# Joe Rogan Experience #2240 - Roger Avary & Quentin Tarantino
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [December 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u5vPHuAXXg)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  So you're saying that someone was telling you how to kill someone with coffee?
*  Okay, so I got to know all these you were talking about some his name is John McPhee,
*  some operators and I got to know through a friend through a billionaire friend who loaned
*  his plane to the Clinton to fly those people out of I think North Korea and so from that
*  point on he was surrounded by these guys and one of them this guy Mikey which isn't his
*  real name I think he's actually named they name them all after the Archangels so he was
*  like Michael, Gabriel, like they take on these nothing creeper than an assassin with biblical
*  Archangel.
*  Well you know and so he you know we got to know each other because of our mutual friend
*  and I think what happened was he and a couple of other guys you know they were placed on me as
*  like for surveillance purposes like you know find out what the savory guy's about maybe or just keep
*  an eye on him or whatever and they told me right up front like be nice to your surveillance you
*  know like don't try to lose us or anything like that because and you know I heard stories about
*  how you know they're surveilling somebody and wherever Bolivia and suddenly some gang attacks
*  their surveillance and they step in kick the shit out of the gang and so I got to know these guys
*  and naturally you know I'm a writer and filmmaker and so I of course want to talk to them about
*  stuff and they immediately started volunteering oh yeah we've learned all these different ways
*  when I became an operator blah blah blah I learned how to kill people without and I was just making
*  a list now of the 10 ways to kill someone without leaving a trace and I was like well just like when
*  I told Quentin about this he's like well what are those I'd like to hear those everybody wants to
*  hear those and so one of the ones that I think is the best one is you inject someone with coffee
*  caffeine like just inject coffee into their bloodstream gives them a heart attack and it's
*  untraceable later on they do an autopsy and they just discover caffeine in your system that's it
*  that's it is this just right into the blood coffee it can kill you sometimes the simple way like
*  just right into the juggler in a syringe yes jeez after extracting whatever information you need to
*  get out of them but he was how much coffee will kill you like that I don't know you know is it the
*  Turkish kind or is it Folgers Cuban espresso yeah but he was a he was a medic you know during
*  during the war well the war and he was a medic and so he you know was kind of identified as
*  somebody who knew how to kill somebody very easily because you know what will work yeah because you're
*  a medic and so you know I would hear every now and then oh I'd kill some guy and some diplomat
*  or something in the Philippines and hit him with my car and then I'd look in my rear view mirror and
*  make a determination a medical determination of you know is the guy still alive or it's better
*  finish him off and put him in reverse and drive him over again a couple of times and then take
*  off and he's doing that all the time all the time they're doing it well Jamie and I were just talking
*  they think they have a photo of the guy who whacked that insurance CEO oh yeah yeah uh-huh yeah they
*  think they have a photo of his face now oh they do huh well I would think with the amount of time
*  they picked it up later I think you know there's cameras everywhere yeah and that's part of the
*  problem with someone and I don't think this guy was a professional I think this guy if I had a
*  guess some guy who got fucked over apparently that company is really bad on denying claims
*  30 34 percent denial rate something like 16 yeah yeah so those guys I don't think anybody's gonna
*  like be crying too hard over that god maybe his family but that's about it yeah it's a dirty dirty
*  business the business of insurance is fucking gross it's gross and especially health care insurance
*  just yeah fucking gross well actually all insurance I live in California and uh all of a sudden because
*  I live adjacent to any kind of open space like nobody will insure my house because of fire right
*  and so suddenly it's like I have a house that's uninsurable and it's not just me it's everybody
*  and so it's chaos yeah yeah my friend is trying to sell a house in California and they turned out
*  it was 125 000 a year just to get fire insurance yeah like what yeah it's insane fucking nuts it's
*  insane yeah but you know I was evacuated three times when I lived there I used to live in bell
*  canyon and you know it was fucking it was rough I'm like I've been like I've been really lucky
*  I live in I'm almost afraid to say it all right because I've been living in the the Hollywood
*  hills that I've never any of the fire stuff happens never happen around yeah it is just luck
*  yeah I mean the benefit of your place is you're at least in a helicopter accessible well they're
*  just going to dump all that fire retardant right on top of you I literally am kind of at the top
*  of the hill on a bunch of rock all right so if the whole fucking place is it turns into an inferno
*  I'm still fucked and I think that place has probably been there a while it's probably
*  withstood all sorts of calamity yeah when I was filming fear factor I talked to this guy was a
*  fire guy for the fire department he said it's just going to be a matter of time there's going
*  to be one day where a fire hits LA and the wind is the right way and we're not going to be able
*  to stop it it's just going to burn right through to the ocean he goes it's just a matter of time
*  we all know it I was like what the fuck dude I go the whole city goes the whole city he goes when
*  those big fires get going yeah there's not a damn thing like what happened in Malibu a few years back
*  like those are I always thought Malibu those rich people that was the closest
*  Maui that was like around 93 that actually happened while we were shooting pulp fiction
*  really yeah well there was a there was a big Malibu fire the big Malibu fire happened while
*  we were shooting pulp fiction so we actually set up a tv on the set because Bruce Willis
*  was going to work maybe loose his house and so he was like actually uh so we have a little tv
*  area so we could like so in between takes we can watch what's going on with the fire and they're
*  like uh and there was all these reports that no Bruce Willis and his family are on top of the house
*  with the with their water hose I go no he's not he's right here well the thing is fires were normal
*  like it used to be when I was young uh you know I grew up in California and so when I was young
*  fires would burn through Malibu constantly but now they put all those houses in there where there
*  never were houses because the fire is a natural process it kind of clears land cleans the land and
*  it's normal actually but you know when you put all that kindling in there suddenly we end up with
*  these like super storms of fire just where everything's just you know going crazy yeah
*  it's I think it's over development which is the cause of these insane kind of fires that we're

*  you roll your dice you take your chances and you roll your dice no matter where you live
*  yeah it's just it's just fucked up when it happens like oh my god yeah i drove home once we were
*  filming fear factor we had to stop the set early because the fire was so bad this was like 2003 or
*  something like four and driving home it took me 55 minutes on the five to get home and the entire
*  time the right side of the highway was on fire for 55 minutes everything like lord of the ring
*  style so three different times you got evacuated from your house yeah three different times so
*  what is like okay so you decide what what you're going to take with you kind of yeah last time the
*  last time was the last time it was like you know the last big fire in la and i came home from the
*  comedy store at like one o'clock in the morning and my wife and i are looking out the window and
*  the fire's like maybe five or six hundred yards away and it's coming over the hill and we were
*  looking at each other i said let's just get the fuck out of here yeah right on let's just get out
*  of here now just so we grabbed the kids got a laptop took some clothes i didn't even have
*  underwear i just said we could just buy stuff who gives a fuck you know who cares if you have your
*  life yeah i'm always the i don't want to say the stupid guy but i'm the guy who for some reason
*  always decides i'm gonna stay and like i'm gonna and oh you're that old guy i live near a fire
*  department there's a fire hydrant across from my driveway the roof where the flood is happening
*  yeah that's me like my family went away and i was like well they're gonna close it out so we can't
*  get back in i'm just gonna hang out here until i know that it's and you know at a certain point
*  there was fire like cresting the the ridge and i'm kind of watching it i ran down to the fire
*  department to see you know like hey guys it's it's coming it's i can see it from my house
*  and they're all there like hanging out eating sandwiches and like not even worried about it
*  at all they're like they kind of looked over at it it's okay it'll be fine it'll just burn a little
*  yeah they get a little too blase blase about fire blase by the way my spec ops friend
*  uh he's like fuck those firemen man fuck them they get so much like credit for like nothing they
*  barely do anything they're on these incredible pension plans like he like hates firemen that's
*  ridiculous well that's a it is a great job but you can't get mad at someone for having a great
*  for having a great job there's a buddy of mine that i used to play pool with well he has to
*  actually hump it into another country and kill somebody so that's well the thing he's got a real
*  tough job he's not getting enough credit that's what it is that's really what it comes from
*  well that's better way to say it yeah that's the that's the reality of our world today those
*  people don't get enough credit but firemen you know it is a great fucking job by like the way
*  he breaks it fuck those guys it's like they all these huge pensions and everybody thinks they're
*  heroes they're not heroes that's funny because they're just doing their job the firemen are very
*  comfortable with fire these people are very comfortable with people dying and dying because
*  of them exactly just get real they get blase blase about murder it's not murder if it's
*  sanctioned by your own country wonderful yeah what a cool loophole yeah isn't it i had a
*  interesting thing you know it's like you know when you live in the hollywood hills you're
*  paying actually you know you pretty decent property taxes so you get there's you know there's a little
*  vig that comes with it you know you get a there's a reason why you you know you don't have to wait
*  two hours during when you're during election you just go to the you go to the local elementary
*  school you're in and out in five minutes all right when it comes election day but also um
*  it's one of those stupid things that you do that like like you're like what was the fucking idiot
*  where you you turn on the burner and then you like leave the room for a while all right and
*  then you come back and all of a sudden your your kitchen is is flaming all right and so uh uh has
*  that happened to you that happened to me once all right and uh so the the alarm goes off and i
*  hit the button let the fire department know and then i i i put it out i put it out like pretty
*  much immediately and then maybe five minutes later it could have been three five minutes later
*  the fire truck is at my door so i didn't even have time to say hey it's uh you know it's it's
*  okay now it's okay and so there's an entire fire truck at my door and i i let them in and go guys
*  i'm really sorry i was really stupid you know i i left the room and with the pot on the stove and
*  it went whatever in any way and uh so i'm really sorry i wasted your time i'm really really sorry
*  i wasted your time having said that it's nice to see that you guys are here this quick yeah yeah
*  i'm sure they were like oh we'll just get a selfie and they were like yeah yeah you're right yeah
*  wow yeah exactly your private taxes pay for something are you sure you want us to come in
*  and just make sure yeah go ahead if you want the problem is sometimes they have to chop through
*  the walls to make sure that yeah yeah fire embers inside yeah spray it all down get it's a hard
*  fucking job when it's a hard job though the thing is most of the time they're just chilling
*  you know they get to cook they eat they work out oh i take ice cream down to our guys at the like
*  i'll go out and buy a bunch of ice cream or some pizzas and take it down just on random days just
*  to uh well actually it was funny that's cool well it was i'm okay with the fire guys well it was
*  actually funny because it was like uh uh one of the things that was a crack up it was like the
*  local fire department when we worked at video archives or video store the local fire department
*  was a customer and so they'd rent different movies but like it was almost out of out of five
*  movies that they would rent for pornos yeah no they lived up to their they just literally
*  career did you guys work together yeah yeah no shit that's how you guys met yeah that's how we
*  met wow video archives in manhattan beach how fucking cool is that from like 84 yeah yeah
*  wow about five years yeah maybe even a little bit before 84 well i started officially at 84
*  because you were a customer before i was a customer yeah yeah i was a customer before yeah i i
*  predated quentin as uh one of the employees so i was there look at you guys yeah actually yeah
*  that's that's us that's crazy uh very unfortunate shirt on my part
*  there was a lot of unfortunate shirts in the 80s everybody was confused they cut the drugs off in
*  the 70s no one knew what to do for 10 years that's exactly yeah it's it's crazy like you
*  would have never thought back then that that industry would completely vanish you thought
*  blockbuster video is going to be around forever well you know one of the things that that uh
*  what i didn't think film was going to vanish either yeah exactly i didn't think the theater
*  experience was going to go away either but what are the things though that was the
*  the death keel to video stores that no one ever liked when they were talking mom and pop
*  when they're talking old people uh to like hey you know you you've retired from your business
*  you've got a nice little nest egg if you want to if you want to invest in a nice little business
*  where you get to work with your neighborhood and be in a nice little store with your family
*  you know video stores that's a that's a good business well i don't know anything about movies
*  we have people help you you know help you choose the titles and everything
*  so there's a lot of people that like invested in this stuff and it seemed like a good idea the
*  reason that it seemed like a profitable idea was the idea like well you know uh i sell you this
*  video cassette and you you pay for the video cassette but the minute you rent it past the point
*  that uh where you paid for you paid for the video cassette yourself then everything else is you all
*  that other money that you make from here on in is just all profit once you pay for the actual
*  cassette and of course you'll have some cassettes that don't rent as well but you know but that's
*  the way it works out but it should work out great well again that sounds like a pretty good business
*  model if i spend this money and then you know five years from now boom everything is is uh a profit
*  where
*  where where it all fell apart is the idea that you always have to get new shit
*  because like life does it's not a bookstore well bookstores need to get new stuff too but it's not
*  a library life doesn't stand still every month there's new titles coming out and you have to be
*  competitive and you have to get the new titles and so even if it if that were the issue of the
*  if that were the issue that wouldn't be that big of a deal but if you're a mom and pop star you
*  only have so much room yeah so it's a space it's literally a space shelf space within three to four
*  years you're bursting out of the seams of videos you're just bursting out you've got no more room
*  you've got no more room and so now all of a sudden rather than having your face your your tapes facing
*  out now everything is you know uh uh sideways spine facing spine facing and and you've got a
*  really uh and and and it just never stops it never stops next month and you got to get this and next
*  month you got to get that and next month you got to get that you need a cosco-sized building yeah
*  well yeah well again if you have four different video stores or if you have a chain you can
*  move things around and it's easier but when you're a mom and pop that's just it you know mom and pop
*  store and you have a bike store you don't have to keep getting new bikes every month
*  if you have a pottery store you don't have to keep getting new regardless of your inventory
*  every single month yeah constantly have to grow your inventory every six months you get something
*  cool you don't need to get it every month and you're defined by you having the new shit and then
*  there was another problem when um when companies that were massively funded like blockbuster came
*  onto the scene they would go in and they would kind of do this sort of gray market purchasing
*  where they would buy you know 50 diehards and a mom and pop store can't afford to buy more than
*  one or two diehards or three maybe to satisfy your clientele yeah the thing is you'd spend you spend
*  the money like okay like you know one of our big titles when we in the early days of video was
*  top gun yeah top gun perfect you know so you get like you know you you'll get even the mom and pop
*  stores you'll get 12 or 15 because everyone wants to see it and at some point it's going to be out
*  and it's going to be checked out and so you've got to satisfy well you're gonna yeah you'll rent
*  all 15 of those for the next two weeks you know it's going to be you know it's going to be good
*  but then now you now you have to sell them off you know for ten dollars a piece you know once the
*  you know once the the desire has died it largely fell on us because we were a smaller store and we
*  had a blockbuster just a block away basically um not even a block we're talking about in the same
*  fucking basically it's not a block away it was in the on the block yeah in the shopping center that
*  we were in and yeah well you're missing the best the most interesting thing it's not about the
*  the bulk buy the bulk buy is that's what it is but that's every mom and pop store has to deal with
*  that depending dealing with a franchise well what it changes your strategy though yeah but what
*  blockbuster would do and they were famous for doing this they were famous for doing this and
*  but particularly they were strategic about it is like okay uh we're going to go into this town
*  okay we're going into manhattan beach what's the biggest video store what's the most popular local
*  video store in manhattan beach well that would be video archives they're right on some public
*  you know they're right across the street from the warehouse all right which is like was the big
*  which was one of the big rental places before blockbuster it was rent uh was warehouse warehouse
*  erections and tapes and and they still managed to survive across the street from warehouse
*  and then what does blockbuster do they buy the shaky's pizza that is in our shopping center
*  our shopping center and they moved into the shaky's pizza because of like well okay we're
*  warehouse and with the these video archives guys well this is obviously the place to be so they just
*  bought out the shaky's pizza and opened up and they still couldn't shut us down yeah wow i'm sure
*  they had the attitude of well just brush them aside oh of course of course that's how they
*  and so consequently because you don't you can only get three or 12 top guns whatever it is it's not
*  as many as blockbuster is getting you end up having to focus on like how am i going to convince my
*  clientele to watch something other than top gun this weekend and so it landed on us to basically
*  say oh you can't get top gun well how about this movie well you haven't seen but you know it's you
*  know it's the difference between being a cool coffee place and being starbucks right you know
*  or or you know a franchise bar and a cool little joe's bar all right the bartender knows you right
*  you know so it's like look if you just absolutely positively need top gun that weekend then go to
*  across the streets of the warehouse and get it all right uh we have what we have but we had
*  customers that like came in every fucking day and part of their day or every other day you know when
*  their camps were run were due and they were people of the neighborhood and they came in
*  and uh not only did they rent stuff they dropped stuff off and then they rented new stuff out
*  but like they came in to talk to us for 20 minutes or 45 minutes like every other day
*  and there's no algorithm to tell them what to do we're the algorithm yeah you have to know oh this
*  guy oh they're on a date night so they're gonna want this kind of rom-com type movie or this guy
*  he really likes you know uh vietnamese hooker porn uh tapes i gotta make sure to find something
*  like that for him and those kids they're gonna want you know some skate stuff so i've got to
*  learn all about the bones brigade uh videos and stuff like that and so yeah you just kind of
*  figured out like how can i upsell the stuff that they haven't heard of because invariably anybody
*  who comes in but you're making it just sound a little bit more cynical than it was you are
*  making it sound more cynical more like the challenge you guys like a married couple
*  totally we're like a married couple it wasn't that without the benefits tell them the whole story
*  honey just tell them the whole story we were just hanging out and they're coming in hanging out too
*  yeah and we would pop a movie on and like uh you know pop the movie on and be watching scenes from
*  and be talking about the scenes then a customer would come in or many customers would come in and
*  they'd just become part of the conversation and we would have like you know like a chat room in the
*  no no there was like no there was there there was about like 15 customers that like
*  you know i talked to five hours a week every week for five years yeah you know because they come in
*  and i'm like what's been at least 40 minutes every other day and i expected to see them and the other
*  i watched what i watched on tv i saw what i saw at the movies and then they saw what they saw in
*  the movies they watched what they watched on tv we all talked about and they talked about the videos
*  and then what else we're gonna get and if you like that you're gonna like this about our lives and
*  everything yeah so at what point in time while this is all going on do you guys decide we need
*  to make our own fucking movies it was always the case well we were always thinking well
*  well well roger and and uh roger had another friend that it was a guy that connected me and
*  roger together was a guy named scott who took his own life at a certain point of his father owned
*  another video store that i worked out as well and that quentin used to come into but the thing is
*  though that while i was just thinking about making movies roger and scott were like making movies on
*  super eight yeah and they were making little horror films and little zombie movies on on on on super
*  eight and then like supernatural thrillers and they're the word turns as a zombie movie yeah
*  yeah it's kind of yeah it's kind of a zombie movie more of an afterlife okay maybe okay
*  and but uh but you're making like legit horror films i'm just thinking about this stuff and
*  these guys are like sam raimiing it you know like sam rami they're making their shit in their
*  backyard and working on it for like three months and stuff yeah and um you know like i was friends
*  with all the punk guys because it was like la punk and so they were always in my movies all the
*  punks were in my movies and because they were media literate they loved movies and so they were
*  easy to pull in and uh and to be in the film so they were always playing like you know the gang
*  of punks who beat somebody up or something so it must have been cool working at a video store
*  though because it's essentially like you have it's like an education well when the time came where
*  we actually wanted to be making movies where we were talking about making movies because i can
*  remember when i think it was it was around the time of sex lies in video tape or maybe she's
*  got to have it no no definitely size and video but i remember uh you coming to me and saying
*  the moment is happening yeah it's happening like small a small movie is is possible to get made
*  like like it's happening for us for guys our age yeah i mean i i mean the one you know it was like
*  the sex size and videotape was sort of like the uh uh like the seattle band that broke all right
*  but i was already looking at uh blood simple was my was my in yeah that's a great movie was my in
*  all right where it was that was okay it's an artistic movie it's our it's arty it's funny
*  i can it can play the art houses and play the art house circuit but there's a genre base to it
*  yeah there's a genre base it's like you know it's a thriller it's a it's a film noir-y kind of
*  thriller done in a certain kind of way but it's a genre base yeah i go that's the way you do an
*  art film you do it you make it a genre base art if you keep one foot in in because it's entertaining
*  yeah if you keep one foot in exploitation in some way in genre if you keep your foundation in genre
*  then you can do whatever you want like my favorite filmmaker is stanley cubrick i love cubrick movies
*  okay one can pretty much look at all of his films and say each and every one is a genre film he's
*  got his science fiction movie he's got a horror movie even barry linden as a costume drama at the
*  time it's a costume genre it's a genre that was that was a solid bankable genre the book is a
*  definitely a pulpy genre well yeah the book was serialized wasn't it it was like thackeray wrote
*  him in like uh like an episode it was like a soap opera but that was a very popular popular book at
*  that time yeah and so um yeah it was all uh if you can if you can and i knew this making my first
*  film and i know quentin you were talking about it this was the conversation we were actively having
*  of we have to make sure that we make a movie people want to see like a genre film like and i
*  was calling them exploitation movies at the time like i want to keep one foot in exploitation
*  and then but at the same time i'm like well i kind of also want to make like you know i want to
*  elevate it as much as possible and so when the time came for me to make my first first film
*  killing zoe um you know it was like i knew it was going to be a bank robbery because i wrote it
*  around a location you know we we found this while they were scouting for uh reservoir dogs laurence
*  bender uh or maybe you also had scouted that location found this bank location and laurence
*  called me up he's like hey i'm calling all the writers i know i found this bank location and if
*  you can if you have a script that takes place in a bank we can kick together a couple hundred
*  thousand dollars and make a movie there it's like this complete solid amazing location and i said oh
*  my god laurence this is your lucky day i happen to have a script that takes place in a bank
*  and then i just quickly wrote one based on the location and as i was writing it i was thinking
*  okay um you know i know that it's going to be a bank robbery it's a bank and so i know it's going
*  to be a bank robbery and that's my solid bankable genre that i'm going to uh to stick with but i
*  knew i wanted to do something more with it and i had just traveled through europe and uh and i had
*  been telling quentin the stories of traveling through europe he's like oh you should do a movie
*  called roger takes a trip and uh i still think it should have been called i think it's a different
*  movie i think it's a different i don't think it's uh no you kind of made roger takes a trip just
*  added bank robbers in it i had been in paris i had bumped into a guy that i knew from los angeles who
*  was a french guy and he was like oh i'll show you the real paris and i went out with he and his
*  friends on rick john claude all the characters from the movie i went out with him and his friends and
*  we uh you know he drove me through paris and next thing i know he's doing heroin and i'm like and
*  it started with you no not with me i i now we do heroin yeah it was like now we do heroin hold my
*  arm i did hold his arm and like i had never real yeah yeah i had never seen anything like that like
*  he tied his arm off he's like hold my arm no no no he was the tying on yeah you roger was the
*  roger hold my arm while i shoot up jeez so but he doesn't quite know that this is all going to
*  happen that that that everything else has been a preamble to this yes suddenly that happens
*  and then he just needed a heroin partner yeah his friends are like oh doing it in the nose doesn't
*  even affect me anymore you know things like that and i'm like writing these lines down like this is
*  great shit and so i get back and i tell quentin like about this whole story and about these guys
*  and going you know driving around the champs-elizé and this is where the fags sell themselves
*  oh now we go into the into the nightclub down below and we do more heroin i'm like what about
*  the cops aren't the police gonna say anything it's safer here than on the you know anyway like you
*  can do heroin anywhere in paris and it was like no i work at lamont like all of it was like
*  basically everything in that movie i you know was stuff that i'd actually seen and so when the time
*  came to make it as a bank robbery film i just you know i'm thinking about it i'm like well it's a
*  bank robbery movie but it's going to be about these guys and it just became a movie about a guy going
*  someplace and the and everything that he thought he knew is wrong you know like you think you know
*  you haven't seen your friend in a while you go see him okay uh it's all about that that kind of
*  friendship and misconception he's downstairs at the bank johnny greglade the bad guy is upstairs
*  the chaos is going upstairs he has no idea what's going on upstairs and so this kind of just became
*  what the movie was about and so i just quickly wrote the script and then uh you know we ended
*  up not even using that location to shoot the movie in it came together later and i ended up
*  shooting in downtown la instead but but it was the seed was planted the seed was planted so
*  the idea was okay i'm going to make a french film out of it because i i'm like in la i'm making a
*  film like what can i do that would be different like that would make this more than just a bank
*  robbery movie and because of the experience i had just had i was like i'm gonna make a french film
*  okay i had no business making a french movie
*  i didn't even really speak french i just thought it would be kind of cool i like you know a cool
*  french girl and like greasy dirty french guys and french criminals and i always loved you know
*  alain delon and the samurai you know the way he wears a suit and the way he carries a gun
*  and the way he walks around i just like i uh you know just adored all of that and so it was like
*  well let's put all of that kind of space that's in my brain into the movie and then the movies
*  tend to take on a life of their own they tend to be like children you know it starts off as a concept
*  as a conception it has a conception and then it has an infancy and then you're raising that child
*  to become the movie and along the way you're really just kind of protecting it and trying
*  to allow it to grow into what it's going to grow into without forcing it to become something that
*  it's not and and it's a little bit of a balance you have to be a good parent which means you have
*  to give it a little bit of freedom to grow into something that you don't know what it's going to
*  be but at the same time you have to be willing to you know be strong with it as well that's a very
*  underappreciated movie it's a fucking great i think i think i'm really good at making
*  underappreciated movies i think i've had i've built a career with an underappreciated movie
*  those are the classics that you would look for in a video store yeah yeah absolutely you'd look
*  for the movies that were really good that nobody knew about dog day afternoon's not in but we can
*  get you killing so my favorite moment in the movie well i like it when the guy gets burned alive all
*  right you know the hamburger scene that was yeah but uh i remember they were trying to talk you to
*  cut out and they go no no you can't cut that out i'm taking my name off yeah yeah yeah
*  no quentin did that actually quentin was a great gorilla to have on my side at that time but uh uh
*  why would they tell you to cut that out well they're like well i don't know it's everyone is
*  afraid it's a too rough it's everyone's afraid everyone operates out of fear taking my name off
*  the only people that don't operate out of fear i think is the director and the actors those are
*  the ones who if everything's working right you're fearless it's always executives but it's the scene
*  that my seat my favorite scene is the scene with jean huin glan when he walks into the close-up
*  oh yeah and he's just like wait a minute he's like remembering what he heard and he's and he
*  realizes uh uh okay so that's a good example of because the movie was shot for explain the
*  scene better the scene was shot for i mean explain the scene better i will the movie was shot for
*  for very little money we had no money to make it so i had to shoot the entire upstairs first and then
*  the downstairs because it's like doing a company move but i had kept i i knew that you know when
*  writing and this is sort of a kind of a rule that we had was i mean one make a genre movie to
*  explain the scene i'm going to i said explain the scene don't tell me that you what you're
*  talking about at that moment you missed the exit the scene was a replacement for another scene that
*  was in the movie that was too expensive to shoot that's the short what does that have to do with
*  what i like what i replaced it with was and i had to fight for it was a single shot because
*  originally he goes downstairs and he sees a bunch of like guys coming in through the sewer so he
*  starts machine gunning people in the sewer because there was like a little sewer manhole in the bottom
*  of the bank i was like oh let's use that and so i had this whole thing and the bond company showed
*  up and you're like you're behind schedule and you've got to like uh you know we're gonna you got to
*  cut pages and i couldn't cut anything and i'm shooting upstairs downstairs stuff and so it's
*  like i had to have something because he leaves the scene and then comes back angry and so i knew i
*  needed to have something and originally i had this whole scene where the cops are coming in and he
*  reacts to that and so i said well okay i just need one shot and because it's all i could had time to
*  do because the fucking bond company and so i set up which were actually really cool to me they were
*  actually film finances was great they um i i just set up a single camera i asked for a kind of a
*  cubrician lens a nice wide like maybe a 14 millimeter lens and i just had john hugh walk
*  up into a close-up and i just had him do i said just walk into a close-up and just start looking
*  around and just start seeing things coming out of the walls and no no is that the shot you're
*  talking about he does like a little magic trick beforehand like no that's not the one you're
*  talking about no that's the great shot that's a great shot no the scene i'm talking about is
*  but that's why i wanted you to explain it because i hadn't seen it in a long time but it was uh is
*  that the shot well that's the shot that's the shot i'm talking about look he's looking into the walls
*  he's looking around but i thought the whole idea about it is the idea that i added those
*  lines of dialogue in no but i thought i did some adr i thought the whole idea i thought the whole
*  idea is is he puts it all together he realized that there's something going on that the cops
*  are doing this or eric stolz is dirty with him all that and it all hits him he's ready to do
*  something else and he walks into a close-up and it all hits him but now we the audience know what's
*  going on yeah and then he's just like well it just shows that sometimes if you can't do what you want
*  to do what you come up with is better and this was an example of it rained that day and i had
*  to use the rain that's sort of the example the frustrating part for me about what you're talking
*  is like i don't care how the sausage was made i like the sausage i wanted you to talk about the
*  sausage not the factory
*  you don't want to know what's in that sausage you have no interest in that the italian sweetness
*  well it was very sweet but it started off sour it started off sour because i couldn't do what i
*  wanted to do and so i just came up with something that was well he puts it together in his head
*  but and i mean i still think that sequence is exhilarating because it's all it all
*  boils down to an actor's face well i had tom sevini on the set because uh and i couldn't
*  afford tom sevini but i found his number and before i shot and i called him up and in pittsburgh and
*  i said tom sevini is a makeup effects artist who did dawn of the dead he did all the effects for
*  dawn of the dead like and not to mention all the great slides friday the 13th all the slasher movies
*  like he's the superstar of of practical makeup effects of horror films of that era he was in
*  vietnam and saw some shit and every time i'm talking to him about stuff like he's like oh
*  yeah well you know no if you're bleeding from back here you know there's only two small veins
*  and blah blah because when your head gets knocked off like he's seen all this stuff and so
*  this is his way of processing it but tom came in and i couldn't afford him i called him up on the
*  phone i was like hey can you think uh i'm a young filmmaker i'm uh you know i'm your biggest fan
*  uh i'd like you to make up effects blah blah blah okay he flew himself out we had no money to pay
*  him i think we paid him like some tiny amount he flew himself to la put himself up worked on the
*  film and he made that burn makeup on that burned garden the vault out of vaseline paint and tissue
*  paper and i watched him make it was the most unbelievable thing how he made blisters and burn
*  effects and it was like watching one of the great artists work tom is the
*  incredible guy he's an incredible incredible guy well you were asking earlier on about uh whoa
*  you're working at a video store did you ever think you know when did you start thinking about
*  making your own stuff well i was thinking about making my own stuff for like a long long long
*  time but these guys were actually doing it um but there is the truth while i thought about it
*  like for a long long time and always figured i would do that eventually i did fall asleep for
*  a few years you know it was uh because uh working at that store i just got caught up in the little
*  life there and is you know it's interesting because um you know you spent your 20s going to
*  comedy clubs and you know building building a career so i'm selling my 20s there and well it's
*  one of those things where it's like well this isn't my dream this isn't what i wanted to do
*  working at a video store for years uh i wanted to actually make movies it's not my dream what i'm
*  doing but it's dream adjacent it's it's close to my dream it's close to my dream i get to watch
*  movies all fucking day i get to talk about movies all fucking day i don't have to work at a pizza
*  parlor i don't have to i'm not delivering pizzas i'm not i'm not i'm not busting ass uh as a bartender
*  i'm not busting ass doing menial jobs i mean this is the kind of job i uh that you know i i do if i
*  i'd go to the store if i wasn't paid to go to the store you know so it's like you know but but for
*  a couple years it did put me to sleep it did kind of put me to sleep it put my ambitions to sleep
*  a little bit because i was happy enough yeah i was happy and just one of these days i'll
*  rub he didn't have the fire i didn't have the fire and when i got the fire when i eventually
*  got the fire back again and it was a life-changing thing it was a life-changing day it was um
*  we had a buddy of ours named steve oh yeah and he was one uh uh um we had different living
*  arrangements and at one point in time me and steve were living in the same house together
*  renting in the back of the towards the back of the store the dude house yeah it was where everyone
*  would hang out and um but now steve was older than the rest of us so it's like he was about like
*  almost five years older than us but he didn't seem like it he was a young guy like five years
*  younger mentally or emotionally yeah yeah and um but
*  so he hits 30 and he starts changing he starts changing like drastically he's that i mean he was
*  like the one of the funniest guys they ever knew and he's just really really funny stoner dude and
*  really cool and all of a sudden he's like angry about things and now he's not quite as funny and
*  now he's got this issue and so we're roommates and there's this one night that he's kind of like
*  all he's kind of disgusted with his life and he starts ranting and he and and he's describing
*  a situation that was very common if you were a kid growing up without a you know without a degree
*  or anything in the 80s especially in california where it's like you can't get any really good jobs
*  but like you can work at a licorice pizza and if you're an okay employee you could like work at
*  licorice pizza for a couple of years and maybe you could even become assistant manager or manager
*  and maybe they send you to another store and and maybe you work there for three years and that's
*  really great but then you know all of a sudden the district manager doesn't like you you run a file
*  of somebody higher up in corporate and all of a sudden next thing you know you're fired and you're
*  out in the street again it's management yeah okay and so now you've just spent three years at licorice
*  pizza now now you could get a job at trw or some of the places like a real job job or uh well those
*  are kind of hard to get but you can work at warehouse records and tapes tomorrow because
*  you just had three years at licorice pizza same thing with wild west clozier same thing with
*  miller's outpost same thing with any of these kind of stores next thing you know you're 28
*  and the only jobs you've ever had are minimum wage jobs behind a counter that that were designed for
*  kids to pay for their gas right and and you've like spent your entire 20s doing that and then
*  you start getting bitter and you start getting bitter and but but he was not just better bitter
*  about the job aspect of it he but i knew he oh my god he's telling me the truth i'm learning
*  something here because he you know he goes you know you know quentin you think that we're this
*  really great team with this really great crew well we are i mean you know that time of your
*  20s were like you your group of friends or your family you know and like well we are quentin
*  at 20 i worked at south bay cinemas and i hung out with a bunch of guys just like you
*  and some girls there too there was a bunch of guys just like you and then i stopped working
*  at south bay cinema then i worked at miller's outpost and hung out with a bunch of guys just
*  like you and we did everything just like we do we went to movies together we went out and we
*  dated amongst the girls there everything yeah then i worked at least your pizza for far far four years
*  with a bunch of guys just like you i've wasted my life hanging out with a bunch of guys just like you
*  and they all go away at a certain point
*  okay and i realized this guy's kind of telling the truth i this he's showing me a truth about
*  him he's he i'm i'm this is coming from somewhere and then all of a sudden he still hung around us
*  he still liked us but then he started making it a point to uh touch base with some of his high
*  school friends they were still around so he's not just hanging out with guys four years younger five
*  years younger than him anyway i'm turning 25 around this time so i'm having my own little
*  okay well what have i done with my life so far so far fucking nothing so i'm having my own little
*  anxiety hitting 25 but i'm seeing what it's like five years from now yeah when you turn 30 a window
*  to the future when you're tuned 30 and you're in this situation and
*  and there was like one night that i had what i used to call i would do it every once in a while
*  i haven't done it in a long time thankfully i would have a quentin to test fest where i'd
*  stay up all night long and rather than give myself excuses i would look at everything that i'm
*  fucking up in my life or everything i'm not doing or whatever and just not give myself any
*  fucking excuses out just like nail it and i would spend like all night laying out everything i'm
*  doing that's wrong and then i would spend the last two hours figuring out how i can change it
*  and as opposed to just doing it and then going to get some sleep and and then you forget about it
*  and fall back into your you know your routine i decided to change my life and i was like look
*  the problem is is that i'm living in the south bay and even though i drive to los angeles i
*  want i gotta not worry about this job anymore i gotta just move to hollywood i gotta get involved
*  there i gotta meet other people that are in the business and if i have to work manpower jobs you
*  know where you just work like four days at this place and four days at that place well then that's
*  fine and by the way i shouldn't be making money until i'm making money doing what i want to do
*  and that was ever a danger all right but um uh but then you know the next thing i knew you know i
*  was i moved out of the south bay and then i couldn't move into hollywood i couldn't afford
*  hollywood but i could afford koreatown and i was close enough and uh and literally the minute i
*  kind of moved out there i met a guy who wrote uh low budget horror movies and then through him i
*  met other guys that wrote low budget horror movies and this guy who directs a few low budget and this
*  guy who produces a couple and well but yeah you meet one person and that introduces you to three
*  other people now all of a sudden i actually knew people who were actually making movies and the
*  thing about it was it was like also well if these guys can do what i can do because they weren't too
*  special right yeah you know uh that's the weird realization that you end up having yeah uh and
*  and then literally it wasn't like everything changed but like within a year and a half from
*  moving out of the south bay moving into the hollywood area within a year and a half i was
*  finally able to make a living as a as a writer you know getting like a seven thousand dollars
*  rewrite on this script over here four thousand dollars for this polish over here another ten
*  thousand dollars for this rewrite over here well shit i mean i would make ten thousand dollars a
*  year uh through all my 20s but before that point so like if i can make like if i can make 15,000
*  from writing oh my god that that was the greatest thing in the world wow but it just takes being
*  around people that are actually doing it so you realize it's possible well it's the realizing
*  it's possible but it's also but it's also a situation where it's like um as opposed you know
*  as opposed to talking to your buddies about comedy in minnesota your buddies who like comedy no you're
*  at the comedy store and you're dealing with comedians every fucking night yeah and you were
*  the you know you're in the place where the shit happens and you're you're hearing how the laughs
*  work but also he's like you know what's going on oh caroline's comedy hour is doing the tryouts for
*  this and you know chuck uh uh uh chuckles is doing this thing or that thing oh and there's
*  a sitcom going on there's the funny neighbor guy yeah at any moment you're in the you're in the
*  you're plugged in yeah at any moment there's a circle of people rising in any industry yes and
*  it's just a matter of finding those people and those people will all gravitate towards the same
*  things yeah and they have the thing where it's sort of like you know like hey benny we we have a
*  spot for you that could be really you know i can't do it but my friend joe could do it can you
*  can yeah how about how about giving joe a chance yeah okay will you back joe up yeah i'll back joe
*  up okay yeah well let's call your friend joe can he be down here at nine yeah he can be down here
*  at nine well that's how you get a fucking gig this is exactly what we tried to do when we built the
*  mothership here yeah what we've done yeah we decided when we left la like we need a place
*  where comics have a hub and when we're all in austin we all just moved to austin because of
*  the pandemic yeah and all of a sudden we were allowed to perform indoors it was crazy in november
*  of 2020 we were doing shows indoors and you know you couldn't go on twitter because they would call
*  you a big super spreader a fucking monster but everybody started moving here by the you know by
*  the time 2020 rolls around there's like 15 16 world-class comedians that didn't used to live
*  in austin that are here now and we were like let's let's build a club yeah so we bought the ritz
*  theater uh where uh you know some of your movies are played yeah this is fucking crazy and when we
*  put it together the whole idea was like have a place where people can come we have two nights
*  of open mic nights monday and sunday and monday night so there's always a chance to get on stage
*  there's always a guy there's a real talent he get is a adam eget is a real talent coordinator
*  he's really going to watch you he's really going to give you advice and you're around the best
*  comics in the world all the time and everybody knows it's possible and everybody treats you
*  the way you would want to be treated if you were starting so you're just one of us you just started
*  but you're not we're not better than you we're not we're not there's nothing special about us
*  we're just telling you we we started walking and now we're 15 miles in you're 15 feet in just keep
*  walking okay okay but let me ask you let me ask you a question because it you know when i watch
*  some of the things on the comedy stern because you know i'm i really love going to the comedy
*  yeah you know and and they treat me really great there this is really cool all right um but you know
*  the mythology of the plays is you go down there on open mic night if you have something to offer
*  yeah you know then you you know you work your way up and then you're the doorman and then you know
*  what and you you work your way up but it seems like that was then that was a long time ago now
*  it seems like people are almost paying 10 years all right or eight years before they actually
*  are getting up and getting paid not necessarily um like tony henchcliffe started at the comedy store
*  he started as a doorman you know and he worked his way up to selling out madison square garden two
*  nights in a row i mean it is possible to still be a doorman i met tony when he was just starting
*  out i'm figuring that that's a spot but it seems like but if you have to wait five years
*  well you don't get good for 10 years yeah yeah okay it takes forever comedy is like making a
*  mountain out of layers of paint well it takes you have to fail yeah you have to have the
*  opportunities to fail there's also no one along the way how to do it yeah like writing a film
*  like you you know you have a protagonist you have the antagonist you have a plot you have a you have
*  a bunch of stuff that you can kind of create and formulate would you really but would you really say
*  that it takes 10 years to be a solid comedian it takes 10 years to be a real headliner like a guy
*  why headline a little different that's a little different that's when you're a real common yeah
*  you can do an hour yeah you can do an hour and then you could write another hour yeah like you
*  you kind of know who you are because it takes years to build that well also to be a headliner
*  you have to be enough of a you have to be enough of a name of a draw to actually draw an audience
*  yes yes and you know you have to usually you go on the road with a headliner and then the people
*  get to see you oh i remember he was here when tom sagura was in town that guy's really good
*  we saw him then and he did 15 minutes now he's going to do an hour this would be great
*  and it's sort of that kind of a deal but it's the same sort of situation where most people don't
*  like if you're in pittsburgh you don't know what to do you know you go up there's a couple open
*  mic nights everybody sucks and there's no inspiration that's set up for comedy and it's
*  in a fucking pizza parlor exactly and it's good on the weekends and it doesn't work and you go
*  well i guess this is not for me right it's good on the weekends because they'll fly in you know
*  greg fitzim and some headliner and you'll get to see a real comic for a weekend so you get a little
*  bit of an education from that and maybe if you're lucky the club owner will let you open for him or
*  do 10 minutes on that show and you kind of like get a feel what it's like to perform in front of
*  a real audience that's there to see a real comic but you got to be around like comedy doesn't exist
*  in a vacuum there's no great comedian that lives in some small town by himself like thinking but
*  you could find some great blues artist or a great novelist yeah novelist is probably the best one
*  because you kind of live in your own head yeah but you you have to be around the other people
*  that are doing it which is exactly why quentin moved to hollywood yeah exactly got away from
*  these losers you had to do it but you you really do have to do it wait i think i recall living in
*  hollywood as well i've done freaking franklin yes across from plumber park your bitter friend
*  gave you a valuable little piece of information yeah he did no very much you need those you need
*  those moments oh i knew i was hearing the truth and i knew i was hearing a coming attraction
*  yeah because i was already feeling it at 25 right right right have i thrown my topsoil years away
*  right right the topsoil exactly it doesn't come back it doesn't come you never get to be 21 again
*  let's hit reset yeah yeah you get one weird march through this life and if you don't if you have it
*  throw it away until 23 but from 24 on you need to be thinking about what you're doing for the
*  rest of your life yeah get it going yeah get it going yeah that well this i think these
*  conversations are so important for young people to hear because there's a lot of people out there
*  that do have ideas and sometimes they have a little bit of a fire and then maybe they have a job that's
*  kind of cool like yours was and they they get sedated almost the worst thing that can happen
*  is getting comfortable which i think is what you were talking about yeah yeah but you know i mean
*  it all worked out okay it all worked out really really good and the thing about it was you know
*  i did get comfortable but i got comfortable in a cool place and ultimately i did have the energy
*  and the the wherewithal to ultimately get dissatisfied with it and and and want more
*  you know the alternative would have been me working at a department store for those 40 years
*  yes right right right where there's nothing i would have been like really been miserable
*  right right here i'm able to i mean you know in in this instance i'm still involved with filming
*  the part that the sedative part was the idea that it was close enough to what i want to do right
*  right right right it was close enough i could get i could get there's guys like that at the
*  comedy store there's a friend of mine at the comedy store that was uh he was a bartender in
*  the back bar and he wanted to be a comic yeah but he was there it was like five years after i met
*  him i'm like hey man you got to quit this fucking job yeah because you're here with all the greatest
*  comics in the world but you're not going on stage because you're and you're making good money and
*  that's that's the the velvet curtain yeah you know that's pulled over your eyes like i i worked on
*  lords of dogtown the the movie about uh zephyr surfboards and skateboarding and polyurethane
*  wheels and surfing and i'm not like like uh surfer or anything but my entry point into that movie was
*  zephyr surfboards was exactly like video archives and i imagine that this is like this in a lot of
*  places where um you know you have a shop they make uh skate they do skateboards and they've got a
*  shaper guy there you know skip englum who's a surfboard shaper and he was sort of like lance the
*  guy who owned video archives and he started a shop and he's selling to all the kids locally and all
*  the kids who like love surfing you know like stacy peralta or tony alva or guys like that they would
*  just go hang out there just like we would go hang out at the video store and so i looked at that and
*  i was like okay i don't really know anything about these guys other than growing up in the
*  beach community but my real entry point was i understand gravitating towards what you love
*  and wanting to be close to it and that if a video store is the closest thing to hollywood in your
*  town that's where you go or if it's if it's not a movie theater and so well you know it was it was
*  funny because uh when i first started when i started at the video store i was like it was great
*  because you know like i said i got to hang out in this place that i enjoyed and i'm surrounded
*  by movies and talking about access to all those titles but then also there was also the situation
*  of you know i became like a little film critic in that town you know it was like i was like the
*  the story was my little village voice and i was the andrew saris there i was the critic
*  and people would come in and at a certain point like oh this is a quentin what should i get you
*  know and the thing is i'm not just like holding court on my own personal taste pretty soon they
*  got a really good idea about my my taste but the thing is i'm usually gearing it towards the people
*  you know i'm not gonna you know uh get some housewife to watch some gonzo movie that i
*  yeah gonzo violent movie that i really like i'm i'm gaming i get to know her if the tailor tailor
*  it and so i'm you know putting something in her hand that i think she's gonna she's gonna appreciate
*  it i kind of know what kind of comedy she likes i know who she likes stuff like that and so
*  i'm like you know really kind of uh um you know uh uh gearing it in a certain in a certain way
*  and that that that felt that felt really good it felt like i said i felt like a film critic
*  yeah you know but one of the things that i forgot i was gonna i was gonna go somewhere with that
*  i forgot i lost my train of thought all right uh but uh uh but one of the things that ended up
*  happening and if i i hope i didn't say it the last time i was here um that ended up happening is we
*  became really famous in the neighborhood we were the video guys yeah and you know our store was a
*  little different than most of the businesses that were in uh uh manhattan beach and so everyone kind
*  us we were the video guys so in a strange way it it was a uh um a precursor to what it would be like
*  to be famous with the whole world kind of knows about you like that in manhattan beach i'm like
*  walking down the street and people like hey quentin hey quentin hey how you doing how you know i'm like
*  i'm at the working at the store i'm walking to the jack-in-the-box to get a coke and come back
*  and then you know but uh we'd walk into the the man's uh uh movie theater all right that was by
*  the theater you know and me and two of the guys would walk in to go see a movie and we we walked
*  down the aisle and we hear hey those are the video guys guys oh yeah i was in san francisco once and
*  uh the guys from red cross the punk band they were customers of ours i was like oh they're uh doing
*  a signing at this local record shop i'll just go show up i'll just show up there on hate ashbury
*  and i walk in and immediately the mcdonald brother guys were like hey it's the video store guy
*  hey man come back come back behind with us i don't think they talk like that they kind of talk like
*  it's good to get that slow drip get a little bit of a taste of it before you actually get famous
*  just get a feel of what it's like it still doesn't give you the full it's like you know oh i'm just
*  going to smoke a little weed compared to i'm going to mainlined uh you know well oddly enough
*  the thing that it did was it made me feel part of a community which i had never felt with before i
*  actually felt part of the manhattan beach i felt part of the manhattan beach i was part of the
*  manhattan beach community you know the people knew me there and you know and i was i i was an
*  upstanding member inside of that community yeah yeah yeah the the fame thing is no one can teach
*  you how to do that there's someone needs to be like a group of people to get together with people
*  that are about to get famous and say hey listen we're famous already let me tell you how fucking
*  weird this is i don't know if you're prepared for this when we were first trying to make true romance
*  you know quentin had this amazing screenplay and it was like uh we were going to try to do it cone
*  brother style we had just seen blood simple and we were like okay i'm going to produce quentin's
*  going to direct we're going to go out and make this our first thought was okay we've got this
*  database of doctors and lawyers and housewives in manhattan beach we're going to go to the video
*  store you know we ended up not doing that you were going to ask them for money we were going to go
*  we never had the balls to actually ask anybody for money yeah it was we're talking about getting
*  money and actually getting money we strategized about it a lot but we never actually i drew up
*  full partnership papers before uh before that whole dream failed of doing it that way yeah nobody
*  knows what it's like to actually be successful until you are but in the beginning did you guys
*  feel like pretenders did you feel fake did you have imposter syndrome i didn't have imposter
*  syndrome because i did a movie and i was really happy with the film but the thing is what i felt
*  like i'll tell you exactly how i felt i didn't feel like imposter syndrome well i guess a little
*  bit there is that all that like waiting for somebody to tap you on the show what the fuck
*  you doing to get out of here yeah uh who would let that guy in right the fuck out what i had was
*  i felt like i was a reporter deep undercover all right on the opposite side of the line
*  right this isn't really me i'm like those people over there right right but i'm deep undercover
*  right i can i can give you reports from the from the from the front of what it's like here on the
*  on the battle line right well maybe that was a good thing though it was a really cool thing
*  because i think that's what one of the things you did with your films is you did shit that
*  was very risky like we're talking about executives and all these different management people that
*  are going to come in and fuck with your thing and don't do that and cut that out but you you had a
*  sensibility not of a person in management but of a person that i know what i'd like i know what i
*  like and i and i think i can think differently than these people do oh no no i would know i
*  one of the things we talked about we had a little theory about it what was uh that gave us a bit of
*  a superpower when we were first brought into once we established ourselves that people knew
*  we'd read our scripts so you knew we were yeah we had something to offer um we would walk into
*  rooms and we realized that and and look i'm not here to make fun of hollywood executives some of
*  those guys like look you don't know how bad some of these movies these scripts are they actually
*  oftentimes they actually make them better yeah they're really really terrible all right they
*  some of the when they go through the sausage factory oftentimes they get better
*  uh uh believe it or not um but the thing is though you'd walk in there and
*  you don't become this super successful executive by being doubling down on your own opinions
*  you kind of want to get the temperature and right get a consensus going on you're not the
*  maverick that's not how people establish themselves as executives uh um the d girl
*  doesn't become the head of the development process by you know being the punk rock person who's the
*  you know right shooting for the for the plim souls they're looking for a rolling stone but um
*  uh film people film geeks and film you know uh film buffs the one thing they have is their opinion
*  and they have spent years defining their opinion and they almost have nothing to show
*  for their dedication to cinema other than their highly evolved opinion so you put them in a room
*  and say well what would you do well it's about time you asked me and for the first time you
*  asked me and then you and then all of a sudden you take the strong point of view
*  and the room the term in hollywood is he who has the strongest point in the view
*  he who has the strongest point of view in the room wins yeah and executives don't have the
*  strongest point of view you know but the maverick artist who only can hear the sound of his own
*  voice he definitely has the strongest point of view but it's refreshing to them yes you know
*  invariably they hire you because you scare them a little you're a little scary and they like that
*  they want it they want to be like a little thrilled by that right but then you know like
*  a girlfriend or something they want to change you they think they're going to make you normal
*  right exactly and then it falls on you to just stay true to that initial guy who was in the room
*  i had a really interesting situation where i had a guy who was an executive who actually directed
*  a movie and he was talking about like well i've seen these jokers out there and you know what they
*  do isn't so special i think i could do it and so he you know so he finds finds a book and then they
*  they adapt it and and now he's doing the movie and you know he's getting through it everything's
*  working fine he's getting through it and then uh then he realizes the difference between himself
*  and a director because there's a he's dealing with another director about something because
*  he's an executive so he's dealing with another director about another movie and he asked him a
*  very important question about his movie and the way he answers it he realized the difference
*  between him and that director and he goes i realized oh see he's a real director
*  because he sees the movie yeah he sees the movie in his head the question i asked he went into his
*  head and he saw it he saw it and he could actually answer it below the flower pot is green
*  because he sees the entire picture yeah i don't see it i'm just doing my best i'm i see it written
*  all right but i don't see the movie in my head i'm just doing my best with the with the written
*  material he's the comedy central executive that thinks they could be a comedian yeah yeah yeah
*  right on and then they get on stage and they eat shit yeah yeah yeah what you were saying is exactly
*  what happened to chapelle oh the chapelle show yeah like they loved him he's this wild dude and
*  then all of a sudden this is too wild this is becoming really successful we'll make him change
*  you they want to stop saying the n-word they want to stop a bunch of different things on the show
*  and we'll give you all this money if you roll over they gave him literally the devil's deal
*  we're going to give you 50 million dollars and this is this is what you're going to get and he's
*  like no i quit i quit everything and i'm going to go to africa i'm going to hang out in africa
*  for a while and i'm going to quit stand up for 10 years and come back and still be the best that is
*  so the right move oh my god well look he's a legend now but he but that's the that's really him
*  if you're around him he's a he's an artist in like the truest sense of the word you know um when i
*  was young one of my first jobs was actually given to me by one of our customers this guy john langley
*  who did that show cops and so uh like he was you know getting his power turned off and stuff like
*  you know constantly and he was struggling to get by and he would do these little things with heraldo
*  revera that quentin and i would work on his pa's every now and then and the dolphin grin exercise
*  video we worked on the dolphin grin exercise video together yeah we were picking up dog
*  shit in venice beach with our hands so that dolph could do aerobics on that little grassy knoll
*  hilarious um and so you know i'm like the first i'm i'm a pa working for him a driver i'm running
*  around town my car is like the transmission is going out i'm trying to figure out what am i going
*  to do this is not what i want to do i don't want to work on cops but like i need the job and so i'm
*  i go in and i meet with with john and he's been a customer of ours and he's fatherly like to me yeah
*  and um i go into his office and i sit down and cops has just started it started because of a
*  writers guild strike and you know there was a writers guild strike and so fox was like well
*  that show has no writers and so they ordered his thing and he went from nothing to like i'm
*  buying yachts yeah yeah i'm collecting vineyards that's not not only that though
*  i remember when he first came up with the idea with his partner malcolm barber yeah all right
*  so he comes in and he's like hey we've got a really good idea for a show so he's he's he's
*  describing cops before cops has ever been made yeah and and his first idea was it wasn't called
*  cops it was called the real miami vice
*  it probably was doesn't scale out to the whole country yeah yeah yeah he um well they defined it
*  they refined it i asked him i said john like you've worked on you know in this business a long time he
*  was an ad for a long time what kind of advice can you give to a guy like me who's trying to you know
*  work my way up he's like well what do you want to do ultimately i said well i want to direct films
*  well then be a director don't work your way up the ladder don't try to be a grip and work your way in
*  just be a director and um i heard that and he's like start at the top it's the best way to go
*  just start at the top and uh you know just tell people you're a director put yourself in that
*  otherwise people will just pigeonhole you they'll just say that's who he is he's a grip or he's a pa
*  or he's you'll you'll have to work your way up just tell people who you are so i thought about it and
*  i was like okay i quit and he's like what i said i quit i'm a director and i left i walked out
*  i mean i gave him notice and uh and i walked out and he sat there and he later told me years later
*  told me man i heard i thought that was the most audacious ballsy thing
*  that i gave you advice and you took it right away and okay never mind the fact that it took me years
*  of love just telling people i'm a director i directed super eight movies like i was not a
*  director i was a poser i was faking it until i made it but i told people what i was and what i was
*  doing and eventually it stuck eventually enough people hear it and all those people who you end
*  up going into a room and pitching your idea and they say no eventually they see you at
*  can running around you know trying to do foreign sales they're like hey maybe that kid is a director
*  that was all it you know it was just believing in yourself it's funny that guy when no one else
*  believes what you believe the guy he's talking about uh john langley he created cops it was he
*  was a really good customer and his wife maggie was really lovely she came she Morgan and all
*  of his kids and uh i heard the story came back to me later that uh you know uh when i got the
*  deal to make reservoir dogs you know just little by little through the manhattan beach community
*  they started you know hearing oh hey quentin's making his movie yeah quentin got his movie off
*  the ground he's actually making his movie he's not at the video store anymore he's actually making
*  a movie good for him and who knows what's going to happen to it but it's happening and uh um
*  and i think they were having a little dinner party at their house and then maggie mentions to uh uh
*  john about what happened really that's actually happening it's actually happening yeah no they've
*  got production offices and everything they're they're they're making the movie and goes
*  everybody raise your glass yeah to quentin he did it good for quentin that's raise your glass
*  i'm getting terry i just even thinking about it you know i i just have to say john langley uh you
*  know because i had some shit happen to me in my life i spent some time in jail uh i kind of uh
*  screwed up my life but when everything went down when everyone in hollywood dropped me like a hot
*  rock john langley was there our customer john langley because i lost we lost everything he
*  loaned me some money he gave me my first job when i got out of jail uh writing something for very
*  little money but he wanted me back in the saddle i love the things you wrote from jail oh thanks
*  yeah thank you they were really good it was really interesting it was like this like super
*  intelligent writer who's in jail you know it's different different sort of perspective rogers
*  working on a book about his jail experiences that is fantastic i kept a really detailed super detailed
*  journal about like everything that's going on around me and you know it became a really i mean
*  that was an it was a very intense experience being placed into a room having the doors closed and
*  you're just left with yourself and everything all your things which define you get stripped away
*  everything gets kind of dropped and you lose who you are and you're just left with your
*  remorse and regret for why you're there and you have a lot of time to think about things
*  and um but having said that as a writer there was a concrete bench that i could sit on i had golf
*  pencils i could buy sheets of paper and um and i've never in my life been more productive i've never
*  wanted to write more than when everything was taken away and i've never felt more about the
*  world and i've never um uh yeah i've it was a very monastic i was telling quentin at one point
*  it was kind of monastic like you know you're you're in a you're in a secular kind of you're
*  in a cell you're in a cell and you're you're with a bunch of god dudes and you're writing you know
*  it's like you're i became a scribe i started i mean i was a scribe beforehand but i really really
*  it became my escape being able to write being able to fall into things and to be able to travel into
*  another world and then also people find out you're a writer and they're like hey man would you write
*  my essay would you write my girlfriend i want to write her a love letter i need your help so i
*  wrote like a ton of love letters that's actually good practice for dialogue oh yeah no totally
*  totally no actually i heard some amazing dialogue and you're writing your robin hood script all
*  right in there so that's your way to get out of uh the cell is to write his robin hood script
*  you know i well there's a book cart and uh so i'm you know every now and then you go through the
*  book cart and mostly it's like tom clancy novels they love tom clancy and stuff like that and uh
*  clive barker novels and things like that but lo and behold i found this old penguin paperback of
*  you know an old old version of robin hood written by e charles vivian and like oh man this is going
*  to be great and i start reading it and it's like they get into evil hold which is uh like this castle
*  where you know uh marian's father is being kept and nobody knows it and he's there and he's not away
*  at crusades he's in this prison and robin hood goes into the prison and in the moment when he's
*  in the prison how he sees the other prison the the wretches that he has to leave behind
*  because they're too wretched to even come out like how bad the prison is and what he's seeing
*  inside and his observations i was shaking after reading it i'm shaking thinking about i mean
*  the entire experience now but you know it was such a um a vivid depiction i'm like well i'm
*  adapting this because i'm feeling it right now i'm feeling like what it's like i'm feeling what
*  it's like to have authority to have the boot on your on your neck i mean rightfully so but i
*  nevertheless and um and so i started writing uh you know my version of robin hood and with on
*  you know pencil and paper and as i'm writing it like i was crying as i wrote it i was looking
*  at the pages the other day and there's like teardrops like wow all over it like on every
*  page that's like holy crap it's like when you're writing like that and you're feeling that much
*  it's not a bad thing to cry when you're writing yeah it's like thank god i'm i'm feeling like i'm
*  feeling something and it's traveling into the page and also because i had been a working writer in
*  hollywood for a long time just by speed i had fallen into the very bad habit of composing at
*  my computer at my laptop like one of those assholes who goes to starbucks and since i was
*  that guy and so i'm sitting and i had kind of become used to that well writing by hand in
*  while incarcerated it reconnected me with like pen to paper or pencil to paper and
*  it reminded me that not only like when you write something down you have a different relationship
*  with the i consider the pen is the antenna to god it is the antenna to god and also when you type
*  it into the computer that's a process of rewriting yeah and so you're losing an entire section and so
*  it reconnected me with that i couldn't agree with you more okay well tell me explain this more to me
*  this is fascinating to me because uh i've heard many people say this about comedy that they have
*  to write on paper i don't i write on a laptop i've always written on a laptop for me it's what i like
*  about writing even writing on paper is that it takes more time to write the word appreciate
*  than it does to think about what it means to appreciate something like the word appreciate
*  you know what it is instantly oh he appreciates us but to write appreciate it takes longer so
*  there's more thinking well i'm more thinking i feel like when you have more thinking there's
*  more little different ways you might alternately branch off with your ideas i don't i don't think
*  uh that is not false not that i've not that i've ever written an hour-long stand-up comedy show
*  all right but um i would think that your writing is different than my kind of writing sure right
*  you know it would like i would think as far as writing stuff down it's like notes and ideas and
*  funny word phrases or right or this and then the other but then you're working it out you're saying
*  it you're saying it you're saying it you're saying and then you get your story right and maybe you
*  say it into a recorder maybe you do this or you do that but you know but probably doesn't even
*  look right when you when you when you type it up on a on a thing it doesn't look right no the way
*  you tell the story what i was going to get to is that when you when i type i can type quicker than
*  i can write by hand oh yeah and the problem with comedies it comes quick and slippery and also you
*  can a little lit you can edit no that makes it that makes a tremendous amount of sense i mean
*  we're writing stuff that has to hold up on the page right that has to hold up as writing i'll
*  write a 1500 word essay and i'll use one line like there's one thing in there that might be a bit
*  but i'll write all this other shit on transportation it's like strip mining you just pull all that dirt
*  out and just process it that's get a little oracle what it's like i've tried to write so you open up
*  your mind about okay just let loose on public transportation yes yes and it's i'm not even
*  trying to be funny i'm just trying to write and then i'll find something funny in it and then
*  that's that's the starting point now i take that cut it copy it into a completely fresh document
*  now what is this okay but how do i get to ultimately it's whatever works is where is the best
*  is it you on either typing or whatever is it is it you doing that
*  a eight page thing on on transportation or is it more likely that you're just pacing around
*  doing a running monologue on public transportation well i'm sitting still right that's what you mean
*  the thing about typing is i type good so not great but i i don't have to look at the keys
*  and i can type pretty quickly and if i have a good laptop like a thinkpad that has a lot of
*  finger travel then you really feel it and i get into like a zone and then it's just about like
*  yes but no you actually do write your notes yeah and then it's just about trump but they don't
*  always come out the same way because sometimes when you bring them out on stage the moment lets
*  you know this is not the way to go it's this way and then all of a sudden you're like god how did
*  i not see that in front of the computer because you weren't in that vibe of the crowd like it said
*  you don't do it on your own you have to do it with them it's like the one art form that literally
*  cannot be practiced in solitary yeah you have to do it so when i write i write like that but it i
*  also write things down on pieces of paper i also write like whenever i if i have an idea i got to
*  catch it well they're not going to give you that computer in jail that's true you're going to be
*  forced to write it on pencil and that's going to be an okay experience but the exp what is it
*  that makes it to you like the the hand to god like what is it about writing on paper i well my little
*  my little analogy of it is you can't write poetry on a computer why not well because we're it's
*  i'm going for a rhythm right i'm going for i'm going for i'm going for a rhythm and then and and
*  there's like there's a connection between my chicken scratch and this paper and this pen as
*  opposed to this other thing and and the more unintelligible and only i can read it the more
*  legit it kind of is and the thing is and and it's it's vomit it's absolutely vomit okay
*  that when you write by hand you overwrite you way way overwrite because you're just
*  you're just getting it out there you're getting it out there then after all the vomit happens
*  then you sit down with a typewriter or then you sit down with a thing and now you take the vomit
*  and you and you tame it and now you make it now you make the sentences work and now you
*  there's more creative this is okay now you may and now you come up and now you now you make it
*  work like a writer now you make the page work now you make the sentences work can we stop for a
*  second while we're in the restroom yeah hey uh you have cigars don't you yeah you want a cigar
*  yeah let's have some scars he doesn't do anything fun i'll have a cigar on jorogas show i will have
*  a cigar he doesn't do anything fun that's the truth you don't do anything fun really
*  uh well maybe i should talk about this talk about maybe i should talk about uh are we on
*  or shall we can i go yeah yeah um yeah i don't do anything fun don't do anything fun no uh you know
*  um making movies is fun well that's the fun the cutter i thought that was a cutter that looked
*  cool is that a cutter is that brass knuckles um what are you saying about fun i don't do anything
*  fun well you know after after what happened to me i i mean i should probably tell the whole story
*  and maybe i eventually will here but um you know i uh i went to jail
*  for a dui related incident uh that caused manslaughter and one of my passengers uh died
*  and um uh you know after that and going to jail and whatnot
*  i'm not the funnest guy to get drunk with yeah i don't know i
*  it's kind of what it is i you know if i go to a party or something like that i i don't want to
*  be seen holding a drink with uh you know even with water in it i'm teasing him but i you know
*  i get it yeah of course who wouldn't fucking get it
*  but then you had the fact that he's a vegetarian i mean all the all the
*  you're a vegetarian yeah why did you do that because his wife made him that happens yeah that
*  happened to a friend of mine that's uh he sneaks out burgers every now and then i um i also have a
*  kind of uh it's kind of like a an animal thing i had a pig um as a as a pet and man when you
*  look at those eyes those are human eyes there yeah and yeah i looked into it and it looked into my i
*  just i had chickens before that and you know what it's like chickens are like cats you know they
*  want back scratches and stuff and i just couldn't like after a while i just couldn't do it yeah
*  it there's people that are feral you ever met a feral person you don't want to let them sleep
*  in your house you met a wild crazy person you're in jail so push that thing up you had it right you
*  had it right today yeah this thing right here yeah push that up yeah sorry pull it down yeah
*  sorry pull it down sorry hey like you've yeah they're great foundation cigar shout out um
*  you've you've been around feral people right you don't want feral people living in your house
*  you don't you don't want to take some murderer and you know give them your car and let them
*  you know come and sleep in your room you know yeah it's different yeah i should take you around
*  some wild pigs no i've wild wild pigs are like little demons they make like orcs wild pigs are
*  wild pigs i get it here fight with each other there are people who are like that also exactly
*  that's my point my point is domesticated people are awesome yeah domesticated people like yourself
*  and myself we're fun to be around we're nice people we know you know we're not gonna rob you
*  no one's gonna kill you it's there's a difference the what the wild the wild is
*  it's different so i understand that you wouldn't want to eat animals but they eat each other
*  and it's just this bizarre cycle of life i think it's uh it's where you're getting your animals
*  from are you getting your animals from of like these mass factory that's the other part of it
*  that's the other part of it is i think there's a line in highlander too where sean connery says
*  i don't eat anything that i cannot identify and i kind of feel like that as well like i don't have
*  a lot of trust for large industrial you shouldn't you should but you can get meat from like a farm
*  you know like you can get it from a ranch you could go to one of those uh you know they have
*  those uh what are those farmers market type deals oh yeah and meet a rancher and i am not from them
*  i am not like one of these people who are like oh never never like you know if i am in the right
*  place in the right environment and the right uh food is is there like if there's a like if i'm in
*  on an island in greece and the guy comes up from the boat with a basket of fish and which one would
*  you like i'll take that one you know sure like uh do you at least eat eggs oh yeah yeah okay so you
*  dig eggs like they're going out of style yeah that's good so you're probably getting what you need
*  long as you eat eggs i tell people like eggs are free no one's getting hurt especially if you have
*  your own chickens that's the greatest thing in the world we have 15 there's nothing like uh
*  eggs straight from a chicken oh it's great nothing it's also it's karma free like the chickens are
*  having a good time no one's getting hurt like they're all they're all like treated like pets
*  like hey girls i love chickens i would i actually really have i've always actually thought that
*  an exotic pet would be to have like a chicken you know it's like one chicken yeah and just like
*  treated like a dog a treat hey that's my chicken he hangs around you gotta get a couple of them
*  they need to have a pecking order yes they like to hang out with each other too
*  gerbils figured that one out yeah he was a chicken farmer was he really oh yeah oh no
*  shit and farmer that's how he worked out all of his policies in the camps is we shouldn't talk
*  about that don't like connect that to chicken farming it's just you know it's like this the
*  name ate off right you can't use it anymore you can't have that little mustache anymore
*  you can't have a chaplain that cool mustache michael jordan tried for a little while yeah
*  mike that's how competitive that guy is like fuck that i can i can wear that mustache
*  he had a hitler for a while i think i can make it happen i'll make it happen he just decided
*  he was gonna force it through you know as far as writing in jail i'm just thinking about it right
*  now um one of the other things i had to contend with was uh they would confiscate anything that
*  i wrote oh so um you know like once a week or once every two weeks or so why would they do that was
*  it illegal to write i was considered a security threat by what i was writing and um oh because
*  you were telling the truth about what was going on that and then when they sent me in like i was
*  placed in this like solitary confinement thing like in the hole and uh you know you're in there
*  and like i never been anything like that before in my life i was thinking this is like fucking
*  guantanamo except it made me think about it i've got due process at least and so um i'm in this like
*  like crazy kafka-esque mechanized totalitarian environment you're in a room where you have no
*  window and the lights are on 24 7 and you know i don't care what anybody says you go into a room
*  three days deprived of sound and and and the understanding of time you go crazy after a you
*  know after two days you're insane they broke me after two days i was like oh i'll do some yoga i'll
*  meditate uh no problem no after a while if the lights are on 24 7 and you can't hear it it's like
*  being inside of a seashell you go slowly nuts is that by design oh yeah yeah for sure it's by
*  design it's like you're placed into a and and um so about once a week like in when i was in population
*  um about once a week the you know middle of the night or you know the lights are down and suddenly
*  the lights come on bright lights are always on but lights come on bright and suddenly a bunch
*  of guards come rushing in through the doors you know they just storm into the the tank into the
*  section and they pull everybody out of their cells and they strip everybody naked and they
*  put you up against the wall so you're up there with like you know sancho and you know leroy and
*  like everybody's suddenly you're all you know one moment you're being kept separate and next thing
*  you know you're all naked together standing up against the wall and they're going through
*  everybody's cell and they're just ripping your cell apart looking for anything and usually they're
*  looking for tar heroin or a shank or a weapon of some kind or works or some cell phones anything
*  like they're looking for anything that's considered contraband okay for me they were looking at my
*  writing because when i was in solitary for that time like literally on kites a kite is a like a
*  requisition form that you send out to the guards you're not allowed to talk to the guards they
*  don't want you they don't want to talk to you you tell them what you want on a kite and then you
*  give them the kite and then they take it off and maybe it gets answered i never had one answered
*  and so they they come in they strip everybody naked they take all your clothes and they're
*  under the guise of where you know we're doing a laundry exchange and so everybody gets new
*  clothes and you end up with like these big baggy pants and or something too small for you and they
*  would look for contraband for everybody well with me they would look for whatever i was writing
*  because when i was in solitary i was writing you know like maps i would map the place like a
*  fucking idiot like i still was uh you know i'm writing about oh isenhard the guard i saw him
*  watching you know uh uh literally saw him watching on a little tv nazi propaganda like triumph of the
*  will is playing on his tv and he's watching it i'm gonna write that down so they didn't want me
*  writing all my stuff they were like that guy is a fucking threat you get whatever he's written and
*  so i noticed that whenever i was taken out of my cell to shower to go to yard to do whatever that
*  they would come in just take whatever i had written so i learned that they couldn't take or open
*  letters to my attorney and so um because it's privileged and so what i would do is i would just
*  write and then whenever i had to leave my cell like to go to yard or if they were rating the
*  cells and taking everybody out and looking for contraband i would just quickly seal the envelope
*  my writing would go in you know i always left it when i was working in the letter to my attorney
*  and then as soon as they would rate it i would just seal the envelope and then that would go out
*  then he would send that letter to my daughter who would then type up the pages that i was writing
*  so that's how i wrote several scripts was like that wow and um uh yeah because
*  little what did you what did you you said you read some of rogers writing when he was in
*  prison what did you read you uh where did you publish it i don't remember where i was reading
*  it well was it on twitter i had several things okay so first of all i was placed
*  i was sentenced to go to a low security like a country club facility i went i went to a low
*  security facility and um i went in there and you know you have access to stuff uh it's it's you
*  know it's more like a like a camp almost and you're there and you're incarcerated but it's
*  it's a light incarceration almost and i had access to a cell phone and so i started tweeting and these
*  were the early days of twitter and so i started tweeting oh they found tar heroin and so in in
*  you know pudgy cell and they dragged him off and oh they uh you know this happened over here oh the
*  so-and-so shakes so and so oh they've rolled up so and so and taken away i was like tweeting this
*  stuff and this is the early days of twitter and roger ebert who was like at that time the biggest
*  on twitter was following me and he put me on blast like he uh he suddenly decided that he would tell
*  every and like all of a sudden one day overnight like the story kind of went everywhere in the
*  world he put you on blast in a positive way well he just told everybody that oh this is happening
*  somebody is roger avery academy award-winning writer is tweeting from jail and tweeting from
*  behind bars did he but did he at the time now it's like nothing people do it all the time
*  people like uh i've got nights doing podcasts i've got a friend who's one of those january six guys
*  and he's uh he sends me like tweets all the time like he's you got a friend who was a january six
*  yeah yeah you got a friend who was a january six guy well he's still there he's like
*  hundreds of days in uh jail without uh without any kind of uh without trial without process yeah i i
*  i mean tell me if i'm wrong but like that's not how it's supposed to be is it's not how it's supposed
*  to be you're supposed to have a due process of some kind well especially when you watch the actual
*  footage of how it went down oh i watched it live and there was that that guy that antifa guy waving
*  people in you're like moving them in they were moving the the um the block stockade the blockade
*  things they were moving out and cops were waving people in they were opening the doors for people
*  i want you to think about it this way in the most heavily armed nation the world has ever known
*  why would you have an insurrection with no guns they gotta have guns machine guns those guys
*  weren't planning on an insurrection no and then you have the factor that there was agents in in
*  the crowd and we don't know how many there's government agents in the crowd that were inciting
*  people to go in yeah that's what they do and i want to know who that cop was who shot that woman
*  yeah what about that yeah that the whole thing's crazy yeah the whole thing's crazy and there's
*  this thing that cops died that no no cops got died that day that's not true no the cop who died he
*  died of a stroke and i believe it was a stroke a stroke or a heart attack but well like everything
*  there's a lot of misinformation being given to us by the mainstream media but it gets attributed to
*  it you know sort of like when you know anything happens to anyone four years after the vaccine
*  they attribute it to the vaccine oh it was probably the vaccine yeah it could have been the guy just
*  had a fucking heart attack but this guy who was a cop he did not die there he was not killed by the
*  protesters and you watch the video of the the shaman dude with the fucking buffalo hat they're
*  walking him around the cops are showing him around they're guiding him how would you ever think that
*  that is going to let you wind up in jail how would you ever think that if you're an unsophisticated guy
*  who was wearing fucking face paint and you're kind of a kook which and you're part of you think
*  you're part of a movement which is really scary you know people get a part of a movement and they
*  fucking yeah we're all doing it and then you've got literal government agents encouraging you to do it
*  moving barriers letting you in they were playing chess and these idiots were playing checkers and
*  they all got locked up yeah because nobody was doing an insurrection it wasn't an
*  insurrection you don't do an insurrection without weapons it's the whole idea is crazy so there was
*  no presumption that there was going to be any kind of like that you were going to get thrown in jail
*  for a thousand days and so my pal jake lang is uh he's been there forever and every now and then
*  i get a like a picture of him like he's been in like look i deserve to go to jail that guy doesn't
*  and most of those guys don't yeah i think it was a bad decision certainly to go into the capital
*  was a bad decision to smash windows but i want to know who people have been smashing things like for
*  a whole year before that right that's a very good point it's like we were a culture of smashing
*  things at that point it's also as soon as you find out that there were government agents that may or
*  may not have incited people to go in the whole thing fucking changes like what are you trying to
*  do are you there to serve and protect or is there some other weird shit going on because it seems
*  like there is and no one wants to talk about it because you don't want to be that guy but at a
*  certain point in time you should be that guy you should go what's going on man
*  there comes a point where men of good conscience must stand up and uh and and speak out against
*  things that are obviously wrong yeah and that is one of them yeah that is one of them it's a big
*  one it's a weird one and you know there's all this uh pushback about trump getting into office
*  he said one of the first things he said was he was going to release all the january 6 prisoners like
*  how long do you think they should be in there for who's who's opposing this they should at least be
*  going to trial yes you should at least be going to trial right it is unconscionable to hold somebody
*  for over a year two years now like like well the thing i mean the government has always had a
*  situation where uh we talked about when we did our uh episode on the andersonville trial yeah you know
*  is um the one charge that the government can put against you where they don't need direct evidence
*  is conspiracy if they arrest you for conspiracy that means they don't have direct evidence but
*  they don't need direct evidence well for conspiracy by the by the way when i was like just one thing
*  that's how they got manson right oh yeah yeah that's true right all right well they knew
*  what manson done because they were helping them yeah yeah yeah well i believe that too because
*  books one of the best one believe me i read every manson book that they're possibly could read and
*  then i read that when i throw the rest of them away in the fucking trash chaos is chaos is just
*  fantastic and he helped me too because uh uh my my first ad is a friend of his all right bill clark
*  and uh when i was writing the the once upon a time in hollywood um book i go deeper into the
*  manson stuff and so i had a couple of little questions in my head that i always kind of
*  wanted to know the answer to so i got tom's number and i called him up and i was able to
*  ask him something really super like direct questions that can really help my book
*  it's a crazy fucking story oh it's you know when i was in jail they i found out they record everything
*  they're just constantly recording and uh so somebody's in there and they're like man i'd
*  like to kill that da well that's conspiracy and so they'll wait and like oh you're about to get out
*  and like they'll literally start walking out like ah stop yeah oh god remember that thing you said
*  about conspiracy let's play that back for you oh god or what you said about killing the da well
*  that's uh you're you're going away again you're going back to trial that happened a lot but it's
*  also don't ever talk they put guys in your cell to get you talking about shit oh yeah that happened
*  that happened right away that happened right away they're trying to get you to uh to incriminate
*  yourself deeper constantly it's like a fun game what a fun game what a fun game to serve and protect
*  and incriminate you deeper well i look like i had a my i as quentin will confirm i have my authority
*  issues i always i always have i always have i'm suspicious of anyone in power and um should be
*  yeah it's intoxicating maybe like this okay so when roger okay part of the thing on our show
*  i'm getting back to what roger's saying i'm not changing the subject uh uh uh
*  when we do our show you the thing is when we do our show uh we talk about three movies so i pick
*  three video cassettes the show we're talking about is the video archives podcast which is
*  it was our second season patreon.com video archives but the thing is all right so it's
*  like there's like the main movie then there's that second movie that's like kind of like the
*  main movie but probably you don't know that much about none of some wild exploitation thing that i
*  you know this is what the fuck is this let's watch it find out and the one of the things
*  that's about our show is i don't say hey roger so find these movies and you watch them and i'll
*  watch them and we'll get together and we'll do it on the phone too well right no no we don't do
*  all right you know we get together to watch the movies together part of it is the experience
*  of being together and watching the movie together through his eyes the reason we came up with the
*  idea of the show is like when we when we when we reconnected we started doing what we used to do
*  during the pandemic yeah and then we were sort of like well hey let's come up with a way we can get
*  paid to do this all right you know uh so me and roger will get together and we'll we'll watch
*  three movies and sometimes even four and then we'll get together then we have a day off and
*  then we get together on another day and then we record and we're always in the room when we do it
*  but the thing is when roger comes over to watch the films i've kind of learned that it's like
*  roger i'm starting it's three movies we're gonna watch i am starting the first movie 20 minutes
*  after you get here because roger will just get off on some archaic piece of thing the earth is flat
*  the earth is flat and the next thing you know all right it's been an hour and 15 minutes later
*  and you're getting further and further and further away all right from the from the
*  the alchemy we're trying to create with the first movie so now it's a little in 20 minutes i'm
*  hitting play so wrap it up that's a problem with podcasts when people come over sometimes we have
*  some of the best conversations before the podcast so now i have to be rude i'll be like stop stop
*  let's not talk you're all come on let's come on let's catch that magic yeah catch yeah because
*  you gotta catch it because it is weird it's a it's a weird thing you know um it's it's a beautiful
*  thing though because it's so open you know there's no one telling like there's no studio people
*  yeah no i mean even the idea i mean one the fact the idea uh uh
*  the idea that this has replaced the talk show the talk shows that we grew up watching and then like
*  those were the kings yeah the fact that podcasting and you're the king of them but the fact that that
*  podcasting has replaced that but also the fact that anybody that it's got something intelligent
*  it's got a cool little setup it's got an interesting personality and it can and it can be
*  it can sell it's still an interesting conversation theoretically can start a podcast 100 yeah yeah
*  the barrier to entry is so low i think about the barrier to entry when you wanted to be a director
*  oh god jesus it's fucking crazy not only not only that you know like the old days of television
*  you know like desi lou yeah we own our content like you own your content yeah and
*  never mind that it's a podcast i'm okay with that i like the the fact that this is something where
*  for the first time in my life at least i'm involved with something where there is nobody
*  else it's me and quentin who decide everything yeah and you know if if quentin wants to do it
*  we go there if i want to do it we go there well i talked to quentin if quentin allows it we go there
*  i mean basically what we're doing is the same thing we used to do that's true
*  video store we we do what we used to do at the video store we're talking about
*  it's completely terrible i i have the kill switch but other than that
*  no no i didn't mean it like that
*  i never used the kill switch but the kill switch is always there no no not really not really well
*  i guess theoretically but you know what what you want you want a theoretical sort of damn
*  a clean most times when you've used the kill switch you've used it on your own i use it on
*  myself you used it on yourself you actually haven't used it uh like on any of my things
*  that i've wanted to do which is really cool but basically we're doing the same thing we used to
*  do we used to sit around and talk about movies and so during the pandemic you know quentin called me
*  up and we hadn't talked for i mean we had bumped into each other into each other a few times but
*  we hadn't really we had had a little bit of a we had a falling out and i i call it a sort of a
*  business related falling out and maybe if i had been a little more mature i was young as a filmmaker
*  and probably unprepared to deal with the complexities of agents and attorneys and
*  hollywood and money and fame and the press and the press's agenda and and all of that i was just
*  approaching it like i'm a so cal gen x punk filmmaker that was how i approached it i'm going
*  to do whatever the fuck i want to do i'm going to make the movie that i want to make and i with
*  that attitude of you know i know what i want i know what's right and nobody can tell me i'm wrong
*  because you have to be a little bit of a megalomaniac to be a director you have to
*  be willing to say no i'm right even when everyone is telling you you're wrong and um is that how
*  joker 2 got made i like joker i like joker i know you did i like joker too i've succeeded i'm just
*  fucking around i will defend joker too yeah i will i'll defend the movie as well i can't wait to
*  watch it i need more fucking press on that i can't wait to watch it and then talk to you about it
*  afterwards because tim dillard said it's the worst fucking movie that's ever been made and he's in it
*  you know i can well that may have colored his perception though oh but tim thinks everything
*  sucks it's like the beauty of tim no matter what everybody's saying is amazing like tim loves to
*  talk shit about austin the funniest thing that i've heard for a while on youtube what i was
*  listening to you guys talk is he's a guy i never really listened to his show or anything he's
*  fucking brilliant but when he was on your thing talking about the election and when he described
*  tim waltz is like well that guy just that guy's a goofball who just should be at a county fair
*  eating hot dogs i laughed for 15 minutes and played it back about three different times
*  because i thought that was such a funny comment he's always funny he said it sounds like kamala
*  harris is doing voodoo curses she's doing gypsy curses he said she speaks in gypsy curses
*  and he always does this show with these fucking crazy glasses on like that's his new thing if
*  you ever watch his show it's the best because it's literally just him ranting and a producer
*  and the rant the ability to rant as a singleton operator is a fucking lone person out there
*  without anybody to bounce ideas off of is a rare talent and he's the best at it i've ever seen
*  bill burr is really good at it as well but tim dillon is the best at it i've ever seen he's so
*  fucking good at it and he's just basically performing to one person who's his producer
*  he's just ranting and so because of that he's got this crazy muscle that he's developed from
*  years of doing that where he just rants about all these different things but it's fucking brilliant
*  i like ranting oh yeah clearly as you know well that's the great thing about you guys
*  doing a podcast together what i was going to get to is like in the beginning you're talking about
*  replacing the talk show well fucking you guys replaced cisco and ebert right because this is
*  what we wanted to thank you thank you that's god that was actually the agenda that quentin
*  proposed to me both those guys are gone you know what i love watching is videos of like outtakes
*  of those guys like bitching at each other they fucking hated each other they were so shitty to
*  each other and then they had to be smiley and what a bullshit way to live do you remember when
*  vincent gallo wished testicular cancer on roger ebert and then he got it oh wow do you remember
*  okay i do cancer right like he lost his jaw he didn't remove his jawbone that was vincent gallo
*  cursing it onto him he apologized after you oh my god i didn't i think he got it well i think
*  that might have led him roger ebert said that brown bunny was the worst film to ever play in the
*  history of con film that's exactly what happened and then he went he cursed him and then the curse
*  came true and then he regretted i talked to me he was like i wish i had never done that it's crazy
*  if it really worked that movie brown bunny i want to talk about that because i've always thought
*  it's so strange that we can show violence but we can't show sex and i know they tried to do that
*  with like you ever see the lines outside the movie theater when deep throat oh yeah carcin was in
*  line yeah johnny carcin went to see deep throat in a public theater i heard stories about bang
*  crawby arrived at midnight because people didn't know what they were seeing yet it hadn't been
*  defined as a genre there was nudie movies that people watched the stag parties and there was
*  there's that little moment in 73 where there was porno porno chic yeah well still own did italian
*  stallion yeah but that wasn't a popular thing this was and everyone had to kind of see it and uh and
*  like oh hey maybe this will be a thing right right maybe this will be a thing now that like you know
*  you know you know uh one or three or four porno movies will come out every year that'll be like
*  kind of considered like real movies you know couples will go see yeah and that was a whole
*  thing was uh promoting the idea of uh couples going to see a porn film either porno films or
*  just heavily erotic movies right you know uh like for sexy for sexy nights yeah not like
*  trevis bickle does it no no as a sexy night now we're going to go we're going to have a
*  sexy night we're going to go out and see and then we'll go home and we'll take care of business
*  right yeah but it didn't really happen but there was this hope in the early 70s that that could
*  happen but it's fascinating that it didn't happen because what i was going to get to is like violence
*  we don't have any problem with but we all agree that consensual sex is way better than someone
*  getting shot in the face yeah but people get shot in the face in movies constantly you see
*  heads explode and arms getting lopped off bread and butter game of thrones and butter it's constant
*  i think it's actually gone too far i think i mean this could be for me well it's not that violence
*  has gone too far it's the meaningless violence has gone violence without purpose almost and i
*  started to recognize this during walking dead but really game of thrones though you mentioned game
*  of thrones like i loved game of thrones at first and then i started realizing wait a minute like
*  they're getting off on me falling in love with characters and then uh the moment i've fallen in
*  love with a character suddenly they're vivisecting their genitals you know it's like uh
*  and then the cycle begins again you fall in love with a different character and then they're
*  killing them and they're just doing it like statistically because there's like there's nowhere
*  to go other than that they're just pushing the ceiling higher and higher sort of but also if
*  you were living in that world that would be reality nobody lived forever and became the hero of the
*  fucking movie there's no heroes back then everybody's getting gutted there's they're
*  getting usurped they're like going into a dungeon yeah yeah people getting fed the lions you're
*  out of the picture it's just you're getting eaten by dogs this is real and now you have to fight
*  for the next five years against the rats yeah they're in the fucking dungeon with you but
*  television at least the television i grew up with was all about like the familiarity of returning
*  to the characters you love yeah but there was plenty of characters yeah and you did get to
*  return to the ones that stuck around and didn't get their heads i just wish they'd killed other
*  characters anyone else i love that let me give you another let me give you another example
*  my everyone talks about how great television is now and it's it's pretty good i gotta say it's
*  pretty good but it's still television to me and what's the difference between what's the
*  difference between television and a good movie because a lot of the tv now has the patina of a
*  movie all right it it uh they're using cinematic language all right to get you caught up in it
*  and um and and obviously i'm talking about good shows we're talking about shows that you're
*  ozark shows that you're compelled to watch right right right all right um and so okay so okay i'll
*  use an example of a show i'll use uh uh yellowstone i didn't really get around to watching yellowstone
*  the first three years or so and then then i watched like the first season like wow this is
*  fucking great i'm always been a big kevin costner fan he's fucking wonderful in this all right and
*  i got really caught up in the show and everything and all of a sudden i'm having a good time and
*  you know i've got a couple seasons i haven't seen so i'm watching it and and in the first season
*  i'm kind of talking about this is like a movie this is like a big movie it's like a big movie
*  and the guy the guy who writes that is a good writer there's good like punchy monologues and stuff
*  um so then i end up watching like three seasons of it and then i even watched that like 1883 was
*  oh this is a good western show i like westerns but then
*  after i've watched like two or three seasons or one season of 1883
*  look why i'm watching it i am compelled i'm caught up in it but at the end of the day it's
*  all just a soap opera they've introduced you to a bunch of characters you actually kind of know
*  all their backstories you know everybody's connection with everybody else and you know
*  they spend some time selling that out and then everything else then everything is just the
*  is the compellingness of the soap opera of what's happening to this character between that and a
*  film well i'll tell you i'll tell you because the thing is if you watch if you watch edge of night
*  monday through friday you get caught up in the dramas of the the family and everything right
*  but you don't remember it five years from now you're caught up into the minutia of it at the
*  moment all right so the the difference between is is i'll see a good western movie and i'll
*  remember it for the rest of my life i'll remember the story i'll remember this scene or that scene
*  and it built it built to an emotional climax of some degree uh uh and you know one the story is
*  good it's not just about the interpersonal relationships the story is good itself but but
*  but there's a payoff to it but there's not a payoff on this stuff it's just more inter
*  interconnectional drama and while i'm watching it that's good enough but when it's over i couldn't
*  tell you i can remember who the bad guy was in the first season of yellowstone because it was
*  danny houston i remember him in it but i don't remember any of the the the details of it and i
*  don't remember any of the bad guys for season two or season three it's out of my head it's just
*  completely out and same thing with 1883 the when i watched the whole thing and that was like a
*  that seemed like a movie except i don't remember sam elli is but the only thing i really remember
*  of it when it was finished but now uh red river i remember for the rest of my life isn't that though
*  because it's a different thing right because when you go to a film film is is designed for one sitting
*  you sit down in the theater you're going to get the entire encapsulation what happens to these
*  characters and i'll give you an example of one that is more than a soap opera and you'll and
*  here's the difference here's the difference okay uh because yeah you could say that uh look they're
*  in the soap opera business but i'll tell you one that's not okay if you watch that first season
*  of uh now here's one that really works like a movie if you watch the first season of homeland
*  oh yeah that first season of homeland first season it's incredible okay yeah very good
*  when it gets to that final episode of the first season and he's got the suicide vest on
*  yeah and he's in the room he can kill the guys that he's been waiting for to do it for the whole
*  movie and you don't want him to die but you're kind of into him and you kind of want him to
*  pull it off and then his daughter calls him on the phone before he does it she doesn't know what
*  he's going to do but she gets that little sense from him that something's weird dad you you need
*  to tell me that you're going to come home right now you need to tell me right now that i will see
*  you later tonight and the entire series has been built to this scene and it's one of the most
*  emotional scenes i've ever seen in in a movie any tv show i've ever seen that first season was great
*  i've ever seen dramatized now that was a movie that was not a soap opera that built to this
*  moment of him being in that fucking room with the suicide vest on and and there was complexity she
*  doesn't know what she's asking but we do right she's stopping this major thing and she'll never
*  know that but we do right right right and he's still committed that's but he's more committed to
*  her and we know that that's just great shit that's a movie right and you can't can you do
*  that every week no i didn't say you can do it every week but i mean you know what i'm saying
*  when the season's over i need to walk away with more than just the soap opera an impactful moment
*  exactly now i don't expect you to do that every week but at the end of the arc if you're telling
*  a continuing story right at the end of that fucking season you need to bam drop the mic
*  yeah you need to tell me a fucking story not just dot dot dot dot dot i see what you're saying
*  and look while i'm watching it i'm not asking for that but the fact that it all just goes away
*  once it's over and it's just sand on the beach right it's a different thing though right i mean
*  this is what the weirdness this is the weirdness of the theater experience versus home here's where
*  it's not a different thing part of the thing that makes it different is the fact that everyone's
*  watching these continuing stories continuing stories continuing stories okay if it if it were
*  if it were bonanza where it's just a setup story charles bronzen shows up he's a half-breed indian
*  and he's working at the ponderosa for a while and he gets involved in a in an adventure and then
*  at the end it's it's it's done well on that show you you have the the episodes are maybe
*  not so good or episodes or there are are uh whatever they're that's not one continual story
*  but then but then you'll have this great episode with charles bronzen or do they have a great
*  episode with with james kohler they're almost standalone so yeah that could that could have been
*  a movie yeah they could have expanded that to a movie right they're standalones instead of just a
*  long ongoing story well the difference is is that that's that's episodic it's a long ongoing story
*  that leads to the soap opera aspect well it's episodic and television now has become completely
*  serialized yeah yeah and so you know somebody's going in and they're pitching their show even a
*  really really good show like deadwood okay deadwood i know what they they probably went in they pitched
*  and what they knew that they were going to make was the was it wild bill uh the wild bill story
*  and they've got caridine and like uh and they know that story and that show is fantastic as
*  long as they're telling that story which is like six to eight episodes once he's gone i don't think
*  they had a plan they that was what they pitched and it was like they pitched a movie spread out
*  over a number of episodes but it wasn't even the full season yeah but by that point in time they
*  have now they have all the town characters well they've got everybody but i'll but i would
*  maintain that for the rest of deadwood after caridine's gone it's just things are happening
*  stuff is happening but i don't remember anything about that show other than the town and you know
*  the the various actors that i liked and on the show and but really all they had was those first
*  six to eight episodes i can't remember what exactly what it was and the thing that and the
*  thing about it is i'm not i don't say all this and the sum up of it all is it's useless it is very
*  compelling while i'm watching it but it just doesn't compare to a movie real story that is
*  that you know that stays with me for the for the rest of my life in some cases right i know what
*  you're saying and like you know we'll we'll watch a lot of you know i try to watch at least one movie
*  every episode that i haven't seen and sometimes it's like well i haven't seen it since i was 12
*  you know or i haven't seen it since those are actually the scariest ones to watch because if
*  you loved something when you were young it's almost well i'm expecting not to i'm tougher on stuff now
*  than i used to be all right uh i i you know it was a big champion about so now i'm not such a champion
*  now i see all the problems with it all right but i will watch something i haven't seen since i was
*  22 and i saw like the day it opened uh and i you know and i uh i watch you know i i watch it again
*  i think i just lost my train of thought well actually i can jump in really quick if you want
*  um you know what i'm talking like i'm stoned and i'm not strong cigars yeah strong cigars
*  one of the movies we saw that um we had seen a million times and we didn't even think that
*  it was going to be anything was uh dressed to kill yeah okay let me set this up a little bit
*  then you can take it yeah yeah all right uh it was one of those things where we were doing a thing
*  a special episode with elai roth we were taking you know the italian jallow thrillers and thing
*  okay where are the american versions of jallow thrillers and we figured out there was like four
*  of them and one of them was dressed to kill michael cain yeah and so we get together with with elai
*  and we're going to watch these four movies and then it comes down to dress to kill and it's like
*  i can't even think about how many times i've seen dressed to kill hundreds i can't even think how
*  many times he's seen it and how many times that uh elai's seen i mean we're just huge brian depalma
*  fans and nancy allen fans and everything so it's like how many fucking times and so i almost
*  almost brought up i mean do we even need to watch dress to kill i mean we've got we had a little
*  congress about it we've got three movies no okay let's just watch it we'll just watch it
*  that ended up being one of the greatest screenings of dress to kill i've ever seen
*  all right in that in our living room in my living room watching it with on vhs on vhs pan and scan
*  all right the old wonder brothers video because we watch them on we watch them on the actual video
*  cassettes of video archives all right uh literally the tape that we used to rent and handle and shuffle
*  and put back and forth into the drawers and then rent to customers and that has been sitting on
*  the shelves with the number on it and everything for the we've seen the movie a bunch of times but
*  something about watching it with the three of us and then just sitting there and it's so good but
*  but but but but it was roger who was adding to it it was elai that was adding we're seeing it
*  i was adding to them yeah you know and like we just had this like appreciation for the movie
*  watching it with the three of us in this situation the fact that we even considered not even watching
*  it was just like sacrilege and we saw things in it that we had never seen before that was the other
*  thing it's like i saw things in during that screening because of because of feeling watching
*  the movie with you guys that i had never thought about before and so it opened up all sorts of
*  avenues and you know most frequently you watch a movie and it's it doesn't live up and i'm afraid
*  to watch movies again you know a lot of the time that was just one of those happy incidences where
*  the movie really lived up it it stayed strong even when we'd seen it hundreds i know i mean you
*  could not it'd be hard to pick a movie that i've seen as much as dress again see this is the better
*  version of cisco and ebert this is exactly what i'm talking about the completely unproduced
*  uninfluenced version well i told roger when we finished the first season i go you know roger if
*  we do this the right way in three or four years time we could be considered like cisco and a
*  hundred percent yeah it's it's just a matter of getting it out there yeah i think there's just a
*  bunch of people that aren't aware of it yet they will come yeah build it build it and they will
*  come what i love about um the way we're doing it because our first season we just you know we just
*  put it out and uh and we had a partner with serious xm back then and this season you know they kind of
*  went out of business in their own for their podcasting thing a little bit oh did they i think
*  they pandora now right yeah they kind of turned into a different thing they just changed their
*  whole podcast deal with the caller daddy chick yeah yeah i think they did yeah yeah so i guess
*  they're trying to get back into it i think some other people as well they paid us a lot of money
*  to do it and like we actually did pretty good for like our little archaic little movie yeah
*  show that goes on about two hours a real niche niche type uh yeah and we we can you guys do jaws
*  no we don't want to do jobs but that's the best part of it do whatever the fuck you want to do
*  that's exactly it but the thing is they were like uh uh so we actually had about like two million
*  listeners which was like hey that was pretty good for us for us doing our little stupid uh uh uh
*  movie show about vhs and it's all about vhs it's about the vhs we're talking about the box art
*  of vhs tapes we watch the film we talk about the trailers that are in front of the movie all right
*  we talk about the transfer by the way the movie vhs is one of my guilty pleasure that's a good
*  film yeah yeah the one with the the devil lady yeah yeah she turns into a devil the three to four
*  different stories or three different stories yeah but that one is worth it just sit through the other
*  three for that one the devil lady was fucking amazing but i think they were expecting us to
*  to do like uh john citizen cain they were thinking like dack shepard kind of numbers right right
*  we're never gonna do without with what we're doing right right right yeah and you know and so we're
*  talking you could though you people want to see it they want to listen to it it's just a matter of
*  just it bidding they'll they'll realize they wanted it once they hear it yeah that's what it is it's
*  like oh we want them to only talk about citizen cain no no no no it's got to be whatever the fuck
*  they actually want to talk about but then you'll learn about that movie that you never heard about
*  maybe you go see it and then you'll have a deeper appreciation of why these guys love movies but one
*  of the things that was interesting when we did it when we okay so when we made our deal we're
*  thinking okay well maybe we'll do it here for two years and we own the show and then we want to
*  take it to patreon so we don't have to do commercials right okay and then when i did commercials i did
*  it with a uh uh uh uh uh a 70s dj announcer voice all right because i felt like such a sellout that
*  i'm not going to do it in my voice right that's fun the dot's the the dot's in 750 is coming and
*  it's coming soon you know and i did like the real don steel that was my whole thing because i did
*  like the real don steel i just did those readings like myself and people started commenting on
*  twitter they were like man roger every
*  some people even get in the first week they get qualified candidates only on zip recruiter.com
*  i like solo stoves they're great but like i found myself doing like you know stainless steel ads
*  basically and talking about solo stoves and suddenly people on twitter were saying roger
*  avrey will sell you sour milk from a sick cow it's like well i don't know if i want to like be
*  shilling stuff like that anymore you just have to only approve the ads that you want to do like i
*  approve ads i don't like just let them yeah give me every ad i'm like i can't do this one well we
*  and i say it all the time we're not even under that kind of pressure now yeah yeah the thing
*  about it that's good i thought it but that would be kind of cool it you know is like if we go to
*  patreon we'll lose a whole bunch of uh we'll use we'll lose a whole bunch of listeners but
*  you know we'll put a we put a 40 minute version of the show out there for free you know if you want
*  to get the whole show then you've got to like you know you you got to subscribe and if you just
*  subscribe you get the show if you pay if you pay five dollars you get our show boom boom and if you
*  pay eight dollars then you get an extra special show that we do and we're gonna there's a still
*  a truncated version of it available for everybody to listen to you like the first part of it come
*  for the rest but the thing is though is what i like and some people are sort of like hey fuck those
*  guys everything well okay fine all right and look i get it i'm the guy that i'm the guy what in my
*  20s would go to happy hour at the bar all right and nurse a beer while i ate all the pizza and
*  the chicken wings and that was my dinner yeah so i get that you know and by the way uh you know
*  if you want to like wait till the end of our season and then join for a month and listen to
*  all of our shows that way you can that's an easy way to do it you can get everything for free for
*  a month you can get everything you want in a month but that's not who we're doing it for we're doing
*  it for the people who care about the show and are subscribing to it and those people those are our
*  audience right and then they write on the message board and we write them back and like so we're
*  doing it for those people and as long as we can make enough to just do the show right we're cool
*  and the general feeling is wow this is like a five dollar film school because you've got a couple of
*  guys talking about movies and talking about how to watch movies how to appreciate films how to
*  read a film and then hopefully just hopefully just genuinely compelling discussions and using
*  our experience as filmmakers to discuss even you know deeper into the movies and to better
*  understand them and you know it's uh it is largely something has happened in culture where
*  people they don't know how to argue anymore politely they don't know how to like enjoy
*  an argument with each other before and so quentin and i we don't have to like the same move just
*  like cisco and heber didn't have to like it but you know we can argue about something and then
*  afterwards it's like okay let's go do karaoke now you know it's not it's not it's not a recommend
*  show we want to pick three movies and we want to discuss them yeah and you don't have to like it
*  to discuss don't like the movie if there's an interesting if there's an interesting point of
*  discussion about it well that's good that's all that's all we need we just need an interest we
*  need an interesting uh an interesting con conversation yeah that we have about it's not
*  about it's not about we recommend you watch this movie right personally i don't care if anybody
*  watches any of the movies that we talk about i want them to listen to the show and enjoy
*  enjoy our back and forth and get to understand how you appreciate movies yeah if you want to go out
*  and check the movies out afterwards fine go ahead but i don't care if you do or not and we have a
*  really like dedicated group of people who have come and they've signed up and they like like i
*  really what's funny is i really care about these people now it's like they're there and they're
*  like in the club it's like a clubhouse yeah and the people who want to be there want to be there
*  and they're talking and they're talking they're on a message board with quentin and you know
*  eli rock is uh there and edgar wright and like everybody's like and so it's a we wanted to create
*  a something that was like video archives and that people could come in and talk and i want at least
*  one of the three movies not every week but at least i want to they're not easy to find i want
*  to come up with like well that's not streaming anywhere how am i supposed to get this well it's
*  on vhs you know get a vhs recorder and buy it on eva all right and now all of a sudden that little
*  group is like well maybe we can buy a hey maybe if we buy a vhs and then we can we'll burn it and
*  we can trade it with everybody else and now they're all doing the work to do that well good my
*  daughter gala is one of our producers on the show and uh and she's on the show with us and one of
*  her things is like we get together and we watch the movies at video archives and then we know the
*  films and then she has to she doesn't have that access she doesn't have access she's not there
*  with us she's like she represents one of our one of the people out there she's got to find it so if
*  quentin finds something that's you know pretty difficult to find she's got to track it down and
*  she usually has a little timetable to do it on and she kind of is doing her proof of concept on you
*  can get these you can find these she'll find it on vhs she'll find it however she tracked it down
*  and so you can follow her her guide if it's on youtube she'll tell you it's on you however
*  when she goes quentin i just couldn't track this one down i'm like yes yeah
*  i think that's the real reason he likes to do the show
*  is everything on youtube now a lot of things a lot of things a lot of things a lot of things
*  yeah there's some certain things you can't find on youtube still and if it's up there and it's
*  not there it'll be up again somewhere it's like whack-a-mole right right whack-a-mole there was
*  the gorva dow film the transsexual movie with uh rakel welch yeah oh we watched that we didn't do
*  an episode on it but i had the video of that we watch it as a myra breckhamidge i like it
*  it's a crazy movie well the idea is the guy in the ass that's the best fucking scene
*  yeah she fucks the guy in the ass that is the best fucking scene it's pretty wild i like that
*  movie so much i read the book afterwards because i thought that i thought it was like so cool
*  okay i never liked rex reed and i am not gay but i was actually like wow rex reed's kind of hot
*  well that's what he was trying to do yeah that was the whole movie you did it gorva
*  dow was trying to turn you gay can you give me that lighter yeah sure yes that's one of those
*  weird ones it's difficult to find i had to buy a dvd to get it
*  oh i like that light the light she has that keeps building up to it she goes
*  what's she actually gonna finally show her pussy she goes well it looks like the moment of truth
*  has finally arrived i think rick hell was just fantastic in that movie did you ever see those
*  debates that gorva dow did with william f buxley legendary yeah yeah incredible yeah but this is
*  you know you used to be a bit always won though oh yeah well he was just well he was right and
*  he was better yeah he's right and he's better yeah he's right you have gorva dow fighting with
*  like a norman mailer yeah what were they fighting about oh no just they'd get on the day they get
*  them on like the dick cabin show together you know and he would talk to him like a poncy bastard and
*  the other one in fact they have like a ninny anthrax though i'm sure they had dinner afterwards
*  well just you used to be able to have those kind of conversations on television which is really
*  fascinating yeah it's like now they exist in podcasts you know and like the cisco and ebert
*  thing what i was talking about is like you can't manufacture a friendship yeah one of the and you
*  can't manufacture a real interest you can't be a guy who was a local news reporter who auditioned
*  for the role of the guy who reviews movies you know i'm saying yeah i know exactly what you mean
*  it's like this thing that you guys have is what this is the whole new media movement is based on
*  authenticity right and this is like the whole thing you want people to not be able to find these
*  movies you want to just review movies that you want to review and that's the beautiful thing
*  about it it's like the perfect show in that regard like for a film review show or a film discussion
*  show it's the perfect show and also when a customer used to come into the store they had
*  basically three requirements i want something that's new that was always the first one that's good
*  that i haven't seen yet and i was like well if it's if you haven't seen it yet it's new to you
*  so that takes care of two of those and no we don't have that new one but let's show you something
*  interesting and so it was always a matter of uh you know well the thing is one of the things that
*  and there's a lot of movie there's a lot of movie shows out there on podcasts and they talk about
*  seven the idea isn't for me to just say oh we're better than all those guys we're not coming from
*  that that place but i'll tell you what bugs me about a lot of the other shows is the fact that
*  the people are sincere they're completely sincere but their film knowledge is fucking abysmal they
*  really don't know what the fuck they're talking about and and especially when they're trying to
*  talk about movies from like the 70s or something well they they were usually born in the 80s so
*  they don't know what something was like when it opened up and they don't really have any context
*  right they definitely don't have context that's what they don't have they don't have context they
*  just know whatever they've learned along the way and so they just yank stuff out of their ass and
*  and say stuff that's just wrong a lot they just miss information a lot we actually fact check our
*  shit all right you know uh we we re-record it all right to make sure that we just don't yank shit
*  out of it and we there is a little bit of yanking stuff out of your ass but when i'm not sure about
*  it we look it up and then if i'm wrong then we change it well then also there's the fact that
*  you can count on what we're saying that we're telling you the true fucking shit we're giving
*  you i consider it as i consider it as a film expert that that that i would be i would i i
*  my show wouldn't be worth listening to if i don't give if i don't tell you the truth right i don't
*  give you factual information that you can count on well so because you were there during the opening
*  of the film and you know we're going to describe because we were yeah yeah we we have the context
*  to talk about a lot of these people they maybe didn't see these movies and in theaters and the
*  thing is you know it's like you know my my writing guru as far as like film writing but i think
*  writing in general was uh the new yorker film critic pauline kale and she had one one rule and
*  i one rule for uh uh uh for film criticism and i think this could apply to all writing she goes
*  you have to give the reader a compelling reason to read your writing it's that fucking simple
*  it's that there has to be a compelling reason for you to engage in reading analysis and the same
*  thing about talking about cinema you have to give a compelling reason now yeah i like the guys that's
*  that's that's that's that that's a good start i like their personality i think they're kind of
*  funny that's a that's a good start but there has to be something more than that
*  more than that well that's what's more than that what you just did this passion for it right that's
*  what's more than that it's just this like severe commitment to it that's that's what's exciting and
*  then when we talk about the movies and we talk about everything that's good about them we talk
*  about the things that that aren't good right honest yeah very honest yeah and and and and i can be
*  wrong i can i i don't have to be right about it you might be wrong about the joker i'm not sure
*  yeah
*  see it's audacious it's audacious because you haven't even seen it if you you know you're just
*  jumping on a fucking bandwagon i'm just talking shit i just try to wind you up i'm just trying to
*  wind you up sorry what's like an example of a film that you love that other people hate other than
*  the joker uh i don't know if i loved it but okay i liked it a lot all right uh um well there's i
*  have a ton of those as a matter of fact no there's i have i have so i have so many but but when i
*  was younger particularly i was the champion of like the movie that everyone that all the critics
*  put down and said was the fiasco and i wanted to defend it is it because you're contrarian
*  can i guess yeah yeah is it ishtar well you like ishtar i defied in 1941 he was like one of the
*  champions of ishtar champion ishtar champion 1941 tape on so many customers how many of them came
*  back angry no it's a funny movie it's a funny movie is it really well the problem with ishtar
*  and we were talking about this a little bit uh earlier the problem with this char is that it
*  suddenly became not about the movie but about the production yeah and so people had informed an
*  opinion about whether they liked it or not because it was expensive it's like is that it doesn't
*  change your ticket price no but that is the kiss of death if you feel like a film is over budgeted
*  especially comedies it's like it's like critics have a thing about like you know spending a lot
*  of money on comedies it seems obscene to them yeah what happened with this film like what where
*  did the budget go south well where the where the budget kind of went south for the most part was
*  the fact that uh uh like warren bayty and dustin hoffman kind of like had their full freight on the
*  movie so dustin hoffman got his high big salary warren bayty got his high big salary and so now
*  all the accoutrements they go with everything that goes with it all right i need a plane to fly me
*  back from morocco to new york every weekend i'm sure no no he's just making that i'm making that
*  up but that's not unrealistic but it's not unrealistic it would be like if when they did uh
*  during the time when they did ishtar tom hanks was famous but he wasn't the superstar that he is now
*  all right so if that had starred tom hanks and peter scalari like the two guys from bosom buddies
*  yeah well then that movie would have it would have been it would have cost a lot less and would have
*  been just as funny those guys were terrific together and they would have been really good
*  in that role and the film would have been seen for what it is yeah when a film does get labeled
*  as a bloated film though that that's that is the kiss of death it kind of because the general public
*  will turn on it then they want to fail you know what you generally you give those movies a couple
*  of years and something they're like these amazing movies they're like oh my well water world's a
*  pretty fun film shut the fuck up i kind of have a great time watching what water world was the
*  first laser disc i ever bought that in days is wonder i bought it at the same time you can't
*  defend uh kevin costner's the postman i never saw the postman i like the idea of the postman i
*  remember the screenplay for the postman was great the idea that i never saw the postman but i actually
*  like kevin costner i think dances with woods is one of the best movies yeah but kevin costner is
*  fucking awesome i love that dude yeah but you're right about the but i've always wanted to do
*  i'm not saying he's right about it because i've never seen it but now that says something that
*  i've never seen it but yeah but i wouldn't mind seeing it i'll bet you i like it but then there's
*  films that are so bad they're great like show girls i love show girls show girls is fucking
*  great oh show girls there's nothing wrong with show girls i can absolutely defend i can defend
*  as an entertainment piece i am look i am not as so bad as good guy okay i'm not a sex scene in the
*  pool that's a little ridiculous but yes the sexy in the pool is a little ridiculous but actually
*  the fact that it's going for a hollywood movie that's it's it's it's it's going there was
*  actually interesting but what i really like what i really liked her in it but when she beats the
*  shit out of that guy that's so fucking cool when she beats the shit out of the guy at the end
*  the guy who fucked over her girl her girlfriend and like beat up his girlfriend and then she
*  does these spinning roundhouse kicks and beats the fucking shit out of the guy i was like yeah
*  elizabeth berkeley go what i love about show girls is normally a movie like show girls would be made
*  for under a million go straight to video star robert davi and just be this little exploitation
*  movie and here was an example of that being made for 60 million dollars with paul verhoeven
*  directing doing whatever the fuck he was doing whatever he wants making it as big as possible
*  releasing it nc-17 it's basically the same as one of those sub million dollar exploitation films
*  it still has robert davi in it he's still playing the same part he would normally play
*  and so it's this opportunity to see one of those weird little you know exploitation movies made in
*  this grand fashion in this huge fashion show girl doesn't sit on a special shelf in my
*  in my heart all right all right but i really liked it what i saw and i saw at the theaters
*  i don't know what elizabeth berkeley like pushes jean gerson down the is it jean gerson she pushes
*  down the stairs like like everything about that movie is awesome i think it's great i i love the
*  film i love the film i i brought it up to all the i had a dinner once with like verhoeven a
*  bunch of the producers that film i i started going off on it they all sat there at the dinner
*  watching me go crazy over their film and then at the end of it somebody the one of the producer
*  said well yeah that's all nice to hear but really that movie was just about us doing a lot of cocaine
*  that's exactly what i was just gonna say i'm so glad you just said that because i i always
*  described that movie as a cocaine movie and i was just casting aspersions it was no evidence
*  but it seems like cocaine everywhere apparently yeah yeah because it seems like they thought it
*  was great while they're doing it but it's like what are you doing you know it's one of those
*  things where you think it's great because you're on coke i have a place in my heart for those big
*  movies like that i mean like i said that's not the one that i would that's not the one i would make
*  my case on but i still don't like it that's not my case that's not my that's not my test case well
*  isn't that sort of an example of what happened in when the 80s were a cocaine culture the the
*  world kind of shifted from a psychedelic thing from the 60s and 70s to a cocaine thing in the
*  80s and you get movies like that yeah you get a little bit more edgy a little less trippy
*  well also like a little more ridiculous but see look at how great the beginning it's pretty good
*  that's what i call an actress dedicated to her role no this is where this is where you're losing
*  me this is where you're losing me yeah because how are you keeping a heart on yeah and then it's
*  of all people the whole thing is but just watching aloos with berkeley's tits all right in a big
*  studio movie like this flopping up and down like i'm getting my money's worth well that was huge
*  because it was from saved by the bell yeah but i'm you know okay i'm not actually that's i'm not
*  thinking about it from his point of view i'm thinking about it from the water hitting her face
*  i'm looking from her point of view that's that's the that's the unrealistic part
*  that's true true cocaine movies are fun though there's there's quite a few of those that were
*  just like what is this yeah like how much coke was going around the 80s a lot a lot
*  when you it was actually coke too it was actually real cocaine it was like proper cocaine proper
*  there was you know there was this i mean it's actually really interesting because it's like
*  one of those things where uh remember that customer who used to come in and he would bring in like a
*  rock of cocaine yeah yeah drop it on the counter like a rock of cocaine we and you get boys here
*  the guy was name was tuttle the size of a yeah tuttle the size of a coffee mug and he would bring
*  us these things he was a cocaine dealer and the thing is he would rent you know we'd let him take
*  the movies out and come back whenever he wanted whenever you want yeah and he would come in and
*  uh he'd get his films and then he would like either open up a little like a uh uh uh skull can
*  skull can yeah all right there you go boys there you go boys have fun
*  jesus christ rock and just like bam like throw it on the counter to bounce off yeah there you go
*  boy see you later see you in two weeks like a baseball like a baseball and you take a colander
*  and like just grind it up okay who wants some pure coke for the first time because we're
*  minimum wage kids for the first time we actually had fuck you coke we had access to coke in a way
*  that we could never afford like for about a few months because those relationships don't last
*  that long no no no cocaine relationships never last but for a few buds we're like holy shit we're
*  we're in the fucking you know we're we're in the powder well he there was a party once that he
*  came to and he brought a again a rock of cocaine and a live hand grenade he put them both down
*  they usually go together yeah and it was like okay it's a dangerous combination
*  the person does a lot of coke usually that was a fun party and his name was tuttle and we always
*  described excess as tuttle okay we're gonna we're gonna get into a tuttle situation dude i'm so
*  tuttle oh that's hilarious it became like you're fugazi yeah oh that's so funny when i worked at
*  in boston at nicks comedy stop they would offer to pay you in cocaine or cash
*  there was guys who just took the cocaine in certain comics they just wanted to get paid in coke
*  yeah wild times you know that's the 80s it was the 80s it was the 80s well yeah that was actually
*  even kind of an interesting situation because like uh it was also one of those things where like
*  i was actually really kind of proud of us because we all kind of like whoa we all kind of went nutty
*  for like a little bit with this kind of like more access to coke than we normally have would have
*  more access more access to coke than we ever had ever yeah yeah and like because we can't afford
*  that shit all right and uh so we all kind of went nuts for like a little bit about it
*  and then we all kind of like okay let's yeah enough of that yeah let's bring it together
*  well that's great let's bring it together out and we are and we also saw some other people who
*  were like who let it get a let it get the best of them yeah and they got really kind of like
*  your friend with the story about being bitter yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly the same sort of thing
*  you go oh i know where this is going and so we all like okay let's let's pull back let's get let's
*  let's get control of this and then and we all did yeah it was all collectively we all kind of just
*  got our shit together and put it in the rear mirror right right that means we didn't do it but
*  we just it was we controlled it contrary to your goals we'll stay with pot we'll stay with pot yeah
*  yeah when i was growing up a bunch of people that i knew got hooked on coke and that's what kept me
*  from ever doing coke i would stop i mean i had children and suddenly it was like oh my god like
*  i have to be on call 24 7 right you can't be out like coked up yeah like that that's not gonna
*  last anymore that gets in the way of that gets in the way mushroom trips and pretty soon my saturday
*  mornings became more important than my friday nights this is pretty simple yeah my thing about
*  priorities was i wanted to have excess or i didn't oh i wasn't that interested in it
*  yeah you want to take it to 12 no i wanted to have a big pile of it and we're doing it all fucking
*  night until this is gone until until the straw is bloody yeah okay now i'm stopping now because
*  the straw got bloody i think it's like some people don't have the ability to only do that once
*  like for whatever reason some people they have that thing and they do coke a little bit then
*  they just want to keep doing coke yeah that's scary when it is scary that's scary when that
*  happens because you're captured by a demon yeah you know and it's literally and i think it's
*  literally a demon yeah no i think in the classic jinn sense of the word where it's whispering into
*  your ear well in the sense it does all the things a demon would do you know you you could say the
*  demons aren't real okay but they might be real right look they've been around for i think there's
*  pretty good evidence there's a lot of we live like legitimate evil in the world you know and
*  where is that coming from what's that energy like what what begets that what what is the what is the
*  reason why people are willing to you know mass murder like what is it what is it people willing
*  to launch missiles in the cities what is that where where's that coming from there's got to
*  like that would be evil if you defined it in the classic sense of the word you know when a
*  invading army comes into a village and hacks people that's not demonic that's not evil you're
*  lighting children on fire and throwing them on thatched roofs that's not demonic seems pretty
*  demonic like a demon would do that whether the physical demon exists is almost like not even
*  important yeah it's like demonic behavior is 100 documented what would jesus do yeah right right
*  just ask yourself but it's a thing it's unlikely it's unlikely he's going to raise a fist everybody
*  wants to be smart and you want to be secular and you never want to say that you believe in something
*  that's superstitious or ridiculous so you don't believe in religion you're either agnostic or
*  atheist that's how you get respect and it's like this weird thing where you're not willing to
*  consider like okay but what are the actions what are the actions of good and the actions of evil
*  there's those though the actions are real right and we all know in our heart and our soul when
*  you do a good thing how you feel versus how you when you do how do a bad thing how you feel like
*  so what is what are those forces apocalypse now when uh uh brandos kurtz tells the story of uh
*  going into the village and inoculating all right uh all the children in the village shooting their
*  arms with uh uh uh uh um you know flu shots or something like that you're inoculating them
*  and then the uh uh the soldiers came in and then hacked off all the kids arms and then there's like
*  a little pile of arms and kurtz says you know so we did all that then we came back in the village
*  the next day and we saw the little pile of all the little alarms in there where they hacked them off
*  and i cried like a baby
*  then i started thinking the genius of that the genius of that because these are not monsters
*  they're not demons these are men doing a job and uh and they had the force of will
*  to take the job and and take it to its logical conclusion of what they had to do all right you
*  know i'm not condoning i'm not condoning what kurtz is saying kurtz is a fucking crazy person
*  all right you know uh um but i'm interested in his perspective but of course of course that
*  would be kurtz's perspective he's speaking about true power where he's a god he's a god you know
*  worshiped by these natives yeah clearly lost his fucking mind in the fog of war he's completely
*  lost his mind in the fog of war but he's talking like gingus khan yes exactly like they all talk
*  yeah but this is the thing where you're suspicious of power right like why you suspicious well you
*  should be because you see where it ultimately leads it ultimately leads to a kurtz or it ultimately
*  leads to the way to really be in control of people like you have to use violence you can only use
*  words for so long strong men hold civilizations together that's just a fact of things both of us
*  have become friends over the years with john millius yeah who wrote apocalypse who wrote
*  apocalypse now and you know john is the kind of guy who's like you know conquerors conquerors you
*  know them and he wrote a script about uh gingus khan and that you worked on yeah that i worked on
*  with him to help turn it into a series my daughter and i helped him with it after he had a stroke
*  and um you know you look at his gingus khan script and he's you know he's realistically talking
*  about these horrific atrocities that just you know sewing people up and felt and lighting it on fire
*  and throwing him in river just however you can kill somebody he figured out a way to do it better
*  and um but at the same time you know he invented paper money and he invented the silk road and he
*  you know trade these pulled pulled uh you know that whole region of the world together under
*  one empire and you know over the course of it you know you start out as you know
*  almost like the like konan konan the warrior konan the conqueror konan the king eventually
*  you're his own hand yeah king by your own hand and eventually you you start realizing and john
*  millis also wrote and directed konan the barbarian and so he you know he rightly recognizes that it's
*  strong men who conquer but also who hold together and and maintain order and there's a balance to be
*  had between force and and strength and you know and compassion as well too much compassion you
*  know countries fall apart yeah too much introspection countries fall apart right and
*  when things are too good when things are too good things are too easy and you think they're supposed
*  to be easy and understand how they became easy and what keeps them easy yeah yeah and that's kind of
*  where we are right now it's weird times right now as we are we're in a konan movie well it does feel
*  a little few like we're in kind of neo feudalistic times where you know there's highway men and uh
*  that you have to contend with when you go out and everything's a little more fragile and well
*  there's also this new thing uh which is the internet and social media and there's this new
*  thing that has overcome our minds and uh it's affecting everyone in this very bizarre way and
*  it's making people more tribal and more inclined towards echo chambers more antagonistic against
*  opposing beliefs and views so you were saying about like being able to sit and have a conversation
*  with someone and completely disagree but not take it personally just disagree about the points
*  we've lost that in our society important to be able to engage with other people to disagree with
*  them yes and then to know that that's just that we can still have dinner together we can still be
*  friends i can okay so i go on a show and i said that i like joker too well i say i like joker too
*  now now now there's 150 articles that come out on all these cannibalized articles one person
*  listens to the thing and writes an article about it and then there's 150 ripoff articles on that
*  and then you read the comments it's in the quick the fucking asshole that movie's fucking stuck
*  me he's a fucking asshole for saying this why am i a fucking asshole right i just make any
*  all right that makes me a fucking asshole it's crazy you either like the movie you you don't
*  all right and i'm not i'm not plugging the movie i'm not i'm not saying i'm not doing anything all
*  right i'm just saying i like it who gives a fuck what i like right what do you care what the fuck
*  i like right and also it also but then i'll say i didn't see something well he's a fucking asshole
*  what the fuck i see and what i don't see what the fuck do you fucking care but there's no one in
*  front of him to say that he's an idiot alone with his phone if he just said it out loud amongst
*  reasonable people they would turn to what the fuck are you talking about but he doesn't get
*  that check which is also part of the problem with social media what someone will say something like
*  well i think he's fucking missing out well i'm sure there's a lot of shit i can say that you're
*  missing out on and i don't care if you miss out also you have to be missing out otherwise you don't
*  have a life yeah how much information do you think you can absorb in a day how much things
*  you can watch and listen to you have to miss out for movies a day apparently yeah that's a lot of
*  time man you have to miss out there's gonna be shit you miss out on well the other thing is if
*  you're a full a film fan today you're not just dealing with today's films you're dealing with
*  this insane archive that goes back to rocky yeah you know it goes back to you know on the waterfront
*  goes back to the 20s good lord yeah there's so many films to watch no no like you know a film
*  that i saw that was like very meaningful to me this year is i really like the story of bo jest
*  you know the the french foreign legion story i like french foreign legion movies anyway but that's a
*  really cool story and i really like the whole story of the three brothers in there and uh you know i'm
*  i was familiar with the gary cooper version the 1939 version put it on a stamp but i've never seen
*  the silent version and it started ronald colman and i watched the silent version recently and i was
*  blown away by it the storytelling was so epic and was so visually just beautiful and we have a little
*  micro cinema in the theater i have one of the theaters i have in los angeles the vista and it's
*  like a little 20 seat cinema that we just show vhs and 16 millimeter it's our video archives yeah it's
*  like video arc at the video card cinema club and it's like literally it's like the brick and mortar
*  version of video archives but just like but like a little paris back out back avenue it's like a
*  little clubhouse i mean it's open to everybody but for our core fans and the thing is and we
*  we showed uh last week we showed the the silent version of bo jest in it and uh and i wasn't there
*  at that screening but i asked the guy who was our manager they're mad i said how did it go he goes
*  quinn you would have really loved to have been there for that screening and i go well what he goes
*  it was so moving the end of it and it is really moving and it's just like nobody was talking
*  it was just it was emotional you could hear a pin drop and then was over and and everyone was still
*  kind of in this collective emotional state and they just all kind of left the theater and they
*  they just seen something emotional and they all kind of just moved out into the lobby and and
*  in this emotional state and it was like that sounds fucking fantastic that's amazing i mean i
*  think one of the most magical things about movies is that uh it can speak to you at different times
*  of your life you know at the different windows of opportunity in your life so you might see a movie
*  and not like it and then you know people might see joker 2 today and not really care for it and
*  then five years from now revisit it and watch it again and you're in a different place culture is
*  in a different place everything's in a different place and you have a different perspective on the
*  movie and maybe you like the movie i hated blade runner when it first came out did not like the
*  film i thought it was awful really awful like boring uh like muddled like everything that was
*  wrong suddenly i'm seeing cubric shots in the end from uh the uh the shining like roger would say
*  blade runner should be called blade crawler no i was really hard i was really hard on movies i was
*  a really angry young guy and such a prick about shit he's a completely different guy all right
*  now he's like beds over backwards to be nice about something i go who the fuck is this
*  this
*  humbled by life well i i now look at i mean having you know been a filmmaker and you know and knowing
*  the struggle that goes into getting something on screen like i know how hard it is sometimes to get
*  what you have up here on onto screen and doesn't always work and sometimes you're faking it by the
*  time it gets to the cut but you know it's it's not an easy uh thing to it's not so when i watch a
*  movie now i'm applying my life experience to it and i'm like okay this movie may not be the
*  greatest movie but this is somebody's you know vision yeah and i'm gonna give that you know
*  i'm gonna value that and give myself to it and try to find in it what i like about it and so i
*  always give every movie a shake you know a good shake what's happened with our show that i think
*  is really cool again for the fans that follow it and everything is in our first season we ended up
*  like covering about 70 movies you know uh all together and we mentioned a zillion movies in
*  the course of a show but like you know we covered about 70 movies all together and between the three
*  movies that we we did over the course of like 26 episodes and uh and we kind of created new classics
*  at least amongst the people who followed the show because they followed it and they liked it and they
*  you know watch some old mexican horror movie like demon on there hey that was pretty cool demaroid
*  is amazing and then everybody would put it down if you tried to look at anything about it it would
*  all be shitty reviews about it and everything but then we talked about it with passion and then we
*  gave the right context in which to appreciate the movie it's a killer hand movie and we gave the
*  right context in which to appreciate the movie and then the people appreciated it under that
*  right context like because the movie is old and because maybe they didn't have the money to do it
*  like super clean or perfect you know actually that actually has the most best hand effects well yeah
*  that movie in particular is actually a tough one to because it's is this demon yeah that's
*  a killer hand that fucks everybody up and the thing is this the best like hand on the loose movie
*  it's a mexico exploitation movie okay with mexican exploitation movie but the one that's
*  great about it one she's fantastic and it's samantha agar samantha agar has become one of
*  our heroes all right from the show i love samantha agar but this movie looks hilarious
*  but what's nice but what's really cool about about uh uh the mexican horror genre is uh they take
*  their tacky horror very seriously it's tacky horror but they take it really seriously and you
*  appreciate the the seriousness that they're that they're delivering that they're delivering
*  their payload with and i know how hard it is to to do some of the things that they're doing
*  other this is like it's pre computer graphics it's they have a limited budget but their vision is so
*  big and you're watching it you're like oh my god this is if you just like if you try not to judge
*  it on what a movie looks like today no but but not only just that what's interesting is when you see
*  some of the effects that there's a couple of the effects well how did they do that
*  yeah because it's all done practical and then some of it it's like oh well i can see how they did
*  that oh my god that's so fucking clever they figure it out how to do it in such a clever way
*  i can see how they did it but that's so neat because they just figure it out how to do it
*  on camera in a way that that that sells it yeah and and and it's a crazy movie also it's crazy
*  it's like you're inside of some sort of crazy mexican's head making a horror movie it's
*  fantastic well the horror genre is hard to do to not make ridiculous yeah although the best thing
*  about the horror genre and science fiction is that they're the best vehicles to kind of study
*  culture and sociological issues because you have that abstraction layer that you know makes people
*  think oh i'm just watching a science fiction film or i'm just watching a horror movie right like you
*  watch dawn of the dead and yeah you're watching a movie about zombies in a shopping mall or are
*  you watching a movie about the vanishing middle class being drawn to the consumer temple because
*  it's what they remembered from their lives that was an important place to them like literally
*  quoting the movie i'm actually quoting my liner notes that i wrote for the uh dvd way back when
*  let me go to the bathroom one more time the coffee is making me take a pill no worries
*  go for it we can keep going okay so when you first got into this like did you have uh like a
*  film that you aspired to create something like like when you first did you say i you know like
*  it's a composite comedians would be like i want to be the next eddie murphy yeah it's it was a
*  composite it was a composite i have like a kind of a top three filmmaker you know when you're a
*  young filmmaker and when you're a young child you look to your parents to learn how to behave
*  you know you're a child and you look right you look to them and you're like they teach you how
*  to be sure and so at the beginning of your life you're copying your parents and because that's
*  that's who you love and that's what you're copying when you're a young filmmaker
*  very frequently you kind of copy your parents your cinematic parents and you know so um in my case
*  uh you know i mean you know in in many filmmakers like for instance stanley cubrick who is one of my
*  favorite filmmakers who i'm always thinking about his zero point perspective his reverse tracking
*  shots i just love the the intention of his shots and how he assembles his movies i like um i like
*  everything about his work um i do too cubrick huge fan he like if if you love fritz lang you can see
*  that oh cubrick was that's how he felt about fritz lang like when i watch m i can see the cubrick
*  shots this fritz lang metropolis yeah he did metropolis he did uh i mean it's like some of
*  the greatest metropolis is wild metropolis is a super super powerful and kind of important movie
*  that's exactly uh talking about everything that's going on today that people should see the movie i
*  was thinking about was m which is his movie with peter lorry about the pedophile who's uh and the
*  movie's made in uh just just before the nazis took power oh wow and so he's making a movie that's
*  really about like kind of the rise of uh the rise of hitlerian fascism in europe but he's doing it
*  through this movie about a pedophile and it's it's peter and peter lorry is fantastic and it's
*  actually his first sound movie like fritz lang hadn't made a sound movie and so every single shot
*  in the film is based on sound so he'll have shadows talking and the backs of people's heads
*  talking or even the device of the movie is peter lorry whistling peer giant you know
*  that becomes like the device by which they find the killer and maybe so the whole movie is about
*  sound so as a young filmmaker if you want to learn how to use sound in a movie that's the movie to
*  see yeah because every single shot like it used to be you would show a an empty frame and it would
*  just be a shot of nothing but you know now fritz lang is able to juxtapose like a woman has lost
*  her daughter she's calling for her daughter and so she's looking for her daughter and she's looking
*  for her and elsa elsa and they cut to an empty shot of a stairwell and you hear her elsa
*  and they cut to like you know an empty playground elsa and then you see the balloon that she was
*  carrying trapped in something like whipping in the wind elsa and it's super super intense
*  it and but all he's doing is he's using sound juxtaposed with images which he couldn't do before
*  crazy that he just called it m yeah m for murderer and um this is a this is an amazing
*  amazing movie so cubric see that's a cubrician shot that's this is where he's elsa or elsy
*  so
*  i seem to remember more elsies but i think i got the wrong it's okay but anyhow this is but uh so
*  so cubric had his forefathers who he used to who he used to watch and that he used to look to and
*  so those would be like my grandparents in a way and so there's this like lineage of cinematic
*  grammar and vernacular that gets carried on from filmmaker to filmmaker and eventually
*  after you've made enough films you start walking on your own you start coming up with new ideas
*  but for me it was stanley cubric john borman he's the guy who directed excalibur and hope and glory
*  and point blank and hell in the pacific i mean a number of movies i don't think point is such a big
*  fan of john borman some of his films i think you're a fan of his writing more than you are his films
*  no i i i have nothing but respect for john yeah and um john borman and then roman planski i think
*  those three guys for me and and their work not the guys but mostly their work like
*  i am a composite if you watch my movies i'm a composite of those guys and other people as well
*  and um those were the filmmakers who were important to me those were my parents so to speak
*  cubric is so it was such an odd one like his films are so different and he was a weird guy too he did
*  like complex mathematics in his spare time i do complex mathematics nothing wrong with that
*  no um uh yeah he's a weird guy but he was also i think thinking three steps ahead of everybody
*  at any kind of given moment i mean i mean to be honest i was just thinking i just pulled my
*  script from eyes wide shut i had a script that was from set and i was reading it over the weekend
*  and i saw that um uh it has this i mean i've known this for a long time but i started really
*  thinking about it over the weekend it's missing a narration it's missing a third person narration
*  that uh was originally in in the movie that's because the movie was recut and and changed
*  after his death and and they'll and they will um deny it but as a student of cubric i'm watching
*  the movie and i'm like well cubric wouldn't do that cubric wouldn't do that either cubric would
*  have trimmed this scene i didn't know they recut it after his death okay so apparently they finished
*  it well that's the that's the party line that's the party line but i think that they changed the
*  the notes the close-ups the the inserts of the notes i think those are changed it's missing a
*  narration it's definitely missing a narration uh you know a third person narration like that scene
*  where he sees the the prostitute who's died he's at the morgue and he's looking at her and he's
*  like leaning over her it's a bed for narration there's this whole thing what they do instead
*  because they couldn't say that cubric finished the movie because they hadn't done the recording
*  of the narrator yet and so maybe they just kind of clutched it together except there's an entire
*  thread that's kind of been squashed squashed in that film and that's the the two men that are
*  throughout the movie that are constantly in the background of the film who eventually in the final
*  shots of the film you see like uh tom cruise and nicole kidman in that final scene in the toy store
*  when she's looking at the rosemary's baby bassinet which is totally cubric saying something and they
*  never take their eyes off their daughter until the moment they take their eyes off and the final line
*  of the movie is coming up you see those two guys walking off with the daughter they're taking her
*  away they've given their daughter to the pedo cult that's what's happened at the end of the movie
*  and there's an incident where when they first screened the movie in england uh people who were
*  outside a parent this is all secondhand by the way there are people who are outside of the theater
*  who could hear inside of the theater cubric yelling at all the executives and saying it's my
*  movie you can't cut it i do can't fucking cut my film blah blah blah big argument going on then he
*  dies like four days later oh so somebody went in and finished the movie but i think when they
*  finished the movie they hid the film the the movie got changed into something else
*  and i would love to finish that film i like i'm like have you ever made an attempt
*  i've thought about it and um reading the script over the weekend i started seriously thinking
*  about it well somebody should recut this or somebody should so it'd just be a matter of
*  recutting it with narration well yes and no there's obviously missing there would be missing footage
*  now there's things have been removed and is that accessible no not unless you crack it open and
*  there's no way anybody's thing they would never but hold on here's the thing now we have ai well i
*  know that's yeah you're one step ahead of me i'm one step ahead because i i've actually been
*  experimenting a lot with uh with ai the newer versions are pretty stunning i've been working
*  on runway lately which is uh the curve is insane like the exponential curve of improvement i'm
*  literally as i'm working on things i'll be talking to the guys and you know i'll be saying well it'd
*  be nice to be able to move the camera okay we got that tool on tuesday we're gonna give that to you
*  and so it's like literally whatever you think you can't do ask us because we probably will be
*  able to do it in a couple of days and so it's advancing so fast and so rapidly that i without
*  telling you quentin i made a little claymation version of you and i have them talking and kind
*  of funny looking it's a claymation version of both you and me how bizarre that something that
*  would have cost like hundreds of millions of dollars like if you wanted to do a film like a
*  pixel type you know one of those crazy movies where you have all this like insane animation
*  that shit took forever the best work that i've seen of it lately was the first time i've been
*  kind of ignoring ai and like well i know what it is it's like form completion with visuals and i
*  get it i understand what it is and we'll see we'll see but i like tactile i like tech and i do but i
*  worked on beowulf i made beowulf with robert zemmichus okay and like that was a big you know
*  video uh puppet tune cgi thing my original movie motion capture my original plan for that movie
*  because i was going to direct it myself was to make it like you know in iceland you know under
*  10 million dollars you know just really dirty i wanted it to be like uh you know uh like an
*  early terry gilliam film like jabberwock that was actually the one neil and i were
*  thinking about when yeah neil gaiman when my co-writer on that film and um
*  the movie ended up getting made much bigger it turned suddenly it was like
*  whatever budget i had was probably our craft service budget nothing like making a hundred
*  million dollar movie it's like sushi every day you know champagne fly the plane to england you
*  know whatever you want it's like uh it's crazy but that was definitely not the movie i had planned
*  on making however um when we made it like and it turned into this big performance capture thing
*  it was fun like working with zemmichus and and he's such a like an excitable like creative genius
*  like he's and even before you were able to do stuff like what he was doing in that film
*  he was like constantly taking you know like when he made contact oh we'll take that eyebrow off of
*  jodie foster and i like that eyebrow thing she does and so put that on this take and so he was
*  like messing with her face and doing all sorts of performance stuff and even when you go back to his
*  earliest film i want to hold crazy i want to hold your hand i want to hold your hand is almost a
*  visual uh trick you know having the beetles there but not be there and even though he's not using
*  computer graphics i think he's just a really super inventive guy and it was so much fun making the
*  movie with him because what year was that inventing technologies that was 2010 that i think we became
*  up bail wolf let's watch some of them well i want to remember what it looks like it looks probably
*  like a video game pre-cut scene at this point that's what's crazy right like i couldn't make
*  i've thought about taking bail wolf importing it into my system and then just painting over it
*  let's fucking go by the way you can do easily yeah easily i thought about fixing what this looks like
*  with the bear wolf oh jeez yeah i mean it looks like a like a video game cut scene at this point
*  yeah but it was kind of cool because everybody looked like that not just the monster yeah that's
*  that was kind of cool about it i mean the difference is is that this was actual
*  like performances and so we could we could take you know ray winstone and have him ray winstone
*  doesn't look like that he looks a little heftier and uh
*  cuts his own arm cuts my arm cut my own arm off it's funny because my our original script was much
*  more modest than this but then zemmichus was like okay boys it costs a million dollars a minute do
*  whatever you want he stabs a dragon in the heart oh no this movie is kind of a um i mean it's a
*  little it's an interesting experience what happened to me on this film if you don't mind yeah go ahead
*  so i um so i was going to make this movie myself i had i had set it up initially at image movers
*  was zemmichus producing and then it fell out and the rights kind of reverted back to me i had to
*  cover the turnaround on it but the rights reverted back to me and i was going to go make the movie
*  myself for nothing and i was trying to set it up and it was really i was broke at the time and
*  i was not going to make money and i had to cover the turnaround expenses myself on the on the film
*  which were considerable but i wanted to make the movie really bad and i was working on silent hill
*  this other movie i wrote and um i suddenly started getting calls and it was like the producer of
*  polar express this guy steve bing wanted wanted to buy the script he's like i want to buy it for
*  zemmichus and i said ah too little too late i'm making it now and i kept saying no and every
*  and i was working on this film in canada and i'm just trying to finish it and every hour i'm getting
*  a call from agents at ca and they're like jack rap to you right yeah it was actually yeah it was
*  jack how did you know it was jack did i tell you that well no because he well he was he was
*  zemmichus's agent became zemmichus's that's right that's right partner and um and so i was getting
*  he's the guy who gets shit done yeah he is a guy who gets shit done well i was like you know no no
*  no and you know no i won't i'm doing it myself no no and steve bing and i said if another agent
*  calls me i'm firing the agency and they're like will you will you at least meet with the producer
*  and so i went ahead and i meet with them and he says listen if i don't make this film with zemmichus
*  with with bob i'm going to miss the moment i'm going to lose the movie uh it's it's going to be
*  over uh just what's your price just tell me what's your price and i said i don't have a price i don't
*  work like that he said listen everybody's got a price i said well i may have one but i'm not
*  going to tell you and so look why don't you just tell me just discourage me
*  so i said okay you want me to discourage you and so i started like making shit up i need this i
*  want that i want this i want this i tried to come up with how much money had anybody ever made on a
*  script and let's add some money to that i went over the top he's well roger that is and i had
*  grown a beard to make the movie and like grew my hair long like a viking to learn about you know
*  why vikings had beards etc all that kind of stuff i'm making the movie i'm a viking
*  he said well roger that is uh really discouraging but we have a deal
*  and i was like and i was like uh well okay and i i start driving home and i started like i'd never
*  done anything i'd never done something for money before i'd always done it because i'd
*  for passion and then the money came and this was the first time in my life that i had ever made a
*  choice based on money this titanic amount of money and i was understand broke and i went home
*  and i cried and then the check came and nothing dries tears like money and then zemmichus invited
*  me into the process which was really great of him he really wanted me and neil to to be at his side
*  and collaborate with him and it was a fabulous experience but to be honest i was like who am i
*  now what does it all mean i just gave away something i'd wanted to do my entire life i've
*  always been chasing this john borman film excalibur i think it's one of the most beautiful
*  movies ever made about the Arthurian legends and and if you watch beowulf and excalibur
*  they're very similar actually thematically and so um i was like who am i now what does it all mean
*  you know what i don't even care i don't even know if i want to make a movie anymore
*  you know like what do i have to tell now now that i've just completely sold out
*  and then i was at a dinner and a big dinner and i was driving home that night and
*  i was giving somebody who was at the dinner a lift my wife was in the back seat of the car
*  and we were i told my daughter i was going to be home by midnight we lived in ohi it was dark
*  and um i uh so i was speeding i have a lead foot and um i was speeding to get there without getting
*  into the details of what happened there was i lost control of the car there was another vehicle but
*  they led the scene i lost control of the vehicle i um i think my tire blew but i was going into a
*  ditch and i knew i was going into it into this deep ditch because it was right near my house
*  full of rocks and stuff i knew if i go in there we'll die and so i turned into the thing and then
*  i turned away from it to try to the car spun out and i ended up on the other side of the street
*  where i knew there was like a cow pasture and i was like well what's the worst thing that can happen
*  there well it was pretty bad there was a telephone pole and i hit the telephone pole my passenger
*  and i hit the telephone pole my passenger uh um took the impact and my wife was thrown from the car
*  when i came to all i could hear was the horn you know my hearing is going to have glass in my mouth
*  and i'm i'm injured as well i climb out of the car and it's dark it's really dark but somebody's
*  already arrived the xda from ventura county who did all the drunk driving laws and put those on
*  the books and um he was the first person on the scene i was right near the fire department they
*  showed up shortly afterwards but when i jumped out of the car i came running around to see what
*  happened i saw my wife on the on the asphalt she'd been thrown from the vehicle and i um i
*  i threw myself onto you know onto my knees on the on the pavement and i found myself in that moment
*  uh
*  asking for the one thing that mattered which was just life she looked dead and she and i just in that
*  moment i dug down i begged her to come back to life and i just i said i will give anything for
*  life just in any form i'll take it and in that moment she came back to life it was like the
*  the life came back into her okay it was a completely fucked up scene my other my other
*  passenger is dying in the car or dead and my uh the the police are suddenly there and next thing
*  i know i'm in jail and um uh and suddenly you're like suddenly i found myself in jail i found myself
*  uh guilty of manslaughter and um and and something that is absolutely irreversible happening which is
*  you know someone lost their life at my hand and um so after that i you know um i ended up i found
*  myself in jail and doing time and suddenly everything that had come was gone like everything that i had
*  made gone it all went you know out all that money you made all that to the settlement is it i didn't
*  have time to spend it didn't have time to register that it was there and it was gone because it does
*  it was like it was not real and um and then you find yourself in jail and uh and and suddenly
*  everything is gone career is gone everybody stops calling it's over
*  two number two hit films doesn't matter it's all over in fact it was right in the middle of the
*  publicity on beowulf it was just toward the end of it and um it was it's the most horrible thing that
*  that has ever happened to me and i um and i found myself then alone in jail uh incarcerated um
*  alone with my remorse and regret and uh and really getting existential about things
*  really like um coming to appreciate
*  you know simple existence is the best thing there is it's people don't appreciate what we have you
*  don't appreciate it until it's gone and it is can go like first of all we live in bodies of glass
*  my wife was horribly injured and uh you know and it has been a decade to you know to not just
*  rebuild our lives but to you know for her to come back to health even um what it did though
*  you know as as because i would do anything to to reverse that to reverse what happened
*  i would give anything to do it and i don't say this lightly but having said that
*  i'm kind of grateful as well because i was
*  like asleep walking through life and um it wasn't until that happened that i completely like it
*  changed how i see everything it was like my third eye opened up i don't view anything the same way
*  i you know once you've been incarcerated and you've been deprived of of everything and you have a lot
*  of time to think and be existential you come out of that at least i came out of that experience
*  and you know i i looked at a tree and i was like okay that's the most beautiful thing i've ever
*  seen in my life i hope i never not feel this way this um this appreciation for a cloud you know
*  to be able like when you're imprisoned to be able to pet a cat for example it's so simple it's such
*  a nothing thing you think okay to be able to pet an animal is like a gift the simplest things are
*  gifts when i was in jail it was also a little bit like a comedy you know you have people walking
*  in circles and you know everybody's trying to control the outside and so you start really
*  seeing human behavior up front i mean when i was in jail uh you know i'm there literally
*  during the academy awards it's on the tv in the tank and i'm watching him win like for jango
*  let me ask her for jenga so while quentin is like at the height of things i'm pretty much at the
*  bottom watching through bars and not only that but greg shapiro who produced the rules of attraction
*  for me my producer who came and visited me with robert robin wright in the days that followed he
*  won for zero dark 30 and so i'm like they're like like
*  to be taken from one point where you feel like you're at the top and you're like oh you think
*  you're uh you think you understand things no i'm gonna take you and put you at the bottom but let
*  me tell you something in that moment i was sitting on the asphalt my wife came back to life
*  i immediately knew what i had to say as a filmmaker after that it was like whatever had
*  it was like whatever had whatever cynicism i had had you know uh
*  about the movie and not making it it just went away evaporated yeah it evaporated it evaporated
*  and the ecstatic experiences and they were ecstatic that i had in jail were like i mean you
*  see things kind of for real when you see somebody you know get hanged by their celly in a cell
*  or when you see when you know that you know uh oh that el salvadorian ms 13 hitman guy
*  he's gonna kill that that gay dude he's gonna kill him in the yard i'll go lock myself in my cell
*  literally i'll go lock myself in you shut the door because you know shit is going to go down
*  and so like like that was like every day and so suddenly it was like you know and also you
*  really know who stands with you after something horrible happens and and like john langley uh
*  our customer from video archives ended up being like like when i like i said when i was in jail he
*  loaned me money and he uh gave me my first job when i got out that was our customer who did that
*  and so um like i value our customers yeah like and uh and and and especially john and his family
*  and maggie who i like it really is i talk about john a lot but really maggie she was really my
*  big champion i think and so um anyhow i uh um you know what it taught me actually
*  because i was a filmmaker and i was up my own ass most of the time but what it kind of taught me was
*  you know be compassionate to other people because you might not know it but they might be going
*  through shit in their lives you know and god forbid it be something health related which is
*  almost out of your control but you know people are suffering and people are struggling and i used to
*  be a lot more cavalier about people and kind of fuck with people and uh and be forceful people
*  and not really care as much now i'm acutely aware of of um of people and you know what they may be
*  going through it's just i think this is the best way to wrap this up perfect gentlemen thank you
*  very much this is a awesome conversation this is really really thank you for letting us three and
*  a half hours just flew by thank you oh my god i i i i i i actually thought oh i guess he's wrapping
*  it up quick no i think it's three hours i thought it was like three hours and 15 minutes at least
*  90 minutes no there it is the video archives podcast um on on patreon patreon.com on the right
*  patreon.com slash video if you just look up videoheadspodcast.com it'll be beautiful
