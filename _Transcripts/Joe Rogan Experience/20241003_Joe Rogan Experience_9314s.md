# JRE MMA Show #164 with Israel Adesanya
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMYRySmH5vc)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day!
*  What's up?
*  What's up?
*  Good to see you my friend. What is the chain?
*  What does that stand for?
*  Engage, this is my fightwear brand.
*  Ash Belcastro started this.
*  He was one of the...
*  I'll say this, he was one of the only guys who f***ed with me before I really like blew up.
*  So when I was fighting in China and I lost to Alex, they stopped giving me fights.
*  And I had I think at the time, I was the highest paid foreign fighter in China at the time.
*  Probably not now anymore.
*  But then they stopped giving me fights and I was like, look I have seven more fights on my contract.
*  Can I at least just get three? I just need three because money was running out.
*  You know the money I had saved up.
*  And then, yeah, I was down to my last one day like $500.
*  And Eugene was holding pads for me because he saw something was up.
*  And I just said, bro, I'm about to be broke, this and that, right, right, right.
*  And he said, don't worry, just leave it with me.
*  I get home. I was on the toilet.
*  And he just goes, check your bank account.
*  And I'm sitting there just like, start crying.
*  And I call him, he's like, no, don't thank me, thank Ash.
*  Who started Engage. And I call Ash.
*  I'm taking a shit and I'm just like, thank you!
*  Thank you so much!
*  Like, honestly just intense.
*  Just intense because, you know, I mean I've been there like nothing.
*  And had everything and nothing again.
*  So for me, yeah, he's always been a guy that's been in my corner.
*  And me and Alex Volkonoski now, we've helped raise the brand so we own part of the company.
*  So yeah, I like to rep the set.
*  Oh, that's cool. Nice, nice.
*  And I think Engage also was last Final Three when they had the whole Reebok fiasco.
*  It was Venom, Engage and someone else. I can't remember who else.
*  So we didn't get the gig. But it would have been nice though.
*  Oh, the UFC gig?
*  Yeah, Engage Fight Kits for the fighters.
*  But now it's Venom Fight Kits.
*  Yeah, the whole Fight Kit thing is weird.
*  I really preferred it when fighters could have sponsors.
*  Condom Depot on the back of your shorts.
*  I don't like that. I mean, they should probably have some discretion.
*  I did like it though.
*  And I do like the fact now, like the last fight I had, Hunter hit me up way before any gold gloves or anything.
*  He says, Izzy, we're going to do this for certain fighters.
*  What design would you like on your shorts?
*  And I was like, bet. And I hit up Curtis, who works with Engage, does a lot of the designs.
*  And I told him what I wanted.
*  And then he just did some custom stuff and I sent a few to Hunter.
*  And then boom, I got my shorts, the Lightning.
*  And I quite like that. I like expression.
*  That's one thing I do miss about boxing or kickboxing is the expression on the Monk Kong bands, the shorts.
*  Jonathan Haggerty, he has cool shorts with golden bows on the side.
*  I like that. It's cool.
*  I do too. I don't like everybody has to wear the same shit.
*  I think maybe the UFC at the time, they wanted to be taken seriously in a sense.
*  So we had to like professional sports.
*  But nah, I think we're all different independent contractors and we have different styles.
*  So I'm glad now they've brought out for certain fighters like O'Malley and his pink shorts,
*  Bryce Mitchell's camel shorts. Let us express ourselves.
*  I like that. But I wish fighters had the ability to advertise.
*  Oh, big time. Yeah.
*  That's big. Sponsors on your shorts is a lot of money.
*  Like Shaw was making more money from the sponsors than he was from his fight perks.
*  Yeah, I agree. And there's a way to bring it back, I'm sure.
*  But even now, because they've got some, you get some kickbacks,
*  but it's better if you can just plaster Condom Depot and get a hundred grand on the back of your shorts.
*  How much does Condom Depot pay people?
*  I don't know, but I used to think it was funny. And the fact that it was on the back of the shorts,
*  I'm like, that's placement, advertising.
*  I just feel like if they didn't like some because it didn't represent the sport, like Condom Depot,
*  then just fucking have a list of ones that you agree to.
*  That's actually a good idea. Like say, approve sponsors.
*  Okay, these guys. Or maybe they go through a check first.
*  You want to maybe advertise on a fighter shorts, you have to go through this rigorous check.
*  What's your company? What do you guys sell? Right.
*  Right, right, right. And then yeah, plaster it on the shorts, get some money.
*  I do like it when boxers wear cool shorts. They wear whatever the fuck they want.
*  I love it when Melvin Manhoef would wear those gladiator ones.
*  Yeah, he was a badass. I like tassels though. That's me with my shorts.
*  I always like tassels because when you kick, the way they shimmer, the way they look.
*  And it just makes for cool picks.
*  Yeah, that's just one of the things about the UFC.
*  They want everything to be uniform and organized.
*  But again, now for certain fighters they're changing it, which is good, but hopefully that trickles down.
*  I don't feel like anybody should be wearing shorts in grappling.
*  I feel like the temptation for, yeah, tights. Temptation for grabbing is just too much.
*  And it does happen. Yeah, I've seen it.
*  It's happened to me even with, what's his name, Brunson.
*  Brunson, he grabbed my tights and I was like, yo, that's two times you've done it now.
*  So it is tempting, but I think tights would be the best way to fight.
*  But again, some guys have cool shorts and if that's their style, that's their style.
*  Because some people, I guess maybe they're body type. Maybe they got no ass.
*  I got something back there, but I don't know, a guy like, I wouldn't drop no names,
*  but wearing tights you look like a fucking stick or something.
*  You look a little flat. Yeah, that's what it is though.
*  Yeah, it is what it is. I mean, there's a lot of room for expression.
*  It's interesting to watch all the different styles that people promote themselves as well.
*  There's so many different ways now. And then there's guys like Alex who,
*  he doesn't even speak English and he's risen to the top just based on performance.
*  But even the fact that he doesn't speak English, that's also his superpower, just a charmer.
*  Right. What do you think about that fight this weekend?
*  I can't wait. I just did the breakdown for it. We're about to drop it on YouTube now.
*  I am picking in this fight, Alex.
*  Because I just think the momentum behind him right now is so big. He's just got momentum.
*  Look, I was the most active champion in UFC history.
*  I think next to Alex Volkonovsky as well, he was right up there with me or if not more than me.
*  I think Alex now is on his way to being the most active champ in UFC history
*  because he's already saved this year, I think, two or three cards alone.
*  He's like stepped in and be like, yeah, charmer. Just does it, jumps in.
*  And he fights fucked up. He fights injured.
*  Apparently his knee was really fucked up in the first Yuri Prochaska fight.
*  Oh, wow. You know when he stopped Yuri and then he said he did like a forward roll off the Yuri?
*  He said he did that because he didn't trust standing on his right knee.
*  Oh, wow. Momentum. Yeah, his knee was fucked up.
*  So he didn't, like he was fucked up in training camp.
*  And so when he stepped off of him, he just decided to roll forward instead of putting weight on his right knee.
*  That's smart. That's some parkour shit.
*  But again, that's what you have to do.
*  Look, when you get in the UFC, this is what I did as well.
*  He did it the right way. Fight as much as possible.
*  Fight as much as possible so you can be in people's faces so they can see.
*  That guy just fought. That guy just fought. Oh, I just saw him fight last month.
*  And you fight as much as you can. You get that momentum behind you.
*  And then you become champion. You're that guy.
*  And then again, you just that momentum constantly in people's faces.
*  You're getting posted here, here. And that's how you build the stock up.
*  So I've done that. And he's doing it the right way as well.
*  And I think if he keeps going, I hope he retires, never getting defeated by anyone ever again.
*  Just you. And the way you did it too. Oh, my God.
*  That was one of the greatest celebrations of all time.
*  It just look, it's it's it's the story behind it, no matter what.
*  It's just the history because David even mentioned to me, my brother said, like, you know, you're the only one that can actually stand with that guy.
*  Like, no one's lasted more than two rounds or even around with him.
*  And I thought about it during the breakdown. Like, yeah, you're right.
*  And it's because I knew him. I've fought that guy so many times.
*  And regardless of what happened, I lost three times and I finally won one.
*  It was just the fact that I knew I could beat him every time I fought him.
*  I was just like, I was I was beating him. I thought you won the first one.
*  I felt so, too. But then that's, you know, the Chinese boxing kickboxing fight.
*  They gave it to him. And then the second fight in Brazil under the same company that he gets me.
*  But again, I was besting him, had him on skates.
*  He was fucking and then he brought his spirit. You know what Jerry said about the whole juju thing?
*  That's real. That's real. So the last time I fought him in Miami, look, he beats me.
*  That's why I hate when people say, oh, is he scared? He's scared.
*  It's like, bro, I ain't scared of shit.
*  The guy beat me in the biggest arena on the planet, Madison Square Garden.
*  Same way as the last time he beat me in Brazil in his hometown.
*  I was beating his ass, had him hurt in the end of the first round, all that shit.
*  Took him down and then he gets me in the last round.
*  It's his spirit, his whatever like ancestors or his people that are praying for him.
*  Because I got prayer worries as well. My mom and dad be fasting and they have people like in the spirit praying for me.
*  But like the way he carries himself, something about him just he knows how to recover well.
*  So I just knew I could get him. I could get him.
*  And then after that, he knocks me on the biggest arena in the world.
*  And I'm just like, let's do that shit again, Dana.
*  Because I just knew I was like, I can get him.
*  And then that camp, I was so I went to a different place.
*  And that was the one I kind of mentioned. I microdosed a little bit or macrodosed a lot.
*  And like I always say this, the shower is the most interesting place on the planet, I feel.
*  Because you have the element of water running over your body, strip naked in your bare essentials.
*  You kind of have this if it's a white shower, like a void white space, I can create a lot in there.
*  I can make a lot of things happen.
*  And yeah, one time after one of my showers, I just wrote this thing on my mirror because I just had this premonition.
*  Like this is where I get it done. Like there's no way you could beat me one time.
*  You could beat me two times. You might beat me three times.
*  But I was like, nah, this guy's not going to beat me this time.
*  And I just knew I had to get this done.
*  And the way it happened as well, because first round, I think I won.
*  Second round, I was winning. But then that fucking leg kick, bro.
*  You know what it is. You look at his foot.
*  You look at this bit of his foot. It's like a hammer.
*  You know, like the back of a hammer or a hammer like a ballpoint pen.
*  It is because that's what he kicks you with as well.
*  So he doesn't have to, excuse me, he doesn't have to turn the hip over.
*  And then when he hits you with that, even because he's bone density, long legs.
*  And he hits you with that. You just feel it like, ooh, that's bad.
*  And it's a different feeling because I've been kicked by kickboxes all my life on the thigh, on the calf as well.
*  But when he hits you with that bit, it's just the surface area is so small,
*  but it travels and transfers through your whole calf.
*  And you're like, oh, I can't put weight on this.
*  It's so interesting, too, how he keeps his body completely square.
*  And he doesn't even really turn the hips. Yeah.
*  And so it's so sneaky.
*  He doesn't have to because he's got so much bone density, so much whip from that little.
*  And yeah, it's dangerous.
*  And I think that's going to be a problem this weekend for Khalil.
*  But I don't know why Chael says he did you hear about what Chael said?
*  Chael said he thinks Khalil is going to knock him out.
*  That's possible.
*  But I just don't think he's it's possible.
*  I don't think he's going to get it done because all it takes is one from either side.
*  But I just think Pereira right now has just got that momentum behind him and the frame
*  because he's going to just avoid the shots Khalil's throwing because he just got the long frame.
*  He'll get right out the way.
*  And I don't think Khalil has the reach to mess with him like that.
*  So you might have to get inside.
*  But yeah, we'll see.
*  This is why paper can't fight paper.
*  They have to get in there and fight.
*  So we'll find out.
*  It's very interesting because Khalil is so fast and Khalil's had experience with high level kickboxes when he knocked out Gokhan Saki.
*  That was a big one.
*  Yeah, that was a big one.
*  And that was like early on where everybody's like, oh, shit, Gokhan Saki is finally in the UFC.
*  And then boom, Khalil just takes him out.
*  Yeah, Khalil's fast.
*  He hits fucking hard.
*  And he throws like that.
*  The thing that he did with Lionheart, he throws that off speed shit sometimes.
*  He'll give you a little of this and then he jolts in on you.
*  That off speed uppercut was nasty.
*  It's the looks.
*  Yeah.
*  Almost Prince Nassim-esque but different.
*  It's like looking, looking, bang.
*  But again, he's just violent.
*  Like when he smells blood, he just goes in.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I said, he beats you like you owe him money or something.
*  He's on you.
*  He's on you.
*  Yeah, very violent.
*  But again, I think Khalil, for him to win this fight, he just has to believe in himself.
*  That sounds real cheesy, but believe in himself.
*  Also, he's a southpaw.
*  I didn't think about that.
*  Right.
*  I actually forgot about that till David mentioned it before, but he's a southpaw.
*  But I'm sure Alex and his team know how to deal with it.
*  But I understand how Alex deals with southpaws as well because I can fight him both ways.
*  And I know when you give him that front leg and he knows he can get it, he gets more confident.
*  But if you're a southpaw, he finds other ways to keep you at bay until he can get that leg.
*  It's going to be interesting to see right away how Khalil deals with the distance and
*  how Alex deals with the speed.
*  Because the thing is, Alex can be hit.
*  Bruno Silva tagged him a few times.
*  You took him out.
*  I think the 85 thing was, I think the drain for him to make 85 was insanity.
*  I think it was insane.
*  He's so fucking big.
*  He still can.
*  He still can.
*  But look, it only works until you get knocked out.
*  And it's like, I bet.
*  And let's go to 205.
*  And I said, look, all these 185ers should thank me, man.
*  Honestly, I thank me because a lot of the top guys didn't have to fight him.
*  He fought.
*  Okay, who did he fight?
*  Strickland.
*  Strickland.
*  That was one of the only top guys he fought beat him.
*  And then I think he got a shot at me next pretty much.
*  But yeah, fucking Rob, Drigges, all of them.
*  Because it's not about just fighting him.
*  Getting ready to fight him is a different thing.
*  But I had to do it fucking four times.
*  So I understand.
*  I have a different history with it.
*  What's different about getting ready to fight him?
*  For me, getting ready to fight him, you just know you're going to be in for a war.
*  You know it's not going to be an easy fight.
*  Same for him.
*  He knows when he has to fight me.
*  And it's like, fuck, it's not an easy fight because he knows what I can do to him.
*  But for me as well, I was just like, fuck.
*  Okay, let's go again.
*  And again, it's not like, because I feel that way with certain people.
*  But with him, it's just a different feeling, I guess, because he beat me.
*  That's another thing.
*  And I was like, man, I got to fucking face this demon again.
*  All right, bet.
*  Let's face my demons.
*  And I get myself up to fight him.
*  But it's just getting ready to fight him.
*  It's just the hurdle.
*  I think maybe just because of the history.
*  That's why for me I felt that way, because of the history.
*  Because to fight someone who's beaten you multiple times, it's like, and you know you can beat them.
*  In your heart, you just know.
*  But again, that's the beauty of the story.
*  Right, you had come so close a couple of times.
*  Every time.
*  And then even in the first fight in the UFC, so close at the end of that first round.
*  Like you had him.
*  If there was 30 seconds left in the fight or in the round.
*  10 seconds left.
*  But again, that's the beauty of the story, because then he waited till the fifth round or got to the fifth round.
*  He's just like, did this fucking juju, whatever thing.
*  And then fucking, he just had this energy.
*  And he came at me and then my leg was compromised from the leg kick because of my, the perineal nerve or whatever.
*  I couldn't do anything.
*  So yeah.
*  But look, I love that story for myself and I'm happy.
*  And people still go, oh, when you're the third one.
*  I'm like, look, I do it again.
*  I fucking knock him out.
*  Oh no, okay, no, it's three, two.
*  We got the best out of seven.
*  Right. I'm not fighting for anyone else.
*  I only have so much left in this game.
*  I'm not going to spend this game fighting.
*  One guy. Exactly.
*  Over and over and over again.
*  I don't know how long left, but I just know I'm definitely on the other side of my career.
*  So I want to get these fights out the way.
*  And now I'm not champ anymore in the UFC.
*  So I just get, I'm in this situation where what do I do?
*  I know I want to fight though, because I took 11 months off and I let my body heal and all that.
*  And I felt great.
*  So now I want to get back to being active.
*  Not as active as I was in the beginning, maybe, but I want to be active.
*  And I still feel great from the last camp.
*  Did some testing about three weeks ago.
*  Find out where we were at.
*  I was about where I was before this last fight, four weeks out.
*  So I said, okay, cool.
*  We're still good.
*  Let's build off that.
*  So yeah, I want to fight again.
*  How much of an effect did taking 11 months off have?
*  I think it was more good than bad.
*  I know some people say ring rust or this and that.
*  And I'm like, nah.
*  I felt good in there.
*  I felt good in there.
*  And it was only when I watched the fight back, I saw a couple of mistakes I made even on the feet where I was like, oh, don't do that again.
*  Just with my feet work, my exits.
*  Even David said you had sloppy exits.
*  I was like, yeah, my bad.
*  But yeah, that and then the moment at the end when I slipped and I just the lapse in judgment when I was just letting him go.
*  It was me tripping.
*  Those kind of moments.
*  Maybe if I was as active, it wouldn't happen.
*  But who knows?
*  We'll never know.
*  But I am happy with how I performed.
*  I was happy with the shape I came in.
*  I came in really good shape.
*  And what's his name?
*  Bill, this guy, he did the numbers for me.
*  He said this is the most active I've been in any fight by far in my UFC career.
*  He crunched the numbers up and said my strike per minute rate was like, oh, I'm going to be a fighter.
*  Strike per minute rate or whatever.
*  All you nerds figure it out.
*  You can do your own.
*  But yeah, he goes smart.
*  He's this guy who helps me now with my strength.
*  He did the numbers and said this is the most active you were.
*  So we can do some things different.
*  Put a little more gas in the tank, things like that, and then just stay active like that.
*  It was good.
*  And I had fun in there.
*  I had fun just exchanging.
*  I wanted to ask you about that, like the gas in the tank thing.
*  There's a philosophy that Marv Marinovich and Nick Kursan, some of these guys have.
*  BJ Pence coaches?
*  Yeah.
*  So what they wanted BJ to do when BJ was in his prime, essentially the camp was entirely based around strength and conditioning.
*  So it was all conditioning to give you this insane gas tank.
*  Their philosophy is you know how to fight.
*  You've been fighting your whole life.
*  You're not going to get better at fighting in six weeks.
*  But what you can get is insane cardio.
*  If you only concentrate on that and they don't their thought process is that is the most important thing.
*  That is the thing that fails you the most in fights.
*  That's the thing that keeps you from hitting the gas, keeps you from doing the things you want to do, keeps you from being able to scramble out of positions.
*  But if you can, instead of all this fight specific training, like put that aside and just give yourself the most fucking insane gas tank humanly possible and then fight.
*  And then the margins, the things, the times when you're going to need it.
*  Like your skill level is already elite world championship skill level.
*  It's not going to deteriorate because your cardio gets better in six to eight weeks.
*  But what you can do is give yourself this insane base of cardio.
*  So in those moments when you need to hit the gas, you can.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's what they did for BJ when BJ was at his best.
*  Yeah.
*  I think the best I saw BJ from watching him, especially live, he was training with them.
*  UFC 107, I think Diego Sanchez, he looked like a demon in that fight.
*  Exactly.
*  Unbelievable gas tank and insane confidence.
*  Even in shape, like he was fucking abs and all that.
*  I agree.
*  Definitely.
*  You can always sharpen the tools, keep it sharp.
*  But again, for when you're in a camp, it's just about getting fit.
*  And yeah, there's some things we can tweak so that way we can keep that output.
*  Because when you get fatigued is when you lose your lapse in judgment.
*  You could, your reflexes as well, things like that just start to go down.
*  Were you feeling fatigued in the last round with Trikas?
*  I don't think so.
*  There was one point in the third round when me and him, we really put it on and we kind of had this low key agreement like, okay, you're fucked, I'm fucked.
*  Let's chill for a little bit.
*  And then I think round four I came out like, cool, bam, bam, bam.
*  And I did that sprawl on them.
*  But again, he's so stubborn because I sprawled on him.
*  I literally, he's short, I sprawled and my hips hit the back of his head into the mat.
*  Might have rocked him, I don't know.
*  And then, what's his name, Mark Goddard's like, get up.
*  And he's on one knee.
*  And then when he was like, get up.
*  And he finally decided to get up slowly and I tried to attack him.
*  He just threw.
*  But not to try and hit me, he just threw just to stop my momentum, you know, stop me from coming at him.
*  And yeah, he's a guy that just strong will, strong will.
*  Like, yeah, I can respect that.
*  Physically strong too.
*  Yeah, not as strong as I thought it would be, probably because I felt strong as well.
*  Like, I packed on some muscle for that fight.
*  Preparing for those kind of grueling exchanges?
*  Yeah, but even just for me myself, I just wanted to feel strong.
*  So me and my boy AB, we put on some muscle for that fight.
*  And then having Matt actually making good food for me for the first time ever.
*  Because I got this far off just whatever I wanted to eat, you know, Uber Eats.
*  Yeah, we were talking about that when we went to Terry Black's Bar with you today.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the worst thing to eat right before a podcast.
*  It's like, oh.
*  It's like, I got the coffee now.
*  I'm like, yeah, let's go.
*  We're pegged out.
*  But honestly, for me, having those kind of, because I'm not 23 anymore, 24.
*  Right.
*  My body doesn't metabolize food and, you know, the way it used to.
*  So I have to think about it like Israel, be smart, understand your body's getting older.
*  No, I don't feel old though.
*  That's the thing.
*  When I was younger, I thought 34, I'm done with this game.
*  Then I'm like, I'm old.
*  But that was when I was 24.
*  But now that I'm here, I'm like, I can still squeeze a lot out of this.
*  I can still squeeze a lot out of this.
*  So we are.
*  And the whole thing.
*  Do you ever use a hyperbaric chamber?
*  Nah, not yet.
*  I don't know if we have that in Auckland.
*  Probably do.
*  I did a whole series when I first moved to Austin.
*  I did the whole series because there's this protocol.
*  I think it was an Israeli study that they did where they showed that it lengthens telomeres.
*  You do like 60 sessions over 90 days.
*  And you know, when they measure your biological age by the length of your telomeres, it puts 20 years on you.
*  It decreases your age of your telomeres.
*  It's still like the DNA strand or something.
*  Well, yeah, I don't want to fuck this up.
*  So what exactly are telomeres?
*  Lame in terms.
*  The way you measure someone's biological age is the length of the telomeres.
*  And through things like NMN.
*  Oh yeah, that thing.
*  Yeah.
*  I got it right.
*  Yeah, smart.
*  There it is.
*  Telomeres are protein and DNA structures at the ends of the chromosomes that perform several important functions, including protecting DNA, preserving chromosomal integrity.
*  Telomeres help maintain the structure integrity of DNA during replication.
*  It's the bit at the ends, right?
*  And as you get older, they get shorter and they get weaker.
*  And you know, so that's where I know this.
*  I think it's just a real I saw somewhere.
*  NAD shot.
*  When people get NAD infusions, that helps that as well.
*  I've been seeing that lately.
*  Yeah.
*  Bieber, the Kardashians getting them.
*  I get those.
*  Yeah.
*  But with Briggs.
*  You can do it.
*  Definitely do with Brigham.
*  I use another company.
*  I see.
*  But there's a lot of companies that do it.
*  OK.
*  Is it you saw it approved or is it one of them?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, it's you saw it approved.
*  I'll see you later on Briggs.
*  Yeah.
*  But the thing that does it just as well, maybe even better, is hyperbaric chambers.
*  And so hyperbaric chambers, you elevate it up to two, it's like two atmospheres.
*  So twice our atmosphere.
*  And then you have oxygen.
*  You wear an oxygen mask and you sit in it for an hour and a half.
*  OK.
*  And dude, you come out of that and you're just like, whoa, what the fuck is going on?
*  How often do you do it?
*  Every day for six weeks?
*  I've been doing it a lot lately.
*  OK.
*  Because I got one at the house.
*  So I've been doing it quite a bit.
*  But it's just a completely different way of recovering.
*  I found out about it for recovery when Uriah Faber fought Jose Aldo.
*  The leg?
*  Yes.
*  His leg was fucking brutalized.
*  I remember.
*  And I saw Uriah was always ahead of the game.
*  And he was using hyperbaric chambers to help him recover.
*  And so then I started looking into it.
*  And then I found out about this Israeli study.
*  And then I started seeing all the different ways that hyperbaric chambers can increase your recovery.
*  And TJ Dillshaw did a lot of that as well, I think.
*  But it makes a big impact.
*  They always do it like when you go down to CPI in Mexico, when they do stem cells.
*  They give people hyperbaric chamber treatments as well.
*  OK.
*  I'd have to look into that.
*  If I wanted to do it, I'd maybe do it, say, twice a week or something.
*  Yeah, something like that.
*  How long does the effect last for?
*  That's a good question.
*  I mean, it probably depends on the individual.
*  But it just makes...
*  Anytime I have something wrong with me, I get in there, I just feel just better.
*  I bet you someone knows, if they have one in Auckland now, they'll definitely hit me up and be like, hey.
*  I bet they do.
*  Yeah, I'd like to try that.
*  Yeah, I bet Auckland has it.
*  It's time consuming.
*  The whole experience is two hours.
*  Because it has to get up to pressure, then it has to decompress, and you're in there for 90 minutes.
*  So it's like 15 minutes getting up to pressure, and then 15 minutes of decompressing at the very end.
*  But that's a great way to recover as well.
*  I feel like every...
*  Especially as you get older, every edge you can get.
*  Sauna, cold plunge, hyperbaric, everything.
*  Every edge you can get.
*  Red light therapy, all that.
*  That's where I'm at now.
*  That's where I was this last camp.
*  And I feel like even the one before that, and the one before that, I just remember thinking, how can I...
*  It was actually Eugene who said, how can you make this camp better?
*  And I'll always find something to do to make this camp better, the next one.
*  So that's like the last three camps.
*  So this one, I took it with the whole having breakfast, having a chef help me actually cook.
*  That was crazy that you used to train with no breakfast.
*  That's so crazy.
*  So that was my way, I guess.
*  Then I found out about intermittent fasting, and I realized, oh, I've been doing that shit for years.
*  Right.
*  I guess, not by laziness or accident, but it actually helps though.
*  Like, wake up, have two eggs, or maybe he'll make sometimes something with chia seed.
*  But normally eggs and a bacon piece or something.
*  She needs something.
*  Yeah, something just to get the fuel.
*  Yeah.
*  And even Jordy from Fight Dietitian, he told me, yeah, you should definitely be having breakfast.
*  Because he thought you're crazy training the way you do train.
*  And some of my morning sessions as well will be grueling.
*  And then I'll go have breakfast.
*  But I enjoyed it that way because I felt like more.
*  One thing is when I fight, Fight Day, my buddy doesn't want to eat.
*  He'll make me like a nice plate of something delicious.
*  And my buddy's just like, nah.
*  So Fight Day, I still try and eat something, maybe at least an egg.
*  Because he'll have pancakes, eggs, whatever, bacon, an egg and a little bit of bacon.
*  But my buddy just doesn't want to eat.
*  But do you think if you force yourself to eat, that would be a good thing?
*  No.
*  No?
*  So I just, I think DC said the same thing as well one time.
*  He said he likes to fight hungry so that way he gets that edge.
*  And I feel that way when it's Fight Day.
*  But when it comes to training now, I definitely like to have breakfast.
*  I like the way it feels.
*  Like now I've done it for a few months.
*  I understand the benefits of a healthy breakfast before you have a grueling training session.
*  Yeah, it just gives you more gas.
*  Yeah, more energy.
*  Aljo said that when he fought Piotr Jan that he didn't eat.
*  First or second one?
*  First.
*  And he said he felt like shit.
*  Oh, the day of the fight?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, wow.
*  The time of the fight, I pushed back.
*  I forget exactly what the reasoning was or just forgot to eat or just wasn't feeling it because of the anxiety, fighting for the title, you know, the whole deal.
*  And he just felt it in the fight.
*  It just was where, and especially with a guy like Aljo who cuts so much weight.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, Aljo is so, he was so big for 35.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember running into him and he was like 176 pounds.
*  I was like, what the fuck?
*  How are you going to make 135?
*  He's so big.
*  He looks like that 145 at UFC 300.
*  Yeah, I like that for him.
*  I was bummed out that that Mosvar-Yvloev fight fell out because...
*  It was meant to be this weekend, right?
*  Yeah.
*  That's a very, Aljo is strong at 145.
*  Why did that fight fall out?
*  What happened?
*  Aljo got injured.
*  Oh, insane, insane.
*  Yeah.
*  He got injured and he thought he'd be able to work through it but couldn't.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's, you know, there's a point of diminishing returns with these weight cutting dudes.
*  And I think, you know...
*  There'll be something, like they've got the whole thing at one with the hydration clause.
*  But the thing is, no matter what, people are always going to try and find a way.
*  Yeah.
*  They're always going to try and find a way to sneak past the hydration test or something
*  that they can use to pass it.
*  But I don't know how that works.
*  I don't know how they test for it.
*  It's never happened to me.
*  But weight cutting, even when I started fighting, people used to tell me go down to 170 for
*  you guys.
*  Oh my God.
*  Hell no.
*  How the fuck can you make 170?
*  Back when I was skinny, before like I got really bralic, I was maybe, I could make maybe 80
*  kgs.
*  That's close to 170.
*  170, 70, 7 kgs.
*  But the lowest I ever got to was 80 as a kickboxer.
*  That was it.
*  Yeah, 170, I'd die.
*  I wouldn't even...
*  Because I've seen some of these weight cuts where guys...
*  Like Hamza.
*  Oh, bro.
*  Like when Hamza would make 170.
*  Or even Cyborg.
*  Oh yeah.
*  You see her when she was in the tub crying and shrieking.
*  And Olivera when they go and they huddle around them.
*  It's a way you cut weight though.
*  I'll say this thing.
*  For me when I cut weight, it's a spiritual experience sometimes.
*  It's a weird experience because I've, not just me, I've seen fighters who have not get
*  delirious but start saying things that they wouldn't normally say.
*  Not even in a bad way but just the way they talk.
*  Because you're close to death.
*  Yeah, you see the light.
*  Yeah, man.
*  It's like you really are close to death.
*  I mean it sounds ridiculous to say that.
*  And for someone who doesn't understand what fighters are going through, you'd go, oh you're
*  hyperbolic.
*  But not really.
*  Not really.
*  You really are close to death.
*  If you keep going for a few more hours, you'll die.
*  Yeah.
*  Especially, I mean, I've seen, my weight cuts are normally pretty tame.
*  Not as bad because I think I'm perfect for 185.
*  But the ones that I've seen guys lose a lot of weight the day off and I see them how they
*  are.
*  And even when they go to the scale, you see their face just.
*  Yeah, you never look too destroyed.
*  I always come in underweight as well.
*  I always come in.
*  What do you normally weigh the week of a fight?
*  Week of a fight?
*  If I get to the fight location, say, if I'm say 198, 200.
*  Oh, that's not that bad.
*  Yeah, that's easy for me.
*  I'm like cool, that's normally where I'm at.
*  That's just a few hard sauna sessions.
*  Yeah, just the water loading.
*  And then it's like my body knows.
*  It's weird how my body does it.
*  My body is just like, it just knows, okay we're getting on the plane.
*  You've done it before.
*  It just knows.
*  It's just like muscle memory.
*  And I get to the fight location, my body is like cool, we're doing this.
*  And then the weight just starts to go.
*  Did you notice a difference when they didn't allow IVs versus when they did allow IVs?
*  I never used it.
*  You never used it?
*  I never used IVs.
*  That's the thing.
*  So you never cut weight enough where you were so depleted that you needed to get those bags
*  in you?
*  Nah, fuck out I like to.
*  They say that's the best way to rehydrate the brain.
*  Yeah, because it takes how many hours if you do it orally.
*  It takes a long time.
*  Yeah, to get to the brain.
*  Which affects your chin.
*  You're trying to protect your fucking noggin slushing around in your cream.
*  Yeah.
*  Because what is it, cerebral fluid?
*  It's made of, well I'm guessing a lot of water, right?
*  There's a lot of water in there.
*  Yeah, and the rehydration of the brain apparently is the slowest because of the blood brain
*  barrier.
*  That's the slowest.
*  Your body, your muscles rehydrate fairly quickly.
*  But still, it just never makes sense to me that a person is literally on the verge of
*  death 24 hours before a cage fight.
*  Let's go battle to the death.
*  And then you get head kicked in the fucking chin.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean look, I do love this game and I think weight cuts is always going to be a part of
*  it right now.
*  But who knows, because even now we have height differentials.
*  Are we going to start discriminating against that?
*  Okay, we only have height classes.
*  Is that the next?
*  No, that doesn't make any sense because you've got guys like DC that even though he was not
*  even barely six feet tall, he was a heavyweight champion, but he's a tank.
*  And these are the wrestling skills.
*  I think that the way to do it really is to have more weight classes.
*  I think when you have the big gaps, like 85 to 205 is 20 pounds.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's such a big ass gap.
*  And then 205, if you want to start fighting heavyweight and then you're dealing with guys
*  like Francis, who's a natural 265, that's such a gap.
*  They should have the ones in between.
*  Okay, let's take it.
*  10 pounds.
*  165, 170, 175, 180, like that.
*  They could do that, but I think that's maybe a little too much.
*  I think 10 pounds.
*  Yeah.
*  10 pounds is reasonable.
*  Yeah.
*  All the way up the board.
*  175, 165.
*  25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95, 205, and then maybe 225 and then heavyweight.
*  Super heavyweight.
*  The whole thing of 265 being a limit for heavyweight to me is crazy too.
*  Silly, because there's bigger boys out there.
*  Right.
*  Mark Hunt used to cut down to 265.
*  Yeah.
*  Crazy.
*  Even Francis did as well.
*  Yeah, if they did, I mean, they can just ... I think they talked about doing it.
*  They talked about doing it recently.
*  Maybe last year, I think.
*  They talked about adding more weight classes, but then I never heard anything about it again.
*  I know California was flirting with it.
*  Okay, maybe that's what I saw.
*  They should have it everywhere.
*  There's too many gaps.
*  They're too wide.
*  There's too many tweeners.
*  Yeah.
*  Too many guys that are too small to fight at 170, but they really can't make 55 healthy.
*  At least they took this shit out.
*  Yeah.
*  Finally.
*  Finally.
*  Finally.
*  Look, I always thought that that's a group chat decision.
*  Just say, yo, this is a dumb rule.
*  Let's take it out.
*  Boom.
*  But why does it take so long?
*  Is it because the commission all over the United States or whatever have to get together
*  or something?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't understand how it takes.
*  That seems like a common sense rule, and especially anybody who understands the power of elbows.
*  This is not the most powerful elbow.
*  It's just not.
*  And so to deny that and to say that somehow or another that can't be blocked, well, that's
*  crazy.
*  You could do that just as easy as you could do that.
*  You could block that elbow.
*  Facts.
*  None of it makes any sense.
*  There's a bunch of things that are unrealistic, in my opinion.
*  One of them is not being able to up kick from a downward position when a guy's on top of
*  you.
*  So if a guy's on top of you and you're on your back and the guy has a knee down, you
*  can't up kick.
*  Oh, yeah, that's silly.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I get what you mean.
*  That's silly.
*  That doesn't make any sense.
*  I think you should be able to up kick when you are flat on your back and he's on his
*  knees.
*  Yeah.
*  Because that's a real technique.
*  If you have rubber guard, like flexible hips or whatever, you can just bring your leg and
*  boom.
*  Yeah.
*  Anderson did that to someone.
*  Who did you do that to?
*  What's his name?
*  Yushin Okami, I think.
*  Did he?
*  Yeah, he got disqualified and not in the UFC.
*  Oh, was that in Rumble in the Rock?
*  Rumble, the Yellow Cage.
*  So that was a good knockout.
*  But then they disqualified him.
*  Yeah.
*  That technique, like if you are in a guy's guard and that guy can elbow you in the face,
*  punch you in the face, why can't he kick you in the face?
*  He should be able to lean back and up kick you and it would make the guard way more effective.
*  Dangerous.
*  And it's also more real.
*  Here it is.
*  This one, yeah.
*  Boom.
*  Oh, shit.
*  That was a good knockout.
*  That's a beautiful knockout.
*  That should be 100% legal.
*  Look at the hip dexterity.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at it like the way he just brought that back.
*  Boom.
*  Oh, like an axe kick.
*  Yeah.
*  Like an axe kick from the outside.
*  Yeah, you know what?
*  You're right.
*  That's 100% a good technique.
*  It should be legal and you should be avoiding that if you're on top.
*  Top is an advantageous position.
*  I think the guy that can do on bottom that is real for like a real fight should be allowed.
*  Yeah.
*  It's not like you're cemented in this position.
*  No.
*  Like the idea of like not allowing soccer kicks to a downed opponent.
*  Yeah.
*  What I think about that is the cage.
*  I think if you're pressed up against a cage and someone can stomp you or soccer kick you,
*  there's no way to move.
*  Yeah, true.
*  But if you're in an open space and there's a place to move, all those things should be
*  legal because all those things are real techniques.
*  Facts.
*  But especially if a guy's on top of you.
*  If a guy's on top of you on his knees in your guard and you can get a leg back and stomp
*  him in the face, that's good.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a real technique that should be 100% legal.
*  The one I like, soccer kicks, it just looks cool.
*  But again, if you have someone pinned against the cage and they're even eating them, and
*  was it one, they go, okay.
*  Yes.
*  They allow it.
*  I don't even know what the discretion of the referee is to allow it.
*  I think it's if they're pinned against the cage.
*  Then he doesn't allow it.
*  Exactly.
*  Which makes sense.
*  If you're in the open space, then it's like soccer kicks go.
*  Did you ever see the one where Roger Huerta fought in one and got one of the worst soccer
*  kick KOs ever?
*  Maybe, but I've forgotten it.
*  He fought some big Brazilian cat and this dude soccer kicked him and it was like, oh
*  my God.
*  Like in the open space?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh yeah.
*  He had him rocked already and then he's down like this and this dude just leans back.
*  I think the thing as well is the look of it for I guess the people who aren't really hardcore
*  fans, if they see that they're like, oh, then it goes back to human cock fighting.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  But if that's true, how about Arania Aldana when she fought at the sphere, her whole face
*  is cut open.
*  Oh, that was crazy.
*  Insane.
*  They didn't stop the fight.
*  Tough though.
*  So tough.
*  Yeah.
*  But so here's the Roger Huerta one.
*  So Roger's hurt and Roger shouldn't have been fighting at 170 anyway.
*  And watch this.
*  Oh no.
*  Boom.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I mean that one.
*  I have seen this.
*  That one can fucking kill you.
*  That one can kill you.
*  I mean that dude had everything in that kick.
*  Yeah.
*  He even held it for a little bit.
*  Just really line it up.
*  Full fucking goal.
*  Oh, that's a rough one.
*  That is bad.
*  That's a rough one.
*  But that's a real technique.
*  Legal.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean you can do it in real life.
*  Yes.
*  That's the point.
*  It's the sport of fighting.
*  And if it's a sport of fighting and you can't up kick a guy when you're in your guard because
*  his knee's on the ground, that's ridiculous.
*  Yeah.
*  And you've actually, was it maybe you at this fair you mentioned it with the Marabafite.
*  They stood them up somewhere at the end and I was thinking like, yeah, why they stand
*  them up?
*  Made no sense.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I think so.
*  Yeah.
*  I think Herb was alluding to they want more action.
*  I don't know if he's getting pressure from someone to have more action but one of the
*  things that Herb said was if someone wants it, I think he was alluding to like some specific
*  officials and executives, whoever.
*  He's like, if they wanted to look different, I wish they would tell me because like this
*  is-
*  Oh wait, Herb's saying this to you.
*  Oh really?
*  No, no, no, not to me.
*  He said it in an interview when he was being criticized for trying to get people to work
*  and trying to stand people up.
*  So let me get this straight.
*  He's saying maybe some officials or someone would be alluding-
*  He's alluding to the fact that they want it to look a specific way.
*  I think I pick up what you're putting down.
*  You see if you can find his statement on it because it was interesting the way he phrased
*  it.
*  The way he phrased it-
*  Like cryptic?
*  Yes.
*  Okay.
*  He's trying not to put someone under the bus but he's saying like, look, maybe someone's
*  saying to him that-
*  Exactly.
*  I think they are because he's always like, let's work, let's work.
*  Sometimes when it doesn't even make any sense, like they're working.
*  I saw, I remember and I was like, yeah, he's on top.
*  He just got him down.
*  He's actually trying to beat him up.
*  Sean was defending well but still saying, ah, true.
*  That'd be interesting though.
*  That would, that's, when I say interesting, that's like shady.
*  Yeah, it's shady.
*  But it's what we were talking about at lunch today too is that there are certain fighters
*  they want to win because those fighters are more exciting.
*  And I'm a purist.
*  I feel like there should be no standups.
*  Unless there's a violation, unless someone does something illegal, there should be no
*  standups.
*  If a guy can take you down like Marab does and just beat you up and you can't do shit
*  and even if the audience is booing, that's the fight.
*  Sean wants to get up.
*  He's got to get up.
*  I don't think it should be, you can just hold him on and you're full guard and the referee
*  just stands you up.
*  Because that's such an advantage for the striker.
*  Yeah, a big time.
*  To be standing up again.
*  And you already have an advantage of every round, start standing up.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you work so hard to get something to the ground and then they go, okay, standup.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm trying to think, have I ever been in the position that they made me stand up?
*  No, not on top.
*  But even on the bottom, I always get up.
*  I find a way.
*  That's the ego thing.
*  Because again, look, I had to kill that to really be great at this game because I knew
*  for a fact I couldn't beat some nerds in pajamas.
*  So that was for me my, okay, humble yourself and learn how to grapple.
*  And then I sucked at first and I got better.
*  I never have shown too much of my grappling skills because they never really put me in
*  the position to show as much as I need to.
*  So for me, I was just like, cool, I'll just fucking do it.
*  Derrick Lewis, stand up, get up and just beat him up as much as I can.
*  But yeah, fuck.
*  That is suspect if someone is, I actually want to watch that.
*  I'll watch it later on.
*  Let's see what the statement is.
*  Did you find it?
*  So far I've only found it.
*  Luke Thomas made a video and he said Herb called him after he made the video.
*  Interesting.
*  Luke Thomas, who's that again?
*  Luke Thomas, the journalist.
*  Okay.
*  MMA journalist.
*  They spoke for 30, I'm reading the closed captioning because I can't listen to it.
*  He said those instances, I'll just play this.
*  This might be it.
*  I don't know if you saw Herb.
*  Oh, Luke.
*  Oh, my bad.
*  Of Herb.
*  Ultimately his opinion, but not limited to those instances where he had called for more
*  work from Merab.
*  What I cannot do today is speak on behalf of Herb.
*  Ultimately, his opinions and beliefs are his own and they are his to tell whenever he elects
*  to do so.
*  What I can do is speak on behalf of my views.
*  That's not it.
*  There was an article where they had interviewed him.
*  A statement from him.
*  Yes.
*  It was a statement from Herb himself and he was saying, if someone wants the fights to
*  look different, I wish they would tell me.
*  Damn, that's suspect.
*  Yes.
*  You found it?
*  That's a way, again, that's cryptic.
*  Cryptic.
*  That means they're telling you, I want more action.
*  Okay, here it goes.
*  I've seen on social media, people have spoken about me calling the fighters for more action.
*  That's what I've always done.
*  I can tell you what I tell fighters during the rules briefing.
*  I tell them anytime I'm going to interfere or any intervention, I'm going to talk to
*  you first.
*  Like if I'm going to stand you up, what I'm going to say first is I'm going to say, let's
*  work.
*  I usually clap at what I'm expecting from him is not busy.
*  And what I'm expecting from him is not busy work.
*  I specify I'm looking for effort to finish the fight.
*  So either you posture to where you can set up, fight any attacks or advance your position,
*  effort to advance, because it's not as easy as just passing the guard, but effort to pass,
*  effort to advance your position, effort to bring the fight to finish.
*  That rule was put in place, standing fighters up to make our sport look the way we want
*  it to look.
*  But he said something else.
*  It was more-
*  If he goes as a referee, blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  But I mean, if that's what he said, I trust your recollection of it, but if that's what
*  he said, that's still very suspect.
*  You don't want to get this game.
*  This is one thing about the UFC, it's as real as it gets, or MMA itself.
*  This is what it is.
*  But if you have that happening, then that's starting to seem a little bit like, you know,
*  not to take away, like it's the WWE or anything.
*  It's not that, but you are influencing the course of a fight where a guy has control.
*  And where a fighter-
*  And the referee is the guy officiating the fight.
*  So if he's getting word from someone, the way he said that, someone, that's-
*  I think he was saying, if someone wants me to, if they want the fight to look different,
*  I wish they would tell me.
*  But that's what I'm saying.
*  When he says someone, it's like, who is he?
*  Who is that someone?
*  I don't think the referee's job is to instruct a fighter to do anything other than follow
*  the rules.
*  And if you can hold a guy down, I feel- I'm the worst with this, because I think you should
*  start in the same position you ended the last round, because I think it's one fight.
*  I think it's one fight, it's not five fights.
*  So if a- an advantage for the striker is always standing up.
*  So if a guy gets you down and has your back and the round ends, I think he should have
*  the exact same position and the exact same place on the octagon floor when the next round
*  starts.
*  Because he earned that position, and you didn't earn the stand-up.
*  So if you're standing up, standing up for a guy like you is a giant advantage.
*  Yeah, I'm like, I'm biased.
*  I wouldn't be like, nah, fuck that.
*  That's-
*  Yeah, of course.
*  Well, also the audience would be biased.
*  The audience would be like, shut the fuck up, bro.
*  You know, you fucking pussy little shit.
*  It does make sense when it comes to pure fighting, because even- bro, even- Pride had 10 minute
*  rounds the first round.
*  That's cool.
*  I'm saying, look, some things, like I'm glad this, they've taken out the way, but again,
*  bring back tournaments just for one night.
*  Let's see who's a real badass.
*  Yeah, that would be crazy.
*  I've done a kickboxing, I've never done it in MMA, I've done it in boxing.
*  But I might bring back a tournament, so let's see who's really about this, because you have
*  the adrenaline dump, and you go back and sit down, sit down for ages, and then eventually
*  have to warm up again.
*  I remember that.
*  I've done it a few times.
*  I've won a few of them.
*  But it shows this.
*  Yeah.
*  Like this.
*  Well, it's also built in drama over the evening, where people watch a guy fight once, and now
*  he's going to fight a second time.
*  And that was always wild about the early days of the UFC, watching those tournaments.
*  And Pride as well.
*  I did that a lot.
*  But yeah, that'd be fun.
*  It would be.
*  I think it would be for like, oh, they did it once though.
*  Glory did it, remember Last Man Standing?
*  That was crazy.
*  They fought three times that night.
*  Yeah, they did it.
*  The UFC did it once with the flyweight, the inaugural flyweight title.
*  And I think it was Mighty Mouse and Ian McCall in the final.
*  No, no, I got it wrong.
*  They fucked up the decision, because if there was meant to be a draw, and they'd have one
*  more round, and Sydney, I think.
*  Yeah.
*  They were meant to, but then they fucked up the decision.
*  But that would be crazy though.
*  They'd go like, okay, cool.
*  The judges have it this, that.
*  It's a draw.
*  We're going to one more round after a crazy fight like that.
*  That would have had the whole place just go boom.
*  Well, that's what Glory does.
*  Yeah.
*  One more round.
*  And you see the look on the guy's face like, oh, fuck.
*  Yeah, I've had that too.
*  But that's where this comes in.
*  Yeah.
*  You have to just like, cool, let's go.
*  Get back in the corner.
*  Is that one of the most difficult things to change your mindset in mid-fight, like if
*  something throws you off?
*  Mid-fight.
*  Ooh.
*  Do you remember, what I'm bringing up specifically, is you remember Tim Kennedy and Yoel Romero?
*  Oh, get up, get up.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, stool gate, stool gate.
*  Yeah.
*  Tim Kennedy had Yoel Romero fucked up, fucked up.
*  And then they put Yoel on the stool.
*  They threw ice on the floor.
*  They fucking, and he kept sitting on the stool.
*  And Big John's telling him to stand up, and he's still sitting down.
*  And Tim Kennedy's walking around going, what the fuck?
*  This fight should be stopped.
*  Fight's over.
*  Yeah.
*  The fight should have been stopped.
*  But then Yoel got up and then he stopped him afterwards.
*  But he had like a good solid 35 seconds extra recovery time, which when you're hurt is huge.
*  Yeah, ice on the floor as well.
*  Tim said it fucked with his head.
*  And it was his mental weakness that he didn't, he thought, he was angry.
*  They're robbing me.
*  This is bullshit.
*  I had him.
*  I should have won.
*  The fight should have been, the round started.
*  The minute was up.
*  It should have been, I could have got on him and I could have finished him.
*  And so in his head, he lost focus.
*  It does happen.
*  Like I said, even with me pointing at the ground in that moment, any small lapse in judgment,
*  you just need 30 minutes or 25 minutes of focus.
*  So in that point, yeah, I can see how that would get to him.
*  Yeah, that would get to him because you're like, what the fuck?
*  They're about to screw me out of this one.
*  Exactly.
*  And they did.
*  And so then he's got to fight again while he's going, motherfucker, this shit already
*  been over.
*  Instead of concentrating completely on being in the present, in the fight, you think I
*  got fucked.
*  Anderson versus Bisping when Anderson 31 was on the case celebrating.
*  And then if, I think it was Herb or whoever, you're like, yo, get down here, this and that,
*  right, right, right.
*  Then you have to be like.
*  Which could have been over if Anderson just followed up with one or two more shots, that
*  would have been it.
*  It's like we were talking about Jalen Turner and Hinato Mokano.
*  He drops him, has him fucked up and then walks away like it's a KO.
*  I literally went like, cause I was front, I went to 300.
*  I'm such a fan.
*  I was there from the first fight.
*  That's why I like to wear that as a badge on.
*  I'm like, yeah, I was there and I watched that and I was just like, why?
*  He had eight more seconds.
*  He could have just done something and taken him out.
*  Hinato was fucked up too.
*  He was hurt bad.
*  Yeah.
*  And Jalen can crack.
*  He's tough.
*  Oh, he's so big for 55 and so long.
*  I think he's also really talented as well.
*  He's fast.
*  He's smooth.
*  Like when he fought Dan, you heard that shit.
*  I heard that and Dan grabbed his waist and then Dan had his neck at the end of the round
*  as well.
*  I lost my voice.
*  That's the one where Dan broke his arm, right?
*  Yeah, just a scratch.
*  He did as a savage.
*  Trust me.
*  I love watching him come back into the top five now.
*  I love it.
*  I love that he did that.
*  I love it.
*  I love who he is as a person because look, Dan, I see him every day most days and he's
*  a guy that you don't know what to expect.
*  I don't know where, boom, he just customized himself with all these tattoos.
*  Yeah, crazy.
*  I was like, that's badass.
*  Yeah, he just covered himself.
*  I think he's in Spain because do you know Oscar Willis, the Mac Life reporter, he's
*  fighting Bear Knuckle this weekend, I believe, or maybe next weekend in Spain, but Dan's
*  going to go there and corner him.
*  I'm like, fucking.
*  Bear Knuckle boxing or MMA?
*  No, boxing.
*  That's not for me.
*  I can fight.
*  If I have to get into a fight, whatever, sure.
*  But for me, I'd rather not.
*  I'll pass on that.
*  But that's the kind of shit that Dan loves.
*  Dan's like, yeah, let's do that shit.
*  He wants to do that shit.
*  He wants to be the, yeah.
*  He just loves fighting.
*  Well, Mas Vidal's got that whole MMA league where it's all Bear Knuckle, MMA, which I
*  like because it doesn't make sense to me that you don't cover your shins or your knees
*  or your elbows, but you do cover your knuckles.
*  I just don't like the knuckles because you see, the moose knuckles still there.
*  Moose can cause more damage, like cuts.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh yeah.
*  It slices you open.
*  Exactly.
*  Guys get sliced up.
*  So if gloves, I guess they protect, the new gloves as well.
*  I think I've only fought once in a new gloves now.
*  I might give it maybe one or two more, but I'm like, the old gloves just, they didn't
*  really protect, the wraps protect your hands, but the old gloves, they felt like rubber,
*  like tire rubber.
*  And I think they were just dangerous, like dangerous to hit with.
*  If you hit someone with those, it's like bang.
*  These new gloves, they feel like a little bit of a memory foam.
*  A little softer.
*  Softer.
*  And I don't know about this whole curve thing.
*  They don't really curve.
*  I can still do that.
*  And then I try not to do that.
*  I'm a, you know, whatever, but still this, I'll wait and see.
*  Bro, listen, man, the best gloves for sure are Trevor Whitman's.
*  Yeah.
*  The best gloves.
*  They're the best MMA gloves of all time.
*  I've never seen them.
*  Yeah.
*  I've got.
*  See if you can pull them up.
*  The Onyx?
*  Is that the Onyx one?
*  Yeah.
*  I've got the big ones, but I've never ever had.
*  They are the best MMA gloves.
*  Yeah.
*  They curve.
*  So it's curved.
*  So your hand is in this position.
*  So if you want to do this, you have to open them up, but it's still, you could do that
*  for grappling.
*  It's all the same, but they're in a curved position.
*  And I think that would avoid so many eye pokes.
*  So many.
*  So many.
*  You haven't really been eye poked too many times.
*  Nah.
*  Only time was in training.
*  Really bad one was in training.
*  Not in a fight.
*  Nah.
*  Avoid that as much as I can.
*  I have another thought on that, tell me what you think of this.
*  I feel like they should cover the fingers.
*  I feel like why with like a mitt that goes over the top with like a round surface.
*  Like a boxing mitt.
*  Like a little something soft.
*  Yeah, like those little back glove mitts.
*  Like that's Trevor Whitman's.
*  Okay.
*  That's the Onyx gloves.
*  Those are the best gloves.
*  Trevor Whitman's a fucking genius, man.
*  He makes incredible gear.
*  Has he ever brought this idea to the UFC?
*  Yeah, they were in negotiation, but I think Trevor went crazy and wanted like some ungodly
*  amount of money.
*  He wanted something, according to Dana, at least that's his version.
*  Okay, two sides to the story.
*  But regardless of all that, he makes the best gloves.
*  They're the best MMA gloves of all time.
*  By bar none.
*  They're the best.
*  Yeah, I've got the big ones, but I'll hit them up, see if I can get those ones.
*  Just to try them out.
*  It's also the best foam.
*  Like he uses the most high tech foams, the most expensive foam.
*  And he makes them all by hand.
*  Like Trevor stitches them together.
*  Yeah, I've seen him stitching them.
*  He's passionate about it.
*  But yeah, these new ones, so far, at fighting with them, I still prefer the old ones.
*  You think they're more damaging?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  They are.
*  They feel like...
*  I get it.
*  I don't like to get hit, so maybe that's why I'm biased with it.
*  But when I hit someone with those, I feel it causes more damage.
*  And I mean, I can't cause damage.
*  I've caused some damage on DDP with those ones, but I still want to try them maybe one more
*  time just to feel them.
*  But yeah.
*  They felt different.
*  Yeah, felt different.
*  I can definitely tell.
*  Even the wraps.
*  When I was squeezing my wraps into them, I was like, okay.
*  Just took a while, but I still got it.
*  But I'm like, all right, cool, grab.
*  I like to test the grip strength, make sure I can hold someone.
*  But yeah, we'll see.
*  I don't know why the fingers have to be exposed.
*  Because you never do this.
*  There's no reason to have the fingers ever in this position.
*  Every time you grip, you're gripping like this.
*  Or you're gripping like this.
*  Also, it would prevent joint manipulation.
*  Yeah.
*  Small joint manipulation.
*  It's almost like a webbing.
*  Yeah.
*  That just covers that.
*  Why can't you just have a thin piece of leather that goes over the fingers and then something
*  that's curved around the top?
*  Like you said, like those bag mitts with the thumb out.
*  Yes.
*  So even if you do get poked in the eye, you're getting poked by a large thing instead of
*  a finger.
*  It goes all the way into your eye and fingernails.
*  Yeah.
*  So the nails would be covered.
*  Even if you trim your fucking nails, that's still a hard surface that could scratch the
*  shit out of your cornea.
*  Then you got toes.
*  I've seen people get kicked in the eye, even in training, and infected the eye as well.
*  Oh yeah, man.
*  Yeah, I've seen that.
*  Toe nails.
*  But nah, I mean, that makes sense.
*  I think people are scared of change.
*  Even with these new gloves.
*  I think that's why I'm trying to be like, let me give it one more shot.
*  I'm not going to say I'm against them.
*  I just feel, the other gloves were just, they had that thing on them.
*  Well, Mike Wendell John, he lost an eye.
*  Oh, that's why he wears the shades.
*  Exactly.
*  From holding pads from somebody.
*  So he was holding pads and someone missed and caught his eye with their toenail.
*  I'd do that too, if that happened to me.
*  PTSD.
*  Fuck, man.
*  I think everybody should wear goggles if you're holding mitts.
*  Just a possibility.
*  Just so we know that it happened to one of the top trainers in the sport.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it's a freak accident.
*  Even just grappling, I try and keep my nails trimmed.
*  Just because I've done it before by accident on someone and I've caused, I think I had
*  a collar tie and then they did something and then, and I got, not on me, on them.
*  It's happened to me as well.
*  But I felt bad when I did it on a person.
*  I had their skin in my nails and I was like, yeah, my bad.
*  So again, yeah, cut your nails.
*  But still, that's not a bad idea.
*  I would fuck with that.
*  I feel like it wouldn't affect the grappling at all.
*  It definitely would help eye pokes, which are the biggest problem.
*  Eye pokes are a giant problem, man.
*  So many guys have gotten eye surgery now.
*  I mean, Bilal's had three eye surgeries.
*  And remember when he got poked real bad against Leon?
*  Oh wait, he did.
*  Oh no, the Leon one.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck, yeah, I can imagine.
*  You can change the culture.
*  I feel like it should be done.
*  Because I don't think it's bad.
*  I don't see any negative to cover in the fingers and I see only positives.
*  And I don't think it would do, it's just real simple.
*  Piece of leather here.
*  I get you.
*  Measure the fighter's hands.
*  Some guys have very long fingers, some guys have short fingers.
*  Measure the fighter's hands, build a custom glove.
*  That's not hard to do.
*  Same thing like having glove size.
*  I'm sure someone will make it now.
*  Has someone made that before?
*  I don't think so.
*  I don't know of anybody that's made that, but that should be the way they do it.
*  Because that would eliminate an enormous number of eye pokes.
*  That's a money making scheme right now.
*  If someone decides to make that and then put it out there as a prototype, you're like,
*  look, this actually works.
*  Train with them and then they go, I'm patenting that.
*  Boom.
*  I'm a minimalist, I mean, because I have all kinds of crazy ideas.
*  I'm like, get rid of weight cutting, add more weight classes, change the gloves.
*  No stand ups.
*  Yeah, fair enough.
*  Because also, I'm not interested in making the fight more exciting.
*  I'm interested in what's the best.
*  What actually works.
*  I'm a purist.
*  I want to see what is the actual effective technique.
*  There's sometimes when you see in Jiu Jitsu tournaments where guys are doing something
*  like they're in a 50-50 position.
*  This guy could punch you in the face, kick you in the face so easy.
*  This is not a good self-defense position.
*  And you see it in MMA where guys are accustomed to doing that and they're literally face down,
*  holding onto an ankle and the dude just boom, boom.
*  One of my boys, Nate Law, he just fought in his, I think, third pro fight.
*  The guy had a leg lock and Nate posted this quote from Chilson and after the fight about
*  If a guy is holding onto your leg, just posture up and punch him in the face.
*  That's what Nate did and won the fight.
*  So yeah, I mean, the whole leg lock game, I know some stuff with X-Guard and whatnot,
*  but I don't really fuck with it too much because I get scared because the commitment when I
*  hold onto someone's leg and then you're just exposed.
*  Unless I'm like a Craig Jones type who I just know.
*  As a wizard.
*  Yeah.
*  The thing about leg locks is you have so little time to react.
*  If you don't tap, there's such a brief, especially like an inside heel hook, there's such a
*  brief amount of time you have before your shit is just blowing up smithereens.
*  It's just fine, this is fine, this is fine, and it's gone.
*  Rips apart and then you're fucked for nine months.
*  Even me, if I'm rolling with people, if I don't trust that person or if I just feel
*  like, oh, just go, yeah, cool, tap because ego's not worth it.
*  I don't try and hold onto shit like that.
*  Especially leg locks.
*  Do you have a hard time like that with people trying to get a name for themselves training
*  with you?
*  Of course.
*  So that's for me, it's not even, if I go to a new gym, I pick and choose who I go with
*  and it's not like an ego thing because I don't want to get my ass whooped.
*  It's just like, I don't know you well enough that.
*  Right.
*  And sometimes you see people, they salivate like, oh, this is my chance.
*  This is my, I got my shot now.
*  But now sometimes in grappling with some people in the jujitsu class, they'll just, lower
*  belts, they'll be like, I'm good, thank you.
*  You know what I don't like when I see a dude sitting out around and waiting while you're
*  exhausted and then they go, do you want to go?
*  Like, bitch, I watched you, I'll call him out.
*  I watched you just sit down for 10 fucking minutes.
*  Oh, you'd get that as well too.
*  Why didn't you just jump in?
*  Why weren't you just rolling right now?
*  You want to roll fresh?
*  Is that what this is?
*  And you like call him out and you see the look in his face.
*  Oh shit, yeah.
*  I just go, nah, I'm good, thank you.
*  And I'll get someone that I actually trust because yeah, it's not, it's just, I know
*  the feeling as well because I'm sure that someone will tap me or do something or I'll
*  just let go.
*  And then it's like that.
*  I know when it's real and it's genuine, like good job.
*  And I know the one when it's like, they're like, yeah, I'm going to tell everyone about
*  this.
*  Can't wait to get online.
*  Yeah, here we go.
*  But again, that's the thing when I talk about ego and I had to kill that before I started
*  training grappling because it was just, I sucked.
*  Like nah, I get taps.
*  One thing I definitely will get is a submission in the UFC before I'm done.
*  I will choke someone out like a guillotine or a red naked.
*  I like guillotines, but I've, it's learning how to find the sweet spot for me.
*  The sweet spot when I get it.
*  And when I get it, it's not even a bulldog choke.
*  I get really good at those.
*  Some I can find the spot and I just, cause I got the frame for it.
*  The best person at our gym, Dan, hang man.
*  That's his shit.
*  He grabs your neck.
*  You're going like, it's like, yep, find a way out.
*  You can't cool tap.
*  Yeah, I like using guillotines though, especially on wrestlers because yeah, it just lets them
*  know, okay, this is always a threat.
*  This is always a threat.
*  But again, it's something I've been working on, but eventually before I retire, you'll
*  definitely see me get a submission.
*  Well, it's interesting because you're a specialist.
*  You know, you're one of those guys that like, you didn't come in with a full MMA experience.
*  You didn't start as an amateur MMA fighter.
*  You were a kickboxer.
*  And so you, I remember when you and I first started talking online, I reached out to you
*  on Instagram and you were like, I'm going to wait a little while.
*  I'm going to just do this right.
*  Which is, I thought was very intelligent because you could have just jumped in like many guys
*  do and then they get, UFC throws you in with a wrestler.
*  You get exposed and now you're so far behind the curve.
*  It takes a long time to build up your confidence and your momentum again because you got smothered
*  in your first fight.
*  Yeah, that was 2015 I believe.
*  I haven't sent a DM to Dana saying, just give me one shot.
*  Just get me to the cage.
*  I'll do the rest.
*  Look, I would have, but I'm glad I took my time and it was good for me just to fight
*  different people from Ukraine, China, Brazil, all different types of places and then experience
*  different styles.
*  And that way I felt confident enough when I got to the UFC, my first fight, shout out
*  Rob Wilkinson, good guy, good friend of mine now.
*  And yeah, he tried to take me down constantly and I was able to withstand that because of
*  the work we did.
*  Andre Paulette, my wrestling coach, a lot of drills, just drills, wall work constantly.
*  What year did you start that?
*  What year did you start grappling training?
*  I started in 2010, but I was meant to go into MMA straight away, but there was just so many
*  kickboxing fights and I kept on getting kickboxing fights that I was just too, also I like fighting
*  kickboxing.
*  So I was just like, I'll just take this fight, take this fight.
*  But I was always grappling on the side, like low key grappling on the side.
*  And eventually I think, I can't remember what year my first MMA fight was.
*  It would have been 2014 maybe or 2013 and then I started taking it more seriously.
*  Like I'm a purple belt now, but I'm like, I'm a purple belt.
*  I know I'm dangerous, but it's like, I'm not like, there's levels, there's levels to belts.
*  There's some purple belts, blue belts who can kick my ass.
*  But yeah, I do enjoy it though.
*  I love grappling.
*  I feel like a ninja cat when I'm grappling and I'm on that flow state.
*  I just feel like I just, it's fun to play with.
*  But then again, I've only ever shown cases of brief, like again, who's one?
*  Not just the Pereira fight, Madison Square Garden, Gastelum, I had a triangle on them.
*  Tavares, I had a guillotine at the end of the round, some other ones with the Kimura
*  traps.
*  But yeah, just no one's really put me in that position to make me have to really use my
*  offensive grappling.
*  But again, when I get taken to the ground, I'm just like, fuck, I'm just going to stand
*  up.
*  If kickboxing was as big as MMA, do you think you have ever done MMA?
*  That's a good question.
*  Fuck, if, okay, money wise, probably ego.
*  Because I just knew a fucking nerd in pajamas could kick my ass.
*  I can't have that.
*  Honestly, it's just, I just know like some dude can beat me and he doesn't have to even
*  throw a punch.
*  In the back of my mind, it's still, that's why sometimes when all these, you know, boxers,
*  you know, like, like back in the day when it was USC versus boxing or whatever, I was
*  like, well, this is real fighting.
*  Like you want to see what the baddest person on the planet is?
*  Fight.
*  Right.
*  No one's telling you, you can't use your weapons, but you want to take away all my weapons.
*  That's why I don't think I'll ever box again, because I just think it's too limiting.
*  In kickboxing, I feel like it'd be really hard for me to, because it's too limiting.
*  I do like aspects of grappling that I can use in a fight, but yeah, nah, I like full
*  flesh fighting.
*  I think it's a healthy ego.
*  I just knew I have to really humble myself so I can learn how to fight these guys at
*  their own game.
*  So yeah, that's why.
*  I like how One FC has everything.
*  They have grappling matches, they have kickboxing matches, they have Muay Thai matches, and
*  they have MMA matches.
*  I think that is the way to go.
*  And I really wish the UFC, I know they're invested in this slap fighting shit, but instead
*  of that, have a kickboxing league.
*  I think they don't think that people would get into kickboxing.
*  I think they're wrong.
*  It would be.
*  Yeah.
*  They just did the one in Denver for One FC recently.
*  It went well, and the fights are crazy.
*  A lot of knockdowns, a lot of action packed stuff.
*  But if it was just marketed the right way, with the UFC's marketing machine, easily,
*  easily.
*  It would be one of the biggest leagues.
*  Because everybody loves KO's.
*  Everybody loves stand up fights.
*  You get that in slap fighting.
*  There's a lot of KO's there.
*  But you're going to get real KO's because no one can grapple.
*  You can't grapple.
*  So you're going to get people that are forced to stand up, and you could then attract the
*  greatest strikers in the world like One FC is doing.
*  They're getting all these Thai killers, these Robb Tangs, all these elite Thai fighters,
*  and they're all coming over, and they're fighting in the cage now.
*  I feel like there's an opportunity for that, for a kickboxing league in America that would
*  be hugely successful if the UFC machine got behind it.
*  You know John Way past a lot of that?
*  I think he did.
*  Yeah, he did.
*  In the cage.
*  Yeah.
*  Little gloves.
*  I watched both fights with Brad Riddell.
*  The first one with Brad Riddell.
*  Second one, sorry.
*  That was the one I watched at, cage fighting.
*  Great fight.
*  Crazy fight.
*  Even though John lost, he just showed me who he is.
*  But yeah, I think he did start cage Muay Thai.
*  Yes.
*  I think it was his thing.
*  He should have fucking trademarked that shit.
*  Well, Muay Thai with little gloves is different too, right?
*  Because there's blocks you can't use.
*  Just shielding like a Dutch style.
*  I remember with the big gloves, I always talked about it as well.
*  I always felt my striking was better for MMA.
*  I always felt it was better for MMA because I was like, nah, if you can just do this, that's
*  yeah.
*  You just block whatever I hit.
*  It's just who's tough.
*  Who's tougher.
*  But with the small gloves, you can get around the guard.
*  The hand traps are different.
*  So I always just felt like, yeah, my striking would excel better in MMA.
*  I wasn't as, not I'm tough, but I wasn't as just like...
*  Tough for no reason.
*  Yeah.
*  Thank you.
*  I like to use my brain.
*  I was just tough for no reason.
*  Like boom, boom, boom.
*  Okay, hit you, hit me, hit me, hit you, hit you.
*  That's not my style.
*  I always felt I was slicker the way I moved, the way I set traps.
*  And that's why I like the MMA striking better.
*  It's kind of crazy about the Dutch, right?
*  What is it about them that makes their style so savage?
*  Because if you go back and you like watch like Ramon Deckers or Rob Kamen or Ernesto
*  Houst.
*  Oh my God.
*  I think it's his culture.
*  Is that what it is?
*  Yeah, I think it's the culture of the stock.
*  Because I've seen some of the gym spas.
*  That's how they...
*  It's insane over there.
*  Kalil was talking about it.
*  Kalil was telling the way he went up the train over there years back and he's like, I can't
*  fucking do this.
*  Like these guys are going hard every day.
*  For zero dollars.
*  Yeah.
*  Zero dollars.
*  It's like, what do you get paid in glory?
*  What do the best fighters get paid in glory?
*  What is like...
*  I wasn't getting paid that much.
*  What does Rico Verhoeven get paid to defend his heavyweight title?
*  I think he probably gets more than most.
*  He's still in glory, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  I kind of fell off them after they rubbed me off the fucking belt.
*  I was just like, yeah, whatever.
*  I can't let them...
*  Oh, the Jason Willis fight?
*  Yeah.
*  After that I kind of fell off.
*  I thought you won that fight too.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  It's one of those things.
*  Look, I'm glad things happen the way they have in my career because it always gives
*  me an opportunity to come back or rise again and showcase my spirit, my fighting spirit,
*  not just in the cage, but as a human being.
*  So all the things that have happened to me in my career when it comes to losses or setbacks,
*  I just go, cool.
*  Let's see what I can do next.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Like even look, the DDP fight, the Shreklin fight.
*  What's another one?
*  Well, Pereira got that back.
*  Yarn One, I feel like that was a side quest.
*  I'm just kind of like, man, that's cool.
*  And I never hold onto them.
*  I never hold on like, I need to get this.
*  It's like, nah, this is fine.
*  Like the Alex One, I was cool if that never happened, but then he decided to chase me
*  and I was like, cool, let's do it.
*  The Yarn thing is a crazy situation, right?
*  Because Yarn goes to a split decision with Pereira.
*  It's a great fight.
*  It's a tough fight.
*  He has that crazy fight with Ankalaya.
*  It goes to a draw.
*  And then no one's talking about him.
*  Everyone's talking about contenders in the light heavyweight division.
*  Like, what about Yarn Bojovic?
*  Get him in now before he's too fucking old.
*  I think he's already in his 40s, early 40s.
*  But I think he won the title that old.
*  Wasn't he like 39 or 40 when he won the title?
*  He was.
*  I'm trying to think.
*  I just feel like he's being disrespected.
*  He's just not getting the attention.
*  If you look at his performances, the guy's not had a bad performance.
*  There's not one fight that was boring.
*  There's not one fight where he wasn't trying to win.
*  He's not a wrestler.
*  Right.
*  He's fighting top contenders.
*  He's fighting top guys.
*  Boxing.
*  Yeah.
*  He's a fucking animal.
*  And he's out of the conversation.
*  Like, they're talking about Ankalaya fighting, you know, like, oh, Alex is avoiding Ankalaya
*  so he takes Khalil.
*  Ankalaya and Yarn Bojovic went to a fucking draw.
*  Like, what about that?
*  Like, what about him?
*  Yeah, maybe because he doesn't make as much noise because I don't really see him on there
*  as much anymore.
*  What does it say?
*  Okay.
*  Oh, he's supposed to fight Rakic.
*  I see.
*  I see.
*  Okay, he's hurt right now.
*  Oh, shoulder surgery.
*  I see.
*  I see.
*  So that was January.
*  So that was 10 months ago.
*  Yeah, he's not back yet.
*  Yeah, it must be.
*  Well, that's about the amount of time, especially when you're dealing with shoulder injuries,
*  man.
*  Those fucking things take forever.
*  Yeah, nah.
*  Go see fucking what's his name, Briggs.
*  But yeah, I'm glad I got some today, though.
*  Thank you for that.
*  I actually feel better.
*  Stem cells.
*  Yeah.
*  Not from the stem cells.
*  I like that from the drip I got earlier.
*  But yeah, the stem cells.
*  The ones I had in my ankle, yeah, they worked.
*  I went to Mexico.
*  It works.
*  It works.
*  It's a game changer.
*  It's a game changer.
*  And we're getting fucked here in America where it's very difficult to get the same kind of
*  treatment that you can get in Mexico and Panama.
*  What they can do here is much more limited.
*  Hopefully in the future, they'll release those limitations.
*  But in America, you're dealing with a lot of corruption because-
*  Pharmaceutical companies.
*  ... orthopedic surgeons, pharmaceutical drug companies, they're going to lose a lot of
*  money if they have stem cell treatments because there's so many different things that it could
*  fix.
*  Even Briggs was just talking about what he said on here, just going at them, and that
*  went viral, which is good.
*  I just told him, bro, put out a tweet and say, I will never, ever kill myself ever.
*  I think that's a smart thing to do.
*  Just put that tweet.
*  When you start fucking with those guys, pharmaceutical companies, they will find anything.
*  Yeah, you get in a plane crash.
*  So I was like, whoopsie.
*  Oh, how did that happen?
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck.
*  There was one.
*  What was the one for me?
*  I kind of got a little paranoid.
*  So I did this interview with Oscar Willis, right?
*  And I started talking about the whole ... this is when Epstein just got arrested.
*  And I was saying like, well, Epstein just got arrested, right?
*  And then Oscar goes, yeah, it's funny how the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard case is getting
*  more attention than that.
*  And I'm like, crazy, isn't it?
*  So this Epstein guy just sold kids or whatever, trafficked them to these rich oligarchs and
*  whatnot.
*  I was like, what happened to them?
*  What happens to those people?
*  Where's the list?
*  And then I didn't think anything of it, but then it went viral.
*  And then every year since, it goes viral at least twice or three times.
*  I'll see it just circulate again.
*  And I'm just like, oh, fuck.
*  So then I went on Twitter and I said, I will ... and I'll say it again, look, what's it?
*  I will never, ever kill myself.
*  I've never even come close.
*  I mean, we all think about it sometimes.
*  Like when I was working this job, it just have like a passing fleeting thought, like,
*  oh, if I just jump over this bridge and hurt my leg, I don't have to work for the next
*  six months because I hated my last job, but I would never, ever, ever, ever kill myself.
*  I'm not that ... I'm not built that way.
*  And I've been there before when I think 2013, I realized, is this how people feel before
*  they kill themselves?
*  Like how sad they were?
*  And I was like, man, that's sad.
*  That just made me feel sad for those who actually go through with it.
*  But yeah, anyway, I would never kill myself just in case.
*  Well there's enough people commenting on the Epstein case that I don't think you have to
*  worry, but the people that are in the position to actually know the people's names on the
*  list, those people are probably in trouble.
*  Because that's a crazy piece of information to have.
*  And the fact is that, look-
*  No one's been tried.
*  No one's been brought ... No one's been discussed.
*  We know who went there.
*  We know flight logs.
*  No one talks about anything.
*  There's no effort to prosecute.
*  There's no effort to ... And then you have Ghislaine Maxwell, who's in jail for sex trafficking
*  to who?
*  To who?
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  You have to have done it to someone, but there's no effort at all to uncover that.
*  Yeah, but I'm saying now this year, it's kind of crazy how this year started off with what's
*  his name, Cat Williams on Shad and Sharpe.
*  He starts talking, spilling the tea, sipping the cognac, and then now this whole P Diddy thing.
*  Sometimes you have to tell Diddy no.
*  Oh man, bro.
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  Oh man.
*  Sean Diddy Combs' alleged list of accomplices to be revealed soon.
*  The names will shock you.
*  Attorney says, whoa.
*  I think he's going to sing.
*  I think he has to sing or he's going to jail for the rest of his life.
*  Bro, also I'll tell you what I'm saying.
*  God protects me.
*  I'm so glad God protects me because look, if I got invited to the white party, I'd have
*  gone.
*  Especially if you didn't know.
*  Of course.
*  No one knew.
*  No one knew.
*  Right.
*  If you don't know, you're just a celebrity and you know, oh, Jennifer Lopez is going
*  to be there.
*  Oh, Rick Ross is going to be there.
*  Everyone's going to be there.
*  That would be a cool place.
*  I want to meet those people.
*  I just want to be there having fun partying.
*  But then they start to apparently, they said they were using, I'm going to guess it's like
*  ketamine because they said horse tranquilizer and they're putting in people's drinks and
*  the champagne and then getting them all loose.
*  I'll tell you a secret.
*  It's just us two, right?
*  Yeah.
*  After I knocked out Pereira in Miami, we went to Tootie's the next night and they were like,
*  yo, P Diddy wasn't here watching a fight last night.
*  I was like, wait, word?
*  Crazy.
*  Then I went and checked my DMs and I saw, oh shit, he hit me up.
*  And he was talking about two months later, I want to do an interview or whatever.
*  And I said, here's my manager's number.
*  Bop, cool.
*  Nothing ever came off it.
*  But again, that's why I said, God be protecting me.
*  Right.
*  Because who knows?
*  Like you never know, oh yeah, we're having this party later on.
*  Yeah, that's cool.
*  Cool, cool.
*  And then they start to like, you know, you find some chick, you pull on you and then
*  boom.
*  Oh, how was that 15 year old?
*  Like, wait, what?
*  Right.
*  And you're filmed.
*  Yeah.
*  I heard about that.
*  Yeah.
*  That's all the bottles.
*  All allegedly.
*  Cameras all over the house and a hundred bottles of baby oil.
*  Yeah.
*  What?
*  Nobody's that ashy bro.
*  A thousand.
*  Also, by the way, that's shit lube.
*  Coconut oil is better.
*  Fucking water-based lubricant.
*  But baby oil is acidic as fuck.
*  Johnson and Johnson's.
*  Like, that's demonic, bro.
*  Like, why would you use baby oil even if you're fucking dudes?
*  Old school.
*  Nah!
*  Probably started out with it.
*  That's all the bottles.
*  Nah, that's AI.
*  Yeah, that's gotta be AI. I don't know if it's AI. I think that's real
*  I think it was lube and baby oil I think in a variety of different substances who counted that was a thousand
*  Look at that one two three
*  Baby oil on the wall imagine having 500 bottles and go we need to go for a target run
*  Man, oh the fact that said it was fucking what you call Costco and Costco goes now. We don't sell that shit
*  What is this the faced AR 15s interesting? What does that mean? Does that mean they scratch the?
*  Yeah, whoa, that's a serious crime. Yeah, that's a serious crime, but again see he's in cahoots with
*  Epstein and then is he in cahoots with was he in cahoots with it or was it just a similar type of an operation?
*  He they were friends really yeah, cuz Epstein had a fucking no on Miami as well that really private rich
*  a
*  State in Miami, so they were all in cahoots as well, but again
*  I think he's gonna sing isn't it crazy like that was always the conspiracy theory
*  Tin foil hat thing oh, there's a place where the elites go to fuck underage kids like what what's his name Alex Jones?
*  Yeah, yeah, he was right. He was right. He was right about a lot of things most everything
*  Most
*  But almost everything else he was right
*  But you got to realize that that guy had been in uncovering real conspiracies that the media had not covered
*  for fucking decades and
*  He was literally having like a psychotic break because of it because he's just drinking all the time and dealing with the stress
*  How would you even Kanye imagine you trying to tell people something right and then no one believes you and they call you crazy
*  I go crazy just trying to explain to people even I
*  Can imagine the frustration the frustration of trying to explain to someone and you're like no this is really happening
*  This and they're like yeah, whatever you this and that and I went down the rabbit hole in 2020
*  I'll tell you I did I had to and
*  For me it was just like I could see the fuckery I
*  could look this is
*  The mark of the immigrant that's right here if you look at any immigrant. It's just like that little dot
*  Keloid it's from a vaccine. We all had as kids all over Africa. I can't remember what it was for
*  So I'm not opposed to vaccines, but when someone's trying to force you a cool co-hurt co-hurts you or whatever into
*  Taking something that you're like, you know, it's something just doesn't feel right about it. You know what I mean? Yeah, but again
*  I grew up in Nigeria. I know how corruption works, right? So I mean I'm a lawyer by didn't see the zen
*  You know I'm saying I did my part
*  Whatever, but still I just knew something was afoot. So I
*  Yeah, I did my part. I played the game cuz it's all a game. I go offered
*  Different ways to play the game, but I was like, I'll find my own way and I did so yeah stay pure
*  Which is good. Yeah, this whole thing was just money
*  It was just they were trying to convince everybody that needed a vaccine because they wanted to make enormous amounts of money and they pulled
*  And then now with all the information that's come out all the deaths
*  Yeah, I saw that show die suddenly or whatever. Yeah, and you see the blood clots
*  From the same time that the vaccine and go pushed
*  Excuse me, and then everyone just goes oh
*  Well carry on my dad's like again, I'm frustrated in a sense by don't say it like
*  We fucking told you yes, but then
*  I don't need an apology knowing he's an apology but it's kind of like everyone just oh well
*  I guess that's that and then carry on with their fucking life
*  I was talking to a dude last night who's a veteran who was telling me that the hospital where these veterans get treated
*  They literally told him we are not allowed to make a connection with any of these adverse side effects to the vaccine
*  Even ones that are listed as vaccine side effects
*  They're not allowed to make that connection because they mandated the vaccine
*  Yeah, and this is the real problem
*  The reason why all these corporations all these people don't want to talk about it is because they mandated their employees to get vaccinated
*  Yeah, so they even though there's no liability for the vaccine manufacturers because they're exempt
*  Which is part of the problem why they fucking propose all these things anyway
*  But then you're not allowed to make the connection with the problem these people are having and the fact that they got vaccinated two three times
*  You're not even allowed to say that this might have been the cause of it
*  They're not even allowed to bring up that connection
*  That's so they have to just treat whatever this side effect of the vaccine is without talking at all about the vaccine and not give any
*  Connection to it. Isn't that funny? It's through the looking glass. Yeah
*  It's like we're living in the matrix man. It really is
*  It's like there's complete mind control and the idea of mind control is like no mind control is not real. Of course
*  It happens. I've seen it so many bots bro. Like sometimes I move through life and I feel like look we are all born
*  Like as players in this game, but everyone gets kind of programmed through so you know schooling or whatever education system society
*  And then they just become bots and I can see it as well
*  I guess because when I was bringing it up and I'd say something even people I really love and trust sometimes and then did
*  instantly what they've called it or
*  Agent Smith syndrome, huh? And they just know actually this and that brighter right, right?
*  I might you know why that is because they got
*  Vaccinated and they want to be in the club to get vaccinated and they don't want to believe they made the bad decision and they don't
*  Want to believe they coerced other people into making a bad decision
*  Yeah
*  they want to come up with all sorts of reasons why all these health problems and all these and then the
*  Overall all to all cause mortality increase which is through the roof in some age brackets
*  It's 40% increase in all cause mortality strokes cancer heart attacks all these things have gone through the roof and no one is making a connection
*  Must be just you know the food people eating would just ignore it
*  Yeah, just money even some people like that did get it. They tell me they regret getting it
*  Yeah, so many times I regret getting it, but I had to because if not my job was gonna fire me
*  Then I had to and the the fucking gaslighting thing our former fucking prime minister
*  She did all I don't believe we I don't believe we coerced anyone into getting it
*  I don't yeah, and you just I'm like bitch
*  You literally said if you can't if you don't get this you can't go grocery shopping
*  Yeah, can't go to restaurants you can't work that can't work. So your livelihood gone
*  But then we didn't I don't think we forced anyone
*  We didn't force your hand like when people do that's the ultimate form of gaslighting. You're just like in our face
*  The pressure was incredible. The pressure was incredible
*  And you know, I felt it in the weirdest way because I saw people lying about me on CNN
*  I was like, this is crazy horse tranquilizer thing. They change. Yeah, they was horse dewormer
*  They changed the color of my face. They made me look yellow and
*  I'm like if you do that to me and by the way
*  No one gave a fuck that I got better real quick. That was the craziest part about it
*  Isn't this supposed to be about recovering from a disease here?
*  You got a guy who's recovered in three days and is telling you all the shit he took and you're lying
*  Just to try to like superimpose that sepia kind of filter
*  The one that got me so because we still travel during 2020
*  I did four of those in my cue quarantines the one where you go back to your own country
*  And then you have to quarantine in a hotel for two weeks
*  Before you get let back into society
*  My coach usually did nine a lot of those he even told me Israel that last one
*  Luckily the last one he was able to do in his house, but then his family had to go live somewhere else for two weeks
*  He was just grateful. He had it in his house my last one. I
*  Remember I went outside for our fucking daily outside for what 40 minutes or whatever
*  Sometimes we get shipped
*  Unto the playpen on a bus like prisoners or whatever and then I remember everyone's doing these circles is walking in a circle
*  And I almost did a full circle what time I was like the fuck am I doing?
*  And then I went back into my room and I stayed in my room for the remaining
*  11 days because I just felt like this was too much and then also the one that got me was
*  Third one this lady had a kid in
*  She may be paraplegic or whatever she had a neurological disease and then the the kid had a seizure
*  While the mum was having a smoke somewhere the kid had a seizure and one of the guys
*  Went and helped the mum with the kid and the officer that helped the mum with the kid
*  They put him in quarantine for three days because he didn't have the correct PPE gear on
*  So that let me know
*  This isn't about
*  Looking at people it's about punishing this guy for disobeying the law
*  Because he didn't have it so we're all someone's having a seizure hold up miss
*  Let me go put on this fucking overall and tape my gloves on this while this kid's dying exactly
*  And they put him they punished him for that so that let me know like okay, this is fuckery
*  This is a foot
*  Well, I remember when Dan Hooker had fought over here and then he had there was a picture of him being on the side of a
*  Fence looking at his daughter. Yeah, it was heartbreaking
*  Couldn't yeah couldn't see his daughter for like two weeks. You didn't have the same thing
*  He had a newborn at the time
*  so I have a picture of him with his wife and his son on the other side as well and
*  then he just separating families all that kind of stuff look I
*  Like my alone time I love I might seem like a social butterfly and I am I can do both
*  But I love my alone time and I like being inside
*  but
*  When you have too much alone time, that's bad. Mm-hmm
*  I didn't like that cuz then you start to go in your head with all these other things
*  I mean, I didn't go crazy, but there was I was I was dancing on the edge
*  But that was a lot of enjoyed it people on Twitter lost their fucking mind because they were on Twitter all day long
*  Locked in their house during quarantine for you know months and months at a time just literally getting mentally ill
*  Just reading Twitter and attacking people and then blaming all these people that are unvaccinated on all the problems of the world
*  They just put us against each other. Yeah constantly
*  People don't do that again. I hope people realize like hey that was no one benefited from that. No one got better
*  No, it didn't help anybody survive. It was all bullshit. I hope there's another lockdown
*  Well, yeah, just for like a month. I think okay look
*  Every year at least for two weeks or even some places maybe a month just alright shut everything down
*  Everyone go it was good
*  But you get to spend time with your family or the people you live with and realize do I fuck with these people?
*  Or do I not and they also built like build relationships and relationships things like that
*  The whole world got better the fucking ocean got cleaner
*  So I think it's good lockdown was good for that when it when it was okay
*  But not for extended periods like six months where that's terrible for the economy
*  You're gonna lock down for a month is terrible for the house takes a long time to recover
*  Oh sure when everything ceases and you're not getting any packages in like right now
*  There's a teamsters and longshoremen strike in America, which means all the docks all the
*  No, no one's moving nothing everything's not Amazon just for two
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no eventually that's all gonna lock down
*  Eventually, there's gonna be nothing event. If these guys keep going it's gonna cripple the economy
*  I don't know right now
*  It's only been a couple of days
*  But the the head of the longshoremen's Union was talking about what effect it's gonna have and he basically say I why they doing it
*  Because they want more money
*  Okay
*  they feel like they have a more valuable position than they're being compensated for and this is the best they can negotiate like you guys need to
*  Understand how valuable we are to your society you take us for granted
*  Yeah, you don't want to give us what's fair and so we're gonna fuck you sure and they haven't had a lockdown like that since
*  Yeah
*  It's a real one it's a scary one too because
*  They have an immense power and they haven't flexed it before and they're flexing it now and they're flexing it like right before an election
*  Which is that who knows what kind of effect that's gonna have because if the economy tanks because of that and they can blame
*  Biden and Kamala Harris, you know, it could it could get crazy
*  Yeah, I will see when that start like a week ago to a couple days ago. Oh, really? I think it was October 1st. Yeah
*  Yeah, interesting. I always like it when look I love America, but I like watching it from New Zealand
*  Like when I call me I love the food like the fucking you know, shake Shackle just delicious like last night took so long for this
*  Burger something Austin to get get to our hotel
*  But then when it got there would just smash like all these smash burgers
*  I ate three of them so good and I go back home and I eat clean and I get my body right again, but
*  Here I love it. Even though I'm when Trump won I was stuck here for
*  San Diego for about eight weeks. That's when I went to Ato's jujitsu and I got really really good at jujitsu for a while
*  Me and my teammates we just thought like when Trump wins we need to have food for four days
*  Because it's gonna be fucking crazy. They're gonna cuz from where we are in New Zealand
*  The camera only shows you this
*  So Trump wins we're looking outside. Okay
*  Safe cool everyone's and nothing's really happening. You see, you know Trump flags on someone's lawn Biden whatever on someone's lawn still it's fine
*  but then someone explained to me that even the the Capitol riots when and
*  DC they face the cameras this way if you just turn the cameras this way, you'll see the rest of the street
*  Just normal. Mm-hmm. So from New Zealand when we see what's happening here, it's just the biggest craziest sitcom
*  And again, like I said, I love America, but I like watching it from New Zealand
*  But I do enjoy being here. But again watching it from New Zealand. We have our own cares to deal with but this one is just juicy
*  It's a different kind of chaos. The whole world's watching
*  That's what's different because America's such a weird country that the whole world is watching when we have elections even look
*  Trump just got almost assassinated twice twice twice twice. What's the second assassination attempt? No
*  Yeah, there was a guy who got caught with an AK 47
*  He was hiding in the bushes for 12 hours got in a shootout with the Secret Service
*  I missed all this yeah, because they took it in and out of the news in like a heartbeat
*  He there was a shootout. No that's the the Secret Service shot at him. He fled
*  I don't think he shot at the Secret Service. He fled and then they caught him
*  Well, he's before after the after after okay, I see so this is a guy who is a real lunatic
*  He went over Ukraine to fight for the Ukraine forces. It's a crazy person
*  Okay, and this guy was somehow or another armed to the tits even though it's illegal for him to be carrying a gun
*  he's a convicted felon and he
*  Almost assassinated Trump and it was out of the news cycle in a couple of days. I missed that completely
*  I didn't even know about this news. How they gloss over it. They don't give a fuck
*  But again, how do you gloss over that the one with when he got shot and he just turned his ear?
*  Crazy there's so many things fucked up with that. You know why I mean, I'm sure you've already talked about this other people
*  But just the fact that it's just they apparently saw him on the roof for what nine minutes or something beforehand and just watch them
*  So many things that just go yeah, everything's wrong. It wasn't really Secret Service
*  A lot of those are home on security the lady with the gun. Oh, yeah
*  fumbling with the gun
*  Full panic. Yeah, the whole thing was madness and the fact that that went out of the news cycle real quickly, too
*  Nobody cares about the fact they almost killed that guy now. It's about the debate
*  It's about the day and they went right back to calling them a threat to democracy a threat to our society and like hey
*  Who is that kid? How did he die? What happened there? How did he get a hold of those detonators?
*  How did his apartment get completely professionally scrubbed when they went to that kid's house?
*  There was no silverware his house was professionally scrubbed. He lived by himself. Isn't he a teenager 20 years old
*  Meanwhile he was in a Black Rock commercial Black Rock the company. Yeah, he was in a Black Rock commercial. Okay, and then
*  There's so much to that story and here's the thing if he kills Trump and then they kill him who knows it's all lost
*  It's all in the wind. Yeah, Oh lone shooter a crazy person
*  Unfortunately got a hold of Trump, you know, we need to do take everyone's guns
*  Yeah, this gun violence is a real problem in this country, you know, it's also a problem mind control
*  What did you do to that kid what but drugs was he on no toxicology examination they burned his body in ten days
*  Really? I took a hold of it. They even bury him. Oh, they fucking cremated his ass
*  See, this is what I like. I just get the popcorn. I just go. Yeah, it's nuts
*  It's a crazy because he would have been Lee Harvey Oswald too. I mean just like really Harvey Oswald
*  Allegedly shoots JFK. Jack Ruby walks up to him BAM shoots him. He's dead. What happened? Who knows?
*  That's the whole magic bullet theory again, I've gone down the rabbit hole to a point where I saw that it might have been the driver
*  Yeah, no, no, okay. No, so it is like with AI
*  Yeah, that's bullshit
*  multiple shooters for sure most likely people in the grassy knoll and
*  Most likely probably somebody from where Oswald was as well. It might even been Oswald Oswald might have taken a shot as well
*  I saw this video to this thing. You can't trust shit these days. No, bro. I swear next year
*  I think next year it'll be the when it's like you have to really know what you're watching
*  I'll have to question everything because now it's fingers text. I can kind of oh, that's a bullshit
*  And also there's a little texture. There's a texture with the AI videos and I'm like, that's AI for now
*  Yeah, next year better and better. Yeah, I got a piss. Let's take a leak real quick. No worries
*  Yeah, I'll take a piss as well. My documentary. It's a
*  Great. So we're talking about before. Oh, we just went on the tangent about fucking chemtrails and shit
*  No, but I was just telling Jamie about my documentary I said like you should watch it as well
*  I said even if it wasn't about me
*  I'd still recommend it because it was a well-made
*  Not so sporty sporty films like one of the best pictures I got sent was this lady knitting on a plane and then watching it
*  And I thought that was like an old lady not her demographic watching him and man
*  She's watching me through the documentary knitting because it was something that
*  It was different
*  When did they start filming this?
*  They came on board
*  22
*  2018 we started talking and then they came on board
*  With their cameras, but Jeff Saint-Laurel who is
*  My videographer works for Zuck now
*  Literally does everything but yeah, he had a lot of behind-the-scenes
*  footage and we just put it all together talking about my kind of
*  Rise in this game, but also dealing with the I guess the pressures of all this, you know
*  Because no one there's no book on how to be famous, right? I had to learn this on my own
*  I had to learn this myself. What was the most difficult part of it for you for me? I think people I just didn't expect that
*  I knew I wanted to be when you grow up you think I want to be rich and famous like when you know the MTV Cribs
*  The pin my right era I thought yo when I'm rich I'm gonna have
*  Seven cars one for every day of the week. I'm gonna have this many houses have real estate now differently
*  But also I only need two cars. I'm like, there's all these other stuff that comes through also
*  I'm not a cop person like you. I just like hot wheels
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying my best reaction when I wrapped it was I love seeing little boys be like
*  When they see it, yeah
*  Yeah, but not put it back to black and I'm gonna do something different to it later on with some airbrushing
*  Not me my guy Maddie, bro. But yeah, um, I was just people there's even a bit in this documentary where
*  They were just filming one day and then these kids are like they just drove by my house
*  And they beat the horn they kind of gave me a fright and they came to my door and
*  Then the camera was filming so it's in the documentary and I
*  Explain to them. Oh, it's cool. Let's take a photo. All right, but then it got to a point where it'd be like 9 p.m.
*  10 p.m. And then
*  Yeah, I was still being at home cuz my street mice my house my front door was accessible to the street
*  That was my first house. I ever bought now
*  David lives there. That's his home and I live in this fucking complex that has a gate and a code
*  so if you have to get to my front door, you have to be there and
*  Yeah, just dealing with people was the main thing for me because I didn't expect the attention I was getting I was expecting it
*  but I guess the variable of
*  the unknown so
*  Yeah, I just had to learn how to protect my energy and protect my some boundaries. Yeah, I mean like today after lunch
*  I
*  I'd say yes to photos
*  But if I feel like Sam at the airport if I say yes to you've had this before we say yes to one and people
*  Like oh he's taking photos and it becomes like a zombie apocalypse. And I'm like, you know, I gotta go somewhere
*  So if I tell someone like you know, I can't right now if I say yes to you
*  I gotta say oh, please just one and I'm like, it's not just one right? You don't understand
*  Yeah, and then I'm the I'm the asshole but and I love my fans
*  I love people actually support me and I try and make time for them
*  But then also I have to make time for me because I've been there before where it's pretty much
*  I'm just there and then on my turn
*  I'm like, I'm not even having fun. I don't even have kids yet, but when I have kids
*  That's when I'm gonna be like, yeah, my youngest daughter won't have it
*  She grabbed me and dragged me away good like when people try to take photographs
*  She hates it good my middle daughter doesn't it doesn't bother her that much but the youngest daughter
*  She gets fucking angry. They're stealing my daddy's attention from me. Thank you
*  Yeah for me even if I okay
*  When if I go on a date or whatever and someone sees me and tries to take a photo
*  I just go I want her time right now. You have to ask her or if I'm with my family
*  I just say no especially when you're sitting down having dinner. That's crazy when they come up to the table
*  Like come on, man. Get the fuck out of here social awareness this day and age and everyone ain't know what it's it's funny
*  I can feel it coming once you see me because they look like they're about to pull out a gun
*  Right. That's what it feels like every time they do it
*  I'm just like and I say yes to most of it, but there's times I'll say no
*  So that would be I say the most difficult thing so far was just dealing with people
*  But again, I do like people but also I don't like some people some people just so entitled entitled
*  They just come up at you and it's just like you owe them something because they know who you are
*  I'm I so I might you don't even a fan
*  Sometimes it's it's this thing where they just see people taking photos. I want a photo too, right?
*  I might you don't even know what I do. I'm not oh, can I get one, please? Who are you? Yeah. Oh, yeah
*  I love that. You know why I like it when someone doesn't genuinely know who I am, but when I'm sorry
*  I don't know you I'm like, it's okay
*  My name is Israel cuz I got to meet them on a first name basis, right?
*  But one of the best ones and the best replies I gave one time was these three chicks and or two guys
*  They were just you know, oh my god fan fan fan and one of them was like, excuse me, but who are you?
*  I'm no, it's always a girl. Yeah, and then she came back again like three more times like, excuse me
*  But like who are you? I don't even know who you are. I was like, I bitch
*  I know you are and then her face was just like and I just left it alone
*  But again, I prefer meeting people on a first name basis, right?
*  It makes me feel like I get to know you and you get to know me without some
*  Preconceived notion of what you've seen on TV or YouTube. Yeah. Yeah, I love when someone doesn't know who I am now
*  Now it's nice now I can have a regular conversation with someone, you know, like what do you do?
*  Like I'm a comedian. Oh, have you ever been on television? Yeah a couple of times. I'll look out for you. Okay, good
*  No, I like those
*  Talking to each other real I like what you said protect your energy because that's really what it is
*  Because if you give up your energy to everyone you will get lost. Yeah, you will get lost
*  I learned that the the week before the Robert Whitaker fight in Melbourne
*  so I had this epiphany and
*  Then did the fight did well and again, you know how I told you after my UFC debut
*  It was all this attention and stimulus and when I went home boom, right and for like a month
*  I just felt sad nothing like nothing's wrong. I'm so fucking like I should be happy
*  I should be happy right and that's when I started going to therapy
*  But then I learned through the techniques and tools I've got from that how to protect myself
*  so before the rub fight I
*  Felt the same thing again because my girl at the time had to drag me away from the after party because I hid in the after
*  Party I hid in the toilet. I had a drink
*  Jesus Christ
*  All the seats down just sat there and she's like, where are you?
*  So I just sent a text and she's like
*  No, I'm coming to grab you
*  So we went to go get ramen somewhere and then at the hotel before I flew out
*  I just put out a something on my story saying look guys
*  I appreciate the love and all that if you see me you can come say what's up with you come yelling at me
*  I'm just gonna walk away. It's the yelling thing and I think that's that's a learned behavior. They say oh my god
*  Yeah, Joe Rogan. I'm a
*  Same rhetoric. I'm a huge fan. I love you since this I've watched you since this and it's the same like bought responses
*  Yeah, NPC responses and they're yelling but someone just comes up like hey, man. I'm a big fan
*  Do you mind if I take a pic? Cool? Let's go and they make it quick. They're ready. They're not going off
*  Excuse me. What are you doing here? Right? I'm just like yo
*  Don't hold me hostage. Let's just go like take the picture
*  I like those but if we have a genuine connection and I vibe with someone and we end up talking for like five minutes even better
*  But you can't try and facilitate that but yes when people come and then they hang around and then they won't leave
*  Yeah, and I'm just don't hold me hostage with your conversation. There's a do you remember the first time you met a famous person?
*  You I did some real
*  You won't remember this and I
*  This is another one of those things. Oh, I can tell you not cuz we boys but I met you at UFC
*  192 when Dan for Yair and I met you backstage at the wins and then I came to say what's up?
*  And then I I did fucking bought shit
*  Then I was like, but do you remember my friend Chris he took a photo with you and it's a video, huh?
*  And you're like, yeah, I love you would do that
*  For the next like five hours
*  Yeah
*  Why'd you say that? Oh, and I just felt cringe but I got over it eventually but again, it's one of those things that you learn
*  Yeah certain things I learned even with Snoop one time at Staples Center when it was a Staples Center
*  I ended up smoking with him. But then I
*  Filmed it and then afterwards I remember thinking like why did you do that?
*  I you should just enjoy the fucking moment, right and I cringe at myself when I like I'm like, ah
*  Who doesn't want to fucking smoke with Snoop Dogg, right? But why did I have to film it so I can show people?
*  I don't even think I did I post I did post it. Yeah, of course I posted it
*  But again, it's one of those things I learned now
*  So there's people I've met places I've been now that I just I enjoyed the experience and there's what it is
*  I don't need a photo. Right it's in here. I've taken snapshots. Well, you've had those experiences
*  That's where I give people grace when they're first meeting me. It's like I get it. I remember the first time I met someone famous
*  It's weird. Yeah, it's a weird feeling. You know, you remember that one. Do you I don't good
*  For the next five hours up to the next day I think the fight to you the next day
*  I was just like and I kind of got over it and I just think and I told Chris when I went home
*  Like yeah, I told him about that and I felt so stupid
*  But I know now it's better because when I meet people I really appreciate I don't
*  Geek out of one. No, even if I'm just like, oh, that's that person
*  I kind of birdwatch them and if they recognize me one of the coolest ones was Eminem in Saudi Arabia
*  Because everyone's trying to get a photo and then my my guy I security just goes hey em Israel
*  I see but it was oh yo, what's up? And he came and took a photo with me and I out of everyone
*  Yeah, I like he let me take a photo with him. So I was like
*  Yeah, I felt cool cuz it's Eminem. I mean so things like that. I'll appreciate in certain moments like that
*  I appreciate but I don't I don't force it. I don't try to facilitate it
*  I just let it be I just let it be and if I get it cool and I don't need it
*  That's the thing. You don't need to take a photo for everything. Just enjoy the moment
*  Just enjoy the moment and join the interaction enjoy the energy
*  But I understand the weirdness of meeting someone famous because I do remember it. It's just it's an odd feeling
*  You don't know what to do. You feel weird. You say dumb things, you know why you're saying them and then you're like
*  What did I just do? I'm better now. The coolest one I think I had was Trump
*  Where was this?
*  Vegas at the fights I haven't even the clip was one of the UFC sting
*  Documentaries and I someone's oh, yo America's Last Hope. What's up? I dapped them up and
*  Dana's they're just smiling and then we're talking we just dapping up and talking and they enjoy your fight this and that right and
*  It wasn't weird cuz again, I can understand like I'm meant to be here now, right?
*  Sometimes I get long imposter syndrome. Sometimes it's still creeps in. I don't know if you still get it
*  Yeah, it's still creeps in but I know how to identify it now
*  Yeah, and I go right I'm gonna shut it down like any emotion
*  But yeah, that was one of the cool ones I had where I was okay
*  I handled myself or I wasn't an idiot and many other ones but yeah the ones and there will be more
*  I used to get imposter syndrome so bad. Yeah, where I meet people like Mike can't believe you know
*  I am I gotta hide
*  I know who you are. You should know me and I just said I felt that a little bit yesterday, but I
*  Went to the mothership a little bit. But again, you watch it on YouTube all the time
*  Oh my god, me and my was like we're here. This is cool
*  And then only for a little bit, but I realized I meant to be here cuz everyone's standing around me
*  I'm kind of yeah having to hold court, but I kind of just want to shut up and just be like
*  Yeah, this is cool. Just enjoy. Yeah, but everyone's around me and I was just cool and I re was the man, bro
*  He's just such a he's a funny dude so tall and talking about kickboxing with him. And yeah, well, I'll probably head there tonight
*  See what's up and I'll try and it's a fun place. No geek out so much. Yeah
*  Play cool play cool
*  That's a fun place. We have so many people roll through to it's it's so interesting like all sudden jelly rolls there
*  Yeah, you know now you guys did it man. Like you literally I think it was it wrong white that kind of started the
*  You know the idea and then all of you started to just march to Austin one by one
*  Yeah, he came here before the pandemic. Yeah, and he was the one who put it in my head because you know, Rom's I fucking love it here
*  It's easy to travel. I can see why country. It's beautiful place
*  No traffic people are nice. I just came back from LA. So the contrast is definitely you can see it
*  Oh, it's so much better here and it's better for comedy
*  It's just cuz it's it's the only couple in the country that's owned by a comedian sure free. It's like you can be yourself
*  There's no executives. Yeah, it's just me. I don't even have any partners. So wait, just me. Excuse me
*  when you say that you mean like
*  Do people have to pay?
*  Other comedy clubs to perform there only when you are very very beginning and it's corrupt comedy clubs that you have to pay for stage time
*  Yeah, that's that's not normal. That's something take advantage of
*  Amateurs so they can make extra money so they could justify open mic nights and stuff like that
*  But that's not a lot of clubs most clubs, you know, it's you have amateur nights
*  They all should have it but some we have two nights. We have two nights open mic nights
*  So we just want to make it a real place where people can develop
*  Yeah from the very beginning you could do your first set on stage ever at the mothership and eventually headline there someday
*  I've seen it can Patterson some of these guys they start there now. They just
*  Killing it. Yeah hard work. Yeah hard work just grinding that kids in that club every fucking night
*  He's always and he's traveling all over the place all over town doing different clubs. Yeah going on the road
*  He's you know, he's doing he's making the most of the experience
*  And for someone like me just a fan of comedy in general
*  It's fun to see the process of them starting up and then because I was I used to listen to kill Tony my old job
*  Just so I didn't go postal
*  Sit there with my headphones in and the hoodie on just to hide it so they don't know I'm doing I'm just like and
*  Then now to see where it's become and then you know where on the street is they go coming up and I'm yeah
*  Oh shit, so it's gonna be on there and it's gonna be even bigger
*  Yeah, it's fun to see that and I've seen a lot of comics like
*  Just grow. Mm-hmm, and then seeing the assets develop all that kind of thing and look I
*  Know how hard it is now just watching that because you think oh, I've made a joke before I can do it
*  No, and seeing people bomb one kill Tony after just 60 seconds. I just like yeah, nah fuck all that
*  I'd fight in front of millions of people with the stand in front of a crowd and try and make them laugh
*  Ah
*  Just that yeah, it's a weird kind of rejection. Thank you. That's what it is. It's like oh shit that didn't land
*  Escape escape escape
*  Just like that fuck this shit
*  But you also see other people can do it so you got to figure out a way to do it and it that's part of the
*  Challenge of it all it's why it's so exciting to succeed. Yeah, I'll be that's not a guy's the expert
*  Yeah, it's hard, you know, but it's also fun
*  It means the most fun thing to do for a living and you could do it forever, you know
*  You don't have to rely on your body being fit enough to do it
*  You know fighting fighting is so unique because there's a small window you have from you know
*  18 to maybe 38 if you're lucky or you could be a yo El Romero and compete like deep into your 40s
*  But he's the rarest of the rare or Bernard Hopkins, you know world championship level at 50 crazy
*  But those are the outliers for most people
*  There's a small window make the most
*  That windows the smallest. Yeah, this is the smallest of all the combat sports that even make it to the top
*  Yeah
*  God think about how many guys have an amateur fight versus how many guys like make it to just a world title fight
*  Mm-hmm just to fight for a world title and forget about defending the world title
*  What you've done is like the rarest of the rarest of the rare and then win it back again
*  You know, it's so rare. Yeah
*  I've seen people throughout the walks of life and gyms. I've trained at that. I'm like, I
*  Think you're better than me, but they just never made it. They never got the experience or the exposure
*  Also when the lights are on they shut down. Yeah, and they don't show out
*  I'm like you're better than what then this but again gym champions. Yeah. Yeah, that's a real thing man
*  Would people that perform so well with no pressure and then when that pressure is on they're like 30% of what they are
*  You see the make the mental mistakes you see them rush in and it's it's weird it takes
*  Skill to learn how to perform under the lights, but also you have to have that thing
*  Like you have to know you're that guy or you have to have that belief in yourself. So again, I'm glad I've done it and
*  I'm glad I'm doing it. But now I'm just like I just want to fight
*  I just want to fight have fun. And again, it's weird. Like I just know that fucking gold belt always circles back around
*  I don't chase it never have and I knew it would always be there at some point
*  But yeah, it will and in the moment bro
*  If I'm not happy with what I've done in this game, what's gonna make me happy, right? Right? How could you be exactly?
*  Exactly, you mean think about how many times you defended the title you won the title you beat the greatest guys of your generation
*  How could you not be happy with what you've done already, but I still feel great. And again, it's this is you know
*  Fighters talk about I lost the belt. I felt this pressure lifted whatever. I never felt that when I lost it in MSG
*  I was just like I'm gonna fight this guy again and I got it back. But then when I lost it
*  Not to Strickland boy, even this last one is only time when I was just like I
*  Didn't know I wasn't a champ I guess but when I when I this last fight was the first time I felt that like
*  Well, but I still feel like I'm that guy because a lot of people still have that target on my back because I'm Israel
*  I diss on you but having to fight for the belt
*  having to fight
*  With that
*  Thing. I don't know. This is the first time I've ever felt that where I'm like, man
*  I'm good. So I'm just gonna see what happens train get better and fight again at some point
*  Just concentrate on the task instead of this whole thing of the titles and yeah
*  Cuz I feel like when you have the title these all the spotlight on you
*  This still is a spotlight on me, but it's not the same thing and now I get to enjoy a little bit more
*  Almost freedom in a sense. Well, I've heard fighters talk about it heaps
*  So I again for me, I never felt it till recently that I'm like, uh, I get what they mean now when they talk about the pressure
*  Pressure still there, but it's not the same and I'm like cool. I got to just fight for me now. I get to have fun
*  Yeah, just I want to try some crazy shit like I actually want to fight and just do some I
*  Want to go back to the way I used to fight when?
*  We didn't have so much on our line because it's not just about me. It's about the people that
*  Are around me that you know, I have to
*  Not have to but you know, like if I do good everybody eats, you know what I mean?
*  Mm-hmm. So now that we still do good, we still eat but it's like fuck the belt
*  We just have fun
*  So I just want to go back to having fun the way I used to fight when I was young fucking skit
*  So Fritterer who just did shit for fun like the fucking Tavares fight and around one
*  I'm like, I'm a try a manari roll. Let's see what that does and I kind of missed it
*  But yeah, I'm gonna bring that back
*  I kind of want to do that that kind of shit again just cuz so do you think that like as the stakes are higher?
*  The pressure is more and it just restricts your creativity it restricts your ability to just be loose
*  It didn't at first but the longer you defend the belt it happened to Anderson as well
*  It happened to Anderson as well
*  I saw it cuz I watched Anderson's rise and I saw them even to the point where people wanted him to lose
*  Just cuz he was so great
*  Right and then it's just that natural thing where people build your because they want to tear you down
*  Mm-hmm, and I felt that happened to me as well
*  They're like, oh, we just want to see him lose and when it happened, they're like, yeah
*  And then when I won it again, it's like yeah
*  And I lost it like yeah, so it's just natural it's natural way of I don't know the mob of
*  Humans or whatever the fans. It's just how it is the Coliseum. Well, there's always a bunch of people that
*  Don't like that. You've accomplished something they will never accomplish. Oh, there's always them
*  Yeah, and so they do want to watch you fall because it makes them feel better about their lack of success. What did Dave say?
*  Someone rejoices when a great man falls. Yeah, it was a great quote. Yeah, the cowards the cowards. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's the truth
*  Yeah facts. I've seen it. Yeah, I've even felt it as well. Like we're just like I
*  Wonder what will happen if he loses like it'll just shake the whole landscape of things up
*  So you just wonder like I felt it
*  I think what Floyd I just wonder not that I wanted him to lose cuz I'm a big Floyd fan
*  But I was just like what happened if he lost this fight and like oh shit and but that's what makes it exciting
*  You never know, you know, but yeah, anyway, I'm just here now and I'm just like cool. Let's have fun. Let's fight
*  Let's just get some you know, some good matchups. But again, I'm in a spot now that you've got
*  Rob comes out fighting
*  DDP and Sean are gonna fight and I can't think of who else is DDP and Sean set in stone
*  I think it's not set in stone, but it's what they're looking at. Yeah
*  Take place next year sometime, but I'm trying to get something in this year. So we'll see there's already a few callouts
*  You know here and there but cool
*  The guy that just won in France. I forget his name. Did he win them? Not the main event?
*  Immenov yeah, he said something and I'm like
*  We'll see it'll be a good fight. It'd be fun. But again, what has he done? He beat Brent and Brendan Allen
*  You know, and is that five round worthy because I'm never doing three rounds again
*  All my fights are probably gonna be five if I ever do a three round again, fuck. Let's go
*  Would you want to?
*  Cuz like there's some three rounders that I feel like we got robbed that it wasn't a five rounder like
*  Sarukian and Charles Olivera. That was a good. Yeah, that was a good example that crap
*  That was such a crazy vibe as well
*  Olivera almost caught him couple times with submissions. Yeah, man and
*  Lost a controversial decision like very close decision
*  And then I feel like you give him two more rounds who knows what would happen another one was
*  Hamsat and Kamaru. Oh, yeah that third round tomorrow was coming on strong the couch is yeah off the couch
*  Ten days notice crazy fighting at 85
*  170 pound champion right off the title loss and then you know third round he wins and you're like God
*  What would happen fourth and fifth, yeah, that's where some people come
*  Especially champions. Yeah. Yeah, I can't do five. But again, I say three. I just feel like I would fight like
*  Like a bat out of hell I just feel like would be different but again, it's not even I
*  I do enjoy the the time in the cage
*  But even training for five round fights a lot of people train for three rounds fights
*  But they don't understand everyone wants to be champion till you got to train for five rounds and it's like oh shit
*  You got to do this shit. You have five rounds of the spider circuit
*  Oh shit, that's where you find out the men from the boys you separate
*  So yeah, I do like a five round fight and also you don't get paid by the round
*  So sometimes fights and like that so yeah, that's up to you. Yeah
*  So do you have a timeline of like when you would like to fight again?
*  How many fights you would like to have because I know you're 35 now
*  How long do you think you're gonna do this? I don't know. Like I said, I thought I would be 34 and I'm done with this
*  I always just thought like yeah when I'm 34, I'm done. But then I'm here now and I feel great. So I'm like
*  Let's see three more years. Who knows who knows fucking kid might come out of nowhere. I'm like, oh shit. I'm done with this game
*  Is there any fights that like like Strickland that you'd like to do? Oh, yeah strictly and DDP
*  Strickland one definitely cuz that fight was not me. And again, I don't make excuses
*  He it was just another Dave Chappelle quote. You have to realize when it's your time
*  He's such a fucking philosopher with a day
*  He said something about like when it's your time you have to know when it and be humble enough to know when it's someone else's
*  You know, I mean that was just his week. It was just his and everything
*  So I just you know his time let him have it
*  but I
*  Definitely know what I can do and I took his best shots and I just know like
*  Yeah, I can take this guy. I know what I can do
*  I'm not similar to the perera one where I you know, I was winning but this one I definitely know what I can do with this guy
*  Yeah, what did so is that one shot that cracked you in that first round? Yeah change the whole momentum of that fight
*  Yeah straight punches be looping on linear punches. He caught me good and then the moment I remember thinking like oh
*  Shit, this nigga's hitting me. Oh shit is hitting me and I went to mark
*  God I like you see the picture like I'm okay
*  And then even he told me my next fight with DPS like don't do that
*  Don't have to do that you just have to find a way out but it was hitting me and I was thinking like oh shit
*  This is really happening fucking I had to fight out the position and just get back on them
*  But yeah, how much damage did he do in that exchange in that exchange?
*  No, not really much just a one shot. The one shot was one that got me but the rest was just kind of like
*  Nothing really got through is just a lot of flurries and it looked violent
*  But that's why I was able to look at mark and be like, yeah, we're good
*  But yeah, I'm gonna come back. I see what happens with him and DDP
*  He could win
*  You know beat him and we almost won the first time. Yeah, it was close. There was close very close
*  Yeah, it was yeah, that was a rough fight even at the end that were just swinging on the side
*  They had nothing left in the tank. Well, you see strickle. It's like it was all arms. Yeah, there was nothing in the tank
*  yeah, they emptied out what we'll see we'll see what happens in that fight and
*  Yeah at the moment
*  I just like I kind of like the feeling of not knowing
*  Cuz sometimes people ask who you gonna fight next when you're gonna fight again, I'm like, I'm just chillin
*  so again, I'm just gonna keep training and
*  Sometimes short notice shit happens. You know, I mean and it's like right. Well, I'm already in shape
*  Fuck let's go. Right. Yeah
*  But we'll see so stay ready. Yeah, stay ready
*  Like I said, I've done the testing already and I know where I'm at after this
*  I'm gonna go get some work in and yeah, even on the road. I love this food there. But fuck
*  I know when I get home, I'm gonna have to take all this off
*  I know it will come off because I've got you know, good nutritionist now and stuff
*  But yeah, I just try to stay ready. You guys don't have barbecue in
*  Terry blacks in New Zealand. Yeah, they have all just even the food there
*  I think the quality is different ball. So I try to stay off Uber eats as much as possible
*  Now I have Matt cooking for me. So if I want something I'll see something on the reels
*  Matt can you please make this he'd be like, yeah cool boom and he'll just make that night
*  Yeah in camp it'll be healthy but right now I can I can stretch my legs a little bit
*  Add some cheese whatever but um, yeah
*  Just stay ready. That's the main thing. Just stay ready your camp that city kickboxing gym
*  It's what a fucking gym that is like there's so many killers coming out of that and old Berg now on the rise
*  Yeah, goddamn that dudes good. Yeah, there's so much. Yeah, he's so tall and dangerous
*  There's so many good fighters coming out of there now even recently
*  We had cam
*  Aaron tow and then Navajo fight on the contender series Navajo was only one to get a contract
*  He got it with the hook actually. I don't know if you saw that fight. I didn't yeah Navajo sterling. He um
*  Knocked out the guy in the second round. So now he's in the UFC
*  He got a contract and he's gonna fight this year
*  I think in December so he's already in camp for his next fight because he was kind of fresh coming off that fight
*  So yeah, he's another guy that
*  This that's him yeah the guy in the red
*  Big nav boom and they set him up boom boom out and the guy I fought was tough, too
*  Came strong in the first front, but Navajo was able to put him away another king in the ring champion as well
*  I think he's two-time king in the ring champion. What way is that a light heavyweight? Damn? That's a big fellow
*  So he's a guy my Miami fight with parada he helped me a lot Ben Johnston helped me a lot with the looks, you know
*  But yeah, he he's just a fucking
*  Savant the next level kickboxer, but knows how to grapple. He looks at shit
*  Downloads it drills it and he's using it on you straight away or the next day. It's just one of those guys
*  And he loves to fight. He's a guy who just stays in the gym stays ready
*  Like I say, he's got a fight already locked in even losses got a fight
*  Was the mayor fighting all the mayor in Macau?
*  You know, what's his name? No time. Yeah, welcome. Yeah, welcome. Yeah, that's a good fight. I like that for Carlos
*  Who else? Yeah, so I like the gym the way it's growing even on the local scene as well
*  You have a lot of guys who are just coming up in the local scene and they're looking at us
*  Because of what we've done, you know government funding no backing from the the sports
*  What you call it in New Zealand they try to stifle us during kovat, you know moving the go-pull scene
*  Oh, you can quarantine in the gym. Okay. Now you can't quarantine in the gym
*  We're sneaking around trying to find places to train they following us reporters taking photos putting us in the papers making us look bad
*  We're disobeying the law think about your grandma man all that kind of stuff. So yeah, we've done it our own way and
*  We're still I thought we're still one of the best gym if not the best gym in the world
*  That's why I'm there only reason I'm in New Zealand
*  It's cuz of city kickboxing if not for that place I definitely would still be there to see my family bought it probably moved
*  All over the place like Melbourne I definitely would have lived in Melbourne for a while like Melbourne
*  I love Melbourne Australia Canada somewhere. It's great. Yeah, no, I just like the culture the food
*  It was here in Austin Australia and in New Zealand. They just have such restrictive laws
*  Yeah, and the government has such control over people and I didn't realize it until the pandemic
*  Yeah, and then I was like Jesus Christ, that's why I got to play the game Joe
*  I played a game as it says like it's almost egotistical in the sense
*  The
*  Rules are there for a reason and I am a law abiding citizen, but sometimes there's certain things where I think like
*  The laws doesn't apply to me, you know what I mean? That's why I don't follow politics
*  I only ever voted recently in New Zealand because of the fucking referendum. They were gonna make marijuana legal
*  I was like, okay that applies to me. I'll vote for that. So now what do you call it? One policy voters or whatever?
*  The other laws and stuff. I'm like man
*  Unless if it's something crazy like someone decides all we're gonna tax the rich
*  50% of their money that applies to me then I'll vote
*  So when I say the law doesn't apply to me, it's in the sense of like I don't really care about what their policies are
*  You know, so yeah, that's how I live and I'm able to travel a lot which I'm grateful for but
*  Yeah, if it wasn't for CKB, I definitely would have would have left and said
*  Or maybe traveled more checked out Europe or you know shit like that
*  But right now as I'm fighting maybe after fighting I will you know, you know, it's beautiful
*  Oh, it is beautiful sports to live. I like the pace. I do like the pace
*  and again
*  I like watching America and the rest of world from New Zealand cuz it's just like
*  This little corner of the world just like chilling and just oh, yeah Kiwi Mike. Good day
*  You know and then yeah, just see what happens in the rest of the world and we still get a lot of things happening
*  Culturally that are relevant to the world
*  But yeah, I definitely want to travel after fighting and I get to travel I'm in fucking Austin, Texas now
*  You know talking to you. I thought well as I after this I'm going to New York
*  Yeah, I'm sure I'll be somewhere else on the planet at some point but
*  Yeah, what do you think you want to do when this is over?
*  So I have a plan in place because I know me
*  I'm an adrenaline junkie. So I know I'll need something every like maybe twice a year
*  Where I feel like I'm gonna die. So one of my plans
*  That's why I have a McLaren and you know, I've you know never crashed it amen
*  But um, yeah, so for me like I skydive twice already in the last year that was fun
*  So again, if I said, okay, I'm done fighting now then okay, they're running in the with the bulls cool
*  Let's do that and I'll just train for that and then when it's time to I'll go to Spain or whatever and get ready for that
*  And then go run with the bulls cool. That's good. Yeah, that'll be fun. It's dangerous. You could die
*  Yeah, but that's a dumb way to die. Yeah
*  There's many findings a dumb way to die too, but it's the glory it's glorious glory
*  It's a glorious way, but getting stomped to death by a bull is not a good way to die. Yeah, I mean what are the
*  What do I have? So what's another one? Okay, let's say I go to the outback
*  go learn I
*  know
*  To jump on a crocodile and save it from so I don't know there'll be something I'll find things
*  I'm there's always something I'll find something to do that will make me feel like
*  My life is in danger
*  So you feel like you're gonna need that forever?
*  Cuz if not, you just fall a lot of guys they come back and fight again because they miss that. Oh
*  You know that guy and those especially who never made it to the pinnacle or what they wanted to do
*  Then they still have that
*  Dissatisfaction and then they come back to try and reclaim that glory. Yeah do it for less money
*  And then they fall short they become journeymen
*  Become alcoholics drug addicts, you know shit like that. So I don't want to also who knows
*  My main thing though is definitely start a family. That's one thing I want to do after fighting it'll happen
*  I'm not I don't go looking for that shit cuz when you do you find the wrong thing
*  And I've made that mistake before we're gonna make that mistake again
*  So I know what happened for me and when it does I'm gonna be a great dad. You can't convince yourself that it's good
*  You got a nice to be good
*  Oh, yeah facts. Oh, no, there's a lot of people that want a great relationship
*  So they'd talk themselves into one and the next you know, you're with some girls going through your phone
*  I got talked into one. That's the thing. So now I'm like, okay bet when I get into one
*  I'll just you know when you fall in love you just
*  Go such a lover as well so soft side, but I learned my lesson and
*  Again, it's one of those things you just have to go through and I'm grateful for the experience
*  I'm grateful that I did because now I know exactly what not to do
*  Next time so that's why I don't look I'm single because I just enjoy myself
*  I enjoy not being responsible for someone else's emotional state, you know, she has a fighter because you know
*  You know this, you know fighters when they have to deal with shit. Yeah before a fight before the cost of fight the shit
*  I had to deal with
*  It was my guy and I was quarantining at the gym as well so that kind of stuff I don't want to deal with I
*  Just want to focus on me
*  There's a problem that girls when they think that you're busy with something else and you don't care about you're not paying attention to them
*  They're not your primary focus. That'd be the center of your world very upset
*  I've seen guys where they're they're getting ready for a fight and their girl starts fights with them like as they're weighing in
*  You know, okay, not that bad at least she knew better. But still it's just look
*  It's more about I also don't try and compete with your your your husband or your boyfriend with me
*  You'll lose it's not like in the sense like this is what I do for a living
*  You don't have to try and compete, you know, right weird like when someone tries to compete with their their person or whatever
*  I know it's nuts. Yeah, this is meant to be a partnership
*  Right the intimate person your life wants you to fail because they're competing with you
*  They want to get over on you but thing is what's good for me is good for us
*  What's good for you is good for us, right? If you're a team
*  So again, if you're a team, I'm learning and I'm not looking cuz I think that's that ship sailed in the sense like
*  When I look at someone like say even a Connor with D Devlin, that's fucking cool. I love that. She's still with him till this day
*  They've got how many kids together. That's cool
*  Regardless of what the state of the relationship is now
*  Look she was with him when he was no one and she believed in him that kind of stuff is rare these days when I see
*  The other people I'm just like
*  Right, they still love in the air Joe. It's still
*  Yeah, it can work but boy you gotta find the right person. They gotta find you. Yeah
*  I'm just I should go down the hinges other day just for fun in LA. I was like, let me see
*  I hate these apps. I don't use those I try to get on Ryan
*  They still have me on the fucking waiting list for fucking the last two years
*  I'm like my other than the areas but I went on hinge in LA just to see just to see what's up
*  But it's just funny. It's just funny to see the experience a couple interactions. It was cool
*  But this is what people do now. It felt like the questionnaire to get on hinge
*  I thought it was gonna be like this thing cool cool cool put some pictures up
*  I'm like am I trying to do adoption or some shit?
*  What is this and what is your primary focus and I'm like I spent like 20 minutes doing the whole thing
*  So it's up now. I still have it on an awesome like
*  Well, it's you know, you have to protect your time that's the problem
*  It's like you only especially when you're doing something like fighting. There's the amount of time and dedication
*  That's required to be at your very best is insane and there's nothing like it. There's nothing like it even in sports
*  If you're a basketball player you have to play basketball you have to practice but you there's a lot more free time
*  Yeah, a lot more free time and it doesn't drain your body the way fight training the consequences is different, right?
*  After a game of rugby or whatever cool, I don't know how the
*  The fucking the brackets work or whatever even a basketball football soccer
*  But then you get to play the next day or the next not the next day sometimes the next week, you know
*  Fighting it's not always like that
*  and also if you get hurt you get hurt badly and you
*  Suspension six months and you have to wait and then if you don't if you're not strong mentally, I've seen people break
*  Yeah, I've seen them break and it's like fuck. Come on, man. You can you're better than this. So yeah for me
*  Fighting takes everything
*  It takes everything and I've done well in this game and sometimes in the beginning. I
*  Didn't give everything so that's why now that I'm at this age I'm like yo
*  Give everything so that way when I'm done. I just know I
*  Did everything I could to be the best and I was and I'm proud of myself. So I'm yeah, I'm still here man
*  I'm still like I said, I'm not fighting for
*  You know a belt or anything anymore that'll come around when it does but it's just I'm just fighting just cuz I'd I have
*  Bro a submission is more worthy to me than the third belt like I'm gonna get that. Yeah, I'm gonna get that
*  It's gonna and I'm not gonna look for it
*  It's gonna present itself and I'm gonna get it and I'd be like right I take that off cool
*  Cuz I've done a lot of cool shit in this game
*  It's more like just the highlights and I just know I can so that's that's more
*  Worthy to me at the moment and that's like a maybe ego thing or personal thing. But yeah, that's just me though
*  Did you have a timeline on how much longer you want to fight for?
*  Like I said right now say three years, but I'll be 38
*  That's probably the end. Yeah where guys can compete at the highlight Jared
*  Cannon year got to like 38 30 39 started to fall off a little bit and the last two fights is long
*  I think GSP stopped just around there as well 37 maybe when he fought this thing. Yeah, but who knows?
*  That's what I'm saying. That's like I feel I don't think I'm gonna fight at 40. I don't think I think that's not me
*  I'll be even for me as a person. I'm like, I'd rather be doing something else
*  But 38 right now is in my head. Who knows fucking 36 37. I'm just like right
*  Peace I'm out. I'm spontaneous like that. Well, I think 38
*  39 but let's see 30. Let's see what happens first. But at the moment I'm still here
*  Do you have any thoughts of things to do other than things for adrenaline?
*  Yeah, like to do with your time apart from raising a family
*  production, I definitely want to have my own production company and
*  do stuff like a
*  Couple of acting things of course because they've already come up and I turned them down because of this game
*  I was like, you know, you have to give everything to this game
*  I don't want to spend three months somewhere filming right, you know this kind of stuff
*  But definitely motion capture definitely want to do that, you know, what's his name?
*  The guy that did a Andy circus planning the apes Gollum Caesar
*  He's one of the best at it and I see the way he works and operates and I just I know I can do that
*  I can learn and I'm very coachable. I can learn stuff like that voiceover work
*  With some cartoons or an amaze or whatever video games motion capture stuff. I'd like to I
*  Have more ideas of things I want to bring to fruition
*  Well, I don't necessarily have the skills even though I was doing computer graphic design for about three years
*  I knew how to make a red ball bounce in Maya the 3d program. That was my biggest achievement in that but I can
*  Partner up with someone on studio and just bring my ideas to life if they like it like I learned how to write a script
*  Maybe so I can present it properly
*  Also fuck all this shit with AI. I might just be able to do it in two years and be like, right
*  Boom and if it hits it hits if it sucks cool do it again
*  at the drawing board, but yeah, a
*  Lot of things a lot of things I already have like again shots of my pops
*  My pops is is the is a real OG because he helped me just triple and quadruple my money
*  Yeah, cuz if I didn't have him I definitely would end up as
*  One of those sad stories. I feel just because of who I am as a person
*  I feel like I would have ended up as one of those sad stories because of the trust I have in people
*  so I'm glad I have my dad around just to like
*  Make sure things are cool. There's always vampires, right? There's always vampires. It's just human nature. It's human nature
*  I'm sure you have it as well on the way up and even now I'm sure you have it as well
*  But they always they come out the woodwork and it's like let me see but then my dad's able to tell this is legit
*  This is shit. Oh, let me have a look at this first. He goes through every contract. I
*  can read but sometimes cuz I'm just like I
*  Read really slow or I just lose focus and shit like that
*  Especially contract shit. So that's very difficult to really
*  Yeah, well I just get like unless it it's something maybe a fiction that entices me
*  I can really go deep but I like reading comics and shit like that. But a contract is just
*  Detailed but there's one person on this planet. I trust that once the best for me is my father
*  That's a great thing to have amen because even I've said this like guys like Habib, you know rest in peace to his pops
*  He had him in his corner
*  Michael Jordan he had his dad in this corner, you know on the court
*  My dad is in my corner, but that's on the stuff that really matters outside the cage in life
*  Like I'm
*  When I talk about imposter syndrome, I'm like, how the fuck do I have this many houses? Right? I'm doing well cool
*  I know I'm I'm adulting but that's cuz of my pops and I learned the game through him
*  But the details of the game I still don't know yet. So after this I'll have more I
*  Guess input in the sense that okay
*  This and that and this is what this means and that you know with the property values and whatnot
*  I try not to get too much into it because right now all I can focus on is this
*  Fighting the main thing if I don't have this then yeah, I can definitely tap into all that kind of stuff
*  But now I'd rather just focus on this and let my dad handle it
*  So again, I'm glad I'm grateful so grateful that he's around and he's the one that's helped me
*  Get to this point because a lot of people don't even have their dad in their lives, you know, and I'm glad I do
*  Yeah
*  It's overall it seems like you're in a real good place. I am so yeah, I am look this is life
*  Yeah, you know how it is ups and downs smiles and frowns
*  But right now where I'm at, I'm in a good place way better place because again like people the thing I did like I
*  Appreciate it after my last fight people come up be like hey, man, that was a great fat life. Yeah, you did well
*  This is a model. Thank you. But when people come cuz I was at the buffet and Perth and some guy came up to me just like
*  I
*  Like me I was like what like he wanted to feel sorry for me I was like, nah get your fucking shit off me
*  I'm good. I'm like if you knew how much I made from this fight, you wouldn't even
*  But some people don't know how to react so they come right
*  Well, they were rooting for you and you know, they feel bad and I know but I want I like though again
*  I don't fault them for it because they don't know what to say
*  But the ones that come up be like bro, that was a mean fight man, you almost had him
*  But that was a fucking good fight. I'm like, thank you. I felt good in that one
*  It's it's a different look on two different on the same thing. It's like some look at it with like yeah
*  So I'm looking with that
*  But I'm in a better place cuz again
*  This isn't everything fighting is not everything in my life. I've lost many times of out of fighting, you know, and I've come back
*  I've lost in fighting many times and I've come back. So for me right now where I'm at in life
*  I'm enjoying it. I'm enjoying the ride and yeah, I look forward to the future
*  I look for there's a thought that some people have then in order to be at your best
*  It has to be everything. You have to live and die by your performances
*  And when your performance sucks, you have to suffer until you get a good one. Yeah, that's not for me
*  I've been there before and it's not for me
*  Everyone is different and I understand that when it's like because even when I was on top of the world
*  You know like number one and this and that it never defined me. I never let it define me. I always knew I
*  Was Israel I dissonant before and after the belt. I'm still me no matter what
*  They're still gonna be trying to fight me because they want to have Israel I dissonant on their record
*  You know, they want to they want to fight me
*  They don't want to fight the champ like people will probably even pick a fight
*  Over me then DDP or maybe not because probably easier fight they think but still like
*  I'm me and that's never ever gonna change that's never ever gonna change as long as I stay true to me
*  Yeah, and I look if this game was gonna change me
*  If money was gonna change me it would have done the ages ago a lot of a lot of zeros ago
*  But I've always been this guy with or without money. You can ask anyone who really knows me. They'll tell you. Oh, yeah
*  That's the same dude. I was dancing with back in the day still the same goofball keeps the same energy
*  But now that I'm here I just I have a lot more freedom to do things that I want to do than I'm grateful for
*  but yeah, I
*  Even look forward to seeing who I become next year like who I evolve into next year again. I am me but
*  Learning these things I'm gonna learn about myself. I'm sure you have this as well. Jamie has this well
*  I have this we just figuring out who we are. What do you know 57? No way. Yeah. Yeah, so you're still learning
*  You're never gonna stop you never stop learning when you do you're gonna die. Yeah facts. Yeah, this life is an experience
*  It's a long and people have like this number thing in their head
*  Oh by 30 you should know this some people some people know some people don't learn till they're 40
*  So people never learn I thought I was gonna be married with two kids at 23
*  Yeah, if I zig when you could have said yeah, I'm glad I said
*  I
*  Glad I sag for that one. That was so long ago and I was again
*  I'm soft, bro. I'm like I'm surprised. I'm fucking great at this this fighting shit. Like I'm so you
*  Do you see some it some idiot try to step me out? Do you ever see that? No, what happened some some
*  This is a two weeks three. So I had a great great day at training morning
*  Went to the the the shop to get a pie and I just thought you know people were just showing love
*  I'm just oh, hey, what's up? So I'll take a picture cool cool cool cool cool
*  And then one guy just pulls up and goes yo Izzy. Let's go one outs. I'm like
*  Not the light bro. This is stupid. I was like outs
*  What is our one outs in New Zealand slang like one-on-one like one outs? Let's go and I was like, this is silly
*  I thought fuck and I just started laughing and I said bro, I get paid millions for this
*  I'm not gonna whoop your ass for free and they kind of go angry and he stuck at the lights
*  It's green people are honking driving around them and I'm laughing walking away with my pies in my hand
*  I remember just looking like
*  Fuck and I grabbed my car door. I went
*  And that pissed him off then he drove and then parked in front of my car and I was okay
*  Took my watch off and I told a guy can you please call the cops and I'm glad only one person actually decided
*  See the video that I saw just a small clip of it I didn't know exactly what was going on just an idiot
*  But again, I'm glad one
*  This is the day and age of people just boom cameras out right cuz everyone who was around everyone got the cameras
*  I there was only one guy who uses phone to call the cops when I asked him
*  Cuz I didn't want to hurt this guy and this guy
*  I don't know if he was going through something or he was maybe cracked out or something
*  Cuz even the guy that the video that came out it seemed like it was set up cuz the guy kept on going
*  And I'm like, what are you trying to say and I I'm glad I
*  Like I said, I'm soft. I have patience and if I had a bad day might have been different
*  I like to say that because the freedom of thought but also my friend
*  You know fall vacay got killed by senseless street violence. This is something that we've talked about even in the film
*  it was something that we all had to go through because
*  He
*  Got hit with a coward punch and then hit the ground and then boom
*  He's in a coma for about two weeks and then eventually they have to pull the plug as I'm talking to this guy at one
*  Point I go bro. I don't know you like
*  Whatever has happened. I don't fucking know you I'm sorry and he's like, yeah talk to me nicely bitch talk
*  I'm like and I started getting angry and then got to the point I spat at him and now that was me
*  Like I hoped he did something and then I'm like, right? I'm taking this guy out
*  But then when I spat at him, he just looked down and kept on talking and I realized you're not about this life
*  I'm not gonna spend the next 10 minutes talking and
*  Remember to this guy elevates him in his mind. Exactly. Oh, you took a shirt off at the end
*  I got on my car. I was driving off. He had a shirt off flexing like what bitch what?
*  Now he's crazy person. So for me again, that's why I say I'm soft and I had to I had to really hold myself back
*  I don't know. I'm sure you've no one tries you anymore. Of course
*  Fucking be stupid to try you but I was thinking no one would try me anymore because back in the day someone would try me
*  I'm like bro people were trying Chuck Liddell in his prime and he was a complete psychopath
*  Try that's a dead hooker. Yeah, and would not have the patience
*  Instantly demolish that guy
*  But again, I just don't want to do something because if you breached the line
*  Yeah
*  I was within range and
*  Within my rights to strike him because I felt like what happened with your friend if you knock that guy out and he bounces
*  His head out was what was going through my head
*  Yeah, and also we started this charity walk without fear and I I'm glad nothing happened. I'm glad I was patient because
*  Now that video can be used because we're trying to change the laws. Look the guys that killed my friend
*  When we were in lockdown, they were on home detention
*  So
*  They're free now they're walking free
*  Enjoying their life and my friend is dead. They didn't get convicted
*  I think one of them did but the rest of them they had home detention the ones that actually even helped
*  They got home detention and I think for a year and a half
*  So six months of that home detention we all did it together in lockdown
*  so what kind of punishments that you get to sit at home and watch Netflix and
*  My friend's daughter has to grow up without a father
*  You know for nothing just cuz ego alcohol drunk this and that so again, I'm glad
*  I'm soft and I don't like I don't like confrontation. I don't but when it's time to get down I will get down and
*  I've put it out enough like I want to protect my boundaries and shit like that
*  But I don't ever want to be put in this position where someone tries to set me up just so they can make money off me
*  But there will be a point if someone tries me enough that I will have to definitely defend myself
*  And there's no fucking referee in a street fight. That's gonna drag me off of a person in that I see red bro. Not that shit
*  But yeah, I just yeah, I'm glad it worked out well for me
*  And I spared a life that day cuz if not, it would have been really bad and then I might not be here
*  Right. I might be in the fucking cell somewhere. I might try to make an example out of you. They will
*  Yeah, especially if you killed somebody. Oh, I know these these motherfuckers and then said like the bureaucrats
*  They don't like people like me. They don't like people like me who was outspoken right who was not a
*  Quintessential Kiwi, you know, I mean the guy that just keeps quiet and yeah, you know follows the rules
*  Just very just very humble like
*  Fake humility is something I've never been like I know humble is
*  Or what it is for real cuz I deal with that every day. I I fucking spark Carlos Navajo. I
*  Grow with Dan I get humbled every fucking day. So I know what you real humility is
*  But I need to try and like let the world know I'm humble just so I seem like I'm humble
*  That's that fake shit and I'll never be that and when I see it I cringe cuz I'm like, I know I know you
*  Right, I know you
*  What I see people do that I'm like just be real, you know, yeah, yeah, I try to keep it real as always
*  but again, like I said, I'm soft but
*  Sometimes yeah, it's a real challenge to be yourself with the kind of attention and pressure that you get the magnifying glass of the world
*  And I would never change. I'll never not express myself the way I always do but
*  Sometimes the world to try and put you in a box and be like this is this is what you're meant to be
*  This is who you're meant to be. I'm like, no, it's always weak people that want to do that
*  bro, like what was the one I put up the other day cuz I was I was
*  There was a scene from my movie. I was getting my nails done
*  I was the one I didn't some drip tips and then I put a clip next to it where cam goes
*  Well, I'd be wearing pink my whole life niggas been saying I'm gay bro
*  If you think I'm gay bring your mother around
*  I fucking love that. I was like
*  Yes, cuz again, I don't care. It's never been an issue for me
*  I think people think cuz I never flexed my
*  Girlfriends or anything online. They're like not definitely this guy's sus also cuz I'm nice
*  Being a nice person makes you sus yeah, cuz I'm not a dickhead so silly, but I can't be a dickhead
*  I have been a dickhead in the past. But again, I'd rather I was raised right my family actually
*  you know, my mom and dad raised me with good morals and
*  Yeah, I treat people with respect when and even if I don't get it back it's like cool whatever but
*  Yeah, people expect you to be this kind of cuz you're off that one is oh man
*  You're a lot different than I thought you would be in person
*  Well, you're not trying to fight me. So no, you know, I mean people expect you to be some type of way
*  Oh, I thought you know hard. Yeah, or even yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  Look, there's people you can find who'd be like, yeah, he's an asshole. No, sorry. Well, yeah, but who are you?
*  Yeah, exactly. I was an asshole to you. Yeah, but you're an asshole
*  So I had to be an asshole to get you to fuck away from me facts facts
*  Yeah, and I'm fine with that now that's cuz back in the day when I first came into the game
*  I always felt like I had to
*  With every fan I had to put on the song and dance. Oh, hey, how's it going?
*  Well, sometimes I might be at a four or five at energy level. So if someone pulls up on me, I'm just like yeah cool
*  Let's take a picture
*  But I don't have to ham it up right to make them feel like this is a great experience
*  He's such a nice guy. It's like
*  Bro, the day my cat died
*  I was pumping gas and the guy tried to take I try to make me talk to his cousin on the phone
*  And I said no and he's like, oh all good and I felt bad and I was like, oh, give me the phone and I'm there
*  with the phone
*  Pumping gas and I went bro. No phones
*  I get the fuck away cuz I but I did that cuz I felt bad that he I didn't talk to his cousin on the
*  Phone while I'm pumping gas. So what happened if something happened and boom
*  All what cuz I wanted to talk to this guy's cousin on the phone cuz he saw me at a gas station while I'm pumping
*  Gas, so when I talk about protecting my boundaries
*  It's just about time and place and approach like yeah people not and
*  I've put that out enough where I feel like people do respect it now
*  But some people still think I hate fans or whatever
*  But I'm like, that's what you think if that's what you got for my message and cool you think that
*  But it's about protecting my energy and protecting my boundaries. Well, I don't think they'll ever understand what it's like to be a person like you
*  Yeah, yeah being the spotlight
*  Yeah
*  And so again, they feel like you have this advantageous privilege that no one else gets so they think that you owe them something
*  You owe them your time. I
*  Bro, I'm a fan. I pay for your pay-per-view. You know, you're just talking shit
*  Yeah, oh no are the ones that is when to come bro. I bet on your fight a I'm like, yeah
*  Fuck you multi cuz again, I put my life on the shit every time I step in there
*  I put my life on the line, but they will never understand that they'll come and tell me like yeah, bro
*  One time this is years ago and the club and guys showed me a betting slip. I was like and
*  This is after a yarn fight. He showed me a bit. I'm like cool
*  Like what do you expect me to do? Give you a refund?
*  Fuck you. So I can't respond. Yeah, do you think I wasn't trying to win if you ain't got it like that
*  Yeah, don't put your money up, right?
*  I only gamble with money that I'm I'm gonna lose or I thought I can afford to lose but again
*  Yeah, I'm fucking gambling with my life, right? I'm trying to win and then something back it happened
*  I'm not here again, you know, so
*  Yeah, people are weird and I love people
*  Like I always say this
*  There's something about every group of people on this planet that I love
*  Including my own and there's something I hate about every group of people on this planet just little things little things that just annoys me
*  I'll say like okay Nigerians. I
*  Hate how the elders sometimes confuse respect with fear
*  Because that's how I grew up they confuse respect with fear and I've had to deal with that
*  You know, I'm not gonna say anything else about anyone else because they know so Israel hates these people or whatever
*  But again, I love people but at the same time they're taking advantage the fact you're being respectful
*  I love me first. I know what you're saying. I gotta put me first
*  Yeah, you have to if you don't know what else will facts. Yeah, I have to bro. Well, listen brother
*  I think the way you handle yourself and the way you communicate and the way you're honest and just you could be yourself
*  It's a great example to other people
*  Especially young fighters that are coming up and trying to figure out how they're gonna manage this and if they get ever be so fortunate
*  They get to a position like yourself. You've got you gave him a little roadmap
*  you know, I think that's that's a that's a beautiful gift to give people to understand an understanding of how an
*  Intelligent sensitive person deals with this crazy position in life
*  Thank you, actually hit. Thank you so much. No, no, yeah
*  I can say the same about you what you've done
*  Everything from Dave Dawson's I've met you that you don't remember and I'm glad you don't remember
*  So now even being friends with you, I like being friends with you and also I don't
*  Cuz you still have a job to do and I never want to put you in a compromised position
*  I always still have to respect you and what you do and I still kind of keep my distance a little bit
*  but I always respect and appreciate every time that we've interacted or hang out and
*  You know who you are as a person. So thank you
*  Appreciate you brother. Thank you. Thank you. Man. You're the fucking man. Let's go. All right, let's wrap it up
*  What else what style been there on watch it watch it Apple TV? There it is bang beautiful. Awesome. All right
*  Thank you so much. Thank you. Appreciate it brother. Thank you
