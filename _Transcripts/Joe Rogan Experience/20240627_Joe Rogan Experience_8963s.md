# JRE MMA Show #150 with Daniel Cormier
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=0.0s)]
*  I got a friend named Zach Esposito and he used to do that. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5.72s)]
*  We would get that with practice and every technique had to be perfect. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=16.44s)]
*  Even getting undressed and then back dressed was, this dude would sometimes get undressed [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  three times. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=25.88s)]
*  What? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=26.88s)]
*  And then when he got undressed, maybe he put something on in the wrong order. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=27.88s)]
*  I don't know what he would do. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=32.2s)]
*  But then he would take it off, he would do it again, he would take it off. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=33.2s)]
*  If he was drilling, every move. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=35.6s)]
*  It's like I don't know what that disease is called. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=37.6s)]
*  Obsessive compulsive disorder. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=40.12s)]
*  That, that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=41.12s)]
*  It was with everything though. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=42.12s)]
*  And he became an NCAA champion. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=43.12s)]
*  Doesn't it make sense though that those kind of things, if you could channel them into [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=45.2s)]
*  something positive. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=49.08s)]
*  Like if you're a maniac. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=50.08s)]
*  Say if you're like a compulsive gamble, you can't stop gambling. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=53.08s)]
*  You just gotta get out there and place bets. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=55.28s)]
*  You gotta place, there's guys like that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=57.68s)]
*  If they could channel that same energy into something else like jujitsu. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=59.08s)]
*  Could you imagine like an athlete that's like that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=63.72s)]
*  Michael Jordan. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=67.76s)]
*  I'm sure he's like that. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=68.76s)]
*  For as compulsive of a gambler as he is, that was his approach to basketball. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=69.76s)]
*  So nobody could be greater. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=73.76s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=75.08s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=76.08s)]
*  Exact same thing. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=77.08s)]
*  It's just one of them is dangerous. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=78.08s)]
*  One of them will fuck up your life and one of them will make you the goat. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=79.08s)]
*  Will make you the goat, but the other side of it is it don't turn off. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=81.76s)]
*  And that's the fucked up part. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=86.88s)]
*  That's the fucked up part. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=88.28s)]
*  It doesn't turn off. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=89.28s)]
*  Having that as a thing and then the competitiveness never turns off. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=90.28s)]
*  It drives you crazy. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=95.84s)]
*  Well, that's why Tyson didn't work out for years. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=96.84s)]
*  Mike did my podcast twice and the first time he did it, Mike was like heavier. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=100.16s)]
*  He was smoking weed all the time. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=104.64s)]
*  He was so chill. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=106.28s)]
*  It's like, wow. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=107.28s)]
*  It's like Mike Tyson is like such a sweet guy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=108.28s)]
*  And then Mike Tyson signed up for the Roy Jones fight. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=111.3s)]
*  And the next time he came in, he was 225. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=114.08s)]
*  Forearms were jacked and he was intense. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  I made a decision to make the table wider on my podcast, dude, because I was so nervous [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  being that close to him. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=125.6s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=126.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=127.6s)]
*  I was like, I got to have a little, just to separate from really intense people so I could [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=128.6s)]
*  collect my thoughts. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=131.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=132.72s)]
*  He tapped back into that thing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=133.72s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=134.72s)]
*  He had suppressed it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=135.72s)]
*  When you saw him, he was friendly and he was nice and he was smoking. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=136.72s)]
*  But he was still friendly. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=139.28s)]
*  He was still cool as fuck. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=140.72s)]
*  But this was the real Mike Tyson. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=141.92s)]
*  That was the guy. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=144.11999999999998s)]
*  Because he tapped back into that monster. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=145.11999999999998s)]
*  He found it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=146.76s)]
*  Because you know, you got to have the monster. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=147.76s)]
*  You have to. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=149.92s)]
*  In order to be a world champion in any type of combat sport, you have to have that monster. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=150.92s)]
*  A legit monster inside of you that doesn't really live in the real world. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=157.6s)]
*  Because in the real world, he doesn't work. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  In the real world, if you can't put that monster away at times, you don't work in life. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=164.56s)]
*  You're in trouble all the time. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=170.76s)]
*  You're in trouble all the time. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=171.76s)]
*  But that same monster, if you can control that motherfucker, then you're Mike Tyson. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=173.56s)]
*  You're Mike Tyson. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=178.12s)]
*  But then that's why he would see him skirt the line, right? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=179.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=181.6s)]
*  When he's talking to the reporter, that reporter, that is still one of the craziest things I've [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=182.6s)]
*  ever witnessed. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=187.16s)]
*  When he was on the stage and the reporter said something and Mike started talking about [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=188.16s)]
*  if we were in jail, I would do this. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=193.44s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=195.48s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=196.48s)]
*  I'd fuck you till you love me. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=197.48s)]
*  I'd fuck you till you love me. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=198.48s)]
*  Joe, how do you... [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=199.48s)]
*  I mean, what? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=200.48s)]
*  I mean, what? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=201.48s)]
*  What? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=202.48s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=203.48s)]
*  But imagine that guy in that state trying to operate in the world with normal people [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=204.48s)]
*  like us. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=210.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=211.76s)]
*  Doesn't work. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=212.76s)]
*  Doesn't work. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=213.76s)]
*  He's in jail. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=214.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=215.76s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=216.76s)]
*  It's crazy because the thing that made him great could also run away like a wildfire [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=217.76s)]
*  and burn everything around him. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=219.95999999999998s)]
*  In everybody. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=221.83999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=222.83999999999997s)]
*  And when you're the man and he was the man, then there's no restraints anymore, which [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=223.83999999999997s)]
*  is even crazier. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=230.16s)]
*  Because now you crash a Rolls Royce and just give it to the cops. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=231.84s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=233.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=234.96s)]
*  No matter what he did. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=235.96s)]
*  Just take my car. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=236.96s)]
*  I don't even want it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=237.96s)]
*  No matter what he did, take the car. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=238.96s)]
*  I'm fine. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=239.96s)]
*  They hide everything. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=240.96s)]
*  You know, honestly, here it is right there. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=241.96s)]
*  That's it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=243.56s)]
*  He was like, I'm like your daddy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=244.56s)]
*  Let me hear this, Jamie. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=245.56s)]
*  Give me some volume. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=246.56s)]
*  Go from the beginning. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=247.56s)]
*  He's like breathing heavy. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=248.56s)]
*  Put your mother in a straight gag, you punk ass white boy. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=249.56s)]
*  Come here and tell me that if I fuck you in your ass, you punk white boy. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=250.56s)]
*  I mean... [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=251.56s)]
*  You faggot. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=252.56s)]
*  You can't touch me. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=253.56s)]
*  You're not man enough. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=254.56s)]

*  You can't last two minutes in my world, bitch. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=269.96s)]
*  Look at you scared now, you hoe. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=270.96s)]

*  What do you say to someone... [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=286.96s)]
*  Who is that guy? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=288.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=290.96s)]
*  Who's that guy? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=291.96s)]
*  Who's the reporter? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=292.96s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=293.96s)]
*  But what did that reporter have to say to get that? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=294.96s)]
*  Well, he said something that you should be in a straight jacket. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=297.96s)]
*  Wasn't this the one where Mike bit Lennox? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=301.96s)]
*  He bit Evander. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=303.96s)]
*  He bit Evander. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=304.96s)]
*  Bit Evander's ear. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=305.96s)]
*  But didn't somebody get bit in this? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=306.96s)]
*  That was when he was about to fight Lennox Lewis, I believe. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=308.96s)]
*  Wasn't there like a brawl before this? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=310.96s)]
*  There was a brawl. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=311.96s)]
*  Did someone get bit or am I imagining that? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=312.96s)]
*  I don't remember him getting bit. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=314.96s)]
*  I remember him biting Evander's ear and they got into a bit of a fight. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=316.96s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=321.96s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=322.96s)]
*  Were you there? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=323.96s)]
*  No. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=324.96s)]
*  No, I watched it on TV. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=325.96s)]
*  Oh, I was about to say, that was crazy. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=326.96s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=327.96s)]
*  He bit a chunk of his ear off. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=328.96s)]
*  He couldn't beat him. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=329.96s)]
*  He couldn't beat him. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=330.96s)]
*  He was in a situation where he wasn't the man because he was so used to being the biggest, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=331.96s)]
*  baddest mug in there. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=338.96s)]
*  And in a situation where he wasn't, he goes, I have to go primal. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=339.96s)]
*  It's all you know. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=345.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=346.96s)]
*  You bite a motherfucker. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=347.96s)]
*  He bit that motherfucker. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=348.96s)]
*  Evander Holyfield has somehow forgiven him. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=351.96s)]
*  Evander's amazing. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=354.96s)]
*  Dude, I love Evander Holyfield. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=355.96s)]
*  How good was he? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=357.96s)]
*  He was the best, bro. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=358.96s)]
*  How good was he? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=359.96s)]
*  What a warrior. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=360.96s)]
*  He was the man. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=361.96s)]
*  What a warrior. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=362.96s)]
*  And those Tyson fights, because he had to endure. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=363.96s)]
*  Yeah, he did. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=365.96s)]
*  You know, I mean, Tyson put it on him and he endured. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=366.96s)]
*  All of them. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=369.96s)]
*  Remember those Riddick Bow fights? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=370.96s)]
*  That's the ones. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=371.96s)]
*  My God. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=372.96s)]
*  The Riddick Bow fights. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=373.96s)]
*  Now we got to think, like the Tyson fights after the Riddick Bow fights, which is even [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=374.96s)]
*  kind of crazy. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=377.96s)]
*  Riddick Bow was good. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=378.96s)]
*  Riddick Bow was good. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=379.96s)]
*  Those guys were good. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=380.96s)]
*  Riddick Bow. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=381.96s)]
*  Evander Holyfield. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=382.96s)]
*  He bit his leg. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=383.96s)]
*  Oh, he did bite his leg. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=384.96s)]
*  Tyson was forced to pay Lewis around $360,000 for biting his leg. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=385.96s)]
*  And the bra almost saw the mega fight canceled altogether. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=390.96s)]
*  Yeah, he bit his leg. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=393.96s)]
*  But that's the thing, right? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=394.96s)]
*  Like he had to do something. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=395.96s)]
*  Anytime he was threatened. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=398.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=399.96s)]
*  You know, it's like when you're in the wild, right? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=400.96s)]
*  I watch a whole bunch of shit. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=404.96s)]
*  It's called like, one is nature is metal. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=405.96s)]
*  Oh yeah, I love that page. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=407.96s)]
*  That's a sick page, bro. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=408.96s)]
*  Nature is metal. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=410.96s)]
*  It's the craziest shit. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=411.96s)]
*  It's the craziest. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=412.96s)]
*  Nature is so metal. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=413.96s)]
*  It is, dude. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=414.96s)]
*  Some of the shit you see on that page is nuts. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=415.96s)]
*  But you'll see a bear and it'll just walk around and it just fucks everybody up. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=417.96s)]
*  But then when there's a bear that's as big as it, it starts to question and it might [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=423.96s)]
*  cower down. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=428.96s)]
*  But in this situation, Mike Tyson is not going to cower down the Lennox Lewis. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=429.96s)]
*  So he bites him. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=432.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=434.96s)]
*  He bites him. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=435.96s)]
*  He probably fell down. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=436.96s)]
*  I'm going to tell you one thing. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=438.96s)]
*  I'll tell you this right now. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=439.96s)]
*  When I was in that press fight with John Jones, I was still undefeated at the time. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=440.96s)]
*  And we were at the MGM Grand and he head butted me, like put his head on me. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=446.96s)]
*  So I push him. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=451.96s)]
*  He's an alpha male too. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=452.96s)]
*  So the fucker attacks me. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=453.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=455.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=456.96s)]
*  So we get to fighting. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=457.96s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=458.96s)]
*  So we get to fighting. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=459.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=462.96s)]
*  And we're fighting and Joe, the security guard from the UFC falls under me. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=463.96s)]
*  But now I'm on my back as we go flying off the stage. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=469.96s)]
*  I will say that was a good thought to bite the motherfucker. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=472.96s)]
*  What am I doing on my back? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=476.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=479.96s)]
*  I'm losing. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=480.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=481.96s)]
*  You're going to bite the son of a bitch. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=482.96s)]
*  I ain't got no mouthpiece in my mouth. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=485.96s)]
*  And if I would have bit him, that would have been like a reaction for a guy that usually [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=488.96s)]
*  will walk around in most places around this world as the alpha. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=494.96s)]
*  And then when he finds himself on the bottom as the alpha, he's got to find a way to survive. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=498.96s)]
*  So that's what Mike Tyson would do. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=503.96s)]
*  He would go as primal as he could think. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=504.96s)]
*  How do I survive? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=507.96s)]
*  It was always survival with this guy. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=508.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=510.96s)]
*  And if I would have bit him, you'd have been like, DC bit him, but it's not the first time [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=511.96s)]
*  we saw somebody bite a motherfucker down there. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=515.96s)]
*  Because Mike Tyson did it three times. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=517.96s)]
*  It's like you're so unfamiliar. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=519.96s)]
*  I told my kids the other day at wrestling practice, Joe, I said, my whole life I feared [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=522.96s)]
*  getting pinned so much that I don't even sleep on my back to this day. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=528.96s)]
*  I said, I fell asleep on my back one day and woke up in a full panic attack. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=532.96s)]
*  Jones had me on my back, man. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=543.96s)]
*  That shit's unfamiliar. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=544.96s)]
*  So if I would have did some crazy shit, that's just what would have happened. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=545.96s)]
*  That's what would have happened. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=548.96s)]
*  Because you don't go to your back. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=549.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=551.96s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=552.96s)]
*  You can't sleep on your back. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=553.96s)]
*  You can sleep on your back? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=554.96s)]
*  No, I snore too loud when I sleep. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=556.96s)]
*  I cannot sleep on my back. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=558.96s)]
*  I really have trained myself to where I'm like, I'm getting pinned. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=560.96s)]
*  I don't let the kids in my restroom. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=565.96s)]
*  That's so wild. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=570.96s)]
*  I don't let my kids, when I'm talking, and if they lay back, get off your back. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=571.96s)]
*  If they're stretching, I'm like, don't stay on your back too long. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=576.96s)]
*  I try to trick them in their mind that their back is literally the worst place in the world. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=580.96s)]
*  And that's what my coach did to me. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=586.96s)]
*  Everything I did, get off your back. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=589.96s)]
*  Get off your back. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=591.96s)]
*  Then he would lock me on my fucking back. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=592.96s)]
*  He would get dudes lined up in high school and college and an arm triangle, which is the worst. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=593.96s)]
*  You can't breathe. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=601.96s)]
*  It's a headlock in wrestling, right? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=602.96s)]
*  You obviously don't go chest down. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=604.96s)]
*  You're trying to pin them. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=605.96s)]
*  He would put me on my back in those situations with my fresh partners, and I would have to get off my back not to get pinned. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=606.96s)]
*  So I just never got pinned in my whole career. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=612.96s)]
*  I wrestled from 10 to 30, and I might have got pinned like three or four times in all those years because I was just so afraid of going to my... [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=615.96s)]
*  I just never got pinned. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=625.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=626.96s)]
*  I'm trying to implement that into my kids. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=627.96s)]
*  It makes sense. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=629.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=630.96s)]
*  It totally makes sense if you make it the utmost priority. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=631.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=633.96s)]
*  Because you've talked about this before that you see sometimes when guys get tired, they accept positions too easy. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=634.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=639.96s)]
*  And when they go to the back, they don't immediately scramble. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=640.96s)]
*  They don't immediately try to get an angle or an underhook or something. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=642.96s)]
*  You'll see them accept the position. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=644.96s)]
*  And then it's too late. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=646.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's too late. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=647.96s)]
*  When you're fighting or in those situations, you've got to address it now or you're done. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=648.96s)]
*  So when we're doing commentary and we're talking about the fight and somebody gets taken down and a guy starts to get into the positions where I get quiet because you're better there, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=656.96s)]
*  and you start walking through the submissions, how it's getting set up. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=668.96s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, this dude's done. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=671.96s)]
*  The guy on top is waiting. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=673.96s)]
*  He's taking too long to address what's happening. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=674.96s)]
*  And the next thing you know, oh, my God, triangle, right? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=677.96s)]
*  Because it's not just when the legs go up. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=680.96s)]
*  You're like, this dude's starting to... [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=682.96s)]
*  He's starting to set up a triangle. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=683.96s)]
*  And I'm like, he is, right? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=685.96s)]
*  He's waiting. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=688.96s)]
*  You got to always be in motion. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=689.96s)]
*  You got to always be kind of thinking about the next step. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=691.96s)]
*  Are you screwed? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=694.96s)]
*  If you start accepting, you're screwed. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=695.96s)]
*  When you look at the guys that are really good at MMA submissions off their back, like Olivera, Olivera's real good. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=696.96s)]
*  It's so crisp, though. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=703.96s)]
*  When he gets those moments, those openings, just crisp. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=704.96s)]
*  Yep. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=707.96s)]
*  Right away. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=708.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=709.96s)]
*  He finds those arm bars and triangles and he cinches submissions up so quick. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=710.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=716.96s)]
*  So quick. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=717.96s)]
*  One of the quickest guys, I mean, does he have the most submissions in the history of the sport? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=718.96s)]
*  Yeah, he does. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=721.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=722.96s)]
*  Like 20. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=723.96s)]
*  They're so quick, man. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=724.96s)]
*  The technique is so smooth. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=725.96s)]
*  How do you have 20 submissions? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=727.96s)]
*  How do you submit 20 of the most dangerous people in the world? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=728.96s)]
*  This dude's a beast. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=731.96s)]
*  I remember his first submission win in the UFC with Efrain Escudero. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=732.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=736.96s)]
*  Remember he hopped on his back? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=737.96s)]
*  You know, that was here. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=738.96s)]
*  Was it here? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=739.96s)]
*  That was actually in Austin, I believe. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=740.96s)]
*  There was a guy that came into a meeting today and said, my first pro fight was in Texas. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=741.96s)]
*  He saw I watched Efrain Escudero fight against Charles Olivares. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=746.96s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=751.96s)]
*  But he's a beast, man. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=752.96s)]
*  These dudes are, the fighters today are just crazy. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=753.96s)]
*  They keep getting better. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=757.96s)]
*  It's next level every time. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=759.96s)]
*  Every time. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=762.96s)]
*  Every time. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=763.96s)]
*  I bet when you go back, because you do a lot of rewatching fights, when you go back to [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=764.96s)]
*  the days before, whenever I was watching as a fan, thinking, unbelievable to watch Chuck [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=770.36s)]
*  Liddell and Tito Ortiz and these guys fighting. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=776.4000000000001s)]
*  The way that they fought today, it's like prehistoric. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=780.2s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=785.9200000000001s)]
*  The skill level. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=787.5200000000001s)]
*  The difference. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=788.6400000000001s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=789.6400000000001s)]
*  It's like they're faster, they're bigger, they're stronger, they're more advanced, the [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=790.6400000000001s)]
*  techniques are better. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=794.6s)]
*  It happens in every sport, right? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=796.4000000000001s)]
*  But in MMA now, you're seeing it. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=797.72s)]
*  Chuck was just like a marauder. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=800.5200000000001s)]
*  He was crazy, wasn't he? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=802.48s)]
*  He was a marauder. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=803.48s)]
*  I mean, the thing about Chuck was he had an iron chin. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=804.48s)]
*  He did. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=807.72s)]
*  And he was not scared to take shots. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=809.12s)]
*  He would just wade into the fire. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=811.1600000000001s)]
*  He was very skillful. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=812.84s)]
*  He was very skillful. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=813.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=814.84s)]
*  But he was also willing to put himself in danger. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=815.84s)]
*  He also knew that if you hit him, he could take it. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=817.52s)]
*  But if he got to you, you were going down. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=821.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=823.6800000000001s)]
*  He had full confidence in his power. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=824.6800000000001s)]
*  Or it would affect you so much that you would start to kind of turn away and then you're [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=825.6800000000001s)]
*  fucked. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=829.6800000000001s)]
*  Then he would get you. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=830.6800000000001s)]
*  You remember the Babalu fight? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=831.6800000000001s)]
*  Dude, I swear to God, Joe, when I was in Stillwater, Oklahoma, I was on my Olympic run. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=832.6800000000001s)]
*  You guys were doing a few pay-per-views a year. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=839.64s)]
*  It wasn't every month like we do today. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=842.56s)]
*  I think it was four, five a year. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=844.16s)]
*  I don't remember how many we did. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=846.36s)]
*  But it wasn't many. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=847.68s)]
*  And it became, who's Chuck Liddell beating this time? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=848.68s)]
*  That really was the pay-per-view. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=852.76s)]
*  Is he beating Babalu this time? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=855.28s)]
*  Is he beating Randy this time? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=856.8s)]
*  Is he beating Randy? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=858.4s)]
*  Who's he going to beat this time on the pay-per-view? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=859.4s)]
*  Because he was massive. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=862.68s)]
*  He was the biggest star. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=863.68s)]
*  He was going through his run as a champion. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=864.7199999999999s)]
*  He was a motherfucker, dude. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=867.0s)]
*  He was a scary guy. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=868.68s)]
*  F**ker was in shape, too. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=869.68s)]
*  Very good shape. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=870.68s)]
*  Dude, he was in shape. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=871.68s)]
*  Well, Hakelman, John Hakelman from the pit. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=872.68s)]
*  Yeah, he's a psycho. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=874.68s)]
*  That guy, he's a psycho. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=875.68s)]
*  He's a great psycho. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=876.68s)]
*  I love that dude. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=877.68s)]
*  But that guy was one of the first guys to implement really unusual training, like wheel [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=878.68s)]
*  barrels filled with rocks and shit, pushing them uphill. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=884.3399999999999s)]
*  That pit, that training center that he had in San Luis Obispo. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=888.3s)]
*  It looked like it was outdoor. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=891.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the cage was outdoors. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=892.0799999999999s)]
*  I always looked at it like, are these guys training outside? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=894.88s)]
*  Hakelman's funny, man. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=897.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=898.16s)]
*  He's a fun dude. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=899.16s)]
*  But he just was the first to realize that functional training. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=900.16s)]
*  Yep, functional training. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=903.88s)]
*  This kind of work, those really hard physical work along with technique. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=905.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=909.8399999999999s)]
*  It's interesting when you go back to the pioneers, how they all had it figured out on their own. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=910.8399999999999s)]
*  And that's what it was. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=916.04s)]
*  Like, Miletich figured it out on their own. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=917.04s)]
*  The Lions Den did it their way. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=918.52s)]
*  And Miletich trained a bunch of champions. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=921.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=923.16s)]
*  They had the best. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=925.04s)]
*  Pover, Robbie was in that gym. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=926.04s)]
*  Matt Hughes was in that gym. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=929.8s)]
*  Tim Sylvia was in that gym. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=931.24s)]
*  They all were in that same gym. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=932.92s)]
*  Bro, the Tim Sylvia that knocked out Rico Rodriguez was a scary man. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=934.24s)]
*  A big dude, too. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=938.04s)]
*  He was jacked back then, too. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=939.04s)]
*  Remember how jacked he got? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=941.04s)]
*  Yeah, he was big. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=942.36s)]
*  This is pre-USADA. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=943.36s)]
*  Remember those days? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=944.36s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=945.36s)]
*  Everybody was saucy. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=946.36s)]
*  And USADA's going again. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=947.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=948.36s)]
*  USADA's going again. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=949.36s)]
*  Yeah, but they're going to have a new program. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=950.36s)]
*  But they're going to have a testing program. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=951.36s)]
*  Yeah, they're going to have a testing program. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=952.36s)]
*  So back to those days. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=953.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think they're going to let them use peptides, which I think is a mistake. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=954.5600000000001s)]
*  I always told people, I said, I fought guys on steroids early in my career. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=958.16s)]
*  You had to. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=964.4s)]
*  I honestly don't ever recall taking a test when I was in strike force. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=965.4s)]
*  10, 11, 12. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=969.48s)]
*  Nope. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=971.8000000000001s)]
*  Drug test? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=972.8000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=973.8000000000001s)]
*  I never in my life took a drug test. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=974.8000000000001s)]
*  I never did. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=975.8000000000001s)]
*  I never took anything, but I never got tested. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=976.8000000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=978.64s)]
*  So I was like, somebody was doing something. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=979.64s)]
*  Of course. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=980.96s)]
*  And then they suspend poor Nick Diaz for weed. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=982.5600000000001s)]
*  For like five years. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=984.96s)]
*  They gave him like a five year suspension for weed. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=985.96s)]
*  Listen, the best example of all time clearly is Alistair when he was fighting Brock. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=987.96s)]
*  Bro, did you see that dude? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=992.84s)]
*  What was that? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=994.6800000000001s)]
*  He was a superhero. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=995.6800000000001s)]
*  That was UFC. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=996.6800000000001s)]
*  No, yeah, he fought him before even in strike force. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=997.6800000000001s)]
*  When he was beating them dudes up in strike force. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1001.48s)]
*  Oh yeah, when he was beating dudes up in strike force. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1003.1600000000001s)]
*  Oh, when he kicked Brock in the side though. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1004.1600000000001s)]
*  Bro, he was so terrifying when he was saucy. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1006.5600000000001s)]
*  When he was like full Alistair Ream, 265. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1010.2s)]
*  I know, it's crazy, he's a vegan now. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1014.5600000000001s)]
*  That's what he's like, not eating meat anymore. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1016.6800000000001s)]
*  No, no meat. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1018.36s)]
*  That's impossible. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1019.36s)]
*  And he's weighs like 190 it looks like. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1020.36s)]
*  Yeah, there he is. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1022.8000000000001s)]
*  This is uber Ream, son. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1023.8000000000001s)]
*  Look at him in the dream, look at him in the dream. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1024.8s)]
*  Look at him in the dream. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1025.8s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1026.8s)]
*  Uber Ream was a motherfucker. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1027.8s)]
*  But it's like that's, I mean, you need a bunch of things to be uber Ream. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1031.96s)]
*  Obviously you need talent. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1036.48s)]
*  You gotta have skill too. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1037.8400000000001s)]
*  He was really good. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1038.8400000000001s)]
*  Also, just tough as shit and not afraid. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1040.6s)]
*  I mean, that guy got KO'd a bunch of times and always fought, just always fought like [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1042.8s)]
*  a warrior. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1049.48s)]
*  You know what the problem with that was with Alistair though? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1050.48s)]
*  You could see when he stopped because he wasn't as sure of himself. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1055.76s)]
*  He had become so reliant on those abilities that, not even the ability, because he never [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1060.6s)]
*  lost the ability. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1065.24s)]
*  He had become reliable on the comfort of knowing the stuff that he had done prior would make [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1066.6s)]
*  sure he's not tired. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1072.04s)]
*  He was more in shape. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1073.5s)]
*  He had more muscle. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1074.5s)]
*  He had more muscle and it messed with him towards the end of his career. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1075.5s)]
*  Of course, it had to. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1078.76s)]
*  It has to. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1079.76s)]
*  He had to know what an advantage it was having it. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1080.76s)]
*  Look if he had come along in an era of no testing, he goes down as one of the greatest [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1082.6799999999998s)]
*  heavyweights of all time. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1087.6s)]
*  Of all time. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1088.6s)]
*  And he still is. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1089.6s)]
*  I still think he is. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1090.6s)]
*  Yeah, I still think he's one of the best of all time. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1091.6s)]
*  He's a great fighter, man. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1092.6s)]
*  Dude, he won everything. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1093.6s)]
*  When you win everywhere. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1095.76s)]
*  K-1 Grand Prix. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1097.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1098.36s)]
*  I mean, that is wild. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1099.36s)]
*  When you win everywhere, you got skill. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1100.56s)]
*  You won in the Elite XC, you won in Strike Force, you won in the UFC, you won in K-1, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1103.12s)]
*  you won in Glory. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1107.92s)]
*  And he never even hurt Stipe. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1108.92s)]
*  He had Stipe. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1110.48s)]
*  He had Stipe for a moment there. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1111.48s)]
*  He had him bad. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1113.48s)]
*  He just made a couple of errors and Stipe is a survivor. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1114.48s)]
*  You can't make no mistake against Milicic. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1117.64s)]
*  He's a tough one. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1119.56s)]
*  He's a survivor. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1120.56s)]
*  Yeah, he's tough. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1121.56s)]
*  He's so tough. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1122.56s)]
*  Yeah, he's very tough. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1123.56s)]
*  I was like, no. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1125.36s)]
*  I know. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1126.36s)]
*  We were looking forward to it. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1127.36s)]
*  Have you ever had an injury like that where it's torn off the bone? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1129.48s)]
*  No, it was a very odd injury for me to watch too because it didn't seem like it was like, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1132.32s)]
*  like you know, grappling, wrestling, we get extended a lot, right? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1137.6s)]
*  So when you're going and you're doing your jujitsu and you and I are going and you take [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1143.36s)]
*  and you're in half guard, right? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1148.62s)]
*  Every time I go to get up, I build to my elbow. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1151.7s)]
*  I get to my underhook. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1154.8400000000001s)]
*  I'll take a single leg. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1155.8400000000001s)]
*  You'll sprawl because you got to take your leg away from me. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1157.54s)]
*  When I'm up on my elbow and I get to my half guard and I'm on the butt here, I will always [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1160.8s)]
*  go to a single because I'm a wrestler. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1165.06s)]
*  You will sprawl and then try to go back behind me. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1167.3s)]
*  My arm gets extended every time. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1170.5s)]
*  And that's kind of what happened with Jones. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1173.5s)]
*  It's like he was in an underhook and the guy sprawled a little bit and then his arm came [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1174.9s)]
*  away from his body and it ripped and it's unfortunate. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1178.72s)]
*  But do you think that I know John has been doing a lot of heavy lifting to get up to [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1182.7s)]
*  heavy weight that and the extra weight, right? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1189.42s)]
*  He's carrying all that extra weight. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1191.84s)]
*  He's lifting all that weight. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1193.16s)]
*  And it's like you got to develop muscle, but it's got to be usable muscle. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1194.16s)]
*  You can't just be big. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1198.02s)]
*  Well, the other thing is if you're not doing anything, like if you're not taking anything, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1199.02s)]
*  then your recovery from like really heavy power lifts is kind of significant. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1204.2s)]
*  Didn't he lift like 600 pounds or something? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1210.76s)]
*  He's strong as fuck. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1212.8s)]
*  He's strong as fuck. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1213.8s)]
*  He looks very big now. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1215.0800000000002s)]
*  Like he looks like a heavyweight. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1216.8400000000001s)]
*  But I just wonder how much weightlifting do you have to do to maintain that frame? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1218.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1222.4s)]
*  Well, he was strong. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1223.4s)]
*  He was always strong. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1224.4s)]
*  When we fought, he was strong. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1225.4s)]
*  Like he was strong. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1226.4s)]
*  Leverage. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1227.56s)]
*  Great with his leverage. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1228.76s)]
*  The way he was able to manipulate positions, because I thought without a shadow of a doubt [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1230.96s)]
*  that I would take him down at will, but it's hard. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1236.32s)]
*  Even if you get a take down, it's hard against the best guys. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1240.96s)]
*  I picked Steve A up, I threw him down, held him down for the whole first round. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1244.44s)]
*  And then he got up because we got to start again. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1248.52s)]
*  So now I got to start that process all over again. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1252.16s)]
*  And that's why Habib Nirmangar Mehta was so special because it didn't matter how many [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1254.88s)]
*  times he had to restart the process. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1258.62s)]
*  He went right back to doing that with his opponent knowing that he was going to throw [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1260.26s)]
*  you to the ground. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1264.54s)]
*  So when you're fighting guys like Jones, he's so tall, he's so rangy, and he just understood [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1265.8999999999999s)]
*  fighting. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1271.3799999999999s)]
*  The guy just understands fighting. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1273.02s)]
*  And it makes him hard to deal with. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1274.82s)]
*  And then Joe, when you get in a clinch with this dude, he's so tall that it's almost like [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1276.9799999999998s)]
*  you're holding him up if you're the shorter fighter. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1285.2199999999998s)]
*  He's like draping over the top of you. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1288.38s)]
*  And that is what fatigues you. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1290.5800000000002s)]
*  Because when I'm clinching, you know, I fought there a ton, like in the clinch, punch, punch, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1292.8600000000001s)]
*  punch. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1297.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm trying to break your posture. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1298.6200000000001s)]
*  He doesn't do that. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1300.3000000000002s)]
*  He pushes you against the octagon and then he leans. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1301.3000000000002s)]
*  So now you're carrying 220 with your weight up against the octagon and it's like, and [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1304.2600000000002s)]
*  then he's changing level and he's spinning trying to elbow you. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1309.3400000000001s)]
*  The dude just understands fighting and understands how to maneuver his body to fatigue you. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1312.2600000000002s)]
*  He also is the best at managing distance. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1318.46s)]
*  Oh gosh, it hurts so bad trying to get close to him. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1320.98s)]
*  I tell you that, hey, dude, it hurts so bad. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1324.34s)]
*  It hurts so bad. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1327.26s)]
*  The kicks to the body and the knees, because you know me, like me and Kane were forward, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1329.18s)]
*  forward, forward, head movement, get close, punch, punch, punch, take you down. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1333.78s)]
*  But with him, he was a southpaw, so his lead leg was right there, so I wanted to grab a [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1338.74s)]
*  single leg. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1342.78s)]
*  But this dude would be stepping back kneeing me. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1343.86s)]
*  Knee in me. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1346.34s)]
*  Knee in me. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1347.34s)]
*  And then I'll be like, okay, so I need to stop going forward. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1348.34s)]
*  So now I'm at range and he blasts body kick and then body kick. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1350.78s)]
*  So now you're like, shit, I'm not going to stay on the end of these body kicks because [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1354.4199999999998s)]
*  they hurt. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1357.1399999999999s)]
*  So then you get close and he knees you. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1358.1399999999999s)]
*  So it's like you're landing and I'm hitting him, but he's hitting me with things that [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1360.22s)]
*  may not be as big, like my hand overhand, right, looks big, but that knee just goes [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1366.1799999999998s)]
*  boom, right in the rib every time. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1370.62s)]
*  Boom, right in the rib. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1372.22s)]
*  And then every now and again, they catch you right in the middle. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1373.46s)]
*  That shit hurts bad, man. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1376.74s)]
*  I don't even know how the hell I was going through all that in that octagon because now [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1378.74s)]
*  it hurts. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1383.82s)]
*  It hurts. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1384.82s)]
*  It hurts. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1385.82s)]
*  Alex Pereira kicked my leg. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1386.82s)]
*  I was like, this shit hurts. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1388.58s)]
*  That dude has the weirdest leg kicks. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1390.54s)]
*  They're so sneaky. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1393.74s)]
*  My cousin had the greatest analogy for Pereira. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1395.74s)]
*  He goes, he is Thanos literally just collecting fucking stones, infinity stones. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1400.86s)]
*  He's like, he goes, I love Marvel. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1409.34s)]
*  He goes, it was like when Thanos showed up and he's just collecting infinity stones. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1413.1s)]
*  There's a timeline. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1417.54s)]
*  You know there's a bad guy, bad guy. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1419.06s)]
*  And then there's this ultimate bad guy who was just in some fucking bar in Brazil and [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1420.9399999999998s)]
*  it is he had to open his mouth. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1425.62s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1431.54s)]
*  If Izzy just shut the fuck up, he would have stayed where he was. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1432.54s)]
*  But I mean, it's like a delayed reaction on the kick. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1435.9399999999998s)]
*  But if Izzy would have just shut up, this dude would have stayed in Brazil. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1441.2199999999998s)]
*  That dude is so sneaky with that kick. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1445.6599999999999s)]
*  And if you get too close, he's going to punch you. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1448.4599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1450.3799999999999s)]
*  Well, he's so long and he's also so odd in his striking movements. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1451.3799999999999s)]
*  He's like this tall. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1456.34s)]
*  He's tall. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1457.34s)]
*  They're very odd. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1458.34s)]
*  And if you get close to the right hand, even that thing he does when he's walking out and [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1459.34s)]
*  he does this little thing and he throws this combination, it doesn't look fluid. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1463.1s)]
*  He's like boom, boom, boom. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1467.9399999999998s)]
*  But you know, like if that dude hits you with that, you're going to sleep. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1469.82s)]
*  He goes to sleep. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1472.58s)]
*  Everybody goes to sleep. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1473.58s)]
*  Yuri's in there dancing and shit. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1474.58s)]
*  Yuri's like doing all kind of like weird stuff, right? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1476.1s)]
*  And Alex is like. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1478.82s)]
*  Just stone face. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1480.4199999999998s)]
*  Stone face. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1481.4199999999998s)]
*  Like I'm going to. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1482.4199999999998s)]
*  It was one of the greatest stare downs ever. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1483.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm going to kill you is what he's thinking. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1484.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm going to punch your weird ass. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1488.78s)]
*  I'm going to kill you. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1490.06s)]
*  Who's the guy that he scissor kicked? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1491.26s)]
*  He scissor kneed? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1493.26s)]
*  Michaelitis? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1494.26s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1495.26s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1496.26s)]
*  I thought you were lying, bro. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1497.26s)]
*  I thought you were lying. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1498.26s)]
*  The whole time, Joe, I'm sitting to your right. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1499.26s)]
*  I'm like, man, Joe Rogan up in here lying to me. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1505.02s)]
*  He telling me this dude, this good. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1507.78s)]
*  He's this. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1509.82s)]
*  You see, I'm telling you, because I'll be honest with you, I had watched him a little [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1510.82s)]
*  bit. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1514.5s)]
*  I hadn't watched all of his kickbox and I was like, I was like, OK, this dude's supposed [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1515.58s)]
*  to be good. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1518.9s)]
*  Let me watch a little bit. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1519.9s)]
*  I don't. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1521.26s)]
*  It's kickboxing. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1522.26s)]
*  And you come in and you're like, DC, wait until you see this Pereira in real life. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1523.26s)]
*  And I'm like, OK, he's good. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1528.02s)]
*  DC might be the best kickboxer that we've ever had. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1529.66s)]
*  Well, Izzy's here. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1532.34s)]
*  You know, like Izzy's here. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1534.14s)]
*  He knocked out Izzy twice. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1535.34s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1536.34s)]
*  Knocked him out once. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1537.34s)]
*  Or knocked him out once. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1538.34s)]
*  Beat him by decision. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1539.34s)]
*  And I'm like, they hit that. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1540.34s)]
*  And then he does that. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1541.34s)]
*  And I look over and I go, oh my God, you're telling the truth. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1542.34s)]
*  Dude, he's something fierce. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1545.58s)]
*  I mean, this is Sean Strickland. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1547.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1549.1799999999998s)]
*  Right? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1550.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1551.1799999999998s)]
*  With a left hook. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1552.1799999999998s)]
*  With a left hook. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1553.1799999999998s)]
*  I mean, the guy who's now the middleweight champion. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1554.1799999999998s)]
*  Champion of the world. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1555.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1556.1799999999998s)]
*  And he took him out Izzy. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1557.1799999999998s)]
*  A year. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1558.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1559.1799999999998s)]
*  He was the champ in a year. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1560.1799999999998s)]
*  Dude, he's got two world titles and 11 fights. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1561.1799999999998s)]
*  In two years. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1563.34s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1564.34s)]
*  He's been in the UFC. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1565.34s)]
*  Dude, I don't know Joe if we had, and he's here in Austin. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1566.34s)]
*  So I'm going to go hang out with him later. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1569.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm going to see Pereira. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1570.9399999999998s)]
*  I like him. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1572.22s)]
*  I love that dude. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1573.22s)]
*  He smiles. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1574.22s)]
*  He actually smiles before. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1576.1000000000001s)]
*  He just didn't smile. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1577.1000000000001s)]
*  Now he smiles. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1578.1000000000001s)]
*  I just don't think he wants to smile after fights or before fights. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1579.1000000000001s)]
*  He just wants to fight. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1581.78s)]
*  Stays cold. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1583.46s)]
*  He's there for a reason. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1584.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1585.46s)]
*  To just beat somebody's ass. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1586.46s)]
*  He was so extraordinary in kickboxing. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1587.46s)]
*  When I watched him in kickboxing, some dudes just have some extra gear, some extra power. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1589.6200000000001s)]
*  It was shocking. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1596.74s)]
*  He would hit guys, boom, and they would just like skip up and flatline. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1597.74s)]
*  With 10 ounce gloves. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1602.02s)]
*  Fuck man. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1603.02s)]
*  He's doing it to everybody. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1604.02s)]
*  He's connecting on is going night night. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1605.82s)]
*  And he does it in two different weight classes simultaneously. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1607.78s)]
*  So when that guy was going to fight MMA, I'm like, hold on baby. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1612.3799999999999s)]
*  Because this is going to be some wild shit. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1617.22s)]
*  He was an extraordinary dude. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1619.62s)]
*  And he was three in one when he made his debut on N. Madison Square Garden. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1621.3799999999999s)]
*  And you knew that if he was able to win a couple, he would rush him to Izzy. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1625.82s)]
*  And he got there and he beat him. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1630.22s)]
*  I still now, I don't know how Izzy beat that dude, man. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1632.42s)]
*  He caught him perfect. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1637.38s)]
*  He caught him. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1638.38s)]
*  If that fight would have kept going, I don't think Izzy was going to win. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1639.38s)]
*  He was hurting Izzy bad. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1642.3000000000002s)]
*  That leg was fucked up already. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1643.8200000000002s)]
*  It was done. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1644.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1645.98s)]
*  It's crazy how good he is at that. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1646.98s)]
*  It takes like two or three. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1648.1000000000001s)]
*  He doesn't move his hips. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1649.1000000000001s)]
*  The way he does it is so beautiful because there's no telegraphing at all. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1651.18s)]
*  He just move in there and slap. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1655.3000000000002s)]
*  You got one, two in there, three. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1658.34s)]
*  And you start seeing the welts. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1660.62s)]
*  Here he had a big weld on his leg. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1662.62s)]
*  You know what's the worst? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1664.42s)]
*  It's like, you train a certain way. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1665.42s)]
*  When I first started fighting, I would train Southpaw something because it's your fast [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1669.3799999999999s)]
*  hand. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1674.5s)]
*  And then Kane kicked me in the face. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1675.5s)]
*  And I blew my nose out. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1677.74s)]
*  I said, I'm never fighting Southpaw again. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1680.06s)]
*  You don't see stuff as well. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1683.98s)]
*  It's not natural. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1685.1399999999999s)]
*  So I always stayed conventional. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1686.38s)]
*  Most do that. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1690.3400000000001s)]
*  But then because you don't train in that off stance, you fight Pereira, next thing you [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1691.46s)]
*  know he's got your leg beat up. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1696.6200000000001s)]
*  You're switching to Southpaw, which is what Yuri did. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1698.0600000000002s)]
*  Yuri's not a Southpaw. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1700.6200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1701.6200000000001s)]
*  Yuri doesn't fight Southpaw. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1702.6200000000001s)]
*  Now you're fighting in a fight stance that's unfamiliar against one of the most dangerous [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1703.6200000000001s)]
*  men in the world. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1707.1000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1708.1000000000001s)]
*  How are you supposed to fight him? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1709.1000000000001s)]
*  And you have a compromised leg. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1710.1000000000001s)]
*  And you're compromised. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1711.1000000000001s)]
*  So you're not going to be able to move as quickly. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1712.1000000000001s)]
*  Because you're not doing it on your terms. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1713.66s)]
*  You're switching on his terms. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1715.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1716.98s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1717.74s)]
*  And once those calves get chopped a few times, only they know how compromised that leg is. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1718.74s)]
*  It hurts. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1725.14s)]
*  Izzy's leg in the first fight he said was fucked up after the first round. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1726.14s)]
*  They're always on crutches and in wheelchairs. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1729.38s)]
*  When they're done with him, people don't see this. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1731.6200000000001s)]
*  When we're leaving the arena, these guys are either getting wheeled to the post-fight press [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1734.06s)]
*  conference or wheeled to the ambulance because their legs are so jacked up. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1739.74s)]
*  He tears their legs up. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1744.06s)]
*  It's bad. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1745.74s)]
*  Tears their legs up. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1746.74s)]
*  It's bad. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1747.74s)]
*  And he's just so efficient with it. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1748.74s)]
*  What a hard style to emulate as a sparring partner. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1751.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1754.54s)]
*  Especially since he really still can't wrestle. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1755.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1757.54s)]
*  Think about all the success he's had and he still can't wrestle. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1758.54s)]
*  Some of these takedowns he gets taken down with is like, he still hasn't developed to [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1761.1s)]
*  the point that a real good wrestler wouldn't try to take him down over and over again. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1765.22s)]
*  But you could never get there because he knocked you out. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1769.46s)]
*  You know what else is shocking? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1771.66s)]
*  He never seemed drained at 85. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1774.42s)]
*  How was he making that weight though? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1777.5s)]
*  How was he making that weight? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1778.78s)]
*  And now when he's fighting at 205, it's seemingly more durable. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1779.94s)]
*  He looks the same. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1784.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1786.3400000000001s)]
*  He does not. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1787.3400000000001s)]
*  20 pounds lighter, he looks the same. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1788.3400000000001s)]
*  He does. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1791.66s)]
*  He really does look the same. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1792.66s)]
*  That's how big he was when he was fighting. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1793.66s)]
*  This guy had to be getting up to 215 whenever he was making 85. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1795.3400000000001s)]
*  I think it was heavier. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1797.9s)]
*  One of the fights I said it was 226, I believe. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1799.6200000000001s)]
*  226 in the octagon at 185. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1801.8999999999999s)]
*  Find out whether it was after the fight or the day of the fight. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1804.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he went, that was like what he was walking around at. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1808.9399999999998s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1812.78s)]
*  That's so big. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1813.78s)]
*  It's not fair, man. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1815.3s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1816.3s)]
*  You know, that power that he has. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1817.3s)]
*  But I think also, I mean, you'd be the best person to ask about this. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1819.8999999999999s)]
*  When you see guys that cut a lot of weight, it seems like it's harder for them to take [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1824.3799999999999s)]
*  shots. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1828.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1829.86s)]
*  I remember watching the Davidson Figaro today. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1830.86s)]
*  I said, remember by the end of the Moreno trilogy, our fourth fight, every time Brandon [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1832.3s)]
*  hit him, it looked like it hurt him. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1837.26s)]
*  And Davidson was never a guy that had chin problems. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1839.4199999999998s)]
*  But he's going up to 135 now this weekend. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1842.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Rob Font. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1845.26s)]
*  Yes, against Rob Font. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1846.26s)]
*  So it's like, is he going to be more durable? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1847.26s)]
*  Is he going to be better at taking shots now? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1850.54s)]
*  Because he was, I mean, TJ Dillashaw, when he went to 125, he was a shell of himself. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1853.8999999999999s)]
*  That was a terrifying weight cut too. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1858.86s)]
*  God, he looked like dead man walking. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1861.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1863.2199999999998s)]
*  He looked like someone who was dying. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1864.2199999999998s)]
*  Do you, did you, what do you think? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1865.2199999999998s)]
*  As a fighter, I actually liked the afternoon weigh-in better. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1868.1399999999999s)]
*  I liked the afternoon weigh-in opposed to the morning weigh-in. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1873.26s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1876.54s)]
*  More time and sleep, sleep. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1877.9399999999998s)]
*  The night before you got to sleep. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1880.9599999999998s)]
*  Because if you woke up at seven, eight over, you had all day Friday to make the weight. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1882.8799999999999s)]
*  On fight day. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1888.5s)]
*  Yeah, 219 on fight day. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1889.5s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1890.5s)]
*  What, that's 25 pounds, bro. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1891.5s)]
*  That's so big. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1893.5s)]
*  That's 25 pounds. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1895.78s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1897.78s)]
*  That's really nuts. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1898.78s)]
*  But again, that's because they have so much time though. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1899.78s)]
*  Because if he weighs in at 11 a.m. on Friday morning, now he's got 24 hours. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1903.1399999999999s)]
*  Now he's got, he's in the main event. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1909.18s)]
*  So this dude is not fighting for probably 35 hours after he steps on the scale. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1911.64s)]
*  You can gain 25 pounds in 35 hours. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1918.2s)]
*  I think that's 35 pounds, right? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1919.96s)]
*  That's 35 pounds? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1922.96s)]
*  35 pounds. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1923.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1924.96s)]
*  That's 35 pounds in a day. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1925.96s)]
*  That's bananas. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1928.48s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1929.48s)]
*  35 pounds is insane. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1930.48s)]
*  I can't. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1931.48s)]
*  Think at 35 steaks. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1932.48s)]
*  I actually can't, I can't, I can't at 35. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1933.48s)]
*  Just think of 35 steaks stacked up. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1935.48s)]
*  And then you take that out of your body. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1937.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1942.0s)]
*  I mean, it would be up to here. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1943.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1944.9199999999998s)]
*  35 steaks. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1945.9199999999998s)]
*  It would be up to there. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1946.9199999999998s)]
*  Insane. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1947.9199999999998s)]
*  That's 16 ounce steaks. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1948.9199999999998s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1949.9199999999998s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1950.9199999999998s)]
*  What do you think, do you think it's possible to ever come to a point where there's no weight [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1951.9199999999998s)]
*  class or there's no weight cutting at all? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1955.8799999999999s)]
*  There's more weight classes, more options, but people fight at their natural weight. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1958.6399999999999s)]
*  You see what, you see one of the problems with that is if there are more belts, they [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1963.24s)]
*  kind of becomes boxing a little bit and it could be a little watered down because now [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1971.1200000000001s)]
*  you got to champion every 10 pounds. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1974.7600000000002s)]
*  So you don't know if you got the best guy as the champ. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1977.6000000000001s)]
*  Right now you're pretty sure that the UFC champion is the best fighter in the world [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1980.94s)]
*  anywhere between 135 to 155, 160. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1985.4s)]
*  You know those guys that weigh that naturally. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1989.96s)]
*  The guy in the UFC is the best fighter in the world. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1992.96s)]
*  55 between 55 and 85, 90 you have the best fighter. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1995.5200000000002s)]
*  And I'm talking lightweights, they cut from 185, 180. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=1999.68s)]
*  So to get to 155. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2004.64s)]
*  So you know you're getting the best fighter of all men around those weights in that weight [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2007.5600000000002s)]
*  class. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2014.04s)]
*  But if you get a 65, 55, 45, 35, 25, I don't know that it works. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2015.04s)]
*  I really don't know that it works. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2020.96s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2022.8400000000001s)]
*  I could see your point, but there's some people that are definitely tweeners, right? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2024.52s)]
*  Al Jermain Sterling. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2029.28s)]
*  Al Jermain Sterling. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2030.28s)]
*  He is one of them. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2031.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2032.28s)]
*  But is he though? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2033.28s)]
*  Because he was the champion at 35. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2034.28s)]
*  But killed himself to get there. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2035.28s)]
*  I know, but he still had endurance. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2037.36s)]
*  And I always felt like if you're going to have an example of weight cutting, I always [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2039.72s)]
*  felt like Al Jermain had the perfect frame for 35. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2042.56s)]
*  Yes, he does. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2045.08s)]
*  Because he's so big and strong and manages to get there and then he puts it right back [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2046.08s)]
*  on. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2049.84s)]
*  And then when you see him on fight day, you're like, my God. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2050.84s)]
*  Like when you see that dude's abs and all that much. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2053.48s)]
*  He looks like a 160 pound man. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2058.0s)]
*  You know why? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2060.12s)]
*  You know why, Joe? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2061.12s)]
*  You know what they've started to do? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2062.12s)]
*  I think it's the most dangerous thing in the world. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2063.4s)]
*  But you know what they've started to do? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2065.36s)]
*  Al Jermain Sterling was one of the first to tell me, but he doesn't cut all of his weight. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2067.64s)]
*  So with us, we would go on Thursday night, if I weighed 216 and I had to be 205 by Friday [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2074.22s)]
*  morning, I would get as low as I possibly could and then try to go to bed. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2081.6s)]
*  So if I'd get to 207, I would hope that by the morning I'd be 206. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2086.46s)]
*  I'd only have to lose a pound in the morning. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2090.82s)]
*  So I'm dehydrated for 12, 13, 14 hours. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2093.1s)]
*  Those guys today are going to bed at that weight, Joe, 10, 11 over and waking up at [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2097.54s)]
*  like four or five in the morning and cutting the weight. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2104.86s)]
*  Because they said if they cut all that weight, they don't sleep, which I can attest to. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2108.08s)]
*  It don't matter how much melatonin you take. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2111.48s)]
*  It doesn't matter what you do. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2113.46s)]
*  You're going to wake up because you're so hungry. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2114.46s)]
*  You're so dehydrated. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2116.6600000000003s)]
*  You're not going to get a good night's sleep. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2117.7000000000003s)]
*  They're going to bed heavier, getting up in the morning, sucking all that weight off and [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2119.44s)]
*  they're dehydrated for only like four hours. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2124.0200000000004s)]
*  I think it's dangerous. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2127.2200000000003s)]
*  Why is it dangerous? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2129.0200000000004s)]
*  Because you have to cut 10 pounds in four hours. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2130.82s)]
*  If you don't, you're screwed. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2133.1400000000003s)]
*  Oh, you think it's dangerous career wise? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2135.2200000000003s)]
*  I think it's dangerous because you could not make the weight. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2137.3s)]
*  Because you're not giving yourself any room for anything go sideways. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2140.5s)]
*  Because the worst possible feeling is when you go through your entire routine and you [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2145.1s)]
*  expect to lose eight, but you might lose six or five and a half. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2150.46s)]
*  And then you're like, now I got to work out. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2154.98s)]
*  What's the cause of that? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2157.94s)]
*  What's the the the variabilities? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2159.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2161.18s)]
*  Coal room, coal room. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2162.18s)]
*  Did you ever work with a doctor to like on? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2163.18s)]
*  No, I just. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2165.42s)]
*  Weight cutting. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2166.42s)]
*  So what I would do is I wrestled right my whole life. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2167.42s)]
*  So what I would do is I would do these test cuts because I was very afraid because at [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2169.18s)]
*  the Olympics, my kidneys shut down. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2174.54s)]
*  So I didn't get to wrestle my second Olympic Games. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2176.22s)]
*  So I was scared. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2179.58s)]
*  So I would two weeks before the fight or three weeks before the fight when I first started [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2180.94s)]
*  to go to 205, I would go on a Saturday and I would just cut some weight. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2184.5s)]
*  I'd get to 210 to 11. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2188.5s)]
*  I'd lose nine pounds. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2190.8599999999997s)]
*  OK, I know if I do this for an hour, I'll lose nine pounds the next weekend. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2191.8599999999997s)]
*  Do it again. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2196.5s)]
*  Lose nine pounds. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2197.7s)]
*  So then it became a thing where I knew in the right circumstances, with the right temperature [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2199.2599999999998s)]
*  in the room, I could lose nine pounds. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2203.98s)]
*  As long as it wasn't 65 degrees, I was fine. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2206.46s)]
*  Anything over 70, as most gyms are, I was getting nine off. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2211.7s)]
*  So I would I had this routine. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2215.54s)]
*  I would get up, get my body water loaded. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2218.02s)]
*  I would go into the sauna with just my stuff, put all my sweet sweat on. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2223.14s)]
*  I would get sweating after like five minutes, sweat till 10, then start putting all my clothes [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2228.98s)]
*  on in the sauna. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2233.46s)]
*  So I would have my socks, my shoes, my sweats, my t-shirt, my hat, my plastics. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2235.26s)]
*  I would put them all on in the same way every time. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2239.46s)]
*  Plastic pants, sweatpants, socks, shoes, long sleeve t-shirt under the plastics because [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2243.1800000000003s)]
*  I didn't like it against my body, plastic top, sweat top, hat, gloves, and everything [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2248.42s)]
*  just tucked in. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2254.2200000000003s)]
*  And then I would go right out of there because that would take me to like 15 minutes in the [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2256.1s)]
*  sauna. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2259.3799999999997s)]
*  I would walk straight to the treadmill, Joe. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2260.3799999999997s)]
*  Then I'm on the treadmill. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2262.62s)]
*  I run a mile, but only at five because now my heart rate is, my heart's doing this because [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2263.62s)]
*  it's hot from the sauna. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2269.18s)]
*  It's like then I'm trapping all this heat in. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2270.18s)]
*  I get on, I'd run for a mile, 12 minutes. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2273.14s)]
*  Now I'm at 27 minutes. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2275.8599999999997s)]
*  Then I walk. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2277.7799999999997s)]
*  I walk for 20 minutes on two. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2279.06s)]
*  If my heart rate slowed, I would put a little bit of an incline, go to three. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2281.7s)]
*  Walk for 20 minutes. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2285.82s)]
*  Now I'm at 47 minutes. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2287.34s)]
*  I get off of the treadmill, go straight to the ground where they wrapped me for 13 minutes. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2289.02s)]
*  And then those 13 minutes, I'm hurting, Joe. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2293.94s)]
*  I'm hurting. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2295.78s)]
*  I'm laying there. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2296.78s)]
*  I mean, people are like rubbing me. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2297.78s)]
*  They're like talking to me, trying to comfort me. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2299.54s)]
*  But every time I took all that shit off, pool of blood, I'm sorry, pool of water, nine and [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2302.2200000000003s)]
*  a half, 10 pounds. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2307.98s)]
*  And I could tell based on my sweats. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2309.22s)]
*  So I'd wear gray sweats, these gray Oklahoma State sweats. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2312.06s)]
*  And if it came up to my calf, mid calf, I knew I got the weight that I wanted. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2315.74s)]
*  I don't know how. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2320.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't know how that sweat would come up on the sweats. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2322.18s)]
*  But if it came up to my sweats on my leg and then up to my mid forearm on my arms, I knew [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2325.5s)]
*  I'd lose the weight that I needed to lose. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2332.2999999999997s)]
*  So the whole time I was like, yeah, it just kind of starts right here. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2335.46s)]
*  And then as you're working, it just keeps creeping up your body. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2339.3s)]
*  And then once you made it, what was the rehydration process like? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2341.58s)]
*  Well, the best was before you started when you could take IV. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2345.5s)]
*  That was the best. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2349.1s)]
*  Why was that better? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2350.1s)]
*  Joe, it beats your stomach. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2351.1s)]
*  The problem with rehydrating is it would mess with your stomach. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2354.58s)]
*  Everything you drank would make your stomach hurt. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2358.52s)]
*  Everything you ate would make your stomach hurt. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2362.54s)]
*  So even if you made weight at four, you're not really eating a good meal till six because [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2364.62s)]
*  you got to get through the cramps. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2371.74s)]
*  You got to get through the diarrhea. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2373.1s)]
*  You got to get through all this stuff that you did. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2374.7s)]
*  So the IV was the best because while you're doing the IV, it's going directly into the [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2377.74s)]
*  blood. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2381.94s)]
*  All that fluid is going right. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2382.94s)]
*  It's passing this. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2385.02s)]
*  It's just going into your body. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2386.02s)]
*  So while you're doing that, you start to feel better. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2388.38s)]
*  The IV bag, Joe, it was like a straight line. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2391.38s)]
*  It wasn't the drip. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2395.34s)]
*  You know how it looks like it drips? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2396.34s)]
*  My body would just suck that water out of that bag. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2398.26s)]
*  My body was sucking that water out of that bag. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2401.38s)]
*  It was a straight line down. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2404.1400000000003s)]
*  How many bags would you take? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2405.38s)]
*  Two. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2407.38s)]
*  16 pounds of IV. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2408.38s)]
*  Wow. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2409.38s)]
*  And then they took it away from me. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2410.38s)]
*  So then we had to start doing it another way. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2411.5s)]
*  And the reason why is because you could use it to mask performance enhancing drugs? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2413.02s)]
*  Yes, that's what they say. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2416.86s)]
*  Why don't they allow it from places that have... [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2419.02s)]
*  Maybe there's a way to do a test before you do an IV. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2422.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2426.78s)]
*  You know? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2427.78s)]
*  Because it seems stupid to cut off the IV. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2428.78s)]
*  The IV works. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2431.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2432.82s)]
*  Why don't you... [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2433.82s)]
*  What if they had a thing where you had to say, hey, I'm planning on taking an IV. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2434.82s)]
*  Will you guys come and test me before I take the IV? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2439.18s)]
*  Yep. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2441.62s)]
*  Yep. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2442.62s)]
*  They can do that. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2443.62s)]
*  That should be easy. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2444.62s)]
*  That should be easy. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2445.62s)]
*  And then you could get your IV. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2446.62s)]
*  Well, they're getting tested anyways. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2447.62s)]
*  And this new organization, what is it? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2449.22s)]
*  Drug Free Sport? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2452.5s)]
*  Is that what it's called? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2453.5s)]
*  Yep. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2454.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2455.5s)]
*  I actually don't even know which one it is. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2456.5s)]
*  This is a new organization, but Dana White speaks very highly of them. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2457.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2459.8199999999997s)]
*  I just wish they would allow guys to use things like BPC157. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2460.8199999999997s)]
*  The peptides. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2465.02s)]
*  One of my buddies is really big on peptides. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2466.02s)]
*  He said it's helping him. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2468.22s)]
*  He said it's helping him a lot. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2469.2999999999997s)]
*  I've never tried them, but... [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2470.2999999999997s)]

*  Where Anthony went. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2736.28s)]
*  Diego Sanchez did it. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2741.2000000000003s)]
*  Remember Diego did it in Phoenix. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2742.2000000000003s)]
*  He was losing to one of the Brazilian guys and he got fouled. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2746.6400000000003s)]
*  Diego's on the ground like 29, 28. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2750.48s)]
*  He's winning. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2755.52s)]
*  Yep, I'm out. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2756.52s)]
*  Diego's like, I'm out. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2757.52s)]
*  Take my dub. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2758.52s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2759.52s)]
*  Anthony Smith, and if he stays down, right Joe? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2760.7599999999998s)]
*  He wins the belt. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2765.52s)]
*  He fights Jones again. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2767.4s)]
*  Now he's on the pay-per-view portion of it, gets paid more money. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2769.44s)]
*  Even if he loses that belt, he got paid pay-per-view as the champ. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2773.56s)]
*  Otherwise you get told you're a beast for standing up, right? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2779.48s)]
*  But then you lose. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2783.56s)]
*  The UFC moved on. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2784.56s)]
*  John Jones just fought somebody else. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2786.84s)]
*  He could have guaranteed himself another fight. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2789.26s)]
*  It might seem coward, but what's the right way? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2791.0600000000004s)]
*  What's the right way to do that? [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2795.9s)]
*  Because Al Jermain did what he did. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2797.38s)]
*  If Al Jost stays, just gets up and continues, he wouldn't have got a rematch. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2799.5400000000004s)]
*  He wouldn't have defended that belt three times. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2805.0800000000004s)]
*  He wouldn't have fought O'Malley as the champ. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2806.98s)]
*  He wouldn't have fought Zahudo. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2808.92s)]
*  He wouldn't have fought Piorianna and he wouldn't have fought TJ Dillashaw. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2810.32s)]
*  He would have got none of that if he got up. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2813.76s)]
*  So while he might have gotten people to dislike him, he still lived as the champion, made [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2816.46s)]
*  a boatload of money, and he will always be remembered now as one of the better brand [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2821.08s)]
*  away champs in the world. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2825.5s)]
*  It's hard to compare fouls, right? [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2827.26s)]
*  Because you don't really know how ... Only Anthony Smith knows how he felt. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2830.9s)]
*  Only Al Jermain knows how he felt. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2838.6s)]
*  It's hard because every punch or every knee, they don't have the same impact on a person. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2841.42s)]
*  The one that hit Al Jow looked devastating. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2846.38s)]
*  That was devastating. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2848.7000000000003s)]
*  We were in the apex. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2849.7000000000003s)]
*  We were in the apex. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2850.7000000000003s)]
*  Too quiet. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2851.7000000000003s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2852.7000000000003s)]
*  We were in the apex. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2853.7000000000003s)]
*  It was real quiet. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2854.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, play this. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2855.7000000000003s)]
*  Look at him just pressing on the head here. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2856.7000000000003s)]
*  That was mean. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2861.7000000000003s)]
*  Bro, that was so bad. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2864.7000000000003s)]
*  That was so bad. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2867.86s)]
*  That's so bad. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2869.9s)]
*  To the temple. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2870.9s)]
*  He rolled him before that. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2871.9s)]
*  He said down. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2872.9s)]
*  He said one opponent. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2873.9s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2874.9s)]
*  That's nasty. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2876.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2877.42s)]
*  It's a no-brainer in terms of ... Al Jermain's going to be upset. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2878.42s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2883.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's nasty. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2884.98s)]
*  That's a bad one. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2886.26s)]
*  That's a bad knee. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2887.26s)]
*  You can't expect a guy that probably got concussed. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2888.34s)]
*  Look at Anthony Smith. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2891.1s)]
*  Look at Anthony Smith. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2892.1s)]
*  Let me see Anthony. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2893.1s)]
*  He's got one hand down. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2894.1s)]
*  That's just a hand, but I mean ... Look. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2895.1s)]
*  Switch knee. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2900.1s)]
*  Now, today ... [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2901.2999999999997s)]
*  Switch knee. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2902.2999999999997s)]
*  ... under the new rules. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2903.2999999999997s)]
*  Wouldn't that be up? [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2905.2999999999997s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2906.2999999999997s)]
*  Any weight bearing is down. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2907.2999999999997s)]
*  Weight bearing is down, but touching is not enough. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2910.42s)]
*  Touching is not enough. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2912.86s)]
*  Playing the game is not enough. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2913.86s)]
*  Right? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2914.86s)]
*  Down, up, down, up, down, up. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2915.86s)]
*  But weight bearing is down. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2917.3399999999997s)]
*  And that was definitely weight bearing. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2919.42s)]
*  That's weight bearing. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2921.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2922.02s)]
*  And watch. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2923.02s)]
*  Go back, and I want you to pause. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2924.02s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2925.94s)]
*  Keep going. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2926.94s)]
*  Keep going. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2927.94s)]
*  Keep going. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2928.94s)]
*  When it gets to Anthony's face and ... Pause. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2930.78s)]
*  That's when Anthony was like, you know what? [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2933.78s)]
*  Man, if I just sit here and I don't do this no more, there's a possibility for me to get [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2935.98s)]
*  all this money and come back as the champ. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2941.86s)]
*  And then his pride got in the way. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2944.3s)]
*  And he got up there and he finished the fight. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2946.3s)]
*  He was down three rounds to one at that time. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2949.26s)]
*  And he fought. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2952.34s)]
*  And I thought it was a mistake, because he took a legal knee. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2953.34s)]
*  But whatever. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2956.26s)]
*  It is what it is. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2957.26s)]
*  When you look at these ... And he got ... Jones got deducted a point and still won the fight [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2958.26s)]
*  comfortably. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2964.0600000000004s)]
*  That's how much he was ahead. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2965.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2966.0600000000004s)]
*  So ... Two points. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2967.0600000000004s)]
*  He got a two point deduction. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2970.0600000000004s)]
*  Boom. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2972.6600000000003s)]
*  And still won. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2974.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2976.1800000000003s)]
*  Crazy stuff, man. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2977.5400000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2979.1000000000004s)]
*  There's certain deductions. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2980.1000000000004s)]
*  Who knows what kind of an impact that had? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2982.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2985.1800000000003s)]
*  Did he have a concussion? [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2986.1800000000003s)]
*  He's too tough for his own good. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2987.5s)]
*  If you get a concussion from an illegal shot, what are you supposed to do? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2989.54s)]
*  Because now you're really vulnerable. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2994.18s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2995.66s)]
*  You can get hit and you can get KO'd easier. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2996.66s)]
*  What's the right answer? [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=2999.3399999999997s)]
*  You're already loopy. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3000.3399999999997s)]
*  You know what's crazy? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3001.3399999999997s)]
*  I say this, but I never was on the receiving end of a bad fall. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3002.94s)]
*  I probably would have just kept fighting. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3007.54s)]
*  I mean, Stipe poked me in the third fight and I just kept fighting. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3009.66s)]
*  Right? [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3012.8599999999997s)]
*  It's like ... I probably would have kept fighting. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3013.8599999999997s)]
*  I probably would have did the same thing, which is crazy, because it's what fighters [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3015.54s)]
*  do. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3019.02s)]
*  It's what they do. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3020.02s)]
*  It's got to clearly depend on how bad the shot is though. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3021.02s)]
*  Because if you get fouled and knocked unconscious and then you come back ... [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3024.66s)]
*  You're just going to get knocked out. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3028.18s)]
*  If you get knocked out, that's why boxing, right? [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3030.66s)]
*  People always kind of scoff at me when I say boxing is more dangerous than MMA. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3035.2200000000003s)]
*  Oh, how could you say that when they're only boxing and they're using their hands and they [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3040.06s)]
*  jump on you and they hit you on the ground when you fall? [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3045.3s)]
*  I said, I will argue with you that that's safer than you knocking me out. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3047.78s)]
*  Bang. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3054.1000000000004s)]
*  My body, which has been trained my whole life to get up, gets up, they count to eight or [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3055.1000000000004s)]
*  nine and they say, go back and fight more. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3060.3s)]
*  When I'm still concussed, you have hit me so hard that you have knocked me down to the [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3063.54s)]
*  ground. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3068.2200000000003s)]
*  Right? [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3069.2200000000003s)]
*  I get up and then you continue to punch me in the head until one, I either fall down [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3070.66s)]
*  again and go to sleep completely or we get to the end of the round where you come back [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3076.3399999999997s)]
*  and you punch me in the head again. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3080.18s)]
*  In MMA, when you get knocked out or kicked in the head or whatever the case may be, the [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3082.22s)]
*  guy jumps on you, boom, boom, fights over. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3086.98s)]
*  Fights over. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3090.9399999999996s)]
*  I don't have that recovery time to where I think my brain is okay, I go fight more and [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3092.2599999999998s)]
*  then I get destroyed more. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3098.74s)]
*  I think boxing is a much more brutal sport and I love boxing than mixed martial arts [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3100.2999999999997s)]
*  because of that. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3105.74s)]
*  Because of that 10 second count to kind of clear the cobwebs or at least think you're [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3106.9799999999996s)]
*  clearing the cobwebs and then go out there and fight again. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3111.18s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3115.22s)]
*  How fast, in that 10 seconds in most MMA fights when someone gets hurt to the point that they [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3116.22s)]
*  fall, that fight's over. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3121.58s)]
*  Two seconds, three seconds, the guy jumps on them. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3123.8999999999996s)]
*  If me and Stipe Miocchi were fighting, right, I knock him down and then I hit him with the [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3127.22s)]
*  two follow-up shots to end the fight. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3132.62s)]
*  I would like to see how long that sequence took because if Stipe Miocchi and I were fighting [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3134.7s)]
*  and I did that to him in boxing for as bad as he was, he would get up and I would get [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3139.7799999999997s)]
*  to hit him again. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3145.66s)]
*  Just like my knockdown on Stipe was no worse than when Deontay Wilder dropped Tyson Fury. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3147.18s)]
*  Tyson Fury looked like a dead man walking but because he's so tough, he sat himself [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3153.18s)]
*  up, got up and continued to fight. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3157.66s)]
*  That was one of the craziest recoveries ever. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3160.22s)]
*  How? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3162.3799999999997s)]
*  How? [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3163.3799999999997s)]
*  How? [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3164.3799999999997s)]
*  12th round, you look like you're out cold and then he out boxed him for the rest of the [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3165.3799999999997s)]
*  round. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3169.14s)]
*  How? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3170.14s)]
*  But again, in MMA, fight probably would have been over and he would have took less damage. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3171.14s)]
*  Right, but isn't that a better argument for letting him get up? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3175.2999999999997s)]
*  Tyson Fury got up and then figured out how to beat Deontay Wilder in the second fight. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3179.98s)]
*  But he figured it out and was able to beat him as they went on. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3185.0600000000004s)]
*  But in that fight on that night, all it would have taken was for Wilder to land one more [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3188.5s)]
*  but in boxing, again, you get the hole, you get the pull in tight, there's a few seconds. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3192.26s)]
*  But very rarely do we see it happen like it happened for Tyson Fury. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3196.1000000000004s)]
*  We see it on the other side of the spectrum when they get up and they get flatlined. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3200.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, that does happen. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3204.78s)]
*  Because they're so good. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3207.0s)]
*  The boxers are so good at finding that shot. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3208.46s)]
*  MMA guys, we hurt you, we go running, we start throwing wide punches, loopy, them boxing [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3211.46s)]
*  dudes are like, bink, bink, and they go find your chin and then you're like, just out cold. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3217.3s)]
*  I'm telling you man, I'm telling you, I'm smart. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3222.66s)]
*  I'm fucking smart, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I should be the commission bro. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3225.66s)]
*  We haven't talked that much about Francis and Tyson Fury. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3229.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3233.42s)]
*  Because how shocking was that? [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3234.42s)]
*  That was crazy, dog. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3235.42s)]
*  It was the craziest thing. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3237.1s)]
*  And guess what else? [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3238.58s)]
*  You know why? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3239.58s)]
*  Why? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3240.58s)]
*  Because Deontay Wild almost killed him. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3241.58s)]
*  He got up and he took more damage and his brain might be able, Tyson Fury has been hit [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3242.98s)]
*  by some of the most dangerous dudes in the world. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3247.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3249.58s)]
*  And now you're getting hit by Francis, who might hit harder than any of them. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3250.58s)]
*  He might hit harder than all of them. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3254.62s)]
*  Dude, Francis Ngannou knocked Tyson Fury down. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3256.14s)]
*  And he's an amateur, bro. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3259.58s)]
*  This is his first ever professional fight. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3262.78s)]
*  That's what's so crazy. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3264.9s)]
*  You know what was so beautiful about that? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3266.06s)]
*  He actually countered him perfect. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3267.46s)]
*  He had his right hand up and he hit him with the little check left hook. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3269.58s)]
*  It was one of the most, I mean, shocking is an understatement. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3273.42s)]
*  But Francis, look at that. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3278.06s)]
*  His technique was beautiful. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3280.5s)]
*  And that's Francis' offhand. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3283.14s)]
*  That's not even his right hand. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3285.82s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3287.7000000000003s)]
*  What does that say about boxing though, Joe? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3289.78s)]
*  I mean, at the lineal heavyweight champion in the world and the... [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3291.74s)]
*  The lineal UFC heavyweight champion. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3297.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3299.2999999999997s)]
*  But the lineal heavyweight champion in boxing, in just a boxing match, was able to, Francis [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3300.2999999999997s)]
*  was able to compete with him as an amateur. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3309.1s)]
*  Zero and zero. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3311.58s)]
*  Zero. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3312.58s)]
*  Zero and zero. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3313.58s)]
*  He's an amateur. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3314.58s)]
*  What does that say about boxing? [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3315.58s)]
*  I think it says more about Francis. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3317.4199999999996s)]
*  I think Francis is just a special dude. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3319.62s)]
*  You don't think nobody else could do that? [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3321.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't imagine it. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3323.1s)]
*  No, I don't think so either. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3324.74s)]
*  I don't imagine it. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3325.74s)]
*  I think Francis is just a special dude. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3326.74s)]
*  But we did see Conor fight Floyd. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3329.02s)]
*  That's true. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3331.06s)]
*  Right? [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3332.06s)]
*  We did see Conor. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3333.06s)]
*  I mean, could Sean O'Malley fight Devin Haney? [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3334.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3335.06s)]
*  Right? [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3336.06s)]
*  Like you said he could. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3337.06s)]
*  It could happen. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3338.06s)]
*  Something like that can happen. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3339.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3340.06s)]
*  100%. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3341.06s)]
*  But that was surprising. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3342.06s)]
*  That was surprising. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3343.06s)]
*  I thought Tyson was going to beat him up a little bit. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3344.06s)]
*  I really did believe Tyson Fehr was going to beat him up. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3345.06s)]
*  I could see Sean Strickland in a high level boxing match. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3347.38s)]
*  Sean Strickland's pretty good. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3350.1400000000003s)]
*  Did you see Sean Strickland with that gun the other day? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3351.38s)]
*  How crazy is he? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3353.6200000000003s)]
*  We were saying that karma brought that dude to Sean Strickland. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3357.06s)]
*  I mean, Sean Strickland- [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3360.3s)]
*  Because that dude had apparently beat up a woman and then drove drunk, crashed his car, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3361.3s)]
*  abandoned his car and was hiding in Sean Strickland's driveway. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3365.82s)]
*  Of all the driveways to get stuck in. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3369.9s)]
*  It's perfect. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3372.26s)]
*  You end up Sean Strickland's driveway. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3373.26s)]
*  And then Sean's like pushing him down. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3374.26s)]
*  I'm like- [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3376.62s)]
*  This poor bastard. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3377.62s)]
*  Look at this guy. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3379.1s)]
*  He's trying to- and he's texting. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3380.1s)]
*  Yeah, he's hiding in text. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3382.1s)]

*  It's a weird animal to have as our national animal because it's a ruthless raptor. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3720.66s)]
*  It's a ruthless, it's a killer. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3725.7s)]
*  It's a killer. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=3727.34s)]

*  He beat all the best Americans for a long time. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4066.42s)]
*  He wrestled from my Olympic cycle all the way to Kyle Snyder who won the 2020 Olympic [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4069.06s)]
*  Games. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4074.94s)]
*  That guy beat him. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4075.98s)]
*  This dude was so fast. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4078.02s)]
*  He was so good. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4079.56s)]
*  I brought him in to train with me for John Jones. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4080.98s)]
*  My strength coach told me he would try to break him. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4084.84s)]
*  He said, Daniel, I would try to break this guy. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4088.86s)]
*  I would give him all of my workouts. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4093.28s)]
*  He goes, and then I would add just to try to see how far he would go. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4095.48s)]
*  He said, no matter what I did, he never stopped. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4100.28s)]
*  He never got tired. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4103.92s)]
*  And he goes, he always wanted to do more. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4104.92s)]
*  He never questioned anything. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4107.360000000001s)]
*  And that dude, that's why the dude was like a six time world champion, Olympic champion, [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4109.12s)]
*  everything. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4112.04s)]
*  He was the best man. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4113.04s)]
*  And we're just lucky he didn't fight because all of us would have no accomplishments. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4114.16s)]
*  You got any video of this dude? [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4117.08s)]
*  His name is Gutsalov. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4119.5199999999995s)]

*  He was so fast. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4124.72s)]
*  He was so strong. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4126.62s)]
*  His motion, his movement. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4127.92s)]
*  These dudes were, I knew that if guys like that started fighting, they would be a problem. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4130.56s)]
*  And that's exactly what they've become. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4136.4s)]
*  I mean, look at him. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4138.2s)]
*  This is the guy right here. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4140.24s)]
*  It's him. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4141.24s)]
*  We were training. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4142.24s)]
*  This dude was just hitting me with all kinds of stuff. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4143.44s)]
*  I actually, like, and we're sweating too. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4144.719999999999s)]
*  He just never stopped, bro. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4150.76s)]
*  The guy was just tremendous in everything he did. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4152.88s)]
*  So I would have to set my mind every day going into the room like I was about to wrestle [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4156.48s)]
*  in the Olympic games because I knew how hard it would be to try to go with this cat. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4161.36s)]
*  Then he would be beating on these dudes in MMA. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4166.08s)]
*  He'd take against the wall like it was impossible to take him down. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4168.2s)]
*  And we, but look at this though, Joe. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4173.08s)]
*  Everybody would just watch. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4177.84s)]
*  Dude taking me down. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4180.5199999999995s)]
*  He got the UFC cameras. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4181.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm like, yo, cut that, cut that, cut that. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4182.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm like, cut it, cut it, cut it. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4185.5199999999995s)]
*  This is some wild scrambles. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4187.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, you got him? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4189.5199999999995s)]
*  I got one, but that was like, that's probably the only one I got for a month. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4190.5199999999995s)]
*  And then at times I thought he might be letting me. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4196.639999999999s)]
*  I'm like, yo, are you letting me score, man? [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4198.4s)]
*  Because I wrestled you in competitions. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4200.2s)]
*  And I never scored. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4201.96s)]
*  But I mean, he was just too good, Joe. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4204.96s)]
*  I mean, he beat me in the Olympics in my finals. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4206.96s)]
*  He beat everybody. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4208.96s)]
*  Did you ever talk to him about his interest in MMA? [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4210.96s)]
*  I asked him. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4213.96s)]
*  He was like, I don't really want, I want to wrestle. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4215.96s)]
*  And now he's the head of the Russian Wrestling Federation. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4217.96s)]
*  He's the coach now. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4221.72s)]
*  So I said, dude, sometimes I'm embarrassed to say some of the shit I do. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4223.0s)]
*  My kids on my wrestling team, this team now has all my youth club kids. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4230.32s)]
*  They all wrestled for me in middle school. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4237.32s)]
*  When they were seventh and eighth grade, they were doing their homeschool year. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4243.32s)]
*  So reclassifying is a big thing in sports now, where if you and I are supposed to graduate [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4248.32s)]
*  in 1998, we will reclassify to graduate in 99. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4254.32s)]
*  Bro, I took those kids when they were in seventh and eighth grade and I sent them to Dagestan [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4258.2s)]
*  for a month. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4262.5199999999995s)]
*  They took all of their schoolwork and they went to Dagestan and Moscow for a month. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4264.2s)]
*  Like eight or nine kids with two parents. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4270.639999999999s)]
*  I sent them to Russia, bro. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4273.799999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4275.799999999999s)]
*  The fact that their parents actually listened to me is crazy because they're like, yo, you're [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4277.0s)]
*  out of your mind. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4280.4s)]
*  We're not sending our 13 year old kids to Russia. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4281.4s)]
*  They sent them, bro. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4283.58s)]
*  We put them in some big jackets and I said, hey, I know if we want to be the best, they [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4284.88s)]
*  got to be by these guys. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4288.88s)]
*  And so we sent them and Khabib had them in his gym every day. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4290.88s)]
*  He bought and Khabib is a great guy, right? [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4296.0s)]
*  He bought hotels for him. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4298.400000000001s)]
*  He feed them. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4300.620000000001s)]
*  He said, just get them here. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4301.860000000001s)]
*  And dude, they trained for a month. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4303.64s)]
*  They told me, they said, coach, we practice with you. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4307.3s)]
*  He goes in Dagestan. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4310.780000000001s)]
*  It's training because it's in the morning, it's in the midday and it's in the evening. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4312.82s)]
*  You're training all day. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4318.7s)]
*  Long practices. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4320.58s)]
*  He said that these kids told me, Joe, that they do about 30 minutes of gymnastics before [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4321.94s)]
*  they start practice. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4326.9s)]
*  Gymnastics for the flexibility and body discipline and body control and everything. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4329.299999999999s)]
*  So they're flipping and doing all kinds of stuff before they ever got to wrestling. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4335.84s)]
*  They're working, they're operating at a different level. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4340.58s)]
*  That's why you see Mahatchev being who he is. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4342.38s)]
*  Mahatchev is crazy. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4345.86s)]
*  The way he adjusted to Volkanovsky in the second fight was pretty special. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4348.46s)]
*  The use of that left leg, left leg to the body, and then the high kick. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4355.14s)]
*  The way he set that up, man, all the possible endings to that fight that you could have [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4359.76s)]
*  seen. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4365.14s)]
*  Never thought that. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4366.14s)]
*  Never thought like high kick KO. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4367.14s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4368.82s)]
*  And we thought when we saw Habib, that was the complete version of a Russian fighter. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4369.9s)]
*  They see Islam and he possesses all those same skills with the striking. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4376.0199999999995s)]
*  So what about the next one? [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4380.54s)]
*  What about the next one? [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4382.38s)]
*  Because there's going to be another one. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4383.38s)]
*  What about the next guy? [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4385.86s)]
*  They're just getting better and better. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4388.9s)]
*  Now that they know that these guys from that region are, if you're a kid and you're growing [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4390.46s)]
*  up in that region, now you know, oh, I can follow that same path. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4396.42s)]
*  I can do MMA. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4400.46s)]
*  It doesn't have to just be wrestling or they do a sambal, which is as perfect a base for [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4401.46s)]
*  mixed martial arts as you can find. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4409.54s)]
*  Because they're punching and kicking each other and stuff already and grappling and [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4411.46s)]
*  doing everything. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4414.34s)]
*  It's a very good base. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4416.3s)]
*  It's a little weird that they're wearing a jacket. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4417.7s)]
*  They're wearing the gi, yeah, they're wearing the gi top, shorts, but it's like at least [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4420.18s)]
*  they're, you and I agree. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4423.9800000000005s)]
*  Wrestling is the foundation because of the training and everything else. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4426.9400000000005s)]
*  But in terms of what closes with the kind of striking or at least the playing of the striking [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4432.22s)]
*  and ensemble, that's as good in terms of preparing you for mixed martial arts. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4438.86s)]
*  Yes. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4444.42s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4445.42s)]
*  It's awesome. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4446.42s)]
*  I got that little ranch you go on about wrestling that plays daily in my school. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4447.42s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4450.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4451.78s)]
*  They love that. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4452.78s)]
*  The kids love that because that's the truth. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4453.78s)]
*  It's the truth. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4454.78s)]
*  If you want to build a strong foundation even just as a human being, wrestling is where [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4455.78s)]
*  you figure out how tough you are, how much you can push, how much you can deal with discomfort. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4460.74s)]
*  No one trains harder than wrestlers. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4466.219999999999s)]
*  I think everybody should wrestle and I think everybody should have some sort of fight in [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4467.86s)]
*  their life. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4472.78s)]
*  One, some sort of fight. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4473.78s)]
*  It could be in a gym, a sparring match. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4475.78s)]
*  I'm talking a fight. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4478.099999999999s)]
*  It could be sparring. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4479.82s)]
*  I think every human being, if they do themself justice, has some sort of interaction against [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4480.86s)]
*  another human being where it's a bit of a fight. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4486.86s)]
*  You have to. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4489.54s)]
*  I think once you do that, you can do anything because then you're not afraid. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4490.54s)]
*  You cannot be afraid, man. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4495.58s)]
*  That's like my biggest thing to my kids is like you cannot be afraid because people smell [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4497.099999999999s)]
*  that shit on you. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4502.099999999999s)]
*  If you're afraid, people smell that shit on you and they treat you a certain way. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4503.36s)]
*  You cannot be afraid. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4507.299999999999s)]
*  I think everybody should have at least one sort of fight, whether it's sparring, whether [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4508.7s)]
*  it's an exhibition fight, whether it's a high intensity jiu jitsu match, whether it's a [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4514.38s)]
*  high intensity wrestling match. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4519.44s)]
*  I think you should have some sort of competition in your life that pits you against another [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4521.14s)]
*  individual. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4527.3s)]
*  I think we all need it. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4528.3s)]
*  Imagine if we had that as like mandatory service in the country. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4530.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4533.62s)]
*  Could you imagine? [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4534.62s)]
*  We'd be stronger as a country. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4535.62s)]
*  Imagine if like, you know how Xi Jinping is trying to make Russia more, or excuse me, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4536.62s)]
*  China more manly? [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4539.98s)]
*  What's he doing? [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4540.98s)]
*  No, I haven't. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4541.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4542.98s)]
*  They're trying to promote more manliness in China. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4543.98s)]
*  If someone tried to do that in America and they said, well, the way we're going to implement [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4546.62s)]
*  this is we're going to have mandatory combat sports participation for all males. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4550.78s)]
*  At some point in your life you do that. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4558.14s)]
*  Could you imagine if they did that? [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4559.58s)]
*  Hey, I'm telling you, we'd be better for it. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4561.38s)]
*  I think we would. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4564.5s)]
*  We would be better for it. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4565.6s)]
*  I think we would. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4566.88s)]
*  Because then, let's see this. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4567.88s)]
*  Two years ago the country's censors began to blur earnings and colored hair on male [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4570.160000000001s)]
*  celebrities. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4575.06s)]
*  Oh, earrings, sorry. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4576.06s)]
*  Earrings and colored hair on male celebrities appearing on television. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4577.8s)]
*  Earlier this year the education ministry announced a plan to cultivate masculinity in schoolboys, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4581.200000000001s)]
*  including hiring more gym teachers and promoting sports. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4586.88s)]
*  But it says after America, right? [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4590.54s)]
*  So America must be trying to, it's China's turn to worry about masculinity. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4593.08s)]
*  So they're saying that our country is, right? [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4597.72s)]
*  Click on that. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4600.88s)]
*  What is that saying? [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4601.88s)]
*  That's a strange thing to say. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4602.88s)]
*  After America, right? [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4606.0s)]
*  If you follow the disastrous denouement of America's two-decade occupation in Afghanistan, [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4608.2s)]
*  is that the word? [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4615.72s)]
*  Did I say that word right? [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4616.72s)]
*  No idea what that is. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4617.76s)]
*  I don't know what that word is. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4618.76s)]
*  Have you wondered why the world's only superpower has an affliction for distant wars? [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4619.84s)]
*  What is it that compels it to drag its military halfway across the world? [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4625.28s)]
*  What is the origin of its interventionalist instincts? [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4629.68s)]
*  What is he saying here? [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4632.72s)]
*  Reading a lot into this. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4636.04s)]
*  But it's saying that, it's saying, look, in this scheme of things. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4638.84s)]
*  Oh, okay, here it is. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4643.04s)]
*  It's about Roosevelt. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4644.84s)]
*  Roosevelt's scheme of things. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4645.84s)]
*  Imperialism was a necessary manly duty that American men needed to take up or risk letting [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4647.32s)]
*  the reins of global power be seized by a more manful race. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4652.68s)]
*  Sickly and asthmatic in his childhood, Roosevelt had continued to endure attacks on his manliness [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4658.08s)]
*  into his youth as he started out in politics with newspapers lampooning his high-pitched [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4663.56s)]
*  voice and dandy clothes. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4668.92s)]
*  Oh yeah, dandy clothes. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4670.8s)]
*  For the exquisite Mr. Roosevelt, forceful public exhortions to wage foreign wars was [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4672.96s)]
*  an exercise in radical image makeover. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4679.9s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4682.96s)]
*  So they were saying they were picking on his manliness so he decided to go wage wars. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4685.2s)]
*  Yes. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4689.84s)]
*  They bullied him. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4690.84s)]

*  Right? [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4699.76s)]
*  And that's why, I mean the Chinese, they said they're not showing colored hair or earrings [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4700.82s)]
*  anymore, but if we are all forced to wrestle or do jujitsu or do boxing, at least early [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4705.0199999999995s)]
*  in our lives, you develop that foundation for strength. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4716.66s)]
*  You develop that foundation for standing up for yourself. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4720.82s)]
*  You develop the foundation for not just accepting things that shouldn't happen. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4724.98s)]
*  It really is, I think everybody should have it, man. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4730.919999999999s)]
*  I think it's so good for you to have that experience where you stare across from another [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4733.7s)]

*  them in a boxing fight. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4749.58s)]

*  If you wait until you're like my age, and then oh, maybe we get hurt. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4774.2s)]
*  Young, if we all like, if you're in elementary school, it's like, okay, for a month you got [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4778.48s)]
*  to do wrestling. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4783.0s)]
*  I think that was one of the things. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4784.5599999999995s)]
*  In school, most schools don't even have wrestling anymore. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4790.5599999999995s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4794.04s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of kids, like a lot of teams, they don't have teams. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4795.04s)]
*  Let's have jujitsu in schools. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4798.839999999999s)]
*  Let's have these things in schools. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4801.48s)]

*  I think we put these in schools and just give these kids a month. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4806.1s)]
*  Let me say it wouldn't stop bullying. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4810.14s)]

*  And I think if we did jujitsu in those sports in school, even for young girls, they're safer. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4815.860000000001s)]

*  Everybody should know something about combat. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4832.18s)]
*  You're not always going to have the ability to get to something to help you. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4833.98s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4837.0199999999995s)]
*  You've got to be able to do it with your hands and with your feet and everything else. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4838.0199999999995s)]

*  Yes. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4844.5s)]

*  How comforting is that? [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4852.54s)]
*  To be able to know that no security, no anything, if push came to shove, you could at least [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4854.22s)]
*  Defend yourself enough to be safe and your family. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4860.26s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4870.5s)]
*  To be able to walk around the world like that. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4871.5s)]
*  You watch those Instagram videos, the same ones I watch, of dudes who have no idea what [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4872.66s)]

*  And every now and then you find one where someone does know how to fight. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4887.34s)]
*  There was these two dudes tangling outside of a bar on a security camera and this one [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=4890.5s)]

*  for four or five hours. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5282.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5284.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5285.8s)]
*  Dude, 2020. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5286.8s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5287.8s)]
*  You're allowed to do that? [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5288.8s)]
*  That might be one of the last times. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5290.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5292.08s)]
*  Are you allowed to do whatever you want? [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5293.08s)]
*  If you're out of your fucking mind? [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5294.08s)]
*  If you're your own attorney and you're out of your mind? [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5295.08s)]
*  What? [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5299.08s)]
*  You're going to be your own attorney, you dumb fuck? [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5300.08s)]
*  I remember there was a guy that killed a bunch of people on the subway in Long Island, and [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5301.68s)]
*  then he acted as his own attorney too. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5306.96s)]
*  They lose every time. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5309.04s)]
*  And so he was questioning the witnesses. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5310.04s)]
*  He's like, bitch, you shot me. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5312.2s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5313.2s)]

*  You're lying. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5319.2s)]
*  Yeah, the defendant says that. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5320.2s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5321.8s)]

*  Yeah, crazy, crazy people. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5334.0s)]
*  But they're like formed. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5335.0s)]
*  They're not born like that. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5336.36s)]
*  No. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5337.72s)]
*  I mean, who knows what they're born like. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5338.72s)]
*  There is problems. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5341.8s)]
*  People do have mental illness that runs in families. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5343.58s)]

*  It's weird because it's like if you don't have it and then you see other people that [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5351.200000000001s)]
*  do have it, you go, whoa, what is that like? [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5354.88s)]
*  Like what is schizophrenia like? [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5357.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5358.4800000000005s)]

*  I've never met anybody with that. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5363.76s)]
*  I know people that come back and they start acting normal again, then they go out there [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5364.76s)]
*  again, and you never know which one you're going to get when you talk to them. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5368.64s)]
*  That's not good. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5371.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, not good. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5372.160000000001s)]
*  Or manic. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5373.160000000001s)]

*  Yeah, this is the guy. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5377.36s)]
*  Oh my God, and the one thing I noticed was I could hear shots being fired already. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5378.36s)]
*  Solomon Butler is that man accused of shooting at Clements. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5381.639999999999s)]
*  Look at his head. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5384.839999999999s)]
*  Not it? [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5386.4s)]
*  I don't think this is the one. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5387.4s)]
*  Wait, did you see that guy's head? [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5389.92s)]
*  Did that guy get shot in the head? [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5391.2s)]
*  Oh my God, he did. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5392.799999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5394.5599999999995s)]
*  In court, the injury to Butler's head was obvious. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5395.5599999999995s)]
*  Officer Clements. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5400.36s)]
*  Wow. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5401.36s)]
*  Wow, I've never seen anything like that. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5402.36s)]
*  He's missing a chunk of his head. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5404.88s)]
*  I've never seen anything like that. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5406.72s)]
*  I've seen a few things like that. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5408.160000000001s)]
*  Really? [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5409.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, people who survive gunshot wounds and half of the head's missing. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5410.4800000000005s)]
*  Half of the head's missing. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5412.76s)]
*  Yeah, and they can still function somewhat. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5413.76s)]
*  People can live in a lot of different circumstances where a lot of stuff's missing. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5416.76s)]
*  It's crazy that they're still alive. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5421.64s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5423.64s)]
*  That was nuts. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5424.64s)]
*  His whole inside of his head's like dented in. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5425.64s)]
*  So where's his brain? [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5427.200000000001s)]
*  That part's probably not there anymore. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5429.240000000001s)]
*  That part of his brain is gone. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5432.320000000001s)]
*  Is gone. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5434.92s)]
*  Yeah, so I guess the rest of the brain has to pick up the slack or something. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5436.2s)]
*  Wow. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5439.2s)]
*  Or part of your body doesn't work well. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5440.2s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5441.6s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5442.6s)]
*  That's a freaky looking image there. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5443.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5444.96s)]
*  This was a different one, but it doesn't matter, Jamie. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5445.96s)]
*  It was a subway killer in Long Island. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5449.08s)]
*  Serial killer. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5452.52s)]
*  There's a lot of fucked up dudes out there. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5453.52s)]
*  Women love serial killer shows. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5455.76s)]
*  Why? [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5458.04s)]
*  It's so weird. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5459.04s)]
*  But can a serial killer exist today? [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5461.64s)]
*  Yes. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5464.64s)]
*  Yeah, they exist. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5466.360000000001s)]
*  No chance. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5467.360000000001s)]
*  There's active serial killers. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5468.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5469.360000000001s)]
*  How? [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5470.360000000001s)]
*  With all the stuff, like with the DNA and the videos and the cameras and the phones [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5471.360000000001s)]
*  and the tracking. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5475.320000000001s)]
*  Well, you have to have people looking for you, first of all. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5476.320000000001s)]
*  So you have to have left some sort of evidence to begin with. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5479.96s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5482.96s)]
*  There was a guy named Henry Lee Lucas and there's a movie made about him called Henry [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5483.96s)]
*  Portrait of a Serial Killer. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5488.88s)]
*  I'm going to watch that. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5490.400000000001s)]
*  They don't know how much of this guy's story is true because apparently he took credit [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5491.96s)]
*  for a lot of murders that he couldn't have done. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5496.56s)]
*  But he definitely killed a lot of people as well. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5499.12s)]
*  And they would just pick people up randomly. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5502.2s)]
*  They would drive around the country randomly, find someone and kill them. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5504.64s)]
*  That's so bad. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5508.32s)]
*  And if you do that randomly, it's hard to catch people. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5509.32s)]
*  Like if it's your ex-husband and he's been following you, tracking you, and you wind [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5513.96s)]
*  up dead, they look to the ex-husband. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5520.44s)]
*  Yes, for sure. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5522.16s)]
*  The ex-husband's been stalking her, there's some shit going on, and then you break him [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5523.16s)]
*  down into questioning. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5528.0s)]
*  But if it's just a random, if someone just pulls up to a bus stop and shoots somebody [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5529.0s)]
*  waiting for the bus and then gets back in their car and drives off and no one sees it. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5534.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5538.36s)]
*  Most times there is like, it's weird, right? [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5539.36s)]
*  Everybody like is watching. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5544.6s)]
*  Because there was another guy that I watched, he was robbing a person of a drug deal or [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5547.04s)]
*  something and the cops were questioning all the people and said, has anybody seen anything [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5553.6s)]
*  unfamiliar? [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5562.0s)]
*  There was a white van parked and this lady next door was like, was it this white van? [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5563.0s)]
*  She just had a picture. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5568.120000000001s)]
*  And it was what led to the guy getting caught. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5569.84s)]
*  Because the lady was, it was two in the morning and she was randomly like up, which I don't [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5572.2s)]
*  understand why, and she saw a white van parked outside, she took a photo. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5576.639999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5580.8s)]
*  And she gave him the license plate of the van that the people were using. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5581.8s)]
*  So it's like, it feels like if you're doing something wrong for the most part, somebody's [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5584.88s)]
*  going to witness it. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5590.36s)]
*  Well, the thing is, yeah, you're very likely to get caught. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5591.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5595.0s)]
*  Right? [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5596.0s)]
*  Especially if they go looking for you. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5597.0s)]
*  There was this one dude that studied, did he go to school for criminal, he went to school [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5598.24s)]
*  for something to learn the laws so he could be a better serial killer. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5607.6s)]
*  What? [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5612.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5613.48s)]
*  And he stabbed a bunch of people in this house. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5614.48s)]
*  What was it like, a sorority house or a dorm house? [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5616.8s)]
*  Idaho thing. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5620.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5621.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5622.04s)]
*  So this guy, they think he killed some people in the Western states too. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5623.04s)]
*  I think he killed some people in, I think it was Washington. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5627.8s)]
*  Some people turned out missing, it seems like. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5631.360000000001s)]
*  So this guy was studying, he was pursuing a PhD in criminology. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5633.5s)]
*  So he's like studying crime while he's a fucking serial killer. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5641.120000000001s)]
*  Look at his fucking eyes. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5647.92s)]
*  Right? [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5649.360000000001s)]
*  Like look at his eyes. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5650.360000000001s)]
*  Look at those eyes. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5651.360000000001s)]
*  Right? [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5652.360000000001s)]
*  Like look at his eyes. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5653.360000000001s)]
*  Okay, this dude's a little messed up. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5655.36s)]
*  Can you see that? [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5658.44s)]
*  Because there are people that, there are people that say, they can read people's energy and [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5659.44s)]
*  go this person's energy is off. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5665.5599999999995s)]
*  Some people have off energy for sure. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5668.04s)]
*  You can feel it? [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5669.88s)]
*  Yeah, you can feel it with some people. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5670.88s)]
*  Do you feel like they're evil though? [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5672.24s)]
*  Have you ever been around someone and go, this dude's a little evil, man. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5673.639999999999s)]
*  I don't think of the word evil, I just think screwy. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5676.4s)]
*  This is something wrong here. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5679.28s)]
*  This is a facade. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5680.96s)]
*  There's some wild shit going on behind the surface. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5682.56s)]
*  And you can't really tell from a photo, but the photo does look crazy. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5685.84s)]
*  That guy, the way he was looking at his attorney. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5689.64s)]
*  But I bet if you looked in his eyes. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5691.84s)]
*  Like crazy eyes. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5693.52s)]
*  Yeah, crazy eyes. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5694.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5695.52s)]
*  You can, I don't know if I could do that. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5696.52s)]
*  I don't know if I could read a person's energy. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5699.32s)]
*  Because I'm always trying to take the person for who they present themselves to be. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5701.84s)]
*  That's probably one of my worst, it's probably like a problem. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5707.0s)]
*  Well, because you're real friendly. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5711.16s)]
*  Yeah, I always want to take. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5712.16s)]
*  You're a great guy. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5713.16s)]
*  You want everybody to be laughing and smiling. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5714.16s)]
*  I want to take everybody as, what you give me is what I'm going to accept you as, until [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5715.88s)]
*  you show me something different. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5719.92s)]
*  And then it's done. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5722.12s)]
*  It just, there's every now and then you get around a shyster. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5724.0s)]
*  Every now and then you get around some dude who's scamming people around you. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5728.4s)]
*  And you're like, what is going on with that dude? [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5731.5199999999995s)]

*  Like right now, here's what I always wonder. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5736.8s)]
*  And I know why, when you enjoy going to the UFC. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5741.12s)]
*  Because it's just like people that we've all known forever. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5744.160000000001s)]
*  We're all just calling the fights. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5746.400000000001s)]
*  Life has to be pretty difficult at times. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5748.96s)]
*  Because have you made new friends recently? [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5752.360000000001s)]

*  I've been here for three years. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5781.12s)]
*  When did you start your Spotify thing? [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5784.4s)]
*  Three years ago. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5787.04s)]
*  And you've made new friends since then? [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5788.04s)]

*  Nice people. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5794.4s)]
*  You look like you would be happy for me if you worried about me. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5795.799999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5800.08s)]
*  Because for me, it's like, I don't know, Joe, I swear, Joe, I don't know if I see people [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5801.08s)]
*  react any weirder than when they're around you. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5806.04s)]
*  They get all Guinea and shit, man. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5809.32s)]
*  Right? [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5813.12s)]
*  But it's like, it's like hard. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5814.12s)]
*  It's like hard when you get to a certain level to really make new friends. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5819.12s)]
*  Because like you said, shysters are everywhere. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5823.76s)]
*  Things get weird, but there's still good people out there. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5825.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5828.72s)]
*  There's still people that are just regular people. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5829.72s)]
*  Generally the people that I become friends with, they do things that I do as well. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5831.360000000001s)]
*  Whether it's archery or whether it's jujitsu or whether it's comedy or people like that. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5836.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5841.84s)]
*  But you obviously don't hang around just in like, you don't hang around in the same places [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5842.84s)]
*  that we did when the UFC first started blowing up. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5846.8s)]
*  So you're not around the shysters. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5849.160000000001s)]
*  No, not as much. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5851.12s)]
*  But there's always some people around, right? [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5853.04s)]
*  That are trying to like do deals and, you know, sell crypto. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5855.0s)]
*  There's always some weirdos. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5859.52s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5861.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5862.0s)]
*  It's the craziest thing. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5863.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was kind of wondering that, right? [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5864.0s)]
*  When you come up to the fights and we're all like having a great time and then, you know, [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5866.08s)]
*  we kind of go back on our life and sometimes we text about the fights and it's awesome. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5869.32s)]
*  But then I'm like, I wonder if Joe like has more friends that aren't guys from back in [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5873.32s)]
*  the day like us, right? [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5878.52s)]
*  Like that, no, it's just Joe. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5879.52s)]
*  Well, I certainly have a lot of friends that I'm still friends with from back in the day. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5883.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but it's just, it would seem hard. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5887.200000000001s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5890.320000000001s)]
*  But good friends are always good friends. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5892.120000000001s)]
*  And once you make a good friend, oh, it's so perfect, right? [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5893.92s)]
*  They're just the best. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5896.64s)]
*  And you got to be a good friend. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5897.64s)]
*  You know? [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5898.64s)]
*  That's one thing I'm not the best at. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5899.64s)]
*  You're not? [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5900.64s)]
*  At times. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5901.64s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5902.64s)]
*  Bro, sometimes I'm not a great friend. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5903.64s)]
*  Why? [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5904.64s)]
*  What did you do wrong? [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5905.64s)]
*  I just kind of be fucking up, man. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5906.64s)]
*  Like I started, sometimes I'm not a great friend. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5907.64s)]
*  It sucks. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5910.160000000001s)]
*  And sometimes I have to catch myself not being a good friend, right? [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5911.8s)]
*  Like, so I'll do things that I want to do. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5914.8s)]
*  And then a lot of my friends will do things that I want to do. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5919.4s)]
*  So I have to sometimes consciously make an effort to do things my friends want to do. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5923.84s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5928.48s)]
*  Right? [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5929.48s)]
*  Because it's not always, you're not a great friend if you're only doing things that you [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5930.48s)]
*  want to do. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5932.5199999999995s)]
*  True. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5933.5199999999995s)]
*  Right? [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5934.5199999999995s)]
*  So it's like, and then I got into this weird phase where I only hung out with people that [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5935.5199999999995s)]
*  I knew would only do what I want to do. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5939.44s)]
*  And you become a tyrant. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5942.24s)]
*  The equipment manager at Oklahoma State, everybody else is hanging out, I'm hanging out with [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5946.799999999999s)]
*  the equipment manager because it doesn't matter what I want to do, he's going to agree to [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5950.5599999999995s)]
*  it. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5954.5599999999995s)]
*  When I went to Oklahoma State, like when I went to AK, I'm hanging out with these random [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5955.5599999999995s)]
*  guys because they're always wanting to do what I wanted to do. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5960.679999999999s)]
*  But then ultimately, I started hanging out with Kane and all those guys. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5964.92s)]
*  And obviously, when Kane got into his situation, right, to be a good friend, I got to go into [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5968.96s)]
*  that jailhouse to sit with him and talk to him and try to support him as best I can. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5977.04s)]
*  And that's being a good friend. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5984.32s)]
*  At times I might not have done that. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5987.0s)]
*  I wouldn't have done that. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5989.36s)]
*  I would have called him, if he called, I would answer and thought that that was enough. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5990.84s)]
*  But that's not enough. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5996.900000000001s)]
*  To be a good friend, you got to really be a good friend because I've got some great [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=5998.04s)]
*  friends and I've got some great friends from childhood. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6002.0s)]
*  And it's like having a good, it's the best, man. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6005.56s)]
*  When you get good friends, it's the best. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6008.56s)]
*  Yeah, people that don't have good friends, I feel fucking terrible for them. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6010.84s)]
*  That sucks. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6014.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's not good. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6015.28s)]
*  You got to be having a good time with everybody. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6016.28s)]
*  Everybody. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6018.96s)]
*  Most people are pretty cool, man. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6020.08s)]
*  There's bad people, but I've been lucky. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6022.6s)]
*  I've been around some pretty cool people in my life. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6024.4800000000005s)]
*  John Anik's a cool fucking guy. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6027.44s)]

*  How does he do a job with us? [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6035.72s)]
*  Sometimes we're literally just talking. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6037.6s)]
*  And then John's like, this fight is brought to you by Toyo Tires. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6040.6s)]
*  And then he's like, all right, go ahead, boys. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6043.72s)]
*  He's got to do the real work. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6045.72s)]

*  Like tangents. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6048.72s)]

*  I'm like, Dean, that's disrespectful, man. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6081.4800000000005s)]

*  Bro, Kelvin Gastelum at 170. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6099.52s)]
*  I had a conversation with him at the Comedy Store one night. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6101.400000000001s)]
*  Really? [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6103.64s)]
*  And this was after he knocked out Biz Bang. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6104.64s)]
*  Oh, he knocked. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6106.08s)]

*  I think you're a world champion at 170. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6111.5599999999995s)]
*  Go back down. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6113.36s)]
*  Have you just had the discipline to just diet correctly? [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6114.36s)]
*  Because he always carried around all that bone. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6119.44s)]
*  A little extra weight, yep. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6121.04s)]
*  You could do that at heavyweight. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6123.04s)]
*  You can't do that at 85. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6124.28s)]
*  Not at 85, 70. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6125.28s)]
*  As you get lighter, you got to be better. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6126.74s)]
*  Look at him, look at his size, and then look at Drekka's duplacy. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6128.46s)]
*  That dude's huge. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6131.64s)]
*  He's huge. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6132.64s)]
*  Him and Sean Strickland is going to be fun. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6133.64s)]
*  That's going to be fun. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6136.04s)]
*  That's going to be a fun fight. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6138.0s)]
*  Because Drekka's is all for him. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6139.0s)]
*  I didn't think he was good. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6140.0s)]
*  I was always hard on Drekka's. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6143.0s)]
*  And then now I'm looking at him like, well, he beat Robert Whitaker, who is the man, and [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6145.0s)]
*  he beat him down. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6149.5199999999995s)]
*  He's going to be a good one. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6151.08s)]
*  He beat Darren Till easy. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6152.08s)]
*  He beat Darren Till easy. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6153.08s)]
*  That dude, he's tough. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6155.5199999999995s)]
*  That's a wild fight. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6156.5199999999995s)]
*  He's big, man. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6157.5199999999995s)]
*  He's huge. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6158.5199999999995s)]
*  He's so big for that weight class. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6159.5199999999995s)]
*  But Sean Strickland impressed me so much in that Adesanya fight. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6160.76s)]
*  I was like, my God. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6165.04s)]
*  The best thing for me in that fight was talking to Sean before, he had a bit of this uncertainty [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6167.96s)]
*  about himself. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6175.24s)]
*  Didn't know, right? [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6176.24s)]
*  Because Izzy is Izzy. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6177.32s)]
*  He's a global superstar. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6180.44s)]
*  He took the world by storm. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6181.76s)]
*  And Sean, just not very long ago, got knocked out by Pareto. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6183.88s)]
*  So he had these questions, and he doesn't hold back. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6187.6s)]
*  He's like, I don't know if I'm supposed to be here. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6193.6s)]
*  They gave me the title fight because nobody else was there to fight. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6195.799999999999s)]
*  And he was just telling the truth. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6198.679999999999s)]
*  But the moment he got into that octagon, he beat Izzy, man. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6200.44s)]
*  Every round, every second of the round. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6203.599999999999s)]
*  He did not look like he was overwhelmed. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6205.799999999999s)]
*  I said, he looks nervous when he walked into the octagon. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6207.32s)]
*  A minute in, I go, he's not nervous, fellas. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6212.2s)]
*  I go, this dude is locked in. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6214.48s)]
*  And he pitched a shutout. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6217.16s)]
*  That right hand that he landed was so clean. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6218.16s)]
*  Izzy never bounced back from it. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6221.5599999999995s)]
*  Never bounced back. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6222.5599999999995s)]
*  It was not just the right hand, it was all those left hands that came afterwards in the [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6223.72s)]
*  clinch. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6226.200000000001s)]
*  He just was hitting him. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6227.200000000001s)]
*  He hit him with a bunch of left hands in the clinch. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6228.200000000001s)]
*  He looked good, man. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6229.76s)]
*  He looked really good. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6230.76s)]
*  They have this UFC mouthpiece that they were using that registers how many times you get [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6232.64s)]
*  hit. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6236.200000000001s)]
*  He spars the most and gets hit the least. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6237.200000000001s)]
*  He does shoulder. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6240.160000000001s)]
*  He fights behind his shoulder. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6241.160000000001s)]
*  He does. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6242.160000000001s)]
*  That's why it's like. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6243.160000000001s)]
*  And his distance management is really good. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6244.160000000001s)]
*  He fights behind his shoulder. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6246.360000000001s)]
*  He manages distance well. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6247.6s)]
*  He's popping his jab. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6248.96s)]
*  And he's always out. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6250.52s)]
*  He's pressuring you. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6251.52s)]
*  These guys, he's good, man. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6253.4800000000005s)]
*  He's good. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6256.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, Drakus is good. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6257.4800000000005s)]
*  God, I cannot wait for Colby Covington versus Leon Edwards. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6259.200000000001s)]
*  Next week, two weeks, that's going to be good. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6264.040000000001s)]
*  That's a wild fight. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6266.280000000001s)]
*  That's a crazy fight. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6267.68s)]
*  That's a wild fight. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6268.68s)]
*  Can Colby still fight this dude? [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6269.68s)]
*  He hasn't fought in almost two years. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6270.68s)]
*  Well. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6272.68s)]
*  Leon has looked amazing. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6273.68s)]
*  Leon has looked amazing. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6274.68s)]
*  Leon, you know, there was a bump up once he got the champion. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6275.68s)]
*  There was. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6279.92s)]
*  There was a bump up. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6280.92s)]
*  In the second fight, he looked even better. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6282.32s)]
*  He got better. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6284.08s)]
*  He looked even better. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6285.08s)]
*  He wasn't dealing with the altitude. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6286.08s)]
*  You remember when we were in Utah? [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6287.08s)]
*  Like I was tired. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6289.4s)]
*  That's true. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6290.4s)]
*  It's like 5,000 feet. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6291.4s)]
*  Yeah, it sucks. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6292.4s)]
*  It sucks. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6293.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6294.4s)]
*  But he got better between fight one and fight two. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6296.4s)]
*  He defended takedowns better. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6300.2s)]
*  He outstruck Kamaru. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6302.12s)]
*  He just fought better. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6303.76s)]
*  He got that 30% champion bump. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6305.56s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6307.68s)]
*  When Teddy Adler said that, I was like, what is Teddy talking about? [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6308.68s)]
*  And then I was like, oh my God, he's actually better. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6312.360000000001s)]
*  Yo, Teddy Atlas. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6314.360000000001s)]
*  That fight. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6315.360000000001s)]
*  It's going to be a great fight. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6316.360000000001s)]
*  That's a wild fight, man. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6317.360000000001s)]
*  That's a wild fight. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6319.160000000001s)]
*  I believe Joe, for everyone we watch in this beautiful sport that we have, the honor of [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6320.52s)]
*  calling, no one, no one has done more with less than Colby Covington. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6326.92s)]
*  He's not the biggest. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6335.84s)]
*  He's not the fastest. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6336.84s)]
*  He's not the strongest. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6339.04s)]
*  But he wins. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6341.36s)]
*  And with those abilities, he has become a two-time NCAA All-American. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6343.2s)]
*  He has been the UFC interim champion. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6348.24s)]
*  He's fought for the belt two times, and he's fighting for the belt another time. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6350.24s)]
*  But nothing about Colby jumps off the page. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6353.88s)]
*  He's meat and potatoes, as meat and potatoes as it gets. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6356.44s)]
*  Volume. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6359.32s)]
*  Volume and cardio. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6360.32s)]
*  Endurance, cardio off the charts. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6361.32s)]
*  But that all comes with hard work. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6362.32s)]
*  He's not going to out-jump anyone. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6365.68s)]
*  He's not going to jump higher than anybody. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6367.32s)]
*  He's not going to run faster than anybody. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6368.56s)]
*  But with his abilities, he has done that. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6371.5599999999995s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6376.139999999999s)]
*  Because we have seen many people like this that don't accomplish what Colby Covington [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6377.78s)]
*  accomplished. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6382.46s)]
*  I think Colby Covington's a tremendous man, but Leon Edwards is a â I mean, dudes won [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6383.82s)]
*  13 fights in a row, or is not lost in 13 fights. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6391.0199999999995s)]
*  One of the smoothest strikers ever. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6394.0599999999995s)]
*  He's so smooth. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6395.54s)]
*  Boy. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6396.54s)]
*  Well, he started rocking. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6397.54s)]
*  You ever watch him hit the pads? [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6398.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6399.54s)]
*  I watched the thing today, and I was showing this to Lappey. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6401.3s)]
*  I said, I saw these guys sparring in glory. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6404.38s)]
*  And I said, there's never been a day in my life where I looked like this in sparring. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6409.22s)]
*  The combination was perfect, Joe. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6413.4s)]
*  He was on boom, boom, boom, kick, and then another kick. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6415.5s)]
*  I was like, you just don't look that smooth. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6418.94s)]
*  But my question is, look at him. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6422.18s)]
*  Yeah, look at him. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6424.54s)]
*  Look at this pad work. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6425.54s)]
*  Geez. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6428.54s)]
*  He looks good, bro. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6430.820000000001s)]
*  Everything is just so precise. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6433.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6434.740000000001s)]
*  He's the man. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6435.740000000001s)]
*  Everything he does. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6436.740000000001s)]
*  Rocky. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6437.740000000001s)]
*  Strong and big, too, though. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6438.740000000001s)]
*  He's big. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6441.14s)]
*  That fucking left high kick, bro. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6442.14s)]
*  Oh my God, that left high kick is hell. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6444.18s)]
*  I mean, he's really changed his life with that head kick. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6447.02s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6451.38s)]
*  And then he said, head kick bang. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6452.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6453.66s)]
*  He's in the octagon with you. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6454.66s)]
*  That post-fight interview was wild. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6455.66s)]
*  That was wild. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6458.26s)]

*  They said I couldn't do it. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6461.34s)]
*  Look at me now. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6462.34s)]
*  Play that, Jamie. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6463.34s)]
*  Look at me now. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6464.34s)]
*  Ooh, that was. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6465.34s)]
*  There's some of those man that make you tear up. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6466.34s)]
*  You flutter. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6467.34s)]
*  Dude, you tear up. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6468.34s)]
*  I couldn't do it, Joe. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6469.34s)]
*  It's been a long, long four years. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6470.34s)]
*  Do you all doubt to me that I couldn't do it? [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6471.34s)]
*  The ones that I couldn't do it? [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6472.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6473.34s)]
*  Look at me now. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6474.34s)]
*  That's crazy, bro. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6475.34s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6476.34s)]
*  The trenches are built. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6477.34s)]
*  That was so crazy. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6488.42s)]
*  Incredible. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6489.42s)]
*  It was so intense, bro. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6490.42s)]
*  That was incredible. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6491.42s)]
*  I'm tearing up. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6492.42s)]
*  Some of these ones, it's in those moments, right, where you can't help but feel good [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6493.42s)]
*  for the person. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6496.46s)]
*  Oh yeah, man. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6497.46s)]
*  I saw it was Amanda Nunes, too. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6498.46s)]
*  One time Amanda won, and we were all crying. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6500.18s)]
*  She had her daughter, and we're all sitting next to the octagon crying. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6504.46s)]
*  I was like, oh my God. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6507.42s)]
*  Doug Rose made me cry. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6508.42s)]
*  Oh, I was like, this is the most beautiful shit I've ever seen. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6509.42s)]
*  When you get to witness people accomplish great things, it's fucking amazing. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6514.18s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6520.22s)]
*  Even like, and I'm not talking about just athletically, but just in life. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6521.22s)]
*  In life. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6525.54s)]
*  When you see people do great things, you're like, wow, man, I'm happy for this dude. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6526.54s)]
*  I'm genuinely happy for this dude. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6530.46s)]
*  I remember when you first started to move here, I was like, I smiled, right? [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6532.3s)]
*  I was like, this dude worked really hard, and now he's done some amazing shit. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6538.46s)]
*  Like, good for Joe. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6542.5s)]
*  It's like, you could feel good for people. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6543.860000000001s)]
*  Like when I saw, this was way back in the day, when John Anik did his first UFC pay [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6546.46s)]
*  per view, I knew how he had started from ESPN. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6554.58s)]
*  This dude was doing overnight highlights, and then he did all those fight nights, and [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6558.54s)]
*  then he got up to the pay per view and it was you guys, and I said, look at John. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6564.22s)]
*  And I was like happy for him. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6568.02s)]
*  I think that's probably like the biggest thing is to have an ability to feel good for someone [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6569.62s)]
*  when they accomplish something great, because accomplishing great things is not easy. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6575.86s)]
*  It's very difficult. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6580.98s)]
*  So to see that and feel that appreciation for that person and their work, it's amazing, [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6583.099999999999s)]
*  man. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6587.78s)]
*  And we get to do that constantly, watching these humans just overcome and do things that [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6588.78s)]
*  you know 90% of the world can't do. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6597.099999999999s)]
*  It's nuts. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6601.179999999999s)]
*  And when you're around things like that a lot, it inspires you. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6602.179999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6605.46s)]
*  It inspires you to work harder, push harder. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6606.46s)]
*  You know, no one, like for a championship level MMA fight, is there a more difficult [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6608.58s)]
*  thing to prepare for in all of sports? [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6613.58s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6616.139999999999s)]
*  How could there be between the wrestling and the kicking and the punching and the jiu jitsu? [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6617.62s)]
*  What could be more difficult? [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6624.0599999999995s)]
*  When you have strength and conditioning sessions? [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6625.62s)]
*  When I was fighting at 205, I was doing one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6630.0199999999995s)]
*  nine. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6638.18s)]
*  Then I was doing 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 workouts a week to become a UFC champion. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6639.18s)]
*  I would get up at 7 a.m. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6650.0199999999995s)]
*  I would hit pads on Monday, Wednesday. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6651.0199999999995s)]
*  Then I would go to sparring and then I would do bikes at night, cardio, Tuesdays, 11 a.m. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6654.62s)]
*  pads, 12 o'clock wrestling. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6660.0199999999995s)]
*  Then at night I would hit pads again and run. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6661.78s)]
*  I was doing 15 a week. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6664.46s)]
*  And there were times, Joe, towards the end, because I started old. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6666.22s)]
*  I was almost 31 when I started fighting. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6669.34s)]
*  So there were times when I got to 37, 38 when I was the UFC champion where I would get so [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6672.74s)]
*  beat up because I wanted to train like I was taught to train my whole life that I would [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6681.34s)]
*  crawl up the stairs. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6686.780000000001s)]
*  I hear stories of Kamaru Usman walking down the stairs backwards. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6688.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he does that. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6692.620000000001s)]
*  But he's still fighting at it. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6694.580000000001s)]
*  But when those lights go on and he's inside the octagon or it's time to prepare, he gets [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6695.8s)]
*  himself ready. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6700.34s)]
*  That's what championship mixed martial arts is. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6701.700000000001s)]
*  Being so beat down, but being able to turn it on enough to work hard as you possibly [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6704.26s)]
*  can and give yourself an opportunity. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6709.5s)]
*  I would crawl up my stairs. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6711.7s)]
*  You imagine how good Kamaru would be with two good knees. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6713.34s)]
*  He has no knees. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6716.32s)]
*  Yeah, could you imagine that? [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6717.32s)]
*  Could you imagine? [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6718.58s)]
*  He's still one of the greatest wealth weights of all time and he has no knees. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6719.58s)]
*  No knees. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6722.94s)]
*  You ever notice the difference between the muscles in his leg and the muscles in his [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6723.94s)]
*  upper body? [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6726.38s)]
*  No. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6727.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6728.38s)]
*  He's got tiny legs. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6729.38s)]
*  Tiny legs. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6730.38s)]
*  His legs are so skinny. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6731.38s)]
*  He walks like it's almost like his knees are bent forward when he walks. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6732.38s)]
*  And I wonder if he developed that to relieve pressure off of his knees. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6734.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6740.34s)]
*  Yeah, he has to walk, he was telling me that he has to walk on the grass when he's next [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6741.34s)]
*  to grass on sidewalk. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6744.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6745.3s)]
*  He walks on the grass because it doesn't hurt his knees as much. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6746.3s)]
*  Can you believe that? [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6747.9800000000005s)]
*  But that's not, and that's crazy for Kamaru, but most athletes at the top of the sport [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6749.06s)]
*  have those types of stories because it just beats you down. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6755.3s)]
*  Like the sport beats you down, but there's nothing like it. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6759.06s)]
*  But there's no, like, no one's ever come back from a knee replacement. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6762.14s)]
*  No. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6765.42s)]
*  No, no, it's over. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6766.42s)]
*  If you got to replace your knee, it's over. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6767.94s)]
*  You got to put that stuff off until you're done. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6769.599999999999s)]
*  If I could do it again, I wouldn't have done the back surgery after the Lewis fight. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6772.62s)]
*  This thing says he still runs. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6777.58s)]
*  He still runs on his sprained knees. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6778.82s)]
*  He does run. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6779.82s)]
*  He does run. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6781.0599999999995s)]
*  Mike is a savage, though. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6782.0599999999995s)]
*  That seems so crazy. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6783.0599999999995s)]
*  He, dude, he spit in Singapore, too. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6784.0599999999995s)]
*  If y'all listening in Singapore, Mike spit. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6786.78s)]
*  I'm going to tell y'all right now, Mike spit. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6788.5s)]
*  He spit, bro. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6791.0199999999995s)]
*  Mike, he goes, I was running and I spit. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6792.0199999999995s)]
*  I was like, you know you're not supposed to do that here, man. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6794.099999999999s)]
*  You're not supposed to spit on the ground or spit gum out and stuff. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6796.34s)]
*  They don't like you to do that. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6799.82s)]
*  You can't eat sunflower seeds. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6800.82s)]
*  None of that stuff. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6801.82s)]
*  It's so clean there. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6802.82s)]
*  Wow. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6803.82s)]
*  Yeah, they don't like that. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6804.82s)]
*  So Mike spit on the ground in Singapore. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=6805.82s)]

*  Those guys are actual heavyweights. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7033.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7034.0s)]
*  If you can make 205, make 205. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7035.0s)]
*  Go to 205. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7036.0s)]
*  This is my advice. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7037.0s)]
*  Jai Elton. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7038.0s)]
*  At some point, Jai Elton's going to have to face that. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7039.0s)]
*  Like I'm not a heavyweight. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7040.8s)]
*  It'll be the moment somebody can't, he can't take them down. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7043.200000000001s)]
*  It'll be like, eh, I might, he might get through it, but he might have to reconsider because. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7045.68s)]
*  It's unfortunate because there was so much hype on him before the Lewis fight. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7050.12s)]
*  He just didn't fight well. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7053.88s)]
*  Didn't fight well. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7055.400000000001s)]
*  It was weird because. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7056.400000000001s)]
*  Almost like he just wanted to get that W. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7058.12s)]
*  Wanted to get a victory. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7059.839999999999s)]
*  I like Derrick and I think Derrick is like great for the sport, but like if I submitted [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7060.839999999999s)]
*  him, right? [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7067.16s)]
*  It's like you're a Brazilian jujitsu black belt. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7068.16s)]
*  You got to submit him. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7070.719999999999s)]
*  You know, you got to find a way to finish that fight. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7071.719999999999s)]
*  But Derrick's so strong. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7074.5599999999995s)]
*  He would try to punch Derrick and Derrick was just holding his hand with his arms. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7076.2s)]
*  He's like got two arms holding his hands. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7080.5599999999995s)]
*  And so the guys just stuck. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7082.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7085.04s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7086.04s)]
*  How strong must you be? [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7087.2s)]
*  How strong must you be to reach up and grab a guy by the hands and not let him hit you? [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7091.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7096.64s)]
*  We saw that again just recently. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7097.64s)]
*  Somebody was doing it. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7098.64s)]
*  It was Pereira. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7099.64s)]
*  Pereira was grabbing Uri's hands and not letting him hit him. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7100.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7105.08s)]
*  How? [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7106.08s)]
*  The strength. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7107.08s)]
*  How do you grab someone off your back and hold them enough to make sure they don't hit [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7108.08s)]
*  you? [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7111.32s)]
*  I would imagine if you have really long hands. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7112.32s)]
*  Yeah, like fingers. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7114.0s)]
*  Really big hands and long fingers and Pereira does. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7115.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7118.16s)]
*  We see him when he's walking with his hands up. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7119.16s)]
*  They're fucking huge. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7120.68s)]
*  They're paddles. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7121.68s)]
*  He was like. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7122.68s)]
*  Giant hands. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7123.68s)]
*  He was like holding him and like Uri's arm is like going sideways. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7124.68s)]
*  Semmy Schilt used to do that to dudes. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7126.52s)]
*  Really? [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7128.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7129.64s)]
*  Semmy Schilt used to grab a hold of wrists. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7130.64s)]
*  He'll grab a hold of your wrists and his hands were so huge. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7131.64s)]
*  Remember Semmy was like seven feet tall. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7133.92s)]
*  Yeah, he was like seven feet tall. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7135.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7136.92s)]
*  Those super tall guys like I don't think it benefits them. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7137.92s)]
*  Stefan Struven, those guys were at such a severe disadvantage because they were so tall. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7140.28s)]
*  Travis Brown. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7143.6s)]
*  I don't think he'd be 6'7 in fight MMA. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7144.6s)]
*  Really? [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7146.72s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7147.72s)]
*  I think it's too tall. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7148.72s)]
*  Too much leg. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7149.72s)]
*  Too much like they can take you down. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7151.0s)]
*  I don't think it works. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7153.04s)]
*  I think the perfect heavyweight is about 6'4, 255, 260. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7154.52s)]
*  That's what I think. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7162.84s)]
*  For me, I think that's what the perfect heavyweight looks like. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7163.84s)]
*  I think the perfect heavyweight is Francis. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7167.04s)]
*  What's Francis? [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7169.92s)]
*  6'5? [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7170.92s)]
*  6'4? [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7171.92s)]
*  6'4, 6'5, 260. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7173.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7174.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7175.28s)]
*  Perfect heavyweight. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7176.28s)]
*  Somewhere in that range. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7177.28s)]
*  6'4, 6'5, 260. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7178.28s)]
*  A natural 260 jacked. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7179.28s)]
*  Yes, jacked, strong. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7180.28s)]
*  That's the perfect heavyweight. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7184.0s)]
*  Are you bummed out that we don't get to see John Jones versus Francis? [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7185.0s)]
*  I am bummed out. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7189.36s)]
*  I'm so sad about it. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7190.36s)]
*  I do not like that. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7191.36s)]
*  That's the one that I wish and I think now Francis is making so much money boxing he'll [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7192.36s)]
*  never come back. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7197.08s)]
*  Well, the only way to get him to come back, you see the problem is he signed this contract [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7198.08s)]
*  with the PFL. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7203.04s)]
*  If he didn't sign a contract, well who knows, maybe he wouldn't have got the boxing match. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7204.2s)]
*  Yeah, he wouldn't have got the boxing. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7207.56s)]
*  So he goes and he gets his boxing match. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7209.28s)]
*  Now he's a superstar. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7211.76s)]
*  He drops Tyson Fury. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7213.04s)]
*  He beats him up in the eighth round. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7214.4800000000005s)]
*  It was wild. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7215.72s)]
*  It was crazy to watch. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7216.72s)]
*  Wild to watch. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7217.72s)]
*  Like I can't believe it. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7218.72s)]
*  Crazy to watch. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7219.72s)]
*  I was on the seat of my fucking chair. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7220.72s)]
*  Hoping he was what it is. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7221.72s)]
*  I was grabbing cushions. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7222.72s)]
*  I was like please, please win, please win. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7223.72s)]
*  I was grabbing cushions, twisting in the eighth round. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7224.72s)]
*  Like Jesus, oh my God, he's got him. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7227.4800000000005s)]
*  It felt like he had, it was crazy because every time, and I told this to a boxing guy, [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7230.36s)]
*  I went on an interview and I said, even though I believe that Tyson is going to win, I'm [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7236.16s)]
*  an MMA guy and he's one of ours so let's go. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7245.88s)]
*  He's going to beat him. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7248.48s)]
*  I was like he's going to knock him out. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7249.48s)]
*  Then he started winning and I was like oh my God, he might actually win. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7251.4s)]
*  So while I was rooting for Francis, I didn't necessarily know if he really could beat him. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7255.4s)]
*  But then when it started to become a little bit closer, I was like oh my God, has Tyson [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7260.4s)]
*  Fury come on this? [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7263.96s)]
*  Yes. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7264.96s)]
*  On the show? [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7265.96s)]
*  Yes. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7266.96s)]
*  He's huge, right? [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7267.96s)]
*  He's giant. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7268.96s)]
*  He's a monster. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7269.96s)]
*  Yeah, he's huge. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7270.96s)]
*  But he didn't look great against Francis. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7271.96s)]
*  Do you think that he overestimated himself? [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7272.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7275.28s)]
*  You think that's what it was? [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7276.28s)]
*  I think he overlooked Francis. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7277.28s)]
*  Underestimated Francis. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7278.28s)]
*  He said going into the fight that his diet was like hamburgers and McDonald's. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7280.44s)]
*  He said that. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7285.879999999999s)]
*  Walking into the fight night. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7286.879999999999s)]
*  And he hit him with an elbow too. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7289.719999999999s)]
*  It was a beautiful elbow. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7291.36s)]
*  Nice elbow. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7292.36s)]
*  It was a beautiful elbow. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7293.36s)]
*  You think that was on purpose? [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7294.36s)]
*  No, he couldn't do that again. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7295.36s)]
*  He couldn't do that again. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7297.719999999999s)]
*  Unless he knows how to throw an elbow, which I bet he does. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7299.879999999999s)]
*  I would bet you that Tyson Fury, I mean not perfect like that. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7302.96s)]
*  Oh man, it looked like he was throwing an elbow. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7305.96s)]
*  Look at Joe, look at how he turns the elbow over. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7308.5199999999995s)]
*  That's good skills. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7310.799999999999s)]
*  But of course he would learn that. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7312.48s)]
*  Why wouldn't he learn that? [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7313.879999999999s)]
*  He knows how to box. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7314.879999999999s)]
*  He's trying to punch him. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7315.879999999999s)]
*  It looks like he's trying to throw an overhand. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7316.879999999999s)]
*  Right? [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7318.919999999999s)]
*  And he just misses. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7319.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I guess maybe. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7321.639999999999s)]
*  It also could be he's throwing an elbow. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7323.04s)]
*  It's not like he doesn't know how to throw it. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7325.36s)]
*  Just because he knows how to box, you don't think someone's showing him how to throw elbows? [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7327.16s)]
*  I don't think he can throw an elbow. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7330.0s)]
*  Why not? [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7331.919999999999s)]
*  I just don't believe it. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7332.919999999999s)]
*  It could be a hidden skill. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7333.919999999999s)]
*  I mean let's see this. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7335.32s)]
*  This looks like he is even. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7337.72s)]
*  I mean he... [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7340.16s)]
*  Let's see. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7341.16s)]
*  He misses. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7342.16s)]
*  I feel like his hands are already turned down. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7343.16s)]
*  His hands turned down at range. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7345.16s)]
*  Did this guy just actually throw an elbow? [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7347.16s)]
*  He's throwing an elbow. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7349.240000000001s)]
*  He just threw an elbow. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7350.240000000001s)]
*  So when Francis is saying Tyson cheated, Tyson knew what he was doing. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7352.56s)]
*  It looked like an elbow. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7357.280000000001s)]
*  I mean it could be an accident. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7358.280000000001s)]
*  We don't know. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7361.76s)]
*  It's perfect. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7362.76s)]
*  But if that was an MMA fight or a Muay Thai fight, I would say that's a beautiful elbow. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7363.76s)]
*  Chris Weidman and Mark Munoz. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7366.72s)]
*  Yes. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7367.72s)]
*  Do you remember that one? [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7368.72s)]
*  Yes. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7369.72s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7370.72s)]
*  Just like that. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7371.72s)]
*  Just like that. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7372.72s)]
*  But more devastating. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7373.72s)]
*  But Mark was running into it. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7374.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7375.72s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7376.72s)]
*  Mark was trying to get close and Weidman just timed the perfect elbow. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7377.72s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7379.72s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7380.72s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7381.72s)]
*  Perfect timing. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7382.72s)]
*  And remember how bad it split him open? [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7383.72s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7385.72s)]
*  Dude, Weidman was a mother fucker as well. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7386.72s)]
*  He was the best, wasn't he? [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7388.12s)]
*  He was the best. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7390.12s)]
*  The one kick with Luke Rockhold changed his whole career. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7392.8s)]
*  Why did he do that? [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7395.92s)]
*  He did that spinning kick. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7396.92s)]
*  He should have never did that. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7397.92s)]
*  But how crazy is that? [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7399.12s)]
*  It's one mistake, dude. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7400.12s)]
*  Sometimes it's one mistake in there. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7401.72s)]
*  You make one mistake and it costs you. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7403.04s)]
*  He did that kick. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7405.76s)]
*  Luke gets on top and Luke just beat the shit out of him. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7406.92s)]
*  He would have never taken him down. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7411.4s)]
*  He had never taken Chris down. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7413.66s)]
*  But when he beat him up that bad that way, he goes, I'm going to take this dude down [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7415.56s)]
*  now. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7419.4s)]
*  So then he went and chased him down. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7420.4s)]
*  If Chris doesn't do that kick. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7422.4400000000005s)]
*  Rockhold's top pressure. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7423.4400000000005s)]
*  He was so good on top, Joe. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7425.3s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7426.900000000001s)]
*  He was so good on top. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7427.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7428.900000000001s)]
*  People don't give him his props. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7429.900000000001s)]
*  He's one of those guys that his personality has turned people off to the point that they [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7430.900000000001s)]
*  don't respect what he did in the octagon. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7437.02s)]
*  This guy beat Tim Kennedy in Strike Force. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7439.34s)]
*  He beat Jacare Souza. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7442.38s)]
*  He beat everybody. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7444.24s)]
*  Then he became the UFC champion. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7445.24s)]
*  He beat Bisping once. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7447.12s)]
*  He beat a lot of good guys. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7448.860000000001s)]
*  Do you remember the reverse triangle against the guy in Atlanta? [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7450.02s)]
*  What was that guy's name in Atlanta? [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7454.900000000001s)]
*  Luke Rockhold did a reverse triangle. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7457.5s)]
*  It was nasty. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7459.820000000001s)]
*  I can't remember the guy's name. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7460.820000000001s)]
*  David Branch? [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7464.22s)]
*  Was it David Branch? [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7465.22s)]
*  I mean, he was just, look at this. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7466.22s)]
*  This is against the big burly cat that was in the UFC back in the day. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7468.34s)]
*  Tim Bosch I think his name was. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7472.900000000001s)]
*  Luke hits him with the Kimura. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7475.540000000001s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7479.179999999999s)]
*  He hits a reverse triangle on this dude. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7480.179999999999s)]
*  That's Bosch too. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7482.98s)]
*  That's how he got him in the deal. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7483.98s)]
*  Off the reverse triangle. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7487.94s)]
*  But it was a black guy that he got with the reverse triangle in Atlanta. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7488.94s)]
*  David Branch I believe who it was. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7492.46s)]
*  It was sick. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7494.42s)]
*  Well, David Branch came after him in the beginning of that round. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7495.42s)]
*  He caught him a couple of times. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7498.98s)]
*  Came at Luke. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7500.82s)]
*  Yeah, unloaded. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7501.82s)]
*  Unloaded. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7502.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7503.82s)]
*  Thought he could punk him. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7504.82s)]
*  But you know, Luke's biggest issue was when people realized, and it was bisming, when [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7505.86s)]
*  people realized that if you hit him you could hurt him, they started throwing caution to [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7512.62s)]
*  the wind. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7516.94s)]
*  And that's when he started to struggle. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7517.94s)]
*  Because we used to beat each other up quite a bit in the gym. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7520.0199999999995s)]
*  Like it was bad. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7523.5s)]
*  And when people realized that if you could hit him, you might be able to put him out [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7525.34s)]
*  of there. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7529.34s)]
*  He got knocked out by Mike. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7530.860000000001s)]
*  Then he got knocked out by Romero. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7531.860000000001s)]
*  Then he got knocked out by Jan Behovic. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7535.06s)]
*  And it was like, if you can get your hands on him, you can put him out. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7538.46s)]
*  Well, Behovic too. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7542.46s)]
*  That's 205. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7543.46s)]
*  Yeah, he went up. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7544.46s)]
*  Behovic's a big dude. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7545.46s)]
*  He thought he was going to be okay up there, right? [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7546.46s)]
*  And why would you not? [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7548.46s)]
*  Because you had been training with us for so long. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7549.46s)]
*  Right. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7551.46s)]
*  And I had become the champ there. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7552.46s)]
*  You know I didn't know Jan Behovic and I were in the same weight class? [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7554.66s)]
*  I thought he fought at 185, bro. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7558.1s)]
*  I swear to God. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7560.139999999999s)]
*  So then I asked him a question. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7561.139999999999s)]
*  I was like, well, since you went to 205, he was like DC. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7562.139999999999s)]
*  I was like, yeah. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7565.46s)]
*  He was like, I was ranked in the top 15 while you were the champion, idiot. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7566.46s)]
*  I was like, really? [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7570.98s)]
*  I had no idea. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7571.98s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7572.98s)]
*  You didn't even know he was in your weight class. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7573.98s)]
*  Because when you're the best, when you're the champ, you really are looking one to five. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7576.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't think I ever looked past five. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7582.179999999999s)]
*  Because I figured I was never going to fight any of those guys. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7584.5199999999995s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7587.38s)]
*  I was always going to be either Glover, Jones, and then they said Volkan, Oztamir. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7588.38s)]
*  And I was like, same paycheck? [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7593.38s)]
*  I was like, same pay? [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7596.38s)]
*  It was like, yeah, yeah. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7598.38s)]
*  I was like, all right, yeah. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7600.38s)]
*  Volkan. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7602.38s)]
*  Funny. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7603.38s)]
*  Yuri Prochaska, like up until this Pajero fight, he was one of the most interesting guys [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7604.38s)]
*  in the light heavyweight division. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7610.34s)]
*  Because he just does everything so weird. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7612.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7614.38s)]
*  He's a very unorthodox guy, but he's also a guy that was groomed outside of the UFC. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7615.38s)]
*  He beat, one night he beat, I mean, he beat CB Dalloway and King Mo on the same night. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7622.62s)]
*  Wow. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7627.62s)]
*  Yeah, he was the man. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7628.62s)]
*  So he was ready. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7629.62s)]
*  That's why he had won the UFC title in three fights. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7630.82s)]
*  He only fought Volkan when he got there, his first fight. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7636.1s)]
*  Then he beat Dominic Reyes. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7639.54s)]
*  Then he beat Glover to become the champ. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7641.02s)]
*  It's nuts. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7643.46s)]
*  For me, it's crazy also to see at 205 how between 2010 all the way to 20, nobody had [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7644.54s)]
*  the belt but me and John Jones. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7651.98s)]
*  And then the belt just kept getting passed around. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7654.5s)]
*  I wonder who is going to be the person that brings stability again. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7656.94s)]
*  Do you think Perdida can be that long reigning champion? [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7661.82s)]
*  I mean, with Jamal Hill and all those guys out there, they're all so good and so close. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7665.1s)]
*  They're all so good and so close. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7669.58s)]
*  I'm curious to see how his grappling progresses. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7671.46s)]
*  He has got to get better. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7675.82s)]
*  Yeah, but it can get better and Glover is a great coach. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7676.82s)]
*  It's good to be with Glover to pick up the finer points of grappling, especially grappling [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7680.14s)]
*  for MMA. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7684.18s)]
*  Is it just about him when he gets taken down to survive? [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7685.18s)]
*  Because that's what he did against John, knowing that he doesn't get tired and he can beat [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7688.78s)]
*  you up. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7692.7s)]
*  He did it against Yuri. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7693.7s)]
*  Yuri beat him in the first round, same thing. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7694.7s)]
*  But then every round starts on the feet, like you said. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7697.26s)]
*  And every round he's going to chop that calf. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7699.7s)]
*  And he'll beat you up until eventually he gets you. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7701.3s)]
*  But at what point does a Bo Nickel or somebody get a hold of him? [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7703.86s)]
*  That's a very good point. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7706.54s)]
*  He can't get away from him. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7707.74s)]
*  Well, you know, if Bo goes up to 205. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7709.22s)]
*  He'd have to go up now, but he was at 85 before. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7710.94s)]
*  I don't think Perdida is going to drop back down again. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7712.94s)]
*  No, he's not. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7714.34s)]
*  He said he's not. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7715.34s)]
*  What is he, 35 now? [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7716.34s)]
*  34, 35? [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7717.34s)]
*  It's so crazy when you see him. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7718.34s)]
*  You think he's young. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7720.34s)]
*  He's in his mid-30s. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7721.34s)]
*  Well, he had a long kickboxing career. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7722.34s)]
*  He literally was in that bar in Brazil and Izzy had to say something. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7725.62s)]
*  Did you ever see his fight with Dustin Jacoby? [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7729.66s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7731.38s)]
*  It's another one. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7732.38s)]
*  Dustin Jacoby was a really good kickboxer? [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7733.38s)]
*  Very good kickboxer. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7734.38s)]
*  Wow. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7735.38s)]
*  He's a good athlete. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7736.38s)]
*  He was a quarterback, I think, in football or something. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7737.38s)]
*  But Paheta shut his lights out with a left hook. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7739.38s)]
*  Knocked him out. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7741.38s)]
*  That left hook is nasty. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7742.38s)]
*  It's brutal. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7743.38s)]
*  He's so good. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7744.38s)]
*  This is like the first time I think I saw Paheta fight was this fight. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7745.38s)]
*  See, you can find that. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7748.78s)]
*  I think this was the first time I saw him fight. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7750.66s)]
*  He's so good, bro. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7752.3s)]
*  And I was just like, whoa. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7753.3s)]
*  Like, that is extraordinary power. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7755.3s)]
*  And then I'm like, I'm going to keep my eye on this dude. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7756.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7759.3s)]
*  And I watched a few of his fights. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7760.3s)]
*  The Justin Willis fight was insane. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7761.3s)]
*  Let's see that. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7763.3s)]
*  Oh. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7765.3s)]
*  I mean, dude, that's just a different kind of power. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7767.3s)]
*  That left hook is nasty. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7770.3s)]
*  Let me see that again. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7771.3s)]
*  That is just a different kind of power. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7773.3s)]
*  He always lifts his knee, too. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7775.3s)]
*  Where it needs to stay in the hands. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7777.3s)]
*  That's what's doing it. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7778.3s)]
*  And just keep hunking with the hands. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7779.3s)]
*  Oh. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7781.3s)]
*  That's nasty. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7783.3s)]
*  Who hits harder than that? [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7784.3s)]
*  I don't think anybody does. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7786.3s)]
*  I don't think anybody does. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7787.3s)]
*  I really don't think anybody does. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7788.3s)]
*  Find the Justin Willis fight. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7790.3s)]
*  Excuse me, Jason. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7792.3s)]
*  Jason Willis fight. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7793.3s)]
*  And when these guys are going down, they're like out. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7794.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7797.3s)]
*  They're out. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7798.3s)]
*  That's the crazy thing about the way he hits guys. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7799.3s)]
*  It's different. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7800.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7801.3s)]
*  His power is just, it's nuclear. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7802.3s)]
*  And what about your boy Yuri? [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7804.3s)]
*  He was like, yeah, stop it, just fine. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7806.3s)]
*  Yeah, he said that. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7808.3s)]
*  But then afterwards, he changed his mind. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7809.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7811.3s)]
*  Watch this. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7812.3s)]
*  Those legs. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7813.3s)]
*  Nice outside low kick. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7814.3s)]
*  And by the way, Willis is like a legit world champ. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7816.3s)]
*  Really? [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7819.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7820.3s)]
*  Legit world champion. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7821.3s)]
*  This is a high level fight. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7822.3s)]
*  Pereira, he's tall, man. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7824.3s)]
*  Sweat this. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7826.3s)]
*  Oh! [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7827.3s)]
*  Head kick. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7828.3s)]
*  Alex Pereira! [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7829.3s)]
*  My goodness! [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7830.3s)]
*  And he's busting Willis wide open. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7831.3s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7834.3s)]
*  Now wait for the end. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7835.3s)]
*  That looked like it hit his hand. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7836.3s)]
*  Oh! [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7838.3s)]
*  That's that same knee from before. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7839.3s)]
*  See, but this, this Joe, look at this Joe. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7845.3s)]
*  What's, now tell me this guy's not done. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7848.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7850.3s)]
*  To my point about boxing and- [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7851.3s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7852.3s)]
*  Tell me Willis is not done. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7853.3s)]
*  And you're counting. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7854.3s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7855.3s)]
*  Imagine. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7856.3s)]
*  He was already counting. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7857.3s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7858.3s)]
*  If that guy could have got up at eight or nine, they would have let him go back to fight Pereira. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7859.3s)]
*  Bro, that knee is fucking brutal. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7863.3s)]
*  That's the one he got the guy with in the beginning. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7865.3s)]
*  Yep. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7867.3s)]
*  In the UFC. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7868.3s)]
*  You know, so when you see a guy like that that's doing that at two different weight classes [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7869.3s)]
*  in kickboxing, you can't wait to see a guy like that fighting down in the name. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7872.8s)]
*  Hey, so I want to ask you this. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7876.3s)]
*  Alex Volkonovsky, right? [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7879.3s)]
*  He spoke about after the fight with Islam how he was in his own head when he didn't [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7882.3s)]
*  have anything. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7888.3s)]
*  Now he's fighting against Ilya Toporya very quickly. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7889.3s)]
*  I wonder a lot if Alex Volkonovsky will have any lingering effects from that knockout because [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7893.3s)]
*  when we see him, we're all like raving. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7899.3s)]
*  He's the best. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7901.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7902.3s)]
*  Is it just as simple as him just going back down to 45 and he'll be fine again? [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7903.3s)]
*  Because Toporya is a monster, bro. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7905.3s)]
*  Toporya is a monster. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7908.3s)]
*  And that's a fight you don't want to take if you're compromised. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7909.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7912.3s)]
*  And it's also a fight that he could have just waited for. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7913.3s)]
*  You know, I'm all in favor of making wild fights. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7915.3s)]
*  And when Dana White was like, it's going to be Volkonovsky versus Makachev too. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7919.3s)]
*  I'm like, oh, shit. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7924.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7925.3s)]
*  Take my money. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7926.3s)]
*  Yeah, let's go. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7927.3s)]
*  Take my money. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7928.3s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7929.3s)]
*  But if I was Alex's friend and we were talking about this, if you asked me for advice, I'd [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7930.3s)]
*  have to think about it a lot. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7935.3s)]
*  Because I would think, I know you believe you can beat him because you almost beat him [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7937.3s)]
*  in the first fight. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7941.3s)]
*  However, you had a full camp. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7942.3s)]
*  Yes. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7944.3s)]
*  How much better are you with a full camp? [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7945.3s)]
*  You're better. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7947.3s)]
*  Everyone's better. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7948.3s)]
*  Way better. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7949.3s)]
*  No one is better with no camp. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7950.3s)]
*  Right? [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7952.3s)]
*  Can we agree? [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7953.3s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7954.3s)]
*  Especially if you're not injured in camp. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7955.3s)]
*  No one's better with no camp. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7956.3s)]
*  Yeah, nobody. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7958.3s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7959.3s)]
*  So it's dependent upon how hard you were training. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7960.3s)]
*  How hard were you training before you took this fight on 10 Days Nose? [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7963.3s)]
*  Were you preparing for potentially fighting two months from now and you already ramped [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7966.3s)]
*  up training and you already have like real good cardio and you're already sparring? [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7970.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7973.3s)]
*  Or have you been just kind of fucking off here and there and then you're like, I could [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7974.3s)]
*  fucking do it. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7978.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7979.3s)]
*  Because I can fucking do it is not a good strategy against the best pound for pound [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7980.3s)]
*  fighter in the world. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7984.3s)]
*  Right in the world. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7985.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7986.3s)]
*  You want a camp. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7987.3s)]
*  Like a rematch was going to happen anyway. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7988.3s)]
*  Yes. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7989.3s)]
*  It had to happen. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7990.3s)]
*  Yes. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7991.3s)]
*  But you don't take that rematch, in my opinion, with 10 days notice. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7992.3s)]
*  That seems insane. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7995.3s)]
*  And the only reason. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7997.3s)]
*  You want 10 weeks. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7998.3s)]
*  You want 10 weeks. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=7999.3s)]
*  You want 10 weeks. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8000.3s)]
*  But the only reason anyone thought he had an opportunity was because of how great he [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8001.3s)]
*  is. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8004.3s)]
*  Yes. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8005.3s)]
*  Right? [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8006.3s)]
*  If he wasn't so great, nobody would have ever thought he had a chance. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8007.3s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8009.3s)]
*  But because of his greatness, I worry that because of his greatness, we're going to believe [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8010.3s)]
*  that come February or January, he's going to fight to poria and you almost expect the [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8017.3s)]
*  same thing. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8023.3s)]
*  But what if it's too soon? [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8025.3s)]
*  And listen, even if he wasn't compromised, even if he didn't fight Islam, to poria is [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8027.3s)]
*  a nightmare. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8034.3s)]
*  Yes, he is. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8035.3s)]
*  He's a nightmare. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8036.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8037.3s)]
*  He's scary. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8038.3s)]
*  What he did to Josh Emmett, I was like, oh man. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8039.3s)]
*  He's nasty. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8041.3s)]
*  What he did to Bryce Mitchell, like, oh man. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8042.3s)]
*  He's so good. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8044.3s)]
*  He's so skilled. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8045.3s)]
*  He's got great boxing, got great take on the fence. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8046.3s)]
*  Everywhere. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8049.3s)]
*  He got knocked out by Jones in Anaheim and I got called for a fight in late September [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8050.3s)]
*  and I said, no, I need time. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8057.3s)]
*  I need to let my brain heal. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8060.3s)]
*  He got knocked out in October. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8063.3s)]
*  He's going to fight in February. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8065.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8067.3s)]
*  It's fast, man. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8068.3s)]
*  I just, it just. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8069.3s)]
*  He got knocked out by a shin. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8070.3s)]
*  A shin. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8072.3s)]
*  A shin to the head. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8073.3s)]
*  It's just, it's a little bit worrisome for me and I like Volk. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8074.3s)]
*  He's the man. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8076.3s)]
*  But then again, Izzy knocked Paheta out cold. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8077.3s)]
*  Yep. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8081.3s)]
*  In November. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8082.3s)]
*  Three months later, he's fighting Jan Bojovic. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8083.3s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8085.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8086.3s)]
*  And fought better. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8087.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8088.3s)]
*  He got knocked out in April, one in July. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8089.3s)]
*  Out cold. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8091.3s)]
*  Out cold. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8092.3s)]
*  I mean, Volkanovski wasn't out cold. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8093.3s)]
*  To sleep. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8095.3s)]
*  No, he was not out cold. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8096.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8097.3s)]
*  This guy was asleep and Izzy was above him shooting arrows into his body. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8098.3s)]
*  Doing some crazy stuff, right? [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8100.3s)]
*  Wild. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8102.3s)]
*  And then three months later, that dude's fighting Jan Bojovic. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8103.3s)]
*  Yo, six months later, he's the world champion. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8105.3s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8107.3s)]
*  Elect Ferreira. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8108.3s)]
*  I mean, he's had one of the quickest rides, the absolute quickest of two titles. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8109.3s)]
*  I've never seen anything like that. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8114.3s)]
*  Nothing, nothing ever been like that. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8115.3s)]
*  No, never in my life. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8116.3s)]
*  The thing is, man, like if the dude really can just survive under everybody if he gets [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8117.3s)]
*  taken down and then just beats your legs up, like. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8122.3s)]
*  Beats your legs up. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8125.3s)]
*  It's a real problem. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8126.3s)]
*  He beats your legs up and then he forces you to make a mistake and he takes advantage. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8127.3s)]
*  Yes. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8131.3s)]
*  Every single time. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8132.3s)]
*  But I think Jamal Hill's a real challenge for him. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8133.3s)]
*  You think so? [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8136.3s)]
*  The unorthodox? [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8137.3s)]
*  Jamal's a sniper, man. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8138.3s)]
*  He finds chins. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8140.3s)]
*  Jamal said he's not going to take him down. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8141.3s)]
*  He's a clever dude. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8143.3s)]
*  He said he's not taking him down. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8144.3s)]
*  He's going to knock him out. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8145.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8146.3s)]
*  He said, I'm not taking him down. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8147.3s)]
*  I'm going to knock him out. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8149.3s)]
*  He might. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8151.3s)]
*  I think I would take him down. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8152.3s)]
*  Well, who knows? [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8153.3s)]
*  We're going to find out. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8154.3s)]
*  I would try to take him down. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8155.3s)]
*  I would definitely not give him just a stand up fight. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8156.3s)]
*  Jamal's got some nasty hands, man. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8159.3s)]
*  He does. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8163.3s)]
*  He really does have some nasty hands. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8164.3s)]
*  He promises to KO Alex Beheada standing. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8166.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8170.3s)]
*  You know, I have never seen him fight anybody of that caliber. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8171.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8175.3s)]
*  Yet. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8176.3s)]
*  But I think he's capable. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8177.3s)]
*  He's very capable. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8178.3s)]
*  You know, what he did to Glover was very impressive. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8179.3s)]
*  Dude, he just beat him up. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8182.3s)]
*  Just beat him up. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8183.3s)]
*  He really did just beat him up. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8184.3s)]
*  I mean, when you think of how Yuri struggled with Glover, and then Jamal Hill just pieced [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8185.3s)]
*  him up. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8189.860000000001s)]
*  Jamal just pieced him up. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8190.860000000001s)]
*  He just kept touching him and touching him and touching him. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8191.860000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8192.86s)]
*  And it was clever. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8193.86s)]
*  It was smooth. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8194.86s)]
*  He's so unorthodox. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8195.86s)]
*  He does these weird movements where he's kind of like back. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8196.86s)]
*  His head and chest are behind his feet. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8201.78s)]
*  He's like. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8203.3s)]
*  But it works. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8204.3s)]
*  It works. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8205.3s)]
*  It works. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8206.3s)]
*  He's developed a style for him. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8207.3s)]
*  And he's got power. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8208.3s)]
*  He's got power. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8209.3s)]
*  He's got real power. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8210.3s)]
*  He's so big. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8211.3s)]
*  Johnny Walker KO. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8212.3s)]
*  He's so big for the weight. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8213.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8214.3s)]
*  I mean, right now he's as big as I've ever seen him. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8215.3s)]
*  But he's like huge for the weight class. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8217.06s)]
*  How much more time does he need for his Achilles? [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8219.34s)]
*  It's gonna be a little bit. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8221.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8222.3s)]
*  He's not Aaron Rodgers. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8223.3s)]
*  Hey bro, you know what's something funny shit I've ever seen in my life? [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8224.3s)]
*  What? [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8227.3s)]
*  You know what I'm gonna say. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8228.3s)]
*  When Aaron Rodgers was, something happened with Aaron Rodgers and he said, you told him [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8230.06s)]
*  something. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8234.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8235.099999999999s)]
*  That was the craziest shit. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8236.099999999999s)]
*  I was like, Joe's a doctor. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8237.099999999999s)]
*  He was telling me all this stuff. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8238.099999999999s)]
*  He was saying all this stuff. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8239.099999999999s)]
*  And I was like, wow, he did it. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8240.46s)]
*  But now I'll never question you are Aaron Rodgers because Aaron Rodgers is about to [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8242.86s)]
*  play football 11 weeks after Terrence Gillies. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8247.34s)]
*  What is he doing? [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8250.82s)]
*  How? [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8251.82s)]
*  You'd probably have to ask him. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8252.82s)]
*  You know him? [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8255.42s)]
*  Yep. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8256.42s)]
*  Tell him. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8257.42s)]
*  Do you need to tell me what he's doing? [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8258.42s)]
*  I'll tell you later. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8259.42s)]
*  This dude is somehow playing after 11 weeks. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8260.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8263.94s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8264.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty crazy. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8265.94s)]
*  Joe, when I saw him on the field throwing that football, I could not believe it. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8266.94s)]
*  He tore his Achilles. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8271.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8273.98s)]
*  Seven weeks later, he was on the field throwing passes. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8274.98s)]
*  He got cleared for football activities this week. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8277.94s)]
*  How? [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8281.46s)]
*  He's 40. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8282.46s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of modern science going on here. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8283.46s)]
*  Look at him. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8286.859999999999s)]
*  Get out of here, man. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8287.859999999999s)]
*  My man. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8288.859999999999s)]
*  This shit is crazy, man. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8289.859999999999s)]
*  I'm like, when I start feeling bad, I'm not calling nobody but you. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8290.859999999999s)]
*  I want you to tell me how to feel better. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8295.859999999999s)]
*  How? [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8298.859999999999s)]
*  How? [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8299.859999999999s)]
*  If I guess, if I didn't know, I would tell you peptides. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8301.82s)]
*  If you had to guess. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8305.1s)]
*  Okay. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8306.1s)]
*  If I didn't know, I'd tell you peptides. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8307.1s)]
*  Yes. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8308.1s)]
*  Because, dude, how? [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8309.1s)]
*  This guy is ... That's what I think people should be using for the UFC. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8310.1s)]
*  This is the argument for peptides, if that's what he's using. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8314.12s)]
*  I'm not saying he is. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8316.7s)]
*  But that's the argument, is that they help you heal. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8318.480000000001s)]
*  And when you're dealing with all these issues, like John Jones. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8321.02s)]
*  John Jones should be able to get some peptides. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8323.74s)]
*  If he did peptides, would it help his ... Yes, it would help through his recovery. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8325.720000000001s)]
*  Can I see that picture of Aaron Rodgers again? [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8330.3s)]
*  He looked good out there, too. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8332.02s)]
*  He looked good. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8333.02s)]
*  Could you imagine being in the Jets, though? [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8334.02s)]
*  Oh, man. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8335.02s)]
*  Dude, it was perfect. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8336.02s)]
*  He runs out. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8337.02s)]
*  He's carrying this huge American flag. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8338.02s)]
*  That place was loud. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8339.3s)]
*  I don't watch the Jets. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8340.66s)]
*  I don't know if you watch football, but ... I do. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8342.62s)]
*  Aaron Rodgers going to the Jets was like ... The Jets have been terrible for a long time. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8344.86s)]
*  They have the world. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8351.18s)]
*  I like ... They have the world. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8352.66s)]
*  Everything's going for them. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8356.32s)]
*  His legs look jacked, too. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8357.32s)]
*  They look jacked. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8359.06s)]
*  It doesn't look like he had any atrophy. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8360.06s)]
*  Look at him. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8361.06s)]
*  He's just stepping up on his toe and everything. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8362.06s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8364.16s)]
*  Wild. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8365.16s)]
*  He runs out with that massive flag. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8366.16s)]
*  Look at the calves on that motherfucker. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8367.44s)]
*  The place is going crazy, and then he tears his Achilles. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8369.72s)]
*  And then they had that young kid as their quarterback. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8373.68s)]
*  But could you imagine watching this guy work playing football? [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8376.039999999999s)]
*  I saw a video on that hard knock sting, and they have these circles, Joe. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8382.6s)]
*  These circles, they're targets. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8389.16s)]
*  That thing was 20 yards away. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8390.76s)]
*  Every time he would throw, he's like top right. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8393.4s)]
*  It would just go inside that little thing every time. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8396.8s)]
*  Bottom left. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8399.4s)]
*  Inside. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8400.4s)]
*  He never missed. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8401.4s)]
*  He was so accurate. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8402.52s)]
*  He was so accurate. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8403.52s)]
*  He was saying, it's like A in the Rogan. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8405.84s)]
*  Bam. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8409.72s)]
*  That American flag at the top. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8410.72s)]
*  Inside the bucket. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8412.28s)]

*  Wow. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8414.28s)]
*  That dude's sick, man. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8415.28s)]
*  Well, you want to imagine the practice involved in getting that good at throwing a football? [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8416.320000000002s)]
*  So accurate. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8420.400000000001s)]
*  How many hours has that guy played? [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8421.400000000001s)]
*  And that football's like this big. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8422.76s)]
*  Have you ever grabbed an NFL football? [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8424.0s)]
*  It's huge. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8426.04s)]
*  I can't even get my hands on it. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8427.04s)]
*  I've got small hands for a fighter, though, but it's huge. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8428.76s)]
*  And then you look at the receivers. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8433.16s)]
*  I went to a golf course in Florida, and when I walked up, it was Chris Carter from the [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8435.04s)]
*  Vikings. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8440.16s)]
*  His fingers were all broken and turned sideways because I said, what happened to your hands? [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8441.76s)]
*  He goes, catching footballs from all them great quarterbacks. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8448.0s)]
*  When dudes that play with Brett Favre, their hands are tore up because he's throwing so [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8452.36s)]
*  hard that he's knocking their fingers back and stuff. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8457.6s)]
*  Wow. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8460.880000000001s)]
*  Can you believe that? [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8461.880000000001s)]
*  Trying to catch a football player? [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8462.880000000001s)]
*  I can. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8463.880000000001s)]
*  It makes sense. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8464.880000000001s)]
*  If you catch one on the tip of your finger when you're trying to grab it and it gets [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8465.880000000001s)]
*  yanked back. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8468.56s)]
*  And then they got to throw it fast because these run, these DBs are like whoever garden [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8469.56s)]
*  you is so there's like a short window to get it in there. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8473.84s)]
*  There is not footballs. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8476.96s)]
*  Footballs. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8478.84s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8479.84s)]
*  How long before you think MMA gets to the point where you see athletes of that caliber [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8481.0s)]
*  consistently entering to MMA? [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8486.8s)]
*  It's gonna be a little bit. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8489.16s)]
*  I think it'll be a little bit. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8490.16s)]
*  You know why? [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8491.6s)]
*  Because if you have that ability to play football, they go play football because the money's [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8492.699999999999s)]
*  so big. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8496.359999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8497.359999999999s)]
*  Did you imagine a Fred Warner or a frickin he's a linebacker for the 49ers, the best [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8498.36s)]
*  in the game. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8503.92s)]
*  How about when Herschel Walker started fighting in Strikeforce in his 40s and fucking people [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8504.92s)]
*  up? [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8510.720000000001s)]

*  Tell me. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8513.0s)]
*  Dude, Herschel ate one time a day. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8514.0s)]
*  Yeah, I heard that. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8516.04s)]
*  He would eat soup and bread one time a day and he stayed at this great hotel called the [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8517.480000000001s)]
*  Fairmont and I think he was staying there free because Herschel Walker owns this massive [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8522.76s)]
*  chicken company. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8526.84s)]
*  He provides chicken to McDonald's. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8528.26s)]
*  Herschel Walker's chicken is like the like I think he provides chicken to McDonald's [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8530.94s)]
*  and like all these big companies and the Fairmont was one of them so he stayed there. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8534.460000000001s)]
*  He ate soup once a day and Herschel Walker while he was very athletic, Joe, he never [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8538.14s)]
*  picked up his feet. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8543.4s)]
*  So his feet would kind of like drag on the ground. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8544.94s)]
*  Fucker would shock the shit out you every time he punched dog. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8547.54s)]
*  Herschel was getting static electric in his feet because he never picked them up and the [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8550.42s)]
*  fucker would hit and it would shock you. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8555.26s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8557.66s)]
*  Constantly. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8558.66s)]
*  And he would knock people out and bro, he's like when he, Herschel Walker, I think it's [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8559.66s)]
*  documented that he has, like we talked about Mike Tyson, like that guy that lives in that [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8565.859999999999s)]
*  world and then the guy that we see daily. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8571.38s)]
*  I think Herschel, it's documented that he has some of these issues. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8573.939999999999s)]
*  Like a personality disorder. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8577.699999999999s)]
*  Like a personality. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8578.699999999999s)]
*  The first time he fought in the strike force, we're in the HP at San Jose and we're getting [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8580.58s)]
*  ready to go out and he starts going crazy. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8587.26s)]
*  Cursing at himself. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8591.42s)]
*  I'm gonna kick your ass. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8592.42s)]
*  But all I've ever heard from Herschel was like very soft spoken, you know, talking about [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8594.58s)]
*  religion and everything. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8600.26s)]
*  He turned into a completely different person. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8602.22s)]
*  When he walked into that octagon, he went off. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8604.78s)]
*  Right here. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8608.14s)]
*  Bro, he was saying some crazy shit. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8609.14s)]
*  Was this his first fight? [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8610.98s)]
*  First fight. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8611.98s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8612.98s)]
*  I was, I cornered him, Joe. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8613.98s)]
*  How old was he? [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8615.460000000001s)]
*  44 years old, 45 or 46, something like that. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8616.66s)]
*  But look at his feet. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8619.779999999999s)]
*  See how his feet never come up? [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8620.779999999999s)]
*  He would, they were always static. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8623.14s)]
*  Look at him, look at him. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8626.179999999998s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8627.179999999998s)]
*  Oh my God, he just started getting mad. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8629.98s)]
*  Dude, I'm telling you, he did that in the back before we went out there. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8631.9s)]
*  Watch that. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8636.939999999999s)]
*  He just got mad. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8637.939999999999s)]
*  He got mad, bro. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8641.939999999999s)]
*  But he tapped into that other person. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8643.46s)]
*  That's a nice combination too, to drop him. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8644.46s)]
*  He tapped into that other person. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8647.339999999998s)]
*  Who was he fighting here? [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8649.64s)]
*  Carson? [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8651.06s)]
*  Yeah, no, Strikeforce was the best at this, bro. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8652.06s)]
*  Strikeforce would always get you dudes that you knew you'd be okay against. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8655.06s)]
*  Strikeforce was the best at that. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8659.699999999999s)]
*  What do you think about this? [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8661.46s)]
*  I would fight dudes and then they would never be a Strikeforce again. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8662.859999999999s)]
*  Oh really? [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8665.419999999998s)]
*  In the beginning. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8666.419999999998s)]
*  There'd be a guy, he'd fight me, I would beat him, and then I'd never see him again. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8667.419999999998s)]
*  So they just got you good fights. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8671.839999999998s)]
*  They would get me fights, because my first fight was in Strikeforce. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8674.3s)]
*  So I'd fight like, so if I was a wrestler, it was like another kid who was a wrestler, [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8676.619999999999s)]
*  but he was a high school wrestler. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8681.019999999999s)]
*  So then, hey, push comes to shove, Daniel cannot wrestle this dude. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8682.3s)]
*  One dude was my training partner. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8687.22s)]
*  I had a really good sparring session against him. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8689.3s)]
*  Next week I needed an opponent. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8692.859999999999s)]
*  That dude was in there. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8694.339999999998s)]
*  I knocked him out. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8695.539999999999s)]
*  It was the first time I knocked somebody out. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8696.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, Strikeforce was really good about that. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8698.539999999999s)]
*  What do you think about Bellator and the PFO combining? [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8701.06s)]
*  Do you think that's going to lead to anything? [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8704.1s)]
*  Isn't it interesting that people don't care that much about shit that's outside the UFC? [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8707.9s)]
*  Isn't it crazy? [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8712.9s)]
*  Because the UFC has developed such a lead on everybody, it's nuts. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8714.22s)]
*  It really is like now, whereas before when Strikeforce got absorbed, you had Ronda and [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8718.74s)]
*  Nick Diaz and Gilbert Melendez and myself and Luke Rockhold and Jacque and Josh Thompson [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8727.74s)]
*  and Aleister Overeem and Josh Burnett and all these guys. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8734.18s)]
*  So it felt like not a competitor, but at least a legit number two. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8737.699999999999s)]
*  Well, yeah, championship level fighters fighting. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8741.98s)]
*  Bellator has that. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8744.539999999999s)]
*  But the UFC has now grown to a point where it's like the NFL in fighting. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8745.94s)]
*  And as there is nothing else in basketball that we compared to the NBA or to the NFL, [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8753.74s)]
*  CFL, XFL, all that, that's how it is with the UFC. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8759.7s)]
*  So it's like no matter what they do, it's never going to feel as important. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8763.62s)]
*  When in reality, you have some really good fighters, some really good. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8767.82s)]
*  Patchy Mix is really good. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8771.58s)]
*  Johnny Eblen is really good. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8773.220000000001s)]
*  But as long as they're not fighting inside that octagon, it'll be hard for them to feel [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8775.12s)]
*  like it. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8781.08s)]
*  I think it's good. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8782.12s)]
*  I think you're taking the number two and three promotions in the world, combining them. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8783.12s)]
*  It's just crazy that even in doing that, it still feels like a distant second to the UFC. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8787.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's always going to be that way. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8793.52s)]
*  As long as the UFC doesn't fall apart, like if Dana leaves or they sell it again. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8796.12s)]
*  Yeah, Dana can't leave, bro. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8799.4s)]
*  They could sell it again. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8800.72s)]
*  They could sell it again. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8801.72s)]
*  But I mean, why would they? [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8802.72s)]
*  Why would Endeavor ever sell that? [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8803.72s)]
*  Who knows? [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8805.039999999999s)]
*  They shouldn't. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8806.039999999999s)]
*  Someone could come along. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8807.039999999999s)]
*  The Saudis could come along. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8808.039999999999s)]
*  What about when the Saudis just bought the PGA Tour? [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8811.160000000002s)]
*  I'm like, how you gonna buy the PGA Tour? [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8813.560000000001s)]
*  You don't think they could do that with the UFC? [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8816.12s)]
*  Yeah, they could buy anything. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8817.6s)]
*  A lot of money. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8819.6s)]
*  They just overvalue it. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8820.6s)]
*  They just overvalue it. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8821.6s)]
*  They could, but. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8822.6s)]
*  They easily could. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8823.6s)]
*  They could just buy anything. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8825.240000000002s)]
*  It's going to be interesting to see if someone with this new merger, if they change the name, [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8826.68s)]
*  if they stick with the PFL, what are they going to do? [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8832.560000000001s)]
*  So what I heard is Bellator does pretty good overseas, so they're going to run their events [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8835.76s)]
*  over there. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8840.76s)]
*  So it's going to kind of become an international company. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8842.84s)]
*  And the PFL is going to be where they. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8845.52s)]
*  State a PFL. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8848.6s)]
*  And they'll do like a champion versus champion thing. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8849.6s)]
*  ESPN just extended their contract with the PFL, but there's no mention of Bellator. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8852.44s)]
*  You know, I really want to see Johnny Eblen in the UFC. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8859.960000000001s)]
*  I do. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8863.28s)]
*  I do. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8864.28s)]
*  He's good, man. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8865.28s)]
*  He's very good. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8866.28s)]
*  He's a very good fighter. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8867.28s)]
*  Very good. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8868.28s)]
*  You see that fight with Leon's brother? [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8869.28s)]
*  Is he at 185 in the UFC or does he have to go to 70? [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8870.800000000001s)]
*  He doesn't look that big. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8872.880000000001s)]
*  We'll find out. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8874.12s)]
*  I think he would have to probably go to 170, right? [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8875.12s)]
*  Even like the 205 pounder. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8877.460000000001s)]
*  Nemkov? [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8879.04s)]
*  Nemkov. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8880.04s)]
*  He'd have to go to 85 because he's good, but he's just not that big. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8881.04s)]
*  What kind of testing are they doing over Bellator? [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8885.68s)]
*  Not much, right? [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8887.12s)]
*  That's another reason I'm saying that without saying it. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8888.720000000001s)]
*  I think those guys would probably have to get a little smaller to fight at their right [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8892.2s)]
*  weight classes. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8897.66s)]
*  But I think it's a big deal. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8898.66s)]
*  I'm just happy if the fighters are getting more money. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8900.64s)]
*  Like these million dollar contracts, I think that's great. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8904.599999999999s)]
*  Guys are making more money today than they ever made. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8907.119999999999s)]
*  Olivier, Albaugh, Mercier just got a million dollars. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8909.119999999999s)]
*  Two? [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8910.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8911.599999999999s)]
*  He won that twice. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8912.599999999999s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8913.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he won that two times in a row. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8914.599999999999s)]
*  He would have never made that. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8915.599999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8916.599999999999s)]
*  Could partly do because he wouldn't have been able to find that level of success. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8917.599999999999s)]
*  Those guys are too tough. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8921.08s)]
*  Even Derek Brunson. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8922.64s)]
*  Derek Brunson had not looked great in his last few UFC appearances. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8923.64s)]
*  He went to the PFL. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8928.56s)]
*  Looked fantastic. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8930.0s)]
*  Looked fantastic. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8931.0s)]
*  And now he's back on the right track. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8932.0s)]
*  So good for him. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8933.519999999999s)]
*  I gotta wrap this up DC. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8934.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's fine baby. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8935.519999999999s)]
*  It was awesome. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8936.519999999999s)]
*  I got shows tonight. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8937.519999999999s)]
*  Oh, I'm coming. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8938.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm so happy we got to have you. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8939.519999999999s)]
*  Dude, I'm actually coming to the show. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8940.519999999999s)]
*  I can't wait. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8941.519999999999s)]
*  I watched you in Chicago once and I'm coming to watch you again. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8942.519999999999s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8945.48s)]
*  Let's go, Joe. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8946.48s)]
*  Thanks for having me, bro. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8947.48s)]
*  Alright, bye everybody. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8948.48s)]
*  Get a man. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAvD84gKnk&t=8949.48s)]
