# Joe Rogan Experience #2154 - Remi Warren
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlrLibwDTZU)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience
*  Trained by Dave, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day!
*  Cheers, sir.
*  Cheers. Good to see you, man.
*  We're just saying, you're a professional podcaster now, too.
*  Yeah, I guess.
*  A little bit different, you know.
*  Isn't that wild?
*  It's wild, man.
*  I mean, when I met you, nobody was podcasting.
*  No. You're like, you should podcast. You can do a really good podcast.
*  I'm like, all right, I'll podcast.
*  I wonder how many podcasts I've talked people into doing.
*  A lot. I think you're responsible for most of my Spotify playlists.
*  It's got to be over 50.
*  At this time, like, the amount of people that actually have podcasts,
*  that got podcasts after I told them, you should probably do a podcast.
*  People were getting annoyed at me.
*  I ran into people that would tell me personally in the street,
*  dude, I love your podcast, but please stop telling everybody to do a podcast.
*  I was like, why? What if they're good at it? What if they get good at it?
*  Yeah.
*  What's the harm? You don't like it? Don't download it.
*  No.
*  Super easy to deal with.
*  It is, yeah. Yeah, that was the thing.
*  You're just like, well, you're like, Remy, you know what you need to do?
*  What? Podcast.
*  I was like, I think you told me three times before it got here.
*  Fuck.
*  Well, you're a great podcast guest.
*  So if you're a great podcast guest and you were great on that show, Apex Predator.
*  Yeah, thanks.
*  It's simple. You're a good talker.
*  Yeah, I just tell people what I mean, I guess.
*  And your perspective is very interesting because your perspective is a guy that hunts like how many days a year do you hunt?
*  Now, I don't know. It's probably.
*  Down to 200.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, seriously.
*  That's most of the year.
*  Most of the year you're in the woods.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Which is crazy. That's like super unusual for a human being.
*  It is, yeah.
*  Living in America in 2024, what percentage of the population do you like consider your peers?
*  Very small percentage.
*  I feel like Camry, Ronella, you, Dudley, but I don't think those guys hunt as much.
*  No, yeah.
*  They don't hunt as much because you guide as well.
*  Yeah, I'm just like a different kind of addict where I just have to be out there doing it.
*  Well, it's, you know, to people that don't know, it's an amazing experience just to be out there.
*  It's amazing. It's like nothing else that you experience.
*  It's literally wild.
*  It is, yeah.
*  There's a lot of wild things that you do that are like, wow, this is wild.
*  But no, this is literally wild.
*  Yeah.
*  Like for real wild.
*  I think the thing is for me is I can go out there and every, you don't know what you're going to encounter.
*  Right.
*  You're like, it's not a mundane experience. Everything, you have to be aware.
*  It's like you could be out there and one day this happens and everything's fine.
*  And the next day you get attacked by a bear.
*  And then the next day you're like, it snows on you and you're freezing.
*  It's just every, every day is so different and even doing it over and over and over, nothing's ever the same.
*  And it can't be.
*  No.
*  You know, I mean, there's too many different environments.
*  Like you just got back.
*  I was listening to your podcast about hunting for musk ox.
*  Yeah.
*  And that experience of like hours and hours every day in just whiteness.
*  Yeah.
*  Just snow and nothing but on snowmobiles.
*  Like that fucking freaks me out.
*  That was the best part about it is just like the place.
*  Sometimes hunting takes you to those really cool places that you never thought you'd go.
*  Like nobody goes above the Arctic Circle unless they're a scientist figuring out, you know, global warming shit or somebody going hunting.
*  Because it's not I guess there's a few people doing polar expeditions and things like that.
*  But it's not a place you just go vacation.
*  Is this from your Instagram?
*  So this is what it's like out there.
*  Oh, wow.
*  So it's like little trailers out there.
*  Yeah. You're just you're essentially traveling on frozen ocean and you look at the size of the Arctic and it's like larger than.
*  It's like larger than North America.
*  Is it really?
*  I'm not sure exactly how big it is.
*  But when you look at the whole Arctic Circle, that whole region, it is massive.
*  Is it really larger than North America?
*  Larger than the United States for sure.
*  Wow. And so larger than the United States and it's all just snow?
*  I guess it's part of North America so you can't really say it's larger than North America.
*  Yeah. It's just wild.
*  It's frozen snow.
*  And then there's tons.
*  So there's like the frozen ocean and then there's islands in it that would be land.
*  Kind of has some undulation in there like little hills.
*  There's a Arctic care just digging ice.
*  It's like what do they eat?
*  They eat the tundra, I guess.
*  The Arctic care and the ptarmigans, right?
*  Like what do they eat?
*  I don't know.
*  Just the grasses.
*  Just whatever pops up in little spots where they can find.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's not the thing about it is it's super windy all the time, too, because there's nothing to stop the wind.
*  So it's really cold and then it's even colder because you get that wind chill.
*  But that wind blows pretty fierce and that wind's always moving the snow.
*  So the snow's always there, but there would be like a lot of drifts,
*  but it'll cause areas where there's maybe a hill to blow open.
*  So that's what the muskox eat.
*  That's what the Arctic care.
*  So you find like those kind of areas and that there's food sources there.
*  How crazy is that?
*  You're relying on the wind to uncover the snow to give you enough food to sustain.
*  It's wild.
*  And then to sustain an animal that's that large, as large as the muskox.
*  Well, that gives me hope for Bigfoot.
*  Yeah.
*  People say, well, what do they eat?
*  Well, muskox live out in Antarctica.
*  Yeah.
*  Or the Arctic Circle.
*  And when you're out there, how many people live there full time?
*  I can't remember.
*  I think it's under a thousand.
*  Wow.
*  And that's like a larger, we flew into like a larger area and then went over a hundred miles from there.
*  What do those folks do for the most part?
*  There's some in the summertime, there's like fishing and then hunting in the wintertime.
*  And that's what they live off of?
*  Yeah, there's there is stuff like certain some of the more remote.
*  There's other villages that don't have, you know, like an airplane that goes to it or whatever.
*  And they're purely subsistence or getting things in a couple of times a year, like that particular spot.
*  The fuel comes in once a year.
*  Once a year.
*  Yeah.
*  So somebody pokes a hole in the fuel tank.
*  That's it.
*  Yeah, you're done.
*  Oh, my God.
*  It's pretty crazy.
*  Fuel comes in once a year.
*  It's such a crazy thing to say.
*  Like, you got to plan for the whole year.
*  How much fuel?
*  Everybody uses diesel for everything, heating everything.
*  And if you don't have it, you're fucked.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Very, very crazy.
*  Like, I don't know, just there's places in the world that are so unlike what we're used to.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Imagine there's people that are going to live their whole life.
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
*  Most of the people that I met had never left that village.
*  Wow.
*  Imagine taking them to Hawaii.
*  They'd be like, what the fuck am I doing with my life?
*  This is so ridiculous.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know if they would like it.
*  What are you talking about?
*  Everybody likes Hawaii.
*  Yeah.
*  They would love it.
*  I don't know what they think, but it's just like that's what they know.
*  I think it'd be too hot.
*  I'll take two out all day.
*  Yeah.
*  Over fucking freezing tundra and wind and fuck that.
*  Yeah.
*  You mind sweating a little bit?
*  You're next to the ocean jumping the water.
*  Cool off.
*  Relax.
*  They like their food.
*  They like to eat stuff that I wasn't a fan of.
*  It's called muck tuck.
*  It's like essentially whale fat that's been cured.
*  Whoa.
*  Like fermented?
*  Not fermented.
*  It's more like salted.
*  Almost like whale beef jerky.
*  Oh, like, okay.
*  Yeah.
*  Whale fat, that's what it looks like?
*  Yeah.
*  That's it.
*  Bourdain told me that fermented shark was the most disgusting thing he ever ate.
*  Yeah, I haven't had that, but I've heard it's really bad.
*  And they love it.
*  And jelly shark.
*  And apparently wherever the fuck it is, I guess it's Iceland where they eat a lot.
*  Iceland, yeah.
*  That's what it looks like, Jamie?
*  Yeah.
*  Does that what it would look like when you were eating it?
*  Yeah.
*  What does it taste like?
*  I don't know.
*  It's like greasy rotten fish maybe.
*  Oh.
*  No, not a fan.
*  What kind of whale is it, too?
*  The guys, some of the Inuit guys, they have like preferred whale kinds.
*  They like narwhal, the best is what he said, and then beluga whale.
*  And then there's other whales that they don't like as much.
*  Hmm.
*  So yeah, like when the community gets like, they do all that in the summertime.
*  And then they save it for the wintertime.
*  But I guess you'd need to eat a lot of fat to survive the winter.
*  Whale in my brain goes into the same category as monkey.
*  Like you're eating whale or you're eating monkey.
*  I'm like, yo, do you have to do that?
*  Yeah.
*  I'm not a fan.
*  It seems like you probably shouldn't do that.
*  Yeah.
*  I had tried muck tuck before.
*  And so when they busted it out, I was like, I will pass.
*  Thank you.
*  Were they offended?
*  No, I think that they just didn't get it.
*  Right.
*  But like their whole culinary experience, too, is like we got the musk ox and it was really good meat.
*  And I cooked it up with some garlic and canned mushrooms in a pan and do it how I like, like medium rare.
*  And it was phenomenal.
*  And the way they do their cooking is they just boil it.
*  They like it boiled.
*  Everything.
*  Everything.
*  But you think about it, and they've lived so long in a lot of isolation, no doctors, none of this.
*  So they're very cautious about their food and they just don't want to get sick from it or anything.
*  So for probably their entire forever, it's just overcooked food and then you don't get sick.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Yeah.
*  If you get a parasite up there, you're in trouble.
*  You're in trouble.
*  So they just everything's boiled.
*  They like it boiled.
*  Well, I guess if you drink the broth, too, you know, it's like a soup.
*  Yeah.
*  Make like kind of a meat soup.
*  Right.
*  It's probably a good way to be like effective.
*  Like you don't need to cook in fat that way.
*  Yeah, they just boil it and then they've got everything in the pot and that's.
*  And they get their dietary fat from just this whale fat stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  Do they eat anything else that they get dietary fat from?
*  No, I think whales, they eat seals.
*  They probably have no diseases.
*  Yeah.
*  No cancer, no heart attacks.
*  Every list 110.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  Yeah, it's probably good.
*  It's probably good for you.
*  Those people that live.
*  Have you ever seen that Werner Heissel, Werner Herzog film Happy People?
*  I can't remember.
*  It's the one where the trappers in the taiga in Siberia.
*  Now it's an amazing documentary.
*  So Werner Herzog went to Siberia and hung out.
*  I don't know if he was just narrating it or if he was actually there.
*  I think he was just narrating it.
*  Maybe he went there, but someone went there.
*  Point is, like these people are extremely happy and they just all they do is go trapping and fishing and hunting.
*  And they live in these villages and they go around on snowmobiles.
*  And it's it's a kind of it's interesting because it's like what is life supposed to be about?
*  Is it supposed to be about enjoying yourself or is it supposed to be about accomplishing things?
*  Because if it's supposed to be about accomplishing things and you don't enjoy yourself, it seems like you're kind of missing part of the point of life.
*  And these people, their life is enjoyable.
*  Like they love fishing.
*  They're laughing.
*  And they're when they're going hunting, they're talking about hunting, how much they love hunting and fishing.
*  And it's fun.
*  And you get all this food and they're just pulling these massive pike out of the river.
*  They have these giant nets and shit.
*  And so they're having a good old time like all day long.
*  Yeah.
*  Freezing the fish.
*  They feed the fish to the dogs like they have this whole system worked out and just completely exist with what they have with very little other than like snowmobiles and the occasional like machine that they need.
*  They make all their skis, they hand make their skis.
*  This guy was like showing how to make a ski.
*  And so he like he's like using the pitch and the tar and like heating the thing up and cutting it perfectly and planing it.
*  It's pretty amazing stuff.
*  Yeah, that's wild.
*  I guess that's like shit.
*  Yeah. Everybody works real hard to go on vacation and go fishing.
*  This is what we're doing.
*  They just live that way.
*  I met a dude when I was in the British Virgin Islands who worked for a big tech company.
*  I don't want to say the company, but it's like a major company that like, you know, they make like fucking jets and shit for the military.
*  And he just was like, I don't see this.
*  I don't see this.
*  This is this doesn't seem like a good path for the rest of my life.
*  I'm because I'm seeing all these people that were managers and executives are trying to work their way up the corporate ladder and everybody's miserable.
*  Everyone's exhausted.
*  Everyone's overworked.
*  They're all putting in crazy hours.
*  They bring work home with them.
*  They hardly see their family.
*  They make a lot of money.
*  Sure. But he was like, fuck this.
*  He just became a fishing guy.
*  British Virgin Islands.
*  Fucking super chill guy.
*  But as I was talking to him, it's like bringing up scientific terms for different animals and like the way different fish have like very specific.
*  I forgot the term he was using about like it was particularly about Barracuda, that Barracuda like they they make their skin oilier so they can go faster so they can move through the water faster.
*  Yeah, they're lubed.
*  They're lubed up.
*  But he was explaining it in like these scientific terms.
*  And I was like, wow, this guy is like very amazing vocabulary for a guy who runs a fishing boat.
*  He sounds like a scientist.
*  Yeah. Like a guy who I would talk to on a podcast.
*  And the more we're talking, you know, because we're on this four hour fishing trip, the more we're talking.
*  He starts telling me his background.
*  We start talking about the business that he was in.
*  I was like, that's crazy.
*  And she just decided to bail on it all and just start fishing like that's like a character in a movie.
*  Yeah. You know, like nobody does that.
*  Everybody just stays miserable.
*  Yeah, they stay miserable.
*  They buy a new Lexus and they, you know, feel pretty good about themselves.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's why I was like, I feel very fortunate.
*  I feel like a pretty happy person because I pretty much get to do what I love all the time.
*  You get to do the thing that everybody looks forward to every like if you're a hunter and you have like September for our elk or November for whitetail, you look forward to the rut like nothing else in life other than like your kid's birthday.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  You're just so excited about this opportunity that you're going to get to spend a week in the woods and that's your whole job.
*  Yeah, that's mostly what you do.
*  It is. Yeah, it's great.
*  You're super lucky, man.
*  You're lucky.
*  So we brought you out here today to do a podcast, but also because I wanted to get you into ways to well because you had a crazy wrist injury that you had.
*  You went up getting two surgeries on.
*  Yeah, because last time I was in here, I just started shooting that mouth tab.
*  That's right. We talked about last night.
*  I just got set up.
*  Yeah, we shot.
*  Yeah, that was like some of the first arrows I'd flown in front of another human.
*  That mouth tab thing had to be weird.
*  People don't know what we're talking about.
*  Well, so just explain the injury.
*  Let's get into the injury first.
*  Yeah. So, I mean, I tore tendon in my wrist.
*  There's a lot of the movement things and it ended up being dislocated and had to do a reconstruction of the tendon and all that stuff.
*  Had a surgery, essentially a botched surgery, which made the surgery that the surgery did probably more damage than maybe even the initial thing.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. So the the bad surgery caused a lot of complications and then had to have like a salvage surgery after that.
*  What kind of complications it across?
*  I mean, I lost the feeling in my hand.
*  You don't feel anything?
*  No, I do now. The second surgery, they like fixed all that.
*  There is, yeah, just like the recovery went from, you know, essentially a what did they promise like three months to six months kind of recovery to a couple of years down the track and still not even being able to function 100 percent.
*  Still a lot of pain and other things.
*  So, but yeah, but because of that.
*  So what was wrong with the first surgery?
*  Like, what did they do?
*  It just didn't turn out well?
*  Yeah, well, they broke one of the bits when they're drilling in and it got the bit, I guess, got broken in the it's like a hollow screw.
*  So I got busted off in there.
*  So then they tried to use another bit to retrieve the bit and broke that bit.
*  And then they used a hammer.
*  Oh, no.
*  They used a hammer and something else to pound out the.
*  The bit?
*  The broken stuff.
*  Yeah. Oh, my God.
*  And that caused the everything was it was an anchor screw.
*  So then that tore.
*  So they took my tendon, used that tendon to make a tendon.
*  And then that that damaged the tendon.
*  But then, you know, I'd been under and under tourniquet for so long that it's like you got to just finish it up, see what happens.
*  Well, what happened was the tendon tore.
*  So essentially surgery was complete failure.
*  Didn't work at all.
*  Oh, wow.
*  I guess I now had all this additional scar tissue from the hammering and the trying to beat the thing back out.
*  So that's what caused a lot of like go to a veterinarian or a vet.
*  On horses.
*  No, it was actually it was like the first monkeys performing surgery.
*  I was like, this could be great.
*  It'd be a cool YouTube.
*  Yeah, it would be great.
*  You imagine how well have some.
*  Yeah.
*  These monkeys are well trained.
*  It is great.
*  Fucking hammer trying to get a broken drill bit of your wrist.
*  Dude, that's what it's like.
*  Yeah. So that that caused the problem.
*  So, yeah.
*  And part of it for me is just so I wasn't going to sit out in archery season.
*  So I learned to shoot with my mouth because I couldn't draw the bow with my right hand with the right wrist because it was immobilized for a long time.
*  Casts and all that stuff.
*  So I would have missed the hunting season.
*  So I just learned to shoot biting down on a tab, drawing back, shooting, got super proficient with.
*  Super proficient with it and had probably one of my best seasons.
*  Like it was awesome.
*  You know, I remember when Dudley did that Dudley had shoulder surgery.
*  Yeah. And he actually had he had to switch hands to which I was fortunate.
*  I think it's better that it was like it was my dominant hand.
*  But for bow shooting, you control I'm right.
*  I dominant.
*  So I control the bow with my left hand.
*  So it was the same everything except just biting and shooting.
*  Yeah, I've often thought about that.
*  If that's smart.
*  I think my right arm's probably more stable than my left arm.
*  Yeah.
*  It's quite a bit stronger, I think.
*  Are you you shoot right hand?
*  Yeah. Yeah. So I pulled the bow with my right.
*  Yeah. But I feel like my right would probably be more stable.
*  It would.
*  That's the that's the thing.
*  People. So if you don't know for archery, you base off what hand you shoot.
*  It's actually your eye dominance.
*  So whatever eyes the eye that controls your vision is the eye that you shoot with with a bow.
*  So you can have both eyes open, see the sight and the pin and the target simultaneously.
*  So if you wanted to know how to do it, you can like put your hands up, focus on an object that's far away and then close one eye.
*  And if it stays there, that's the dominant eye.
*  If it moves.
*  So when I close my left eye, the object stays there.
*  I'm right eye dominant.
*  So I shoot a right handed bow, which is weird because you're drawing it with your right hand.
*  But every other like you shooting a pistol and you're right handed, you use your dominant hand to control the weapon.
*  Right. So it like really, if you're cross eye dominant and you shoot a bow, everybody think that's a bad thing.
*  It's probably a better thing.
*  You are probably almost more natural.
*  Either way.
*  Obviously, you could shoot a bow with your left hand.
*  Obviously, people shoot a bow with their right hand.
*  So either way would work.
*  Exactly. Like I think it's a lot of malarkey.
*  I think there's a lot of malarkey that I recognize from like when people say you have to do certain things one way with martial arts.
*  Right.
*  Like most of the time, most of the time.
*  But there's a lot of exceptions.
*  There is a lot of different ways to skin a cat.
*  Like there's people that didn't even know that and they started drawing to their non-dominant eye.
*  But you can never shoot with both eyes open that way.
*  Boxing trainers will always tell you that you should like in the beginning, they would never tell you to switch stances, never switch stances.
*  But some of the best fighters ever switch stances.
*  Yeah.
*  But you're not them.
*  But wait a minute.
*  How do you become them?
*  I mean, some of the best boxers of all time, like Terrence Crawford today, one of the best switch hitters ever.
*  Marvin Hagler, switch hitter, Boots Ennis.
*  Just like really good boxers today that switch hit.
*  They do it all the time.
*  But back in the day, you just stood one leg forward and you got, but some people do it this way.
*  Right.
*  So why not learn to do it that way and be able to do it this way?
*  Yeah.
*  It seems way smarter than to just be completely relying on left foot forward all the time.
*  Right.
*  And with archery, I bet you if you practice, no one's going to get a left-handed bow.
*  But I bet if you did, I bet you would get better at your right because that's a phenomenon that happens with learning things.
*  Like even learning how to write with your left hand will teach you to write better.
*  You'll write better with your right hand.
*  I don't know who it was, but I'd heard there was a guy, a fairly prominent archer that got such bad target panic that he switched to shooting the opposite hand.
*  And it helped.
*  He fixed it.
*  Yeah, because his brain was so trained to shooting one way that he just switched his like a star.
*  Target panic is bananas.
*  People talk about target panic like the Candyman.
*  Don't say his name too many times.
*  He'll show up behind you.
*  100%.
*  If folks who don't know what target panic is, it's a real thing, particularly with target archers, with people who their whole life is like your life is about getting an arrow to an X.
*  Yeah.
*  And if you fuck up even a little bit, just a little baby fuck up left and right, it's a nine.
*  And if you really fuck up, it's an eight.
*  But if you hit that X, you're banging tens, baby.
*  Let's go.
*  And so a lot of these guys can shoot 30 X's in a row.
*  Now imagine the mindfuck of being completely stationary 29 times in a row.
*  And here comes the 30th and that little demon creeps in your head.
*  You're going to fuck it up, right?
*  You're going to fuck it up.
*  You're going to miss.
*  You're going to miss.
*  It'll get into your head.
*  And that's target panic for these guys.
*  Some of them can't even put the pin on the target.
*  Yeah.
*  They have to lift the pin up to the target.
*  And when it gets to the target, like a drive by, they pull the trigger.
*  Yeah.
*  They're just going crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  They just like force it in there and you get.
*  Yeah.
*  They just panic.
*  You know, and we've had Joel Turner from Shot IQ, like his whole system that he has for keeping people in a conscious state of mind so that you don't experience that.
*  You don't just go on, you don't just spaz out, which is I can't recommend enough.
*  It's very, very, very good stuff for people.
*  But I guess for a guy like you, you do it so often that it's like a normal thing.
*  Like you also you actually hit the trigger when you want the arrow to go.
*  I do. Yeah.
*  Right. Which is like, most people don't do it.
*  Don't do it.
*  They'll tell you, don't do it.
*  But I think there's more than one way to address very high stress, complicated situations.
*  And this idea that you have to have every shot be an unexpected shot.
*  I don't agree with that.
*  You have to you have to shoot right now.
*  You have to. I don't I don't agree with any of that.
*  I think you just have to be good at doing it that way.
*  Right.
*  You're obviously very good at doing it that way.
*  Like I've shot with you at targets.
*  I've seen you shoot like at distances.
*  You're really accurate.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're still doing it the way they say you're not supposed to do it.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  But that's a trouble, man.
*  I was too hard headed and I taught myself a bad way to do it.
*  I've changed the way that I shoot from when I first started shooting.
*  But yeah, it's not it's probably not pretty.
*  But I do I actually do more of a I do I use an index release, which is just like a post where you activate it with your trigger.
*  But the way that I've done it is I use kind of more of like a back tension style of pulling with that.
*  I used to just slap the trigger and a super accurate with it.
*  That's a camp.
*  You know, it's funny is I that's how I started shooting.
*  And I was actually I was shooting like tournaments and like 3D things just, you know, getting getting my foot in the door with it just for fun in the off season.
*  Never got super serious because it cut into hunting.
*  But I do it and I was winning by a lot.
*  And this guy that I was shooting with is like you're shooting absolutely wrong.
*  And it got in my head.
*  And I was like, wait, I'm doing it wrong.
*  Like nobody's ever told me how to do it.
*  That messed me up.
*  But I was like, it's just a mind.
*  It's a mind game.
*  It's a there's no way to do it wrong.
*  Cam shoots that way.
*  You know, the best bow hunters ever walk the face of the earth.
*  He shoots that way.
*  He makes that thing go off.
*  Yeah. And then there's Dudley who doesn't write Dudley who shoot with a hinge sometimes or shoot with back tension.
*  Yeah. You know, but I'm also you know, my thing is I'm I shoot a bow for hunting.
*  And so for hunting, that's the best style or least in my opinion.
*  And I'm very accurate with it.
*  So I'm not trying to shoot 900 X's in a row.
*  Like I'm trying to make one perfect arrow.
*  And so I can focus on that one shot and that release works better for me for hunting.
*  So that's why you think that the wrist strap with the finger trigger is the best one for hunting.
*  Yeah, because it's always on you.
*  You have to reach for it.
*  You don't have to move for it.
*  It's like always there.
*  And then the other thing is, you know, they talk about it.
*  Don't punch the trigger or whatever.
*  But in certain situations, I need that arrow to go now.
*  I don't need to be pulling through the shot.
*  Like this is my opportunity.
*  And I might be shooting in a window.
*  Yeah. Or in the wind.
*  And I've got to can't the bow just right.
*  And I need to make like a more technical shot that maybe not that it's rushed, but it's like this is this is when it has to happen.
*  And so it can happen the other way.
*  But for me, it's just easier to be like in full control of that decision making.
*  There's also an argument on the other side now in target archery, like Kyle Douglas.
*  Kyle Douglas, he hits the trigger and he wins Vegas.
*  Yeah.
*  He just he pulls so hard that he's pulled bows apart.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. So he pulls on the wall so hard.
*  So he's just got that motherfucker locked out.
*  And he uses in indoor tournaments uses a thumb and hunting uses a finger trigger.
*  Yeah, I love it.
*  It's like you're doing it wrong.
*  Scoreboard.
*  He won.
*  No, he's doing it right.
*  Like you can't.
*  There's that thing like there's if you can do that with a sniper.
*  Right. Like I had a long conversation with Andy Stumpf about this who was in SEALS and sniper.
*  And I was you know, we were talking about like methods and he's like there's as long as you're repeatable, you know how to do this one method like this mindset of there's only one way to do it.
*  It has to be an unanticipated shot.
*  And he's like, you know, no, like you if you're a sniper, it's not an unanticipated.
*  Right.
*  You just don't move.
*  Don't flinch.
*  Like if you've ever one of the proudest things if you ever go to a range is when you run out of ammo, but you don't flinch.
*  You just squeeze the trigger.
*  You're like, oh, that's beautiful.
*  Yeah, it's beautiful.
*  Like even though there's no nothing the gun doesn't go off.
*  You didn't do any of this stupid shit.
*  You didn't move your hands.
*  And if you can just do that with a shot, you can make a perfectly accurate shot by deciding when it goes off.
*  It is possible.
*  The idea that it's not possible.
*  That's a silly thing to say.
*  Right.
*  But is it possible for some people?
*  Well, some people are spaz.
*  Some people are freaked out by anxiety, the moment, the adrenaline, or they don't know how to keep their mind contained like with Joel Turner's methods, which I think anybody should know that anybody should know that you should talk to yourself during it.
*  To keep yourself from just just acting right because of the anxiety, which is because it's a normal.
*  It's a normal like tendency that people have to spaz out.
*  Yeah, I think the other thing too is like maybe there's there's ways that are probably best for most people.
*  And I might be the way that's best for most people.
*  But then there's also that I think the people that have a lot of time into something can do it a different way than a lot of other people because they're they understand that moment.
*  Right. Right.
*  Right. Right.
*  So like there's a lot of people that they get drawn back on an elk.
*  They've tried to get within range of an elk for five years.
*  This is their opportunity.
*  And they don't know how to react to that without some other kind of complete freak out.
*  And then no matter what it is, there's also like if you in a situation where you might get a shot soon or you didn't know you're going to get a shot and all of a sudden you do.
*  Yeah, because if you didn't know you're going to get a shot and all of a sudden you do, you're a gentleman just kicks in your fucking hearts beating.
*  Whoa.
*  But if you know it's going to happen, like, hey, stay chill.
*  It's common. It's common.
*  Like he's you know, he's 100 yards away.
*  He's moving in this direction.
*  You might be getting a shot.
*  Oh, my God. He's he's coming.
*  He's still coming.
*  He's time.
*  We've got to get in position.
*  You give yourself time to experience that this is actually going to happen rather than he's just there.
*  Right.
*  And you just he tries to stay calm, but your arms move it all over the place.
*  You know, it's just it's different experiences and whether or not your brain knows how to process those experiences.
*  If you've had a bunch of those experiences, you're like, oh, I've been here before.
*  Yeah, I know what this is.
*  I know how to do this.
*  OK, it's going to happen.
*  So stay calm.
*  Pick a spot.
*  Pull through your shot.
*  Yeah.
*  And even even myself, like there's times where you go.
*  It's actually the opposite for me.
*  If something surprise is like there is just like, it's here.
*  But it's when you got a stock all day on something like I've invested my entire day into this or this is the last chance.
*  Like, don't fuck it up.
*  Like you go.
*  That's when you start to.
*  OK, well, when I get there, here's what I'm going to do.
*  Yeah.
*  Talk yourself through it in a way.
*  When you're going through the shot, do you talk to yourself as you're shooting as you're pulling the trigger?
*  No, but there's a little bit of a checklist just so I don't kind of like drawback anchor level focus.
*  Hmm.
*  Kind of a.
*  So you just go through that checklist in your head?
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  So do you do you go through it like audibly or do you go through it where you just do the things?
*  I do the things.
*  Level center of your PEEP, all that.
*  Go through all that.
*  I just make sure that I'm making the good shot and then I just focus on that shot.
*  Hmm.
*  Do you have you ever tried the thumb triggers?
*  Yeah, I shoot.
*  I've got all kinds of releases and I'll shoot them all.
*  But just for I don't even know why.
*  Just for fun, I guess.
*  Right.
*  Like, let's say I'm sometimes too, if I'm like shooting and I go, God, this is I'm just not shooting good, then I'll swap up the way that I shoot and go.
*  OK.
*  There's something like my normal method of shooting is.
*  Yeah, maybe it's I don't even know if you call it like essentially a target panic kind of where I'm not shooting right.
*  Then I go, I'll grab that other one.
*  OK.
*  And then I get back in the rhythm and shoot.
*  Do you find any difference in your accuracy with a handheld release like a thumb trigger release versus a finger trigger release?
*  Hmm.
*  I'm probably more accurate with the finger trigger because that's what I shoot all the time.
*  You know, do you do the thumb behind the head thing with the trigger?
*  Yeah.
*  No.
*  If the cam does that, I do not do something.
*  No.
*  I mean, that's a good way to get your anchor point.
*  I guess I don't.
*  I'd have to do it.
*  But I'll hit things.
*  I do more of a knuckle experience on the job.
*  Knuckle to the job.
*  Yeah.
*  What we're talking about, folks, don't do archery is like you have specific anchor points on.
*  So the whole idea about shooting accurately is that you want to repeat the exact same position that you're in each time you shoot.
*  So there's a peep site that's in the draw in the string and you're looking through that peep site.
*  And what you're trying to do is center the site housing so that it completely halos inside of that peep site.
*  And then you look down at your bubble and you want to make sure that your level your bubble is level.
*  So there's like a little leveler that's below your site pin and you make sure that that's level.
*  So that means you're not going to be torquing the bow left or right, accounting the bow, which could affect the way it goes off.
*  And so you have anchor points like the tip of your nose.
*  And some people use like a little button on the string.
*  They touch like Cam has one of those where it touches the corner of his mouth.
*  I have a nose button.
*  I like that.
*  Have you ever tried those?
*  I haven't.
*  They're great because it's pointy.
*  It like pokes your nose and you feel it on the tip.
*  Josh Bowman, like so it touches the tip of your nose and it like digs into your nose.
*  You know, 100 percent you're in the right spot because it just like pokey on your nose like right there.
*  And some people when they draw back, they'll tell you do not put your thumb behind your neck.
*  Do not do that.
*  But that's how Cam does it.
*  He shoots perfectly like that.
*  And so I tried it.
*  I can't do it right.
*  I have to have my my my neck is too big.
*  So I'd have to go like way back because I'd have to I'd have to have a draw length that's longer than I really should have in order.
*  But I fucked around with it and bent my arm forward a little bit and did it this way.
*  And I was like, this is better because you're locked in.
*  Right. Like how stable is that?
*  If you get your thumb behind your head, behind your neck, that's fucking stable as shit.
*  That's locked in.
*  That's way more locked in than holding it there.
*  Right.
*  You know, like if you're holding if you have like a hinge, you're doing like this.
*  You've got your knuckle right where your jaw is generally or some spot in your face.
*  That's not as accurate as this.
*  This is this is this is like locked in.
*  You're not going anywhere, but they'll tell you not to do it.
*  And I've never had anybody explain to me why.
*  I think it's probably because most people, like you said, if you're way back here, you're putting string pressure on your from your face onto the string.
*  So it's pushing the knock one way or another.
*  And so it'd be really hard to tune maybe because, you know, you're you're everything needs to be straight.
*  And so you'd be pushing the knock one direction.
*  So you get you could adjust it.
*  You could you could factor in.
*  But also you could use a different style release where if you had, you know, an index style release or that's there and it's forward enough, it wouldn't make a difference.
*  Well, the thing about those adjustable ones, when they have adjustable necks like the spot hog, the wise guy has an adjustable neck.
*  You can make that sucker like real long or you can pull it down short.
*  So you could find if your neck isn't too big, like if you're a big, giant football player, this is not going to work for you.
*  Yeah.
*  But he wasn't doesn't even work for me.
*  But it works for Cam.
*  He gets it right behind his neck.
*  Yeah.
*  It locks in there.
*  And I think like anything where you can anchor in and there's no other way you're anchoring that way.
*  Right. There's no other way you're anchoring forward.
*  Like this is stops everything in its fucking tracks.
*  I think this is like the best thing you could ever do.
*  Right. If you could really make that work.
*  I wish my neck was smaller so I could pull this off.
*  I would do that because I feel like that is locked in.
*  Yeah.
*  That's locked in.
*  And I've got like a small face.
*  So I think it'd work for me.
*  But there's archery people out right now just pulling their hair out going, shut up.
*  This is terrible advice.
*  I know.
*  Meanwhile, I've watched Cam Haynes shoot balloons at 120 yards like that.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  That's the thing.
*  It doesn't matter what you do.
*  There's always the armchair critics that know how to do it better.
*  It's like, well, I got a certain kind of injury and I got to draw a certain kind of way.
*  It looks like shit, but it works.
*  Well, there's a very similar situation in I think almost every sport.
*  It's definitely in pool.
*  There's so many different schools of thought in pool of like how you're supposed to stroke the ball,
*  whether or not you drop your elbow, whether or not you, what fingers you hold the cue with,
*  whether you turn your wrist forward before you shoot or whether you always keep it parallel or dangling rather.
*  So there's all sorts of like, I think it's with everything that people are struggling to master.
*  Like people have ways that they think everybody should do it and then someone will come along that does it like completely different.
*  And they're killing everybody.
*  And they're like, how? What?
*  Like when the Filipinos came to America, American pool players, they hold the cue, they would back in the day at least,
*  they would hold the cue lightly, but not like the Filipinos.
*  The Filipinos like Efren Reyes is like one of the greatest of all time.
*  He's like barely holding on to it.
*  It's like his hand is like a loose noodle and he's just like, it's smooth like he's playing a violin or something.
*  It's wild to watch.
*  And it's like this delicate way of hitting the balls, like maximum efficiency of his motion.
*  It's all smooth.
*  And they changed the way Americans are playing.
*  But if you had like an American coach, like if you played that way and you sucked and you went to an American coach,
*  they were like, stop doing it that way.
*  This is not the way.
*  You stop your elbow moving.
*  Stop your elbow moving.
*  Your elbows are only supposed to do this, just a tiny motion, just back and forth.
*  And the upper part stays completely still always.
*  These Filipinos are moving that shit around like crazy and playing like wizards.
*  Like some of the best players today, they drop their elbows, they move things around.
*  They have long bridges, short buddy hall, one of the greatest of all time, short little tiny bridge.
*  And some of the greatest players, long ass bridge like Earl Strickland, long bridge.
*  Like there's no like it's all just repeatability.
*  What can you do over and over and over and over again efficiently and accurately?
*  And I think it's the same with archery.
*  I think it's the same with pool.
*  It's the same with a lot of things.
*  There's fundamental principles.
*  Like you have to be able to hit the ball straight if you want it to go straight.
*  Right?
*  With an arrow, you have to be able to shoot a straight arrow.
*  Do you know how to do that?
*  Well, how come some people do it sideways?
*  I've seen guys who like to do with compound bows sideways.
*  Really?
*  What are you doing?
*  Like I've seen, I guess they started that way with like traditional bows.
*  Yeah, because you can't the bow on a traditional bow.
*  And so they just kept doing it that way.
*  And I'm sure you've seen guys who shoot compound bows with no sights.
*  Yep.
*  Like instinctive, which is really kind of wild.
*  Yeah, or fingers or I mean, you can do whatever.
*  I like to hunt with a traditional bow too.
*  So I do that every year as well.
*  And the way that I shoot that is completely different than the way that I shoot a compound bow.
*  I mean, because I actually just instinct, I do what's an instinctive method of traditional shooting,
*  where a lot of people do like different kinds of string walking or whatever.
*  I just do the shoot the arrow, know the trajectory kind of like.
*  Like you're throwing a rock.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Like if I'm going to throw and I just, the way that I practice, I walk around with a blunt tip.
*  It's just like a non-sharp tip or practice tips.
*  I walk around, I shoot pine cones in the forest.
*  Just to gauge the loop, the arc.
*  And so you just build it and it just becomes instinct, where it's like if I'm going to toss a pen to Jamie or my phone to Jamie or whatever there,
*  it's like I'm not going to throw it into space and I'm not going to like hit it on the floor.
*  I'm going to toss it to him.
*  It's the same. You just like, you toss the arrow.
*  Can you toss it on with your right hand now or is it fucked up?
*  I mean, yeah, I guess I can.
*  I look like a little girl.
*  I did some one of those acts throwing things with my buddies and they're like, can you please stop?
*  It's embarrassing.
*  You're going to fucking kill everybody.
*  It's embarrassing.
*  That is one good advantage of having your finger triggered though.
*  You don't have to have all that weight held in your hand.
*  Correct. Yeah.
*  Yeah. That's good.
*  Yeah.
*  You might actually, if you weren't the other way, you might actually have been forced to switch to a wrist strap.
*  Potentially, yeah.
*  Yeah. Does the wrist fuck with your wrist at all? The wrist strap?
*  It does. Yeah. It puts pressure on the one spot that we got.
*  But they did those injections, man. I'm hoping that.
*  Yeah.
*  I have a lot of, I think it's going to be awesome.
*  It's going to make a big difference.
*  Yeah.
*  I can't say enough about waste of well and just stem cells in general.
*  I mean, I've got a bunch from my friend, Roddy McGee in Vegas.
*  And what they do is fix things that you would ordinarily have to get surgery for.
*  In your case with the torn ligaments, they would have to have a surgery.
*  Yeah.
*  And once it's ripped.
*  After that, the recovery portion is where you need it.
*  Exactly. And it just really helps heal injuries, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Like really helps. I have had a left knee problem for a long time.
*  Like I tore my ACL on my left leg when I was 22, I think.
*  I tore it and then I had a surgery on it where they did a patellar tendon graft.
*  And they tried to suture up the meniscus because there was a tear in the meniscus as well.
*  But the suture didn't take, the meniscus tore and then had a bucket handle tear in the meniscus,
*  which is pretty significant because it would lock my leg out.
*  And so that I had to get some of the meniscus removed.
*  So it's always like a little less stable there.
*  There's a little space there and it gets banged around.
*  It's always sore.
*  And it got over the last couple of years.
*  It's actually the stupidest fucking way I've heard it ever.
*  I was on my way on stage at Stubbs in Austin, which is an outdoor venue.
*  And as I was going up these cement stairs, the stairs take like a little turn.
*  And I was turning the recorder on on my phone to record my set.
*  And I stubbed my foot against the stone and it twisted my knee sideways like somebody heel hooked me.
*  And it was excruciating.
*  And I had to go on stage like right there.
*  And my leg was shaking like I was scared.
*  So like one leg like like shaking like my first time like I didn't even shake like that my first time on stage.
*  It was like because it was just the robbing and I had ignored it.
*  I should have in retrospect, I should have like addressed it and made fun of the fact that I'm such a fucking moron.
*  And my leg was fucked for a long time after that.
*  And it got a little bit better.
*  And then every time I get better, I would just start kicking the bag again and or going back to Muay Thai or going to Jiu Jitsu.
*  And it hurt again.
*  And I'm like fuck fucker.
*  And so I went a whole year without kicking the bag.
*  One whole for me is crazy.
*  I went a whole year.
*  I'm like I'm just going to strengthen this.
*  I follow this guy Ben Patrick.
*  He's got this Instagram page knee over toes guy.
*  Only I've ever seen his stuff.
*  Yeah, I think I just seen something.
*  It's amazing.
*  So I've been doing all these goblet squats on a slant board and Nordic curls and all these different exercises to strengthen all the muscles around the knee,
*  which I never really bothered to do.
*  I would do leg exercises, but I didn't think specifically exercises that stabilize the knee.
*  So between that and ways to well, I have zero pain now.
*  It's cool.
*  Raise. Awesome.
*  This been years since I had no pain years like I would go upstairs.
*  It would just be annoying.
*  I'd feel it. I could do it, but I would feel it.
*  I don't feel it at all.
*  I mean, at all.
*  It's nuts.
*  It's nuts.
*  And so the thing to me, it's always kicking the bag because if I can kick the bag and then I'm not sore the next day, something's changed because it was like every time I kick the bag the next day.
*  I'm going to pay for that.
*  I'm going to pay for that.
*  And then you're walking around.
*  It's kind of a little bit swollen.
*  You know? Yeah.
*  So I'm really, really hoping that that's going to have a similar effect on your wrist.
*  Yeah, I'm pretty stoked.
*  Like, yeah, you should know within fairly short amount of time.
*  Like, well, because he shot you up with what it was exactly.
*  I don't even remember.
*  I'll text him right now.
*  Yeah, there was all kinds of what?
*  What did you shoot him up with?
*  An IV plus some direct into the joint stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  It was all gibberish to me.
*  Yeah.
*  I was talking about so million millions of whatever.
*  You go, okay.
*  What exactly did you inject him with?
*  I should have done this with voice.
*  The voice is very accurate.
*  I don't know how it is on your shitty Android phone.
*  Yeah.
*  But on these American phones, these real American Apple iPhones.
*  I don't even I just think it does it now.
*  You guys are still talking.
*  I talk shit, but I'm not not an Apple fan boy.
*  I love I've had Samsung.
*  I was very disappointed when I found out the moon photo wasn't real, though.
*  I was bragging to everybody.
*  Look what my phone can do.
*  I could take a picture of the moon.
*  But I mean, they're great pictures is great.
*  It's so clear.
*  How is it doing?
*  Because it's lying to you.
*  They're like, it's no different than face filters.
*  It's a lot different.
*  If a face filter makes me look like Arnold Schwarzenegger, like then something's going on with that face filter.
*  It's lying.
*  Right.
*  Both filters are fucking lie.
*  But other than that, they're amazing phones.
*  I just, you know, I'm just locked in the fucking Apple ecosystem.
*  But I love the rebels.
*  Yeah.
*  Like my friend, Brian Simpson.
*  He's Android for life.
*  He makes fun of everybody with Apple.
*  Gordon Ryan.
*  Same thing.
*  Android for life.
*  And you, you know, you like annoying people.
*  I do.
*  I'm just like, my favorite thing is just breaking green bubble.
*  You know, and the best is like I get taken off of group text.
*  I'm like, thank God.
*  I hate it because they can't.
*  I mess with you.
*  Exactly.
*  So I'm like, take me off.
*  Sweet.
*  Awesome.
*  Thank you.
*  Well, here that anyways, there's actually hearings about this now because some people
*  are arguing that Apple has created an unfair monopoly on the cell phone world because of
*  the whole green bubble, blue bubble, iMessage thing.
*  It's such a psychological.
*  It's so weird.
*  People are real attached to that.
*  Well, it's a status thing with kids.
*  If kids have Android phones, they get mocked.
*  There's some nutty thing.
*  It's like 90% of teenagers have iPhones.
*  Really?
*  Because if you have like a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, which is arguably the best phone
*  on earth, if you have that phone, you give a green bubble.
*  You looked at less than you have an iPhone 10 because you get like a special color bubble.
*  You got a blue bubble.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Because your iMessaging, you can have an old ass iPhone and people respect you more.
*  You're not that poor.
*  Literally, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is, listen, forget about fanboy shit.
*  It's the best phone on earth.
*  It's the best phone.
*  It has AI built into the phone that will translate in real time, built into the phone.
*  It has AI that will transcribe voice recordings and summarize it for you.
*  So you can make voice notes.
*  It'll summarize it for you.
*  It'll write texts in different styles.
*  Like you could say, make this more business, make this more friendly.
*  And it'll do that with AI.
*  Yeah, it's pretty wild.
*  That's nuts.
*  And it has a stylus.
*  It'll turn it on, it'll turn it into text.
*  You could write on it in your shitty ass handwriting and it'll transcribe it in a normal type set.
*  Yeah, you can take, well, I do a lot of filming or whatever with it.
*  Photos.
*  You can just like, it's pretty crazy, the stability of zooming in at 10 power and hand hold it.
*  Yeah.
*  It's pretty wild.
*  And now when they're doing this, like with these phones, like Apple's phones don't give you nearly as much flexibility in terms of what you can do with the camera app.
*  Right.
*  Or like multitasking.
*  That's another thing they do.
*  I can do anything.
*  You have two windows going simultaneously.
*  You could have a YouTube video.
*  Well, you kind of can do that window in window.
*  You can kind of do that with Apple, with YouTube.
*  With YouTube, it'll like let you have like a little tiny window.
*  Right.
*  But with this, it'll separate your screen for you.
*  I could talk on the phone and watch a movie.
*  Yeah, literally.
*  It'll separate your screen for you and show you the two things.
*  It's pretty interesting.
*  It's the amount of, but it's all that locked into that Apple world, which so many people, including me, are locked into that world.
*  Yeah.
*  So if you do deviate, it's like, what are you doing?
*  It's like you're living in the woods now.
*  Yeah.
*  Your green bubble.
*  People really listen to podcasts and be like, I used to like that Remy guy.
*  But he says, I can't trust anything he says now.
*  Oh my God.
*  It is interesting.
*  I don't think that it's a monopoly.
*  I just think that they've developed a way to make a product that everybody wants.
*  I mean, it's a sneaky move, but like, how is that any different than like Nike?
*  If you wear Nike, you're cool.
*  If you wear Keds, you're a fucking loser.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, it's like, do you notice when you have them on that much?
*  I mean, I guess maybe you do by the way they look, but what's the difference?
*  Like, why do you care?
*  But people care.
*  People care.
*  It's a status thing.
*  Yeah.
*  It makes people angry.
*  Like, I don't really give a shit.
*  Like, I don't care what other people use.
*  I just use what I like.
*  What problems do you encounter by using an Android phone?
*  It's mostly just people complaining about the bubble situation.
*  That's it?
*  And I'm like, people will be like, it's so on your phone.
*  And I was like, no, like there's actually no, it doesn't even matter.
*  I guess they started doing something like a screen or something.
*  Well, on your phone, you can have your text in all kinds of different colors.
*  Yeah, it doesn't matter.
*  But you can change it.
*  There's like different ways you can have it set up.
*  That's the main problem.
*  And then I think the other problem is when somebody sends like a photo because, yeah,
*  I'm not a spokesperson.
*  It's SMS.
*  Yeah, it's the most old technology there is.
*  And so you can't communicate with my phone, not because your phone's superior, but because
*  it doesn't use new technology.
*  That's the argument with Apple is that Apple is actually having to take a step to combat
*  that.
*  So what they're doing is they're coming out with RCS texting.
*  RCS texting is rich something.
*  I forget what it's called.
*  But what that means is that you'll be able to have the same capability that you have,
*  like say if you use WhatsApp or Signal, right?
*  If you use one of those encoded messaging services, you can send a full resolution photograph.
*  You can send a video.
*  There's not like a size limitation.
*  So with the iMessage, you could send anything back and forth to iMessage people.
*  But if someone wants to send you a photo, they have to send an SMS.
*  So it could be this like, you know, huge, amazing, high resolution photo that you took
*  on your Android phone with that crazy 200 megapixel lens.
*  But I get this bullshit ass.
*  Bro, your fucking camera sucks.
*  Exactly.
*  Because it compresses this shit out of it.
*  And the videos are the worst.
*  Like this little square.
*  It's like you're back in 1998.
*  Right.
*  It's like AOL.com.
*  You've got mail.
*  That's what it looks like.
*  Exactly.
*  But it's like, just get your shit with the rest of the world, man.
*  Apple should have done that a long time ago.
*  They were only like Tim Cook literally said, get your mom an iPhone when someone said, how come?
*  You know, I can't text with my mom and get your mom an iPhone.
*  That's what he said.
*  My driver is like, whoa, that's not the way to handle it, fella.
*  You're going to get people mad at you.
*  They just have everybody locked in.
*  It's pretty smart.
*  Whatever they've done, it's quite genius because the psychological aspect of it is what's interesting.
*  You know, it's similar to like Windows and Macs, but it's more because you're using it in public with everybody.
*  Right.
*  Whereas like if you have a window or Mac, like if you sent me an email and you from a Windows laptop and I have a Mac laptop, I have no idea you're sending me it from a Windows.
*  It's just coming in as an email.
*  Same thing.
*  So they figured out a way to have the thing that you carry and use the most connected to a brand that you have to like that has status attached to it.
*  Yeah, it's pretty cool.
*  It's it's genius.
*  Pretty clever.
*  It's the best technology they got.
*  You know, I don't see how that's illegal, though.
*  No, it's nothing.
*  No one's stopping you from going out and getting a Samsung.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, that to me is weird.
*  Like it doesn't.
*  Google is one of the biggest companies in the world and they have their own phones.
*  Right.
*  They have pixels.
*  Yeah.
*  It's also a great phone.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you could take those.
*  I mean, I've been going back and forth with people about this because I had a conversation with Tulsi Gabbard where we're talking about these phones that are de-Google phones.
*  And I guess I misspoke because I was saying that you can't use all the regular apps with them.
*  So I think you can.
*  But I just don't know if you could use because it doesn't track your location.
*  So I don't know how you would use like Google Maps without giving it access to your location.
*  Yeah, I think you would if you use those apps.
*  Right.
*  So does it.
*  But then does it keep your location or does Graphene keep it from doing that?
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not.
*  Because Google just gives you Google is a little snitch.
*  Google gives you up wherever you are.
*  Right.
*  Wherever you are with that phone, they know who you are.
*  Oh yeah, for sure.
*  So I was watching this video on this last night by that Rob Braxman guy and he was explaining.
*  He's an interesting guy that is like all about his whole YouTube channel is about privacy.
*  It's all about how many people are siphoning off information off your phone and everything every day.
*  But what he was saying that the people that got arrested January 6th, all the people that were like around the capital, they got arrested because their cell phone data.
*  So their cell phone data gave their geo location, their tracking.
*  And so what the FBI did was say, hey, who is there?
*  And they went to all these different cell phone companies.
*  They got all their data and they said, well, all these people shows that their phone was on the Capitol lawn or was in the Capitol building and they know where they were.
*  And so then they go, hey, you're going to jail.
*  That's wild.
*  Yeah.
*  From your location of your phone.
*  Yeah.
*  And even if you were there just to see what's going on, like if you and I were there and you have your bullshit snitch phone over there and that bullshit snitch phone is just constantly giving off all of your location to anybody in every app that asked for it.
*  And you're on that Capitol lawn and you're like, this is crazy.
*  Let's get out of here.
*  And then all of a sudden, like six months later, the FBI knocks on your door and thinks you're an insurrectionist.
*  Yeah, that's wild.
*  Whoo.
*  See, I like it knowing where I'm at.
*  So when the AI takes over, it's like, oh, he's one of the good guys.
*  He's on our side.
*  Yeah.
*  We're not one of them Ted Kaczynski guys living in the woods trying to blow us up.
*  Right. Yeah, I think inevitably there will be no escape.
*  And I think all this de-Google stuff and it's great.
*  It's really probably good to protect yourself from, you know, the prying eyes of big government and big business and big data and all these people that try.
*  It's probably good to not do that.
*  But also, you know, it's happening.
*  Yeah, it's happening kids.
*  Like we're getting sucked into some new world.
*  Yeah.
*  Whether you like it or not.
*  That's coming.
*  It's how it is.
*  Unfortunately, it's how it is.
*  Yeah, it's how it is.
*  Brian Simpson's funny because he was just complaining the other night.
*  He's like, I give Google all my information.
*  I like, go ahead, spy on me.
*  Get it all.
*  And they still fuck it up.
*  They'll still offer me ads like, bitch, why did you think I would want to buy that?
*  That's good.
*  It's true.
*  It's like it's not perfect yet.
*  No, it's not perfect.
*  But yeah, that's just the world we live in, apparently.
*  Does it mess with any of the things like Onyx hunt or anything like that?
*  Is there any difference between those?
*  Every once in a while, you'll get an app that's not developed as well for it.
*  But that's about it.
*  What are examples of an app that's not as good?
*  I haven't used one in a long time, to be honest.
*  They used to say Instagram, but now apparently it's optimized for it.
*  I watch a lot of videos on this stuff.
*  There was a few.
*  Yeah, there was like certain things that would work and then not work.
*  But when I want to waste time, I watch videos on cell phones that I'll never buy.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  I watch videos on cell phones that are like coming out of China.
*  Like China has amazing tech, man.
*  The tech that's coming out of China right now, I mean, have you seen their electric cars that could just drive over bumps?
*  And there's zero motion in the car.
*  No, I haven't seen that.
*  They have all these little speed bumps set up and this car has like balanced champagne glasses on the roof of the car or on the hood of the car.
*  And the car is driving over it and it's not disturbing them.
*  Really?
*  It's insane.
*  Huh, that's crazy.
*  It's insane.
*  They have crazy technology in their automobiles right now in China.
*  Like it used to be just a few years ago, like Elon said, their electric cars are kind of bullshit.
*  But now they're like, you look at them, you're like, holy fuck, man.
*  They look like spaceships.
*  They have crazy capability.
*  They can go in circles.
*  Some of them can spin 360 degrees in a circle.
*  In place?
*  In place.
*  So like if you want to do a U-turn, you don't have to do a U-turn.
*  Just do a spin.
*  Really?
*  Your car just spins around.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Nuts.
*  Yeah, I guess that's like in a place like China where it's just jammed actually.
*  Yeah, good move to be able to just spin around in a circle.
*  But they have a video of the car doing it in a parking lot.
*  It's bananas.
*  It's just spinning in a circle.
*  That's crazy.
*  And it can go backwards and forwards, and then it can go forward and backward.
*  Huh.
*  Yeah, it's wild.
*  There's technology that's just beyond what...
*  Dude, most people don't even know how good self-driving is right now.
*  Self-driving, like I have a Tesla, and my self-driver, it's insane how good it is.
*  It changes lanes, stops at red lights, starts again when the light turns green.
*  It's crazy.
*  It knows where all the cars are around it.
*  You can see the cars in the screen.
*  In the screen, when I'm looking down, you see an image of your car and everything that's around you.
*  It's recognized, this is a pickup truck, this is a delivery truck, this is a Volkswagen Beetle.
*  It's like, this is nuts.
*  That's crazy.
*  And it just drives for you.
*  You're supposed to keep your hands on the wheel, but some people fall asleep.
*  But if you keep your hands on the wheel, it'll drive you home.
*  So if you're like, I broke my foot, fuck, what do I do?
*  I can't...
*  I just get to the car, punch in the thing, and it just takes you home.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's pretty crazy.
*  It's nuts.
*  And that's just the beginning.
*  I think in 20 years, the idea of driving your own car is going to be like riding a horse to work.
*  Yeah.
*  Like what?
*  He drove his own car.
*  Is that even legal?
*  Where are you going to park that horse?
*  You know, that's literally how people are going to look at it.
*  Everyone's going to have an automated car.
*  It's going to cut down on the automobile fatalities by 90%, 100%.
*  And it's going to cut down on the fun by 100%.
*  Yeah, that's the part.
*  There is something about driving and responsibility and having your life in your hands and having to pay attention to things.
*  Yeah, we're creating a world where we don't have to pay attention to things.
*  I notice that in what I do.
*  You bring someone out in the wild, and the things that they don't notice is uncanny.
*  Like, dude, what do you...
*  You don't see that mountain lion?
*  Yeah.
*  You're not paying enough attention for the experience that we're having right now right here.
*  Yeah, put your phone away.
*  And people that are not used to just looking around them, 360 degrees, you're on a mountain.
*  There's hills and valleys and there's water down there.
*  There's things overhead.
*  It's like sensory overload for a person who's used to cities.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I just walked...
*  I don't spend much time in large cities, but I just walked from my hotel to breakfast.
*  I looked at the map, saw where it was, walked there.
*  And the amount of people that almost ran into me was insane.
*  Dude, at what point does anybody look up and maneuver?
*  I was just noticing so many people never even looking up.
*  So many people are looking at their phone while they're walking across the street, which I think is so crazy.
*  I always have to be the protective...
*  I've got little kids now too, so I'm always on the lookout for cars and other things.
*  I guess they started putting signs in Germany or somewhere where they're on the ground so they can see whether to walk or not walk when they're on the ground.
*  The lights are now on the ground because everybody's looking down.
*  How many people are developing bad posture because of this?
*  Because it has to affect you.
*  Yeah.
*  You're doing this all the time?
*  Punched over.
*  Until we got these chairs, I'd get back pain every podcast episode.
*  Because you've got to think you're sitting, which is not good for you.
*  It's not good to sit.
*  And then you're sitting in a regular chair that has a slump back.
*  You're leaning back and you've got weird posture.
*  At the end of the podcast, I'd be like, center of my back would be stiff.
*  So these kind of chairs, ergonomic chairs, they force you to have good posture.
*  Yeah, I noticed that.
*  Probably speak better too.
*  Probably.
*  You know when you're...
*  They always have you sit up and object.
*  Yeah, I guess so.
*  Yeah, maybe.
*  I still find myself doing this sometimes, but much more often than I would be, I sit straight.
*  Yeah.
*  I just support...
*  Because posture is essentially like a static exercise.
*  That's really what it is.
*  You know, you just...
*  Because you can't...
*  Your body wants to do this.
*  Yeah.
*  But so if you have some static...
*  It's like a static hold that you keep up all day.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But if you do it, you're better off.
*  Yeah.
*  If you do this, you're leading forward.
*  You're going to get a neck problem.
*  You are.
*  But...
*  My daughter used to go to school with this kid, and I was always saying, how does this
*  kid even do this?
*  Because he always had his chin to his chest.
*  He'd be sitting out in front of the school waiting for his mom to pick him up, and this
*  kid had his chin to his chest like this.
*  He was this skinny kid, and his head was like flat.
*  Like the back of his neck.
*  Like his head was growing out of the center of his chest.
*  It looked painful.
*  And he's just like...
*  His body has gotten used to it.
*  Now he doesn't even bother to hold his fucking head up.
*  He lets his head just drop down on his chest.
*  That's crazy.
*  How many kids are going to get like...
*  Is that an issue?
*  It is, right?
*  Like neck problems because of cell phones?
*  I'm remembering this picture of Tom Sager posted one time.
*  Look at that guy!
*  That's crazy!
*  There's no head.
*  That is exactly what that kid looks like that would go to my daughter's school.
*  The poor bastard.
*  That's nuts.
*  I saw this guy today.
*  That's all it says.
*  I saw this guy.
*  That looks like somebody took the Samsung pen and got rid of his head.
*  There's another thing the Samsung thing can do.
*  Like if someone's annoying, and like if we take a photo, I'm like, I'm tired.
*  Jamie's bullshit.
*  You could take...
*  Just circle Jamie and press that little magic button and poof, Jamie goes away.
*  And they'll fill you in with the background.
*  How do you like that?
*  Better pictures.
*  Get everybody out of them.
*  But you could also doctor photos too.
*  You could make things way bigger than they really are.
*  Like you could take a car and say, look at this crazy car.
*  I saw it just put it in the middle of the street bigger than everything else.
*  And everybody would be like, what the fuck?
*  So hard to tell it's real anymore.
*  It's real hard to tell.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's almost impossible.
*  I know that I always get these ads that are like you talking about something that's not you talking.
*  It's insane.
*  So many people send them to me.
*  They go, hey man, is this real?
*  Like, no, I've never heard of that company.
*  I don't know what they're doing.
*  They're just jacking my voice.
*  It's probably some dude in Nigeria making some money.
*  Get a free crossbow.
*  Joe Rogan selling free crossbows.
*  This came up today because someone was saying that Kanye West is making a limited production cyber truck.
*  Like he redesigned the outside of the cyber truck.
*  It's like three million dollars.
*  And so dudes were asking me about I'm like, I don't know if that's real.
*  Like I saw that thing too.
*  Like I think I saw it on Instagram.
*  I don't know if that's real.
*  It looks fake.
*  Yeah.
*  It looks like something I would do and say and get a bunch of clicks.
*  You can always tell because it's like that thing.
*  Is that real?
*  The Yeezy cyber truck doesn't sound real.
*  One point two million US dollars.
*  The car is all about straight lines.
*  Like how?
*  How is that real?
*  How do you even see out of that?
*  A video.
*  OK, we'll scroll up says a video surface online supposedly reveals the design of Kanye West limited edition Yeezy cyber truck.
*  All black futuristic twist to an already pretty out there and controversial design.
*  I was telling you my daughters hate the cyber truck.
*  They hate it.
*  Why is that?
*  I don't know man.
*  Just not cool.
*  They hate it.
*  I go I think it's dope.
*  Yeah, they look cool.
*  They look more dope though.
*  Did I see you try to shoot it with your bow?
*  Yeah, I did shoot it.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what?
*  It didn't go through.
*  It bounced right off it.
*  It can take a 45 slug.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, but I was thinking like if I had heavier arrows and I had like a single bevel like an iron will.
*  Yeah.
*  Or even a double bevel.
*  Something with a cut on contact.
*  I used like a regular three blade like it was like a Montec style.
*  You know.
*  Yeah.
*  And it just destroyed it.
*  It bounced right off it.
*  Yeah.
*  Broke the arrow.
*  Is it like steel paneling or?
*  Steel.
*  Yeah.
*  It's thick too.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  It's like 7000 pounds that thing.
*  Wow.
*  I mean I did shoot it.
*  Like a lot of people online have shot them with guns.
*  Like 9 Miller is just emptying oozes in the side of the truck and it doesn't go through it.
*  It's pretty nuts.
*  That is crazy.
*  Well that's just for fun.
*  He did that for fun.
*  Like that's how crazy that dude is.
*  That's a lot.
*  It's like let's make it bulletproof.
*  It's also arrow proof.
*  Yeah.
*  But it made me think like if I had a two blade.
*  So it's just you know it cuts better.
*  It gets more penetration.
*  And then if I had a sleeve over the collar over the end of it you know like some protective
*  sort of and then a heavier arrow.
*  An outsert with a heavy arrow.
*  Yeah.
*  An outsert heavy arrow.
*  And I was thinking if I had my 90 pound bow.
*  Maybe.
*  Get that to stick in there a little bit.
*  Maybe not though.
*  I don't know.
*  I mean if it's bouncing bullets off of it.
*  Yeah.
*  It's pretty thick.
*  It is.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  You try it.
*  Yeah.
*  You're still a two blade guy now.
*  I am.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You're all in on that now.
*  I am.
*  Yeah.
*  And you think you prefer penetration over like a big cut.
*  I do.
*  Yeah.
*  But I it's because where I try to edge toward the shoulder more where like the shoulder blades
*  there to protect the vitals.
*  And so if you accidentally hit that I'd rather have penetration and still.
*  Right.
*  With a two blade.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that's the real debate.
*  Mechanicals versus.
*  Yeah.
*  And I feel like it's like better to make a good shot than because like with a mechanical
*  you have to almost intentionally make a bad shot sometimes but banking on the fact that
*  it's cutting larger.
*  You know because you have to stay away from the shoulder or depending on the angle like
*  a quartered away shot.
*  Like I've just had I've had failures with mechanical ones so I just stay away from them.
*  What mechanicals have you tried in the past?
*  A lot of different ones.
*  So this is another thing.
*  Cam shoots the craziest mechanical.
*  He shoots what's called a carnivore.
*  I haven't.
*  Is it a grim reaper.
*  I shot those ones.
*  I like the grim reaper ones.
*  It's a catapult.
*  You're shooting a catapult.
*  Yeah.
*  This thing it's like this big like it opens a tunnel in their body cap.
*  Right.
*  They just die.
*  They go down quick.
*  It's crazy to see how fast things go down because you open up such a hole in them and
*  you know he shoots 90 pounds too.
*  So you have a lot of kinetic energy a lot of kinetic energy and then this big cutting
*  surface of four blades and they're pretty gnarly looking.
*  When you see them open you're like Jesus.
*  But there's a lot going on there.
*  And if you do hit the shoulder.
*  Or there's a lot of things that go wrong.
*  Sometimes the simplest design is the best design.
*  We've been using two blade arrow tips for thousands of years.
*  They work.
*  Check that out.
*  That's a real one.
*  This was probably a fishing.
*  This was probably for fishing.
*  You think so?
*  Because it's so wide or so big.
*  Yeah.
*  Did this come from Texas?
*  Yeah.
*  Probably dug out of like a sandy bottom.
*  Could be.
*  Why would you think that that one would be for fishing?
*  Just the width of it?
*  It's too big?
*  Yeah.
*  I've just seen seen a lot of these like this that would be the size of it.
*  Yeah.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  So to debilitate the fish not like a barb type thing.
*  Yeah.
*  It would probably I could be wrong but I have some similar to this that I was told were for
*  fishing.
*  Were they attaching strings to the end of their arrows when they would shoot fish with
*  arrows?
*  No, I don't think so.
*  Oh really?
*  I think they would just shoot the fish.
*  I've seen guys like just stealing the Amazon and stuff.
*  They do it.
*  They shoot the fish and then they grab the arrow.
*  I did see that.
*  Didn't Ronella do that?
*  He went to Guyana.
*  Yeah.
*  Something like that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And you probably those like long arrow you know probably I mean I imagine there'd be
*  whatever species traveling up those more sandy bottoms when they're spawning and stuff like
*  that so they probably shoot spawning fish a lot and then have those and you just grab
*  the arrows with the fish on it.
*  That makes sense.
*  Make it a lot easier than just grabbing the fish.
*  So this would be do you think it'd just be too big for deer?
*  Yeah I think so.
*  So you see a lot of the yeah a lot of the hunting like big game ones are probably half
*  the size of that.
*  Depends on where you're at though like where I'm at you see a lot of obsidian arrowheads.
*  I'm not sure down here that could be it just be my guess is it'd be hard to get that to
*  fly very good for very much distance.
*  Right.
*  You know so you probably used like a long arrow maybe not even any fletching shooting
*  in a short distance which could be I mean brush country like I don't I'm not real familiar
*  with what's around here so.
*  Does a lot of brush out there.
*  Yeah but they're probably hunting deer and you know they probably in tight quarters too
*  so it could work it could work for deer.
*  Yeah it's kind of amazing.
*  You could definitely use that for deer hunting but.
*  It's kind of amazing that when they were here there weren't even any pigs.
*  Yeah.
*  And now they're fucking.
*  And we were.
*  Swarming.
*  Yeah I was in a place down in I guess it'd be West Texas out at hunting was the last
*  year maybe the year before but this place had a cave on it in it and there's like cave
*  paintings and stuff.
*  Well you got to think like when they were they said that that cave was probably used
*  for thousands of years.
*  Like you could see the where people had sat and was worn smooth and it was pretty wild
*  but when those people were here hunting it was a forest.
*  Now it's a desert.
*  Wow.
*  You know so you think about it like.
*  Climate change.
*  Completely different.
*  Maybe they should have been better with their carbon.
*  They probably should have.
*  I think they they probably stopped climate change by killing all the mammoths right.
*  I don't think they killed all the mammoths.
*  No they didn't.
*  There's no way.
*  There's no way.
*  It doesn't make sense.
*  It doesn't.
*  There's so many spots on earth where you go wait that used to be a far like the Sahara
*  Desert used to be a rainforest.
*  Yeah.
*  What.
*  Right.
*  And while people were alive.
*  What.
*  Pretty crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Haven't they found wasn't there like the bones of some kind of whale that they found in the
*  Sahara.
*  I don't remember this correctly.
*  It might have been one of.
*  There are a bunch of these Instagram pages that are just a hundred percent full of shit.
*  Yeah.
*  30 foot tall skeleton of a man uncovered in Turkey and this archaeologist digging it out
*  and you're like what.
*  And then you go oh this fucking page.
*  So there is this thing that I did see that was it's near where I live in Reno but.
*  I was really now.
*  It's an ocean going mammal.
*  Wow.
*  Some of the earliest forms of whale.
*  OK.
*  So this whale.
*  Where does it say they found it.
*  In Egypt in the desert.
*  Was it called a Basel Baselo soared.
*  Huh Wow.
*  Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in July two of five for its hundreds of fossils
*  to some of the earliest forms of whale.
*  Wow.
*  The Archeo setty and now extinct suborder of whales.
*  The site reveals evidence for the explanation one of the greatest mysteries of the evolution
*  of whales the emergence of whale of the whale as an ocean going mammal from a previous life
*  as a land based mammal.
*  No other place in the world yields the number concentration and quality of such fossils.
*  Wow.
*  That's wild.
*  That is why whale.
*  Look how big it is.
*  Look at they found.
*  Imagine a whale walking around.
*  Bro look what they found.
*  Look at that.
*  That's insanity.
*  They found an enormous whale skeleton in the fucking desert.
*  You ever see the animal that they said was a whale before it became a whale.
*  Looks like a wolf.
*  No I haven't seen.
*  I had a photo of it on my Instagram.
*  This is the original look at the fucking mouth.
*  Wow.
*  Holy shit dude.
*  That thing's crazy.
*  They found that thing.
*  Little feet.
*  They found that thing.
*  Huh.
*  So easy.
*  Show the animal Jamie that used to be a whale or that a whale became became a whale from
*  this evolved from this animal.
*  It looks like some weird looking dog like wolf thing.
*  No no there's there's images that they've recreated of what it looked like when it was
*  walking around on the ground.
*  Yeah that's it.
*  The origin of whales.
*  That thing.
*  Looks like a giant rat.
*  It does look like a rat there.
*  That one's actually in the water.
*  But I've it's not that big either.
*  How the fuck do whales get so big?
*  But if you see the images of what it looked like there's one that I had Jamie it's on
*  my Instagram because I remember that's what it looked like.
*  Look at that one down there with the flippers and the teeth.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Look at that fucker.
*  So those suckers walked around on the ground outside.
*  And then somehow or another they chose to live in the ocean allegedly if you believe
*  in evolution if you're one of those silly fucks.
*  That's wild.
*  If you're one of those silly people doesn't believe the world was created in six days.
*  You think that that's what happened.
*  Whales that they used to those they still like a land mammal.
*  That's land mammal and it somehow or another became a whale.
*  Yeah that's wild.
*  And also how long did it take for you to figure that out.
*  Yeah exactly.
*  How many bones did you guys have to who is the guy who hey I got a crazy thought.
*  Yeah because I imagine they probably didn't find it all.
*  Well it looked like they found it all in one piece but maybe they just stacked it like
*  that.
*  They probably haven't found a lot intact like that.
*  It's one little piece.
*  Well what's this giant bone.
*  Right I mean that one looked intact.
*  I hope they weren't bullshitting in that photo because I hope they found it like that.
*  Like that cool shit.
*  Yeah you know that's all laid out there.
*  You're making me think of this meme I saw recently.
*  Have you seen this?
*  The skeleton how aliens would recreate the animal the animal.
*  Oh that's funny.
*  Oh right a rabbit versus like if you look at the scales and yeah right.
*  Yeah you would think that's some sort of a predatory animal.
*  That's funny.
*  That's a rabbit.
*  Skeleton you wouldn't know it had giant feathers covering up its feet.
*  What is that thing in the lower left.
*  What the hell is that thing for past that lower left.
*  Yeah what is that.
*  So if someone took the bones of modern animals like it's probably a horse or something like
*  that and tried to yeah because our idea of what a dinosaur looks like is like completely
*  speculative right.
*  In fact there's in Montana's they have a science museum and in the front they have a velociraptor
*  has their normally depicted and then on the other side it's how they think they might
*  actually be which is covered in feathers.
*  Just completely.
*  Yeah like a bird.
*  It's like a bird.
*  Yeah.
*  See that.
*  Yeah see I think I've seen.
*  See if you can find that from the Montana Science Museum.
*  It might be museum and natural history in Montana whatever it is but it's in Bozeman.
*  Yeah I saw it when I was there I was like oh look at that.
*  Oh imagine because we think of them as like reptiles.
*  Yeah.
*  Like some lizard looking thing but they think they they at least know some of them.
*  They now know for sure had feathers because they found fossilized images where it shows
*  like where they had feathers giant chickens.
*  Yeah that's it.
*  Yeah that's exactly.
*  So they think it might look like that which is actually even scarier.
*  It's kind of scarier if it's pretty if it's going to fuck you up and it's beautiful.
*  Yeah that I could see that that looks actually looks more realistic in a way.
*  It does something that we see.
*  Right.
*  And if birds are really dinosaurs that survived and they have so many of the characteristics
*  that dinosaurs have some of them do right.
*  And you know some of them even have teeth.
*  But if you look at that thing like yeah I could see.
*  Yeah that looks it does look like a angry chicken.
*  Yeah it's moving away from raptors specifically but yeah these are all just I think it's the
*  dinosaurs at that museum.
*  So the theory is that many different dinosaurs perhaps even the T.
*  Rex I've heard speculated that T.
*  Rex look at that fucker.
*  Whoa that's crazy.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah that looks cooler.
*  Yeah.
*  Wigs on him.
*  Yeah it looks like he's in his hairband phase.
*  He looks like he could be in poison.
*  Yeah.
*  That's funny.
*  They don't really know.
*  I mean one day they'll probably figure it out but right now it's just a lot of guessing.
*  I wonder how they could.
*  One way they could figure it out is to bring one back.
*  That'd be sweet.
*  Well I mean they could pretty much do that with mammoths now right.
*  Oh they're real close.
*  Yeah we're at we're actually going to go see the mammoth when it's actually made.
*  Really.
*  Yeah that's awesome.
*  Yeah I want to see it.
*  I want to I want to see that thing like what are you gonna do with that.
*  Yeah.
*  Let them lose.
*  Because they're good.
*  So they start with an elephant and then they do the embryo but then how many generations
*  Indian elephant.
*  Right.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  Then they'll just keep doing it with the outright to get more.
*  Yeah.
*  Mammoth.
*  Yeah they're just gonna.
*  I guess they'll keep doing it and then develop breeding pairs and then you know they're going
*  to have to separate them to make sure they have genetic diversity.
*  Are they going to like put them back in the wild.
*  I think they are.
*  I think they want to do it in Siberia first.
*  Yeah.
*  The idea is that it would stop global warming by somehow or another.
*  I don't know how.
*  Yeah.
*  They would eat more of the.
*  Yeah eating more spreading the seeds probably with their feces.
*  Probably turn us into a new ice age.
*  These fucking idiots.
*  I think stomping on the ground too.
*  They're going to literally cool the planet to the point where we're fucked.
*  They're going to be like we're going to kill all the mammoths to bring back global warming.
*  Exactly.
*  That'll be like the next hunting.
*  Well that's what my friend Randall Carlson always says.
*  He said global warming is a concern.
*  He goes but global cooling is a real concern.
*  He goes that's what's really scary.
*  What's really scary is ice ages.
*  Because there's been moments on earth while human beings were alive and while animals
*  lived there's been moments on earth where it got so cold that there was so little oxygen
*  in the earth on the earth that we almost didn't make it.
*  That's crazy.
*  Like you're like we're all biological life was real close to being extinguished.
*  Yeah having been to the Arctic you realize like you don't want it to be that cold everywhere
*  all the time everywhere.
*  And all these fucking eggheads that want to spray the skies with particles and cool the
*  sunlight so low down.
*  Why don't we just move to the places that used to be cold when it gets a little warmer.
*  Wouldn't that be a better solution than fucking starting another ice age you dipshits.
*  Because they don't really know what's going to happen if they do wind up cooling the earth.
*  But I guess what if it works too good.
*  Or what I mean I suppose like one giant volcano super volcano can pretty much cool the earth
*  pretty quick too right.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah one giant volcano and we're fucked.
*  I mean anybody who lives anywhere near Yellowstone when it blows is fucked but even people in
*  England are fucked if Yellowstone goes.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Everyone's fucked.
*  It's going to be nuclear winter.
*  Yeah.
*  Over the whole world.
*  Yeah it's pretty wild.
*  All plants are going to die.
*  People turn to cannibals.
*  And that happened.
*  The people they got down to the Toba right.
*  That's it the Toba volcano in Indonesia.
*  There was a super volcano that blew they think it got down to.
*  I forget the number of thousands of people but thousands of people left on earth and
*  they trace that back to this particular super volcano explosion I think was 70,000 years
*  ago.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah 70,000 years ago.
*  Toba eruption been associated with a genetic bottleneck in human evolution about 70,000
*  years ago.
*  It's hypothesized that the eruption resulted in a severe reduction in the size of the total
*  human population due to the effects of the eruption and on the global climate according
*  to the genetic bottleneck theory between 50,000 100,000 years ago human populations
*  decreased by 3000 to 10,000 decreased to 3000 to 10,000 surviving individuals.
*  So there was as little as 3000.
*  That's the low number of humans on earth because of this eruption.
*  So literally like a good sized theater where like I would do a show.
*  That's crazy.
*  3000 but those are the people that live.
*  That's it for the whole earth.
*  Yeah because we aren't we aren't super adapted to the cold really.
*  All 3000 can be like it's not split 50 50 male to female and right.
*  Yeah who knows.
*  I mean probably mostly men survived.
*  It's supported by some genetic evidence suggesting that modern humans are descended from a very
*  small population of between 1000 and 10,000 breeding pairs that existed about 70,000 years
*  ago.
*  That is fucking kooky.
*  So there was a 10 year volcanic winter triggered by the eruption could have largely destroyed
*  the food sources of humans and caused severe reduction in population sizes.
*  These environmental changes may have generated population bottlenecks in many species including
*  hominids.
*  This in turn may have accelerated different differentiation from within the smaller human
*  population.
*  Therefore the genetic differences among modern humans may represent changes within the last
*  70,000 years rather than the gradual differentiation over hundreds of thousands of years.
*  Wow.
*  Imagine if they're like only the dummies lived.
*  We had a star from scratch.
*  Yeah.
*  No wheel.
*  No nothing.
*  No flint tools.
*  Just morons.
*  She's the dumbest of fucking humans.
*  Statistically that's what will happen.
*  Yeah.
*  Well that's probably what does happen to human populations is probably some sort of a collapse
*  and then a rebuild but not everywhere.
*  I think there's always going to be a part that gets spared except super volcanoes it
*  seems.
*  It seems that and asteroid impacts.
*  Those are biggies.
*  That's start from scratch and roaches rule.
*  Right.
*  Then you're fucked.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is also on the table.
*  That's on the menu.
*  Roaches?
*  Asteroids.
*  Oh yeah.
*  But roaches too.
*  Have you ever eaten a cicada?
*  No I've had grasshoppers and cave crickets.
*  Callahan was giving out recipes.
*  For cicadas?
*  Yeah he was telling you how to bake them.
*  You know his podcast?
*  Yeah.
*  He was Cal's Corner.
*  Cal's Weekend Review.
*  Yeah.
*  So he was telling you how to cook them, bake them in an oven.
*  You set the temperature for like 250 degrees whatever.
*  Then you like make a flower out of them?
*  Put teriyaki sauce on them, season them and you eat them.
*  Okay.
*  Well apparently they're good.
*  I just get better at elk hunting I guess.
*  But if you have so many cicadas don't you want to try them?
*  I guess.
*  Like there's places that have these extreme this year right or having extreme blooms right?
*  We have where I live big Mormon crickets that come through and they just travel through
*  their wild.
*  Wow.
*  They make the road all slippery.
*  They'll put out ice on the road.
*  Cars go off the road.
*  Really?
*  Yeah so they get squashed but they start to eat the dead ones.
*  So they pile onto the dead ones and they create these sludge.
*  Yeah and then it gets thicker and thicker and it's just completely slick like the roads
*  get like ice.
*  Do they plow?
*  I don't think the plowing would work.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  That's real?
*  I guess they do plow apparently.
*  They plowed them on the Idaho Highway.
*  Wow that's crazy.
*  Can you show a video of that?
*  There's a.
*  Look those are all crickets.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Dude that's insane.
*  And they're disgusting because they'll go.
*  That's insane.
*  So they're just smashing them and then they're scooping them off.
*  Look how they're scooping them off to the side.
*  Oh my god.
*  Yeah.
*  Just like snow.
*  I had this I was hunting last year and there was just a bunch of them everywhere and there's
*  this old water trough that had I guess you know like a cattle water trough out in the
*  band and somehow some got in there must have died and then the other ones keep piling in
*  and it was like probably I don't know a foot or two deep of just dead crickets with crickets
*  just piling into it and the smell was so bad.
*  You'll never forget that smell.
*  They're just they're gnarly.
*  That's the thing that people keep saying humans are going to have to start eating these crickets.
*  Yeah they.
*  Cricket protein.
*  Like rural Nevada that had the crickets come in.
*  So they just decided I don't know they put a bunch of speakers down and blast like hard
*  rock music and apparently kept the crickets away from the town.
*  That makes sense.
*  The noise.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a long way to the top.
*  There was a certain band that they figured stopped the crickets.
*  I don't know what the band is.
*  I think it was Metallica or something.
*  It's just invading.
*  That's amazing.
*  God I've never even heard of this.
*  Mormon crickets.
*  Now they call them Mormons because they fuck so much.
*  I have no clue.
*  Because they make so many of them.
*  They have so many kids.
*  Yeah.
*  Why do they call them Mormon crickets?
*  I don't know.
*  So is this I've never even heard of these things before.
*  Have you heard of this Jamie?
*  That is nuts.
*  Yeah.
*  I think they also call them maybe potato crickets or something like that as well.
*  Wow.
*  They're pretty wild.
*  Is this a once a year thing?
*  Yeah.
*  Once a year.
*  And then there will be a big hatch.
*  I think maybe because of the winter last year.
*  There's just millions of them.
*  Wow.
*  Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones.
*  Led Zeppelin.
*  There you go.
*  That's it.
*  That's the one that worked.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  So in the apocalypse know that you can just keep these guys from eating your crops with
*  some heavy metal music.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  It seems like a bunch of them are going to get through anyway.
*  That's fucking insane.
*  Yeah.
*  They eat each other?
*  Yeah.
*  Because you walk through there and you step and you step on them and they create these
*  piles of just eating each other.
*  Eating each other.
*  Bro, this is bananas.
*  How do you stay there?
*  I guess you have to.
*  Sleeping on the ground.
*  Oh.
*  Camping.
*  Oh my God.
*  It's terrible.
*  Have you had that happen?
*  Yeah.
*  It's not fun.
*  How did you sleep?
*  Did they get in your sleep bag?
*  No.
*  Did you sleep?
*  No.
*  I zipped it up.
*  Bro.
*  What does that sound like while you're sleeping?
*  Yeah.
*  I was hoping it was going to play cricket sounds for this music.
*  What does it sound like when you're sleeping?
*  Just crickets crawling.
*  I mean it's not.
*  Just constant crawling.
*  Yeah.
*  Or you feel them.
*  They kind of like hop.
*  You hear the thunks of them hitting the thing.
*  Oh bro.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, you got to wipe the guts off your boots.
*  Look at that.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh.
*  I mean it's not like it's going to be a lot of the time, but it is like generally late
*  summer.
*  I know we've covered this before, but what exactly happens to grasshoppers if they become
*  locusts?
*  There's something that has to do with the population, the numbers, and the time of year
*  where grasshopper becomes locusts and they just fill the air and fucking destroy everything,
*  destroy everybody's crops.
*  Yeah.
*  Everything.
*  Like people starve to death because of locust infestations.
*  Well, I think yeah, even something like that.
*  You see the plants, they just come, they'll be on the plants and just, it's like a tree
*  covered in the bugs and they're just constantly eating it, eating it, eating it.
*  And then I guess they lay the eggs under the ground and then die and then they emerge again.
*  It's wild.
*  If you lived in like the 1800s and you're like barely getting by growing corn.
*  And then those guys come by.
*  It's a bad day.
*  People died bad.
*  Yup.
*  Wasn't that like a biblical threat?
*  Like a curse, the curse of locusts?
*  Wasn't that like a thing that people would do back in the day?
*  Like a plague of locusts.
*  Just come and eat all your food.
*  What causes grasshoppers to become locusts?
*  So all locusts are grasshoppers, not all grasshoppers are locusts.
*  There's three different kinds specifically that turn into that.
*  Big difference, you know, grasshoppers are solitary locust swarm, but I'm not seeing
*  what causes it.
*  The thing that I had read was that it was a particular type of grasshopper when there's
*  a certain population density.
*  It causes some morphogenic change in the animal.
*  And then they just move together?
*  Yeah.
*  Because it is weird, like those Mormon crickets, they do that where they move in a certain
*  direction and they're all moving together.
*  It's really weird.
*  Bizarre.
*  They change when they're crowded or isolated.
*  Yeah.
*  There's something about the amount of them.
*  They get a bunch of them together.
*  It's like a gang mentality.
*  When you have riots and people storm on the streets and it's like a mob mentality.
*  And they just keep going and adding.
*  I guess that happens with them too.
*  But they have changes in their actual physiology.
*  There's a video explaining it here.
*  Yeah.
*  The strange thing that turns grasshoppers into locusts, it's on YouTube, Bizarre Beasts.
*  That fellow looks like he knows what he's talking about.
*  But it's weird when animals can change.
*  For some reason bugs, I can kind of deal with it.
*  But like pigs, the wild pig thing is one of the craziest things of all time.
*  That if you let a domestic pig loose, their snout lengthens, their fur grows and they
*  start growing these tusks.
*  And it happens pretty quick.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, they just go feral and it's the way that they can survive better.
*  Because they aren't getting fed all the time.
*  There's physiological changes because they have to root around.
*  But there's no other animal.
*  If you let a dog go, the dog's just going to be a dog.
*  We tried to figure that out yesterday.
*  We were joking around.
*  Like how long would it take before a dog becomes a wolf?
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Yeah.
*  Like if humans turned wolves into dogs, how many generations of wild dogs would it take
*  for a wolf emerged?
*  I don't know.
*  I have seen a pack of wild dogs in an area where there are wolves.
*  And those wild dogs, they get pretty vicious and pretty efficient, pretty fast.
*  Oh, I'm sure.
*  They probably act just like wolves.
*  But then they probably would, yeah, they could probably cross breed with the wolves.
*  I don't know.
*  Oh, they definitely could.
*  There's a lot of wolf hybrids.
*  Yeah.
*  Like people buy wolf hybrids all the time.
*  I wonder though if they would actually survive the challenge to breed.
*  But if the pack of feral dogs is large enough, they could probably.
*  I wonder if it's a cycle that just would happen automatically if given enough time.
*  If you could reproduce the cycle of turning a wolf into a dog.
*  If you just let the dogs out and there would be no more dogs and just be all wolves and
*  then civilization re-emerges and we turn wolves into dogs again.
*  I wonder.
*  Go, maybe.
*  I mean, you can't.
*  I mean, you can't experiment.
*  But if you take a wild pig and you put it in a pen, that fucker's wild forever.
*  Yeah.
*  You have a wild boar.
*  It's not going to like, it's snouts not going to shrink, right?
*  No.
*  It's not going to turn pink again and look cute.
*  Okay.
*  In the early colonial times, that's why they would clip their ears in certain patterns.
*  It would cause it.
*  And that's where the word earmark came from.
*  Whoa.
*  Because there would be domestic and running around, they would need to know which ones
*  were theirs, I guess.
*  Whoa.
*  Pigs were allowed to live basically feral existence, but they were still what we'd recognize
*  as domestic swine.
*  The practice of free ranging pigs may still exist in some areas, but I think it largely
*  died out during the 20th century.
*  However, as a result, just about every part of North America can support feral pigs has
*  them.
*  However, in California, a landowner in the 1920s imported European wild boar for hunting.
*  I think that landowner was William Randolph Hearst.
*  I'm pretty sure.
*  Yeah, I think you're right.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that cocksucker.
*  That's the reason why weed's illegal to this day, that piece of shit.
*  These animals hybridized with feral pigs producing the offspring with some of the appearance
*  and characteristics of wild boar.
*  That genetic line has been spreading for 95 years or so, and it's been quite successful.
*  There's so many of them in California, man.
*  It's nuts.
*  They have them in San Jose, in people's yards.
*  People in suburbs, they'll wake up and there's fucking wild pigs knocking over dumpsters
*  and rooting in their garbage.
*  Rooting in their garden, tearing their lawns apart, destroying their ... They could destroy
*  giant chunks of turf, golf course turf.
*  They just go right through it.
*  They just root it up and go in for worms and other stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  They smell what's underneath the grass and go for it.
*  If you were just living wild and if the world goes to shit, they're the best animal to have
*  around because you are insured there's going to be a high population if you don't have
*  predators.
*  Yeah.
*  You don't have predators.
*  There's feral goats.
*  Goats multiply super fast.
*  Although they're good.
*  They live in really harsh environments.
*  That's probably why people brought them to Hawaii, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean New Zealand, a lot of places and they just flourish because they can go in everything
*  from jungles to deserts.
*  Do you smoke cigars?
*  I know, but go for it.
*  When people do bring animals into a place, like we were talking about Adam Greentree
*  today, and he lives in Australia where they kill cats because they have so many wild cats
*  that wild cats have killed everything.
*  Wild domestic cats, regular cats, killed all the ground nesting birds.
*  They've just decimated populations.
*  Yeah, they just fuck everything up.
*  So they hunt them over there.
*  So if you get a, you ever seen an Australian hunting magazine?
*  Oh yeah, it's like they got a guy with a cat on the front.
*  A dead cat.
*  Look at this big cat.
*  I got a nice cat, mate.
*  You're like, whoa.
*  You know, it's just every time humans bring an animal into an area, almost definitely,
*  especially if it's a predator, they're going to fuck everything up.
*  Yeah, and most of the time they bring it in to control a problem with the rats and the
*  And it's like, well, nobody's going to, they're elusive.
*  They're going to definitely kill the ground nesting birds that are way easier to hunt
*  and kill.
*  Yeah, they don't know their job.
*  No.
*  It's so funny that people didn't know.
*  I mean, I guess they just didn't know that they probably had shitty books.
*  Yeah.
*  They did all this stuff in the 18, like New Zealand.
*  When did they start doing that?
*  Oh, bringing animals over?
*  Yeah.
*  What year was that?
*  Yeah, the 18 something.
*  Yeah.
*  Long time ago.
*  Let's bring animals over, no predators.
*  What could go wrong?
*  Right.
*  And they just exploding populations.
*  But it really shows you too, like when there's predators on the landscape, they definitely
*  take a toll on the prey species.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  For sure.
*  Well, like with reintroduction of wolves.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, and now they're doing it in Colorado.
*  Like, good idea, guys.
*  Yeah.
*  Bring them everywhere.
*  They talk about being grizzly bears to the cascades.
*  I saw that.
*  Do you guys not know what a grizzly bear is?
*  No.
*  I mean, I think to them about your experience on Fog Knack Island.
*  I'll tell you, like the thing about grizzly bears is people, it's generally people that
*  don't live in those areas making the decisions for the people that do.
*  If you think about it, like in the places where you're going to encounter a bear, there's
*  not that many people that live there.
*  But when they, the actual number of people that get attacked and killed might be insignificant
*  in the whole population.
*  But in those areas, it's pretty significant.
*  Yeah.
*  And it'd be like, what if we released, I don't know, Kodiak brown bears?
*  Well, there was brown bears in California that's on their flag, right?
*  Like coastal, large, giant brown bears.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, a couple of those running through San Francisco probably clean up the street
*  pretty quick.
*  Oh yeah.
*  You got a homeless problem?
*  I got a solution.
*  There you go.
*  Pretty wild.
*  Let's reintroduce.
*  We're a bunch of colonizers.
*  We've stolen this land from bears.
*  Right.
*  Bring them back.
*  Yeah.
*  There's amazing bears back.
*  I miss them.
*  Yeah.
*  The whole of Canada where there's nobody living and there's a lot of brown bears, grizzly
*  bears all the way through Alaska into the Arctic.
*  There's a lot of those bears around in places where there aren't people.
*  Right.
*  But the problem with Canada is the population centers like Vancouver don't have bears.
*  And so they're the ones who vote.
*  And so they voted to make bear hunting, at least brown bear hunting, illegal in BC.
*  And the guy just got jacked yesterday by a brown bear in BC.
*  Yeah.
*  It becomes more and more popular because we have more people in their territory.
*  Yeah.
*  And then we're going to expand their range.
*  But there's a reason that we, I mean I love large bears.
*  It's awesome to see them.
*  It's an incredible experience.
*  But there's certain places where they can be and there's certain places where they probably
*  shouldn't be.
*  There's a reason that we got rid of them in a lot of places because they kill and eat
*  people.
*  Yeah.
*  And imagine if it's like, I mean percentage wise, I don't know, the amount of people that
*  get attacked and killed by bears is going up for sure.
*  And it might be a small percentage, but okay, if you took it per capita, people that are
*  in their turf, right?
*  Say, I don't even know if it's a 0.001 percent.
*  Well, what would that be of New York City?
*  Right.
*  And if you had some monster that came and killed a thousand people a year, you'd be
*  like, let's get rid of this fucking monster.
*  Which is what they did.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what they did.
*  Is named for the place where the last person in California was killed by a grizzly bear.
*  Yeah.
*  It's wild.
*  Yeah.
*  This guy got fucking, and then they said, hey, let's kill them all.
*  And then we're like, let's bring them back.
*  I miss the monsters.
*  Yeah.
*  Which I mean, there are places where it's like, it's awesome to see them and they're
*  there and we should have them there.
*  Yeah.
*  But I don't think that we should have them everywhere because I, and especially with
*  like our populations now, they don't realize what they're doing in those places.
*  Do you know people are releasing wolves in California, like sketchy people, like sketchy
*  activists releasing.
*  Uh huh.
*  Yeah.
*  There was one outside of Bakersfield.
*  We played a video of it on this podcast.
*  My friend who lives up there found it.
*  He saw this.
*  He filmed this.
*  He was driving on the highway and they're like, I think that's a fucking wolf.
*  And they pulled over and they zoomed in on this wolf.
*  Hold on a second.
*  I'll find it.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, there's collared wolves going from Oregon and other places into California.
*  This is not that.
*  This is just like releasing wolves in Southern California.
*  Yeah, some dipshit thought it would be cute to let a wolf go.
*  And so I'll find it.
*  I've got the video in here if you just give me a second.
*  Yeah.
*  I know he sent it to me.
*  So I was hanging out with him and I was like, well, how big was it?
*  And he sent me this video.
*  I was like, yo, that's a wolf wolf.
*  And this thing was like five miles from an in and out.
*  Was it like a wild wolf or was it just like a wolf dog that they turned loose?
*  No, it's a wolf.
*  It's a wild wolf.
*  Yeah.
*  God damn it.
*  I can't find it.
*  I know he sent it to me.
*  He might have got a new phone number.
*  I might have his old phone number in my book and not have that image saved in our little
*  text message exchange.
*  Fuck.
*  He probably didn't have an iPhone.
*  So you don't get the bubble saving.
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  I give up.
*  I got it.
*  I know we played it on the podcast before, but it is a bizarre video because you watch
*  the video like, wow, that's a big wolf and it's running near this cow.
*  And then someone comes along and chases away and it runs off.
*  But it's wolf.
*  Somebody just let and then we showed a video yesterday of El Cerritos, California, where
*  a wolf just running down the street like a big ass wolf.
*  That was apparently a year ago that was on TikTok.
*  Last year.
*  You find that again.
*  I found the video of us playing it before.
*  Hold on.
*  Oh, beautiful.
*  Let me find a better version of this.
*  Last year I was in New Mexico and they have was a Mexican wolf.
*  They're different than like the gray wolves or the further north wolves.
*  Bigger than a smaller than a timber wolf.
*  They look kind of like a shaggy wolf.
*  They're like, yeah, they're they're a lot smaller.
*  They're like a large coyote, but we saw a lot of them.
*  Really?
*  We saw a pack of them in the same day that we saw.
*  It was like four to six of them.
*  A friend of mine was with Kip and they saw some six others somewhere else.
*  So they were like, they say the population is not that large, but this is that's a substantial
*  portion of the population.
*  And then how much of a survey they do.
*  And at camp we heard which would be completely different ones than the ones that we were
*  seeing because we're I was like 30 miles away from where I was.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So you're like, there's a lot of them in here.
*  They I think their populations grow a lot faster than they say.
*  Keep track of them.
*  Sure.
*  I mean, how much money they spending in Mexico to give a good audit of the wolf population.
*  Yeah.
*  And this is a New Mexico, which like northern New Mexico or no, southern New Mexico.
*  Sorry.
*  And so they're coming from Mexico?
*  No, they were they were really they're just called the Mexican wolf.
*  I guess this is a separate species of wolf.
*  Oh, it's not a red wolf.
*  No, a red wolf is also a separate species.
*  So I think the red wolf is the one that's a lot more rare.
*  But the Mexican wolf is the one that they have in New Mexico.
*  How big is the Mexican wolf, like 50 pounds?
*  Yeah, it'd be like, yeah, probably something like that.
*  That's found it.
*  Yeah, that is a wolf wolf.
*  Yeah.
*  So this is my friend.
*  Damn it.
*  It just did this thing again.
*  Oh, I found out what happened on why this is something's wrong with the Mac computers
*  and playing video.
*  Apparently I have to update my computer.
*  But just that's OK.
*  Just look at that.
*  Look at that image.
*  That is a wolf wolf.
*  Yeah.
*  And that thing was outside of Bakersfield, bro.
*  That's crazy.
*  Bakersfield.
*  You know, the in and out that's down on the 10.
*  Yeah.
*  Or the five.
*  Is that what the five?
*  What highway?
*  Yeah, five.
*  That's a couple miles away from that.
*  Huh?
*  Wild.
*  What the fuck?
*  Out in a field.
*  Yeah.
*  And he saw it driving and he's like, hold on.
*  Is that a fucking wolf?
*  Yes.
*  So like that's pretty good video.
*  There's people that run some of these wolf.
*  I don't know what you want to call them.
*  Like rehabilitation kind of places.
*  These wolf organizations.
*  That their stated goal is to reintroduce wolves so that we will no longer need to hunt.
*  Because the wolves will take care of the wild animals.
*  They'll keep the population in check.
*  Totally not taking into account pets, kids, Little Red Riding Hood, all that shit.
*  The reason why we were scared of wolves in the first place.
*  They think the wolves are just going to stick to deer.
*  Yeah.
*  No, they're going to take out hikers, bird watchers.
*  Good luck.
*  Whatever.
*  But also too, I mean, when you think about wolves being across the United States, we
*  had a giant Great Plains full of bison, millions of bison.
*  Like they had a lot more food sources and a lot more availability to preferred food
*  sources.
*  A different world.
*  We don't have that.
*  Yeah.
*  And to bring them into this world now is just so goofy.
*  I can't imagine how they got away with it in Colorado.
*  All those ranchers are going to get fucked.
*  They're going to get fucked.
*  Well, I mean, from and I don't know how much of speculation, but I'm pretty sure this is
*  a fact that they took wolves that were depredating like cattle and then release them in Colorado.
*  And guess what they're doing?
*  Killing cattle.
*  Weird.
*  Did you see?
*  Did you see they found one dead and was killed by a mountain lion?
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  So this is this was kind of an interesting thing.
*  In my area in Montana, they did a huge study on wolves because everyone's like the wolves
*  are killing all the elk, which is sort of true because the elk mortalities went up.
*  But what they found is the mountain lions were actually killing more elk and the wolves
*  were pushing off.
*  They were stealing it.
*  So yeah, mountain lion.
*  I've actually witnessed wolves pushing a mountain lion off a kill.
*  So the mountain lions are just a mountain lion is actually probably one of the most
*  efficient predators out there.
*  More efficient than a wolf, I would say.
*  And so the mountain lions can kill, kill, kill pretty much whenever they want.
*  They're just so good at it.
*  So mountain lion would kill.
*  They start to eat.
*  The wolves would come in, run them off, claim the kill.
*  And then what's that make the mountain lion do?
*  Kill again.
*  So they're just using these mountain lions to do their killing for them.
*  Wow.
*  So they run off the mountain lion.
*  So my speculation is they it's been proven that this collared one that they just released
*  in Colorado is killed by a mountain lion.
*  It's like that mountain lion just didn't want to take shit from these wolves.
*  Haven't seen you.
*  You aren't taking my kill.
*  Killed the kill the wolf.
*  Right.
*  Not only that, but they have a small number because they only released a handful of them.
*  So he might have been on his own.
*  Yeah.
*  Who knows?
*  He got a little cocky with the chase you off.
*  And yeah, mountain lions are fairly timid when they run.
*  They just they go off.
*  They get up in a tree and okay.
*  And then they'll go kill again.
*  But in this particular instance, the mountain lion just killed the wolf.
*  He had enough.
*  Yeah.
*  It was like one of the enough.
*  Yeah.
*  So one of these found dead in Colorado.
*  Like you killed by mountain lion.
*  Look at these wolves that they let loose, man.
*  They're amazing.
*  Look, I'm glad they exist, but I feel like reintroducing them is opening up a can of
*  worms that's akin to releasing cats in Australia.
*  I know they came from that place, but they haven't been in that place in a long fucking
*  time.
*  Yeah.
*  Hundred years.
*  And the world's so much different now.
*  Like we have you can't just go back to the way things were because it just isn't possible.
*  I mean, there's a lot of invasive plants that have taken over forage for, you know,
*  undulence.
*  And there's a lot of just so much that's changed road systems that never carve there that I
*  mean, wolves can travel a lot faster on roads and cover more country and be more efficient
*  at killing.
*  So.
*  Yeah.
*  And then there's going to be massive resistance to reducing their population, which there
*  is already.
*  Right.
*  And it's just it's a mess.
*  You opened up a crazy can of worms because you don't understand wolves.
*  The thing is, it's like these people that want to make these decisions to reintroduce
*  these things, they're essentially activists.
*  They have this idea in their mind, this utopian view of nature being played out, but they're
*  not taking into account like what these things actually are.
*  You just have this like beautiful idealized version of what a wolf or grizzly bear is.
*  You're releasing predators.
*  Yeah.
*  And actually, the other thing too is like, oh, Colorado, the wolves that they released
*  there were not the type of wolves that were in Colorado.
*  It was more of a prairie wolf, which is more similar to that Mexican wolf, which is a lot
*  smaller wolf than the ones from way far north.
*  The ones that are north as you go further north, species get larger.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's like they're taking these that weren't even in that landscape ever and kind of filling
*  a gap with them.
*  Well, that's what they did in Montana.
*  They took them from Canada.
*  Yeah.
*  And so these Alberta wolves, these fucking monsters.
*  These giant beasts of a wolf, which they, you know, they need more food.
*  They're more efficient at killing certain species.
*  Like our moose populations just suffered.
*  You want to protect something, maybe protect the moose because there's plenty of wolves
*  in North America.
*  There's not that many chyrus moose, which is really hurting in areas where they've reintroduced
*  wolves because they just weren't used to that kind of, you know, that kind of predator that
*  time of year.
*  Also, they don't have packs of moose.
*  Right.
*  No, very solitary.
*  Very solitary.
*  So, you know, we have a calf now that cow moose will protect that calf, but.
*  As best she can.
*  As best she can.
*  Yeah, it's not.
*  Well, that's the reason why cow moose are so dangerous to be around.
*  It's because of wolves.
*  Because like a deer is not going to really stomp people.
*  Yeah.
*  It's very rare that a deer goes after people.
*  Moose will come for you.
*  They will run at you.
*  Especially if you've got like a dog or something.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Because that triggers that.
*  People running that Iditarod, you know, have to like kill a moose to protect themselves
*  and the dogs because they'll come and charge the dogs.
*  Yeah.
*  This year, a guy, I think the guy that won it had to kill a moose.
*  He got time penalized because he didn't get the moose well enough, but still won, I guess.
*  He got time penalized because he didn't gut the moose well enough?
*  Yeah.
*  So if you have to like protect yourself in a life or death situation, like whether it's
*  a bear, a moose, doesn't matter.
*  You still have to follow all the laws and that law is like you have to salvage things.
*  So you didn't gut it very well, I guess.
*  He was probably in a hurry.
*  He just gutted it, did it real fast.
*  Overcame killing a moose and receiving a time penalty.
*  Imagine a fucking game you're in where there's a time penalty when you kill a moose.
*  Yeah, a moose that's trying to kill you and your dogs.
*  Wow.
*  It's a pretty wild deal, actually.
*  That is insane.
*  So you have to gut it, but do you have to salvage the meat?
*  No, I think that they can leave, so for this race, they can leave the meat there, but they
*  have to like, I don't know whether they mark it with a GPS or something so then somebody
*  does come in and salvage the meat, yes.
*  Wow.
*  His dog Falou was injured before a CV shot and killed the moose with a handgun.
*  Race rules require any big game animal killed in defense of life or property be gutted before
*  the musher moves on.
*  He told officials he gutted the moose the best he could.
*  However, he was ultimately giving a two hour penalty because he only spent 10 minutes gutting
*  the moose.
*  Well, I mean, what is it, as best as he can, like what does that mean?
*  I don't know.
*  Either you got a moose or you don't got a moose.
*  Right, so maybe he just opened it up.
*  I have no clue.
*  Right, he might have just like opened the gut.
*  And then he tried to get it and like, okay, I'm getting, but imagine not being prepared
*  for that and like being covered in blood when it's 50 below or whatever.
*  Also like, what if your knife is not sharp and you go through the first hide, it's going
*  to dull the shit out of you.
*  Sawing at it with a bullshit dull knife trying to cut open this moose and then trying to
*  cut all the organs out.
*  That same bullshit dull knife.
*  You don't have a knife sharpener.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  Yeah, I don't know the circumstances, but yeah, I can imagine it being a shit show.
*  Like I could see a moose being so like you tell me, a moose is so big, you might have
*  to sharpen your knife if you're dressing a moose.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, or you might have like as you're cutting it, you might have to resharpen your knife.
*  Yeah, definitely.
*  Yeah, I mean, especially if you're skinning it and all that depends on how sharp type
*  of knife you have and all that.
*  But he probably just had like a, my guess is like a small knife that, you know, you
*  use to be bullshit.
*  Yeah, cut things.
*  Those little fucking tiny razor blade knives.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  Fuck.
*  That's crazy.
*  A two hour time limit.
*  That seems rude.
*  Yeah.
*  Still one though.
*  That's pretty good.
*  It is pretty good.
*  But what a crazy game you're playing.
*  Yeah.
*  Where there's time penalties built in for not getting a moose.
*  I know you went to Greenland too.
*  Yeah.
*  I saw those videos.
*  Was that when you were still hunting with a mouth tab?
*  It was.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Well, Greenland looks amazing.
*  Yeah, that place is wild.
*  I didn't realize like that.
*  You see that ice, you know, you see pictures of it's all ice.
*  Well, around the ocean certain times of year, it's pretty green because it's not winter
*  yet.
*  But that ice sheet is massive.
*  It looks like this giant mountain.
*  I mean, it climbs some elevation.
*  You don't really realize it.
*  You kind of think it's all just ice.
*  Yeah, just massive ice sheet.
*  Wow.
*  It's pretty wild.
*  Do people walk on those?
*  Like you have to be careful.
*  You don't fall through, right?
*  Yeah, they do.
*  Like while we were there, we'd run into people that were doing expeditions and other things.
*  That was when we were in the Arctic.
*  Some people were doing like a town to town expedition just on skis.
*  And they left.
*  And I'm like looking at it like, man, they don't look like they had enough gear for their
*  expedition.
*  And when we came back in, one of the people was getting care flighted out because they
*  got frostbite and lost a finger.
*  Imagine like six, seven days into a 30 day trek and you're already one finger down.
*  Were they not geared up with like insulated outerwear?
*  I don't know.
*  Yeah, must have.
*  Just not paying attention.
*  Like you get worked up, right?
*  You're working real hard and your body's hot.
*  You take your gloves off and you don't feel cold.
*  And then probably realized like, OK, it just happened so fast, like uncovered hands.
*  Now when you were in the Arctic Circle, like what is the temperature where you're at?
*  Oh, it was like a warm spell when we got there.
*  It was pretty warm.
*  It was like 20 below.
*  But like I talked to some guys that were there the week before and it's like 60 below.
*  And what country is that officially?
*  Canada.
*  Canada.
*  Yeah.
*  And so 60.
*  What's a really rough day up there?
*  I would think in that 60 below with wind chill factor kind of thing.
*  Heavy winds like the breeze.
*  You get a little bit of breeze and that temperature changes fast.
*  Real fast.
*  When it's when it's calm, you go, oh, this isn't that bad.
*  And then when that wind starts to blow, it just drops.
*  It is so cold.
*  And you're bow hunting.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is so crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  To be bow hunting in a place where nothing stops the wind.
*  Yeah.
*  When it's really windy, I think we went out and we didn't have bad winds.
*  So when it does come up, it's kind of one of those things that just stops everything
*  really, because you can't see where you're going.
*  Can't really navigate well.
*  So you just kind of hang out and wait for the wind to die down.
*  Wow.
*  How close were you when you made your shot?
*  Oh, really close.
*  Like 25, 30 yards.
*  Was it windy then?
*  No, it was slightly windy.
*  It wasn't bad.
*  Now muskox have these crazy coats.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  How thick is that stuff?
*  There's a muskox.
*  Wow.
*  Look how awesome that thing is.
*  Yeah.
*  That looks right out of Star Wars.
*  It does, doesn't it?
*  Look at those horns.
*  Pretty crazy.
*  That's nuts.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But yeah, Greenland, that whole area, that whole Arctic region is pretty cool.
*  What did you do with the cape?
*  I skinned it out and brought it back.
*  It's so warm.
*  Are you going to use it as a blanket or something?
*  I don't know.
*  Maybe.
*  It seems like it would be the dopest blanket of all time.
*  Yeah, it would.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  You just line your, I don't know, put it on your bed as a mattress thing or sheet thing.
*  Yeah, definitely.
*  Yeah.
*  People come over your house, like check out the bedspread, son.
*  Yeah.
*  Muskox.
*  I got that on top of the world.
*  Yeah.
*  Pretty wild.
*  Literally on top of the world.
*  Yeah.
*  So Greenland, not that harsh.
*  Not as harsh.
*  No.
*  Well, it was different times a year because I think-
*  What time were you there?
*  I was there in September, so it was the end of, it was the beginning of kind of that winter
*  season.
*  It looked-
*  Or it might have even been August.
*  It was probably August.
*  It looked tolerable.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, summertime, that's like anywhere like as far north as Alaska, the Arctic.
*  Summer is amazing.
*  Sunlight 24 hours a day.
*  It's pretty mild temperatures.
*  There's a lot of bugs, but a lot of bugs.
*  Mosquitoes and bats and all that.
*  Yeah, they go hard too.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  They just feast.
*  Alaska mosquitoes, no, they don't have much time.
*  They just go for it.
*  Good summer fishing, water's open, all that kind of stuff.
*  And then it just turns to ice.
*  And it's like wintertime through March, April, May.
*  That whole timeframe is still winter.
*  And then it gets back into summer.
*  And so when you were up there, when you're trying to locate caribou, do you go to these
*  corridors where caribou naturally sort of gravitate towards?
*  Do you know where they're going to be going?
*  No, I mean, it depends where you're at.
*  There we were able to travel by boat and we could look for them from the boat and go up
*  and hike.
*  Like in places in Alaska, there's places where they kind of live in the mountains.
*  And when it's that, they kind of have just certain areas and they move around in the
*  mountains, but they might not migrate like other herds do.
*  And then there's migration herds.
*  And they do migrate and they travel.
*  And then it's weird because they, not weird, but they tend to travel into the wind.
*  So whichever direction the wind's going, that kind of chooses the direction that the caribou
*  start to move.
*  So they have an area that they can smell threats in front of them.
*  And so when you were there, you were there with that dude Pedro, how do you say his last
*  name?
*  Ampuro?
*  Ampuro.
*  That dude's cool.
*  Yeah, he's a great guy.
*  He's got a great YouTube channel.
*  It's a YouTube channel.
*  All his different adventures are amazing.
*  Yeah, he's a great bowhunter.
*  Awesome guy.
*  Fun to hang out with.
*  I watched one recently where I was like, what?
*  He went elk hunting in Mongolia.
*  Yep.
*  I was like, what?
*  Yeah, the Altai.
*  Elk in Mongolia?
*  Yeah.
*  And like, I thought of Mongolia as being like these steps, like the flat plains.
*  Oh no, there's mountains and.
*  Yeah.
*  Crazy.
*  I mean, it was like, he might as well have been in Utah.
*  Yeah.
*  There's elk.
*  Yeah, Mongolia has elk.
*  Kazakhstan has elk.
*  Hunting out of a yurt.
*  It's really crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Very, very cool.
*  That is one place that I would like to go to Mongolia just to see.
*  It looks awesome.
*  Pedro Ampuerro Hunting Adventures is the YouTube channel.
*  And I mean, he does an amazing job of just like really good editing.
*  It makes it interesting.
*  They're like documentary style videos of all these different places he goes.
*  This guy, that guy goes all over the world.
*  Yeah, he does.
*  Some cool, some cool places.
*  Very cool places.
*  It's just, it's so interesting to see someone.
*  And also when he's there, they're like, why do you have a bow?
*  Yeah.
*  Elks right there, use a rifle.
*  What the fuck are you doing?
*  Yeah, a lot of places in Asia don't understand bow hunting.
*  It's more just like, they don't see it probably very often.
*  Well, they want meat.
*  Yeah.
*  Right?
*  It's like, let's just be efficient.
*  The best way to get meat is a rifle.
*  What are you retarded?
*  Exactly.
*  That thing's 200 yards away.
*  Why sneak up?
*  Yeah, we'd be done right here.
*  Just get prone.
*  Let's fucking get this over with.
*  But to be honest, a lot of the guns that they have over there are not very accurate.
*  Are you allowed to bring your own rifle?
*  Yeah, you are.
*  In a lot of places.
*  It's a major pain though.
*  Oh, is it really?
*  Yeah, a lot of paperwork.
*  Yeah, a lot of paperwork, a lot of check-ins, a lot of military stops.
*  A lot of, yeah, it's like not a fun experience.
*  So for the most part, when you go to a hunt like that, you would let them provide the
*  rifle?
*  Some people would.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know if I would.
*  Yeah.
*  Could you bring your own sights?
*  Could you like bring over a Vortex sight?
*  AKs.
*  Are they shooting with AKs over there?
*  Yeah, they just like leftover stuff.
*  Some shit they left over for the Taliban.
*  Exactly.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's exactly what it is.
*  How many times have you hunted in Asia?
*  Only, I've only been over there once.
*  What was it for?
*  A sheep.
*  Which kind of sheep?
*  In Marco Polo sheep.
*  Oh, those are cool.
*  Yeah.
*  I was in Kyrgyzstan.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  What was that like?
*  It was pretty wild, man.
*  How long does it take to get there?
*  Oh, I don't know.
*  It's really a day of flying and then a lot of driving.
*  Like a lot of driving.
*  I don't know, maybe 14 hours in a 15 to 20 hours in a car.
*  I don't know.
*  Something like that.
*  And so how does one set up a hunt like that?
*  You want to go hunt for Marco Polo sheep.
*  How would you even start?
*  Yeah, it was like one of the things like knowing somebody that has a connection with somebody
*  that has like a, they have like gamekeepers of the area and then you get a permit from
*  and then they go with you that like the game wardens come with you.
*  It's a whole deal.
*  And like these people have the area and it's their job to manage that area.
*  And so that's kind of how that works.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And do you have to grease everybody up?
*  Like you have to pay everybody?
*  No.
*  Well, I mean, you pay for the tags and the permits and everything.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  And then you don't have to pay all those extra people?
*  No.
*  They come with it?
*  Yeah, it's all part of the deal.
*  Oh, interesting.
*  And so when you're doing this, are you horseback through the mountains?
*  Like?
*  Yeah, horseback.
*  Pretty high elevation.
*  I don't even know what the valley floor is going to be.
*  Maybe 12,000 feet, something like that.
*  Wow, that's the valley floor?
*  Yeah, 10, 12,000 feet, something like that.
*  Like pretty high up.
*  Where we were at was on the China border.
*  So it was pretty, like pretty big mountains.
*  And yeah, horses, they use these real small horses there.
*  Incredible horses, like very good horses.
*  But you're going on trails that are super sketchy.
*  I wouldn't want to walk on them.
*  You're taking a horse on them.
*  A lot of them we did in the dark.
*  It was pretty gnarly.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  It was like going back through some of that in the daylight.
*  It was a little uncomfortable.
*  Knowing what you went through at night.
*  And these guys do this all the time.
*  Yeah, there was one spot where they took like a, they must have brought, like, you know,
*  like just a barbed wire fence that has like a metal post.
*  So they took a metal post and they pounded it in into this, like, there's like a cliff
*  and then the trail, well the trail had just wiped out.
*  And so there's like a metal post that they'd somehow pounded in and then just put some
*  stuff on top of it.
*  And then the horse is backing up, like up against the wall and then scooting around
*  and then does a little side hop over it and then goes.
*  And we did that in the dark with no lights because we couldn't, I don't know, it was
*  a shit show.
*  But coming back looking, it's probably, I don't know, 1500 feet straight down.
*  Like in a thing where the horse is like just edging up against the wall.
*  It's pretty wild.
*  You did this in the dark?
*  Yeah, it was not.
*  You had no idea?
*  No idea.
*  Well, I knew you could tell it's steeper than shit because it's just like dark and you can
*  kind of see, but you can't, you don't really get the grandeur of what's going on in the
*  nighttime.
*  Kind of just hold on for dear life.
*  Why the fuck would you do that?
*  No saddles really.
*  No saddles.
*  There's like these blanket saddles.
*  There's like a saddle horn and mostly just a blanket and then stirrups with it.
*  So it's kind of a different setup.
*  Not like a western saddle though.
*  Fairly comfortable horses though.
*  But yeah, I didn't like that.
*  It was wild.
*  Why do they do it at night?
*  It was just a weird experience.
*  We left at night, I don't know what happened, but we got into camp.
*  We went to this, you go through all these checkpoints.
*  We got into camp.
*  We were planning on going out the next morning, but then some people came into camp and just
*  started, our guys and those guys started fighting.
*  And then it was a wild deal.
*  So they were like, we got to get out of here kind of deal.
*  They started fighting like fist fighting?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Just like, they had a lot of guys.
*  So a gang fight broke out on your hunting trip.
*  Yeah, but it seemed weird.
*  It was like, I don't know what was going on.
*  And then, so that goes down.
*  And we're just standing back, like what the hell is going on?
*  How does the fight end?
*  So the leader of their crew and our crew go into the house and then they have a sit down.
*  And then we, so then we're like, one of our guys, let's get out of here.
*  So we throw all our shit on the horses, like packs on there and everything.
*  So that's why we didn't have any lights, because we just threw everything on the horses.
*  And then it's like, let's just ride.
*  Okay, so we're getting set up.
*  And then it was like, before we left, the weirdest thing, I wish I had, I tried to like
*  download some translation stuff, so I just had no communication with them.
*  The weirdest part was like, okay, everybody was good.
*  And so we're loading up now, everything's cool.
*  We're all good.
*  And then they want to take a group picture.
*  What the hell is this group?
*  Is this like some proof of life picture?
*  You know, like what is going on here?
*  So we take a picture and everything seemed pretty normal.
*  And then, then we start writing off and the guy that we're with has an AK and then they
*  start fighting for the gun.
*  And at this point, I'm like, we got to get, we got to get out of here.
*  And so we just start writing and then they're like wrestling for the gun.
*  And then, and then he gets on his horse and we all just ride off into the sunset.
*  I was thinking we're so fucked.
*  You flew all the way over there.
*  You're in the mountains.
*  These guys are fighting over a gun.
*  Yeah.
*  And their gun safety is abysmal.
*  Like it was not, I was just wondering.
*  I've watched YouTube videos.
*  Yeah.
*  It's, dude, this guy, get this.
*  So we're driving and it's a long road trip and we're driving and we pull into this guy's
*  hometown and he gets a shotgun.
*  It's this old shotgun that's like pretty much duct taped together.
*  And we're driving, I guess he's like, Chucker across the road.
*  They look like Chucker to me.
*  I'm sure that's what they were.
*  And so he gets out and he's trying to shoot these birds.
*  This is like, all right, you know, a little bit of camp meat.
*  So he's trying to shoot these birds and doesn't get any birds, but he's now thinking that
*  the Chucker, or, you know, in case we see one, he's ready.
*  So he's got this double barrel shotgun that's loaded and he puts it in the car and he puts
*  it with a barrel up and it's facing toward my head.
*  And I'm like trying to lean out the side.
*  I'm not okay with this.
*  So I'm like, Hey, stop him.
*  And I'm like, this is not okay.
*  He can't have this gun facing me.
*  And so instead of like unloading the gun or doing whatever, he just leans over and puts
*  it on his shoulder like this.
*  That's his gun safety.
*  And I'm like, no, I get out of the car and like, no, we're going to unload it.
*  And we aren't going to go like this.
*  I take it out.
*  I unload it.
*  I put the barrel down, like open it up.
*  I'm like, here you go.
*  I don't care what you do, but I'm not having a loaded gun in the vehicle or a loaded gun
*  point toward me.
*  Like the thought of it, like his shoulders just going to protect the shotgun from blowing
*  my head off.
*  Well, not only that, what if his shoulder gets blown off and he dies, you have to figure
*  out how to get back.
*  Yeah, no, it's just everything's bad.
*  Your ears are blown out because you can't hear anything.
*  It was just not like it was bad.
*  It was wild.
*  I don't know.
*  Did you know what the fight was over?
*  What?
*  Why they got a gang fight?
*  Yeah, the well, from one of the guys like it sounded like it's just like kind of tripe
*  and I don't even know if tribal is the right word, but it's like very like these guys wanted
*  that territory, you know, so they were like gunning for that territory.
*  They were hunting.
*  Yeah, I guess or whatever.
*  They wanted to be the people that take the people.
*  Oh, boy.
*  So it's like, oh, boy.
*  Yeah.
*  It's probably a lot of money in that.
*  Yeah, I would imagine.
*  Yeah, the guy that was like, I was like, what's going on?
*  He's like, no, no, I'm the I'm the big like in some he spoke a little.
*  It's hard to understand, but he in the gist of it was like, I'm the big boss and they're
*  gunning for me like they want what I have in a way.
*  The guiding business.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  So so you eventually get free.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, yeah, there's a we just rode up and then we did our thing and then went on went
*  hunting and came back and everything, you know, and when you came back, everything had
*  been OK.
*  There's no no, there was nobody there, but like the big boss was with us now.
*  So I don't know what happened after that.
*  Was that the sketchiest hunt you ever went on?
*  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
*  That sounds so dangerous.
*  Because if they start shooting those guys, they're going to shoot you too.
*  Yeah.
*  That's going to leave you.
*  Yeah.
*  And I don't know.
*  I think like in that it made sense.
*  It didn't make sense.
*  But what they were I felt like I didn't necessarily think that we were in danger, but I thought
*  it was like a weird situation because you could tell like they wanted something.
*  But I don't necessarily know if they wanted something from us.
*  They wanted something from the other people.
*  Oh, you know, if that makes sense.
*  Cut of the action or something.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Sure.
*  Well, I guess there's probably not a lot of work up there.
*  No.
*  You know, when you're guiding hunters, especially the kind of hunters that are willing to do
*  that have some money.
*  Yeah.
*  Because it's a big deal to get out there like Marco Polo sheep hunting is very hard to.
*  Yeah.
*  It's hard to do.
*  I used to watch what's that guy's name?
*  Tom Miranda.
*  Miranda.
*  Yeah.
*  I used to watch his that guy's another one.
*  He was always like in the middle and one fucking weird mountain range camped up in this yurt
*  with like 10 other people and they're eating bread.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You're out there.
*  There's no there's no backup plan there.
*  And everything he was doing was bow hunting, too.
*  And he had his show was weird, too, because it was all about acquiring all what is it?
*  The big whatever.
*  Like, yeah, when you're trying to the bow hunting thing, when you get.
*  Yeah, the Grand Slams where you get like every single mammal on Earth with a bow.
*  Yeah.
*  Like like they do the Africa, like there's the dangerous ones.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  There's the the the the regular Grand Slam, like all the African continent, big animals.
*  Yeah.
*  All the stuff.
*  It's a weird thing.
*  It's like almost like you're collecting baseball cards now.
*  Right.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, just different places.
*  I like going different places just for that experience of the hunting culture.
*  And it's kind of interesting.
*  You'll go somewhere and maybe even there, like maybe didn't speak their language or
*  whatever.
*  But when we were on the mountain, it's like he's a hunter.
*  I'm a hunter.
*  And we had this certain kind of connection that you just don't get doing other things.
*  Like it's it's pretty interesting where you go and it's like these are hunting cultures
*  and they've they've done this for thousands of years, just like we have.
*  And we do things similar.
*  We don't even necessarily need to communicate that well because we we both kind of are doing
*  the same thing in the same way.
*  And it's like, OK, there's this it's really cool to see.
*  And then that whole like bring the meat back and the campfire cooking and the whole experience.
*  It's not foreign, whereas like you're in this crazy place with all these other problems.
*  But the hunting portion of it is very familiar, you know?
*  And like I really like that.
*  And it's like even going to somewhere else, you go, OK, let's go to a place where it's
*  like, OK, yeah, I can do I need to go hunt a muskox to feed myself.
*  Well, the muskox meat was really good and I'm glad I did it.
*  I don't have to go to the Arctic to feed myself.
*  Right. But it was really cool to experience it with people that have lived there their
*  whole life and like have a certain view of it that is actually maybe even different.
*  But that's how they grew up doing it.
*  And to see to see that is just like a really I don't know.
*  I like that portion of it.
*  So that's why I like to go different places and just see how they do things in different
*  places. And then there's that adventure element of going somewhere kind of untouched where
*  a lot of people don't go.
*  That there's something kind of exciting about that.
*  So do you try to plan like your year with like a certain amount of these wild adventure
*  places that you visit?
*  Yeah, I think so. Or if the opportunity comes up, it's more of just, oh, yeah, I'll take
*  advantage of an opportunity if it's given like, oh, I know this person here that we
*  can do this and OK, cool, I'll try that.
*  Or it doesn't matter whether it's New Zealand or Australia or North America.
*  Well, you were doing a lot of trips in New Zealand, right?
*  Yeah. Well, that's where I came from to get here.
*  Oh, really? Yeah.
*  How often are you there every year?
*  I just I made a pretty short trip out of it this year, but just went over, hunted some
*  fallow deer and saw some friends and it was a good time.
*  But like what's a short trip for you?
*  That was only like a week.
*  Oh, that is a short trip.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  I mean, because I used to go over there for three months.
*  Really? Yeah.
*  Yeah. Wow.
*  Yeah. So it's a lot shorter trip.
*  That place seems amazing.
*  And what a crazy thing that they did where they just reintroduced, not reintroduced, but
*  introduced all these European animals to the landscape.
*  Yeah. Then they flourished like they do really well.
*  There's no predators. So there's hunting and then there's essentially government
*  culling, trapping, poisoning wild what they have to do to maintain the populations.
*  Just to keep it at a reasonable, manageable number.
*  Yeah. And that's what that's what happens.
*  And there's no predators on the landscape.
*  Populations explode.
*  Well, Remy, you live a very interesting life, my friend.
*  Well, thanks. You really do.
*  I always enjoy talking to you and I enjoy your podcast to live wild.
*  Great podcast. Yeah, thank you.
*  It's if you're into hunting related podcasts, it's a very good one.
*  Great tips. I appreciate it.
*  Really fun. And I'm glad you did it.
*  Yeah, thank you.
*  And I really hope this works.
*  I hope that ways. Well, if anything can help, I bet that will.
*  I really hope it will.
*  I have a lot of faith in it.
*  It's it's funny because they said it would be swollen and it's like actually feels better than when I went in.
*  Really? Already.
*  I don't know if it's just like probably they shot me up with some was an IV bag, which probably made me feel pretty good after traveling.
*  Oh, yeah. They give you an IV bag of vitamins.
*  Yeah. Yeah, that's good.
*  All right, brother. Tell everybody your Instagram.
*  Is it just Remy Warren?
*  Yeah. Remy Warren on YouTube, Instagram, any kind of social media.
*  Remy. Have you ever talked about bringing Apex Predator back?
*  If somebody wants to, I'm down.
*  It was a great show. Yeah, I know.
*  I enjoyed it. It was fun.
*  It was a fun show. Yeah.
*  All right, dude. Well, thank you very much.
*  Appreciate your brother coming here.
*  Appreciate it. Bye, everybody.
