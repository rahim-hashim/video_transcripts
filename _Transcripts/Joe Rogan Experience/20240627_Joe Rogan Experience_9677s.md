**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38)
*  Joe Rogan Podcast, check it out! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=0.0s)]
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan Podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6.0s)]
*  Joe Rogan Podcast [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=10.0s)]
*  Oh, that was me. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=14.0s)]
*  I think my dog's cool. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=16.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=17.0s)]
*  I was like looking in the mirror. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=18.0s)]
*  Have you seen that before? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=19.0s)]
*  Did people get you one of those? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=21.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=23.0s)]
*  He's awesome. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=24.0s)]
*  He's awesome. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=25.0s)]
*  He's pretty edgy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=26.0s)]
*  It's amazing that he puts out a piece of art per day. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=27.0s)]
*  365 days a year. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=31.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=34.0s)]
*  I was following him on the X platform, FKA Twitter. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=35.0s)]
*  But it was something that was too jarring. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=37.0s)]
*  Too jarring, some of the images? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=39.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=41.0s)]
*  Well, cheers, sir. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=42.0s)]
*  Happy Halloween. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=43.0s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=44.0s)]
*  Thanks for doing this. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=45.0s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=46.0s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=47.0s)]
*  Thanks for rolling up in the Cybertruck, too. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=48.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=50.0s)]
*  I got a chance to look at it in the factory, but that was almost, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=51.0s)]
*  what was that, like a year and a half ago or so? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=53.0s)]
*  Was it? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=55.0s)]
*  It was a while ago. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=57.0s)]
*  Yeah, a year ago, I guess. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=58.0s)]
*  Yeah, at least a year. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=60.0s)]
*  At least a year. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=61.0s)]
*  And it's different in real life. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=62.0s)]
*  Like, you see it in person. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=64.0s)]
*  Like, these images are just, we were talking about it outside, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=66.0s)]
*  you just can't contextualize them. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=69.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=71.0s)]
*  It looks so odd that you have to see it in the flesh. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=72.0s)]
*  It looks like computer graphics in reality. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=75.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's the coolest looking fucking production card. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=78.0s)]
*  It's bulletproof, literally. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=81.0s)]
*  Literally. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=82.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=83.0s)]
*  One of the videos we're going to show is just going all, like, full Al Capone. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=84.0s)]
*  Just like, if Al Capone showed up and emptied an entire magazine of a Tommy gun [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=89.0s)]
*  into the side of the car, you'd be okay. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=93.0s)]
*  The only thing that's not bulletproof is the glass. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=95.0s)]
*  The glass is optionally bulletproof. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=97.0s)]
*  Oh, it is optional? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=99.0s)]
*  If you want it, you can make anything bulletproof if you want, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=100.0s)]
*  but the glass has to be very thick for it to be bulletproof. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=103.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=106.0s)]
*  So if you want to fix glass. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=107.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=108.0s)]
*  Then how do you order a drive-through? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=109.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=111.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a problem. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=112.0s)]
*  It's awkward. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=113.0s)]
*  You got to pull ahead and open the door and get out. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=114.0s)]
*  But it's okay, you can just duck. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=117.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can just duck. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=119.0s)]
*  Like, duck where? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=120.0s)]
*  How far away are you from full, like, delivering them to people? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=121.0s)]
*  Has anybody gotten them yet? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=125.0s)]
*  We plan to do our first deliveries next month. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=127.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=130.0s)]
*  So, we're going to have a little bit of a chat with you guys. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=131.0s)]
*  We plan to do our first deliveries next month. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=134.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=137.0s)]
*  So now it's just testing and fuck it around? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=138.0s)]
*  The hard part by far is manufacturing, not designing the car. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=142.0s)]
*  So, there's just not really a movie about that, but there should be. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=148.0s)]
*  So, in the sort of the, you know, movies will always be about the sort of inventor who invented the car, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=154.0s)]
*  and then the job is done. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=162.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=164.0s)]
*  That's invented the object, now the job is done. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=165.0s)]
*  This is not true. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=167.0s)]
*  That's the easy part. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=168.0s)]
*  The hard part is manufacturing by far. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=169.0s)]
*  Why is it so much harder than making an individual model? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=172.0s)]
*  Well, in order to make it affordable, you have to make it at volume. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=175.0s)]
*  So, you've got to make everything at high rate consistently. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=191.0s)]
*  If you tour the production line, you'd have a sense for it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=199.0s)]
*  You've got to have all of the casting machines, all of the stamping machines, as the case may be, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=204.0s)]
*  the glass machines, the wheels, the tires, everything required from the motor, the battery cells, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=210.0s)]
*  all of the constituents of the battery cells, all of the silicon that goes in, all of the chips. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=217.0s)]
*  It is, the manufacturing is somewhere between 100 and 1,000 times harder than making a prototype. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=224.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=230.0s)]
*  And then if you want to say, like, you want to get from, once you reach volume manufacturing, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=231.0s)]
*  which is insanely difficult, then you want to make the car affordable, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=237.0s)]
*  it's harder to, say, reduce the cost of the car by 20% than it is to get to volume production in the first place. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=242.0s)]
*  So, I really cannot emphasize enough how hard production is relative to design. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=251.0s)]
*  I'm not saying that design is trivial because you have to have taste and you have to know what to make. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=259.0s)]
*  If you don't have a taste and judgment, then your prototype will be bad. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=266.0s)]
*  But it is, it is trivial, really, to churn out prototypes, and it is extremely difficult to build a factory. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=272.0s)]
*  And how much more difficult is it to make this, considering the body's made out of steel? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=280.0s)]
*  It's very difficult. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=285.0s)]
*  The difficulty of manufacturing is proportionate to the amount of new technology that you have in a car [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=288.0s)]
*  or in the product, and in this case, there's a lot of new technology. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=293.0s)]
*  The production line will move as fast as the slowest and least lucky and most foolish part of the entire production line. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=297.0s)]
*  And you could say, to first approximation, there are 10,000 things that have to go right, at least, for production to work. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=306.0s)]
*  So, if you have 9,999 things that are working and one that isn't, that sets the production rate. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=314.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=321.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=323.0s)]
*  That's quite far of the hard work. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=324.0s)]
*  In fact, the amazing thing about automobiles was not so much the invention of the automobile, but the invention of the factory, the mass manufacturing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=325.0s)]
*  And for that, Henry Ford deserves a tremendous amount of credit. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=337.0s)]
*  He was a next level genius. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=342.0s)]
*  In fact, Ford is really responsible for the entire mass manufacturing industry because he actually founded Cadillac, which was the heart of General Motors, then got kicked out and then started Ford. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=344.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=355.0s)]
*  Yeah, and everyone just copied him. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=356.0s)]
*  Do you know he made one of his first cars out of hemp? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=357.0s)]
*  Well. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=360.0s)]
*  He used hemp fiber for the panels. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=363.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=365.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a fascinating video of him banging on it with a hammer. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=366.0s)]
*  Because hemp is bizarrely durable when it's compressed and when they take the fibers, and I don't know what kind of epoxy they use or something to put it all together. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=370.0s)]
*  But what it makes with the actual physical form of it is insanely light. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=379.0s)]
*  Like fiberglass light, but very, very durable. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=384.0s)]
*  See, if you find the video, it's kind of crazy. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=387.0s)]
*  Henry Ford is banging on what was the hood of it with a hammer. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=389.0s)]
*  There it is. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=394.0s)]
*  So this was like, look at that. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=395.0s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=400.0s)]
*  That is well. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=401.0s)]
*  I don't know why they stopped making them out of that. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=404.0s)]
*  That was from 1941. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=407.0s)]
*  How much does the Cybertruck weigh? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=410.0s)]
*  It depends on configuration, but it's about 7,000 pounds. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=413.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=417.0s)]
*  There's different versions, but 6,000, 7,000 pounds. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=418.0s)]
*  It's similar to, it's a heavy truck. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=421.0s)]
*  Like a Ford F-250 or something like that. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=425.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=427.0s)]
*  And because of all of the metal and the weight and everything like that, but with the engines that you have, it's still, the 0-60 is pretty bizarre, right? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=428.0s)]
*  It's like 3.5 or something like that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=440.0s)]
*  We're aiming to get the 0-60 below three seconds. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=443.0s)]
*  Below three? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=445.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=446.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=447.0s)]
*  For the beast mode version. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=448.0s)]
*  So we've got a beast mode version. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=451.0s)]
*  Well, I don't want to give it all away right now, but there are three demonstrations. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=458.0s)]
*  One of them people are aware of, which is emptying a Tommy gun into the side of the car. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=465.0s)]
*  A shotgun, 45 and a 9mm, and no penetrations. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=473.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=477.0s)]
*  And that comes that way from the factory. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=478.0s)]
*  Can I try it with an arrow? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=481.0s)]
*  Yeah, it'll be fine. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=482.0s)]
*  You think so? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=483.0s)]
*  I bet I can get in there. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=484.0s)]
*  A crossbow might? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=486.0s)]
*  I have a 90 pound compound bow that shoots 520 grain arrows at 300 feet per second with a razor sharp broad head. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=488.0s)]
*  I'm going to try it right now if you want. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=501.0s)]
*  I wish I had it with me. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=502.0s)]
*  Is it at your house or something? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=503.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=504.0s)]
*  Should we send someone to go get it? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=505.0s)]
*  No. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=506.0s)]
*  We could do the demo tonight. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=507.0s)]
*  That would be interesting. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=508.0s)]
*  Maybe I'll drive back with an arrow sticking out of my car. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=509.0s)]
*  I bet I can get in there. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=511.0s)]
*  Okay, I'll bet you can't. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=512.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=513.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'll bet you don't. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=514.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=515.0s)]
*  I think if you have a crossbow that's with enough force, you might get it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=516.0s)]
*  The thing about a crossbow is the bolt, even though it's very fast, it's not going to be nearly as heavy. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=523.0s)]
*  You won't get it. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=528.0s)]
*  You can make a heavy crossbow bolt. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=529.0s)]
*  You could. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=530.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=531.0s)]
*  But generally, crossbow bolts are considerably lighter. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=532.0s)]
*  They're much smaller. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=535.0s)]
*  They're much faster. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=536.0s)]
*  They're moving at like 400, 500 feet per second. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=538.0s)]
*  Easy. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=541.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=542.0s)]
*  The thing that matters is kind of the energy per unit area. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=543.0s)]
*  So interesting. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=549.0s)]
*  Like a 9-mil or a 45, which is basically sort of a 10-mil. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=553.0s)]
*  The 45 is, they're roughly the same, but the 45 actually is slightly worse penetration than a 9-mil. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=558.0s)]
*  You know what I just realized? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=564.0s)]
*  I do have some broadheads. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=565.0s)]
*  I do have some broadheads, and I have a less powerful bow, but I have an 80-pound bow back there. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=567.0s)]
*  Go for it. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=572.0s)]
*  I think we should do it. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=573.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=574.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=575.0s)]
*  When you want to do it right now, you want to do it right now. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=576.0s)]
*  I think we should do it. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=577.0s)]
*  I think we should do it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=578.0s)]
*  I think we should do it. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=579.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=580.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=581.0s)]
*  When you want to do it right now? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=582.0s)]
*  Yeah, we can do it right now. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=583.0s)]
*  Okay, let's do it right now. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=584.0s)]
*  Let's do it right now. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=585.0s)]
*  Okay, let's do it. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=586.0s)]
*  Sick. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=587.0s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=588.0s)]
*  This is going to be funny. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=589.0s)]
*  I'm just like, why does he have an arrow sticking out of his car? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=590.0s)]
*  This show is sponsored by BetterHelp. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=593.0s)]
*  It's a really healthy, good thing to talk about what you're going through with people. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=595.0s)]
*  The good and the bad. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=599.0s)]
*  Don't keep it all bottled up. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=601.0s)]
*  Sometimes that can be friends or family, but it also helps to talk to pros. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=603.0s)]
*  That's where BetterHelp comes in. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=608.0s)]

*  I mean, just be aware of ricochets. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=664.0s)]
*  I'm like... [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=667.0s)]
*  You might want to do it with a slight angle. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=671.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=679.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=685.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=687.0s)]
*  There it is. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=688.0s)]
*  There it is. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=690.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=695.0s)]
*  Blew the arrow apart. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=696.0s)]
*  Flatten the tip of the arrow. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=702.0s)]
*  Look at the tip of the broad end. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=704.0s)]
*  That's impressive. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=707.0s)]
*  Hey, cutie. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=710.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=712.0s)]
*  Well, now we know. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=714.0s)]
*  So we just shot an arrow into it and it barely scratched it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=716.0s)]
*  Barely scratched it. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=720.0s)]
*  It was probably moving 275 feet a second. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=722.0s)]
*  That was a 525 grain-ish arrow with... [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=725.0s)]
*  Yeah, even more than that because it had the 125 grain head so that was 545 grains. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=730.0s)]
*  That's impressive. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=736.0s)]
*  Very impressive. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=738.0s)]
*  It just destroyed the broad head. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=740.0s)]
*  The broad head flattened at the tip and then the arrow blew apart. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=742.0s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=745.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=747.0s)]
*  We have a cool video we'll show at the handover event next month which is emptying an entire magazine of Atomic Gun. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=749.0s)]
*  Which is on the order of 50 rounds. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=757.0s)]
*  You're just going full Al Capone. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=760.0s)]
*  Like out on the side of the car. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=762.0s)]
*  Shotgun 9mm 45. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=764.0s)]
*  And you built it like this just for fun? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=766.0s)]
*  Because it's cooler? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=768.0s)]
*  Because you can? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=770.0s)]
*  You know, trucks are supposed to be tough, right? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=773.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=776.0s)]
*  So, is your truck bulletproof? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=777.0s)]
*  No, mine is definitely not. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=779.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=781.0s)]
*  And if I shot mine with my bow it would go right through it. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=782.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=784.0s)]
*  So, if you shoot any normal car, unlike in the movies where people hide behind car doors, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=785.0s)]
*  a car door is basically very thin, mild steel. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=790.0s)]
*  So, if you shoot a gun through a regular truck, it'll go through both doors. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=794.0s)]
*  So, you can't hide behind a car door like they do in the movies. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=801.0s)]
*  Way back in the day, dating myself, but the A-Team where they'd be like bullets flying everywhere and they'd be hiding behind the car door. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=808.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=815.0s)]
*  That doesn't work. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=816.0s)]
*  But it does in a cyber truck. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=818.0s)]
*  Is this best in apocalyptic technology? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=820.0s)]
*  Yeah, well it's an amazing car to have in the apocalypse. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=824.0s)]
*  Doesn't it also, does it still do this thing where the ride height raises? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=828.0s)]
*  And there's also no regular drivetrain, so there's no axles that are the impediment to going over rocks and things like that? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=833.0s)]
*  Yeah, normally in other vehicles, in gasoline or diesel vehicles, you've got the differential which hangs down low between the rear wheels. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=841.0s)]
*  So, you're like, look under a truck, there's almost always a differential there that's hanging down pretty low. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=851.0s)]
*  So, if you hit the diff on a rock, you'll break it. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=856.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=859.0s)]
*  There's no, the bottom of the cyber truck is completely flat and has the best clear height of any vehicle. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=860.0s)]
*  How far away are we, if it's ever going to happen at all, from having a vehicle that can operate entirely on solar? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=867.0s)]
*  Well, you've got a surface area thing. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=875.0s)]
*  So, it's about a kilowatt per square meter, normal to the sun, roughly. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=879.0s)]
*  So, you just, it really depends on what kind of mileage. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=887.0s)]
*  You can't, you don't have enough surface area to keep the car going just from the car surface area. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=890.0s)]
*  But if you had like something that folded out, you could make it self-sustaining. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=896.0s)]
*  Something that folded out so like you could park it and then leave it on? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=902.0s)]
*  Yeah, you'd have to like unfold like the Starling satellites do where you unfold the solar panels. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=906.0s)]
*  You know, you just need more surface area. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=912.0s)]
*  Is there any potential for an advancement in technology that would make a smaller area much better at conducting sun, nothing? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=915.0s)]
*  No, it's a kilowatt per square meter. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=925.0s)]
*  That's what you're going to get when the sun, if you're normal to the sun, so at 90 degrees to the sun. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=928.0s)]
*  And there's nothing that could accelerate that or no? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=933.0s)]
*  That's just literally the solar energy. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=935.0s)]
*  That's just it. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=937.0s)]
*  Yeah, so then you multiply your efficiency by that. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=938.0s)]
*  So, if your commercial panels like maybe 25% efficient, if they're a good one, so you get like 250 watts per square meter. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=940.0s)]
*  There was one car, what was it, like a Fisker that was using a solar panel that claimed that it was operating like the electronics, like it could start the radio. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=949.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you can definitely, you just don't have enough surface area for it. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=959.0s)]
*  But like, you can like certainly you could run a house with solar, with the solar roof, the Tesla solar roof, you can run a house. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=967.0s)]
*  But it's never going to get to a point where you can just have a car that's made out of solar panels that it could drive around. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=979.0s)]
*  It could never be that efficient. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=985.0s)]
*  Correct. So you don't have enough surface area. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=987.0s)]
*  What research or what breakthroughs have been made in terms of battery technology? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=990.0s)]
*  Like how far away are we from having batteries that are far more efficient and last far longer? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=996.0s)]
*  I know there was some talk of like sodium-based batteries. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1002.0s)]
*  Battery range is not a problem at this point. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1008.0s)]
*  I mean, the Model S will go 400 miles, Model 3, Model Y will do over 300 miles. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1011.0s)]
*  So, you know, that's more than most people need. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1018.0s)]
*  Right, but are we, I mean, how far away are we from making batteries that are more efficient? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1024.0s)]
*  Like we obviously have at least... [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1030.0s)]
*  This is not really a constraint. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1032.0s)]
*  The point at which you've got a car that can do, let's say, even at highway speeds, 250 miles, then, or let's say 240 miles at 80 miles an hour. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1035.0s)]
*  Now you're driving for three hours straight. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1048.0s)]
*  And so if you start a trip at, say, 9 a.m., by noon you want to stop for lunch, go to the restroom, grab a coffee. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1052.0s)]
*  By the time you come back, your car is charged. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1058.0s)]
*  How long does it take to fully charge? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1060.0s)]
*  Yeah, like half an hour. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1064.0s)]
*  Well, you don't want to... [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1067.0s)]
*  People will get used to it because it's a little different. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1069.0s)]
*  You know, like for a gasoline car, you'd want to fill it up. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1073.0s)]
*  For an electric car, you'd want to actually go very close to zero. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1077.0s)]
*  And the car can calculate how much range it has with precision. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1082.0s)]
*  So if you, say, enter a road trip in a Tesla, it'll calculate all of the supercharges along the way. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1085.0s)]
*  Where you stop, how much you should charge, and just let the computer do its thing and it'll work well. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1092.0s)]
*  So you actually want to charge to about 80% and then run it down all the way to 10%, or less. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1098.0s)]
*  Do you want to do that on everyday use as well or just with long trips? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1106.0s)]
*  No, just long trips. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1109.0s)]
*  If you're trying to minimize the amount of time you stop when charging. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1112.0s)]
*  So let's say you want to stop for 20, 30 minutes. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1117.0s)]
*  Then you really... [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1120.0s)]
*  It's a little counterintuitive because for a gasoline car, you would fill it up. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1124.0s)]
*  For a battery, the charge state tapers off as you get above 80%. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1129.0s)]
*  You can think of it like the... [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1134.0s)]
*  I think the right analogy here is cars in a parking lot. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1137.0s)]
*  So the lithium ions are trying to find a parking space. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1141.0s)]
*  As they move across from one side of the battery to the other side, from cathode to anode. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1145.0s)]
*  There's sort of just these ions that are just bouncing around looking for a parking space. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1152.0s)]
*  So when the parking lot is empty, they can zip right in there and find a spot. It's easy. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1156.0s)]
*  As the parking lot gets full, just like trying to find a parking space at a mall, you have to hunt around for a spot. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1163.0s)]
*  That's basically what's going on. The ions are looking for a parking spot. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1168.0s)]
*  So as the battery gets closer to full, it's harder and harder to find a spot. They have to bounce around more. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1174.0s)]
*  So it takes longer to get from 80 to 100. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1181.0s)]
*  Correct. Getting from 80 to 100, it takes about as much time as getting from 0 to 80. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1184.0s)]
*  Just think of the ions that go to find a parking spot. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1190.0s)]
*  Just like if you're in a mall and it's busy, then it takes longer to find a parking spot than if it's empty. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1194.0s)]
*  So essentially you're satisfied with the technologies available right now in terms of the amount of mileage that you get out of it and things along those lines? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1201.0s)]
*  Yeah, range is not an issue. Cost is more of an issue. So just to make the car affordable, a long-range car needs to be affordable. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1210.0s)]
*  When you fully roll out, how many of those things, how many Cybertrucks can you guys make a month? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1219.0s)]
*  We're aiming to make about 200,000 a year at volume production. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1226.0s)]
*  Wow! [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1235.0s)]
*  Maybe a little more. But I just can't emphasize enough that manufacturing is much, much harder than the initial design. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1236.0s)]
*  You know, you can... The Cybertruck was easy to design. I'm not trying to trivialize design. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1244.0s)]
*  It's just what I'm trying to do is to emphasize the difficulty of manufacturing, which is not understood by the public because there's no movie about it. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1251.0s)]
*  So there's lots of movies about the sort of wild inventory in the garage. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1261.0s)]
*  But I'm not aware of any movie about manufacturing. Have you ever heard of a movie about manufacturing? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1268.0s)]
*  I can't remember any, Jamie. Any movie about manufacturing? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1276.0s)]
*  There's one coming to my brain, but I don't think that's what it's even about. So I have no idea. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1279.0s)]
*  What is that? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1282.0s)]
*  Michael Keaton was making some cars in somewhere. I was going to look it up on the internet. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1283.0s)]
*  I mean, it's Tommy Boy. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1287.0s)]
*  Yes, Tommy Boy is the only one. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1289.0s)]
*  That's about as good of a movie. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1291.0s)]
*  It's a great movie. That might be the only one. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1292.0s)]
*  That's interesting that it's such an immense part of American culture and also the decline of some American cities. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1296.0s)]
*  I mean, it's famously documented in Roger and Me, a great documentary where he just talks about how Flint got destroyed when they pulled out the car manufacturing. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1303.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's a reason why generally politicians really try very hard to get a factory in their area is because it's a massive generator of jobs. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1314.0s)]
*  And for every factory job, there's like five, roughly five support jobs. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1325.0s)]
*  You know, so it's like teachers, electricians, plumbers, lawyers, accountants, restaurants. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1330.0s)]
*  So manufacturing is kind of like a nucleus from which many jobs spring. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1339.0s)]
*  That's why it's generally, you know, governors and prime ministers and presidents will try so hard to get a factory in their country or region. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1346.0s)]
*  When you decided to build the Gigafactory and when you decided, well, just even when you decided to get involved with Tesla, did you have any idea of how difficult this would be? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1356.0s)]
*  Did you have a preconceived notion? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1366.0s)]
*  I thought it would be very difficult. I thought our probability of success was less than 10 percent. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1368.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, it would be foolish to think anything else other than that. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1372.0s)]
*  I mean, the even at this point, the only car companies that have not gone bankrupt are Ford and Tesla, American car companies. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1377.0s)]
*  General Motors went bankrupt and Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1386.0s)]
*  There's some chance they'll go bankrupt again. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1390.0s)]
*  Ford and Tesla barely made it. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1394.0s)]
*  It was incredibly difficult to keep Tesla alive when General Motors and Chrysler were going bankrupt. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1397.0s)]
*  So because manufacturing is the actual hard thing, not by far the hard thing. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1403.0s)]
*  I just can't emphasize that enough and I hope somebody makes a movie about that. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1411.0s)]
*  Maybe they should make a movie about Tesla. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1416.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1418.0s)]
*  Why not? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1419.0s)]
*  Perfect. Who would you want to play you? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1420.0s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1423.0s)]
*  How about David Spade? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1424.0s)]
*  Anyone. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1425.0s)]
*  No, I'm kidding. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1426.0s)]
*  I don't care if anyone plays me. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1427.0s)]
*  I just went back to Tommy Boy. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1429.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know he rocks. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1432.0s)]
*  So, you know, Jim Foley is the CEO of Ford and he's Chris Foley's cousin. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1435.0s)]
*  No way. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1441.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1442.0s)]
*  Wow. That's crazy. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1443.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1445.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1446.0s)]
*  And they look, I mean, they look related. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1447.0s)]
*  Yeah, there should be a movie. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1450.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1453.0s)]
*  I just, you got to get someone good that doesn't fuck it up. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1454.0s)]
*  Someone doesn't. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1457.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, the thing is that writers are just disconnected from manufacturing. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1458.0s)]
*  They just never see it. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1463.0s)]
*  So, and I guess you have to try to create some narrative awk. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1465.0s)]
*  I mean, there are some shows like How It's Made type of thing. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1472.0s)]
*  But they're pretty niche. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1477.0s)]
*  But I know of some broken record here, but I can't emphasize enough that it is insanely [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1479.0s)]
*  difficult to manufacture. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1485.0s)]
*  Makes sense. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1488.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1489.0s)]
*  Well, it particularly makes sense when something that novel, something is, but ultimately cool [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1490.0s)]
*  as fuck. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1497.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1498.0s)]
*  What has it been like for you to write a movie that's so different from the other movies? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1499.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1504.0s)]
*  What has it been like? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1505.0s)]
*  You've owned X for a year now. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1507.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1509.0s)]
*  Do you ever wake up in the middle of the night and have a dream that you didn't do it? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1511.0s)]
*  And your life is infinitely easier? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1517.0s)]
*  Well, it's certainly a recipe for trouble, I suppose, or contention. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1519.0s)]
*  What was it ultimately that led you to make the decision to do it? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1528.0s)]
*  I mean, this is going to sound somewhat melodramatic, but I was worried about that it was having [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1538.0s)]
*  a corrosive effect on civilization, that it was just having a bad impact. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1544.0s)]
*  And I think part of it is that it's where it was located, which is downtown San Francisco. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1552.0s)]
*  And while I think San Francisco is a beautiful city, and which should really fight hard to [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1563.0s)]
*  kind of right the ship of San Francisco, if you've walked around downtown San Francisco, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1567.0s)]
*  right near the ex-FKA Twitter headquarters, it's a zombie apocalypse. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1574.0s)]
*  I mean, it's rough. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1579.0s)]
*  Have you ever been in that area? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1580.0s)]
*  Not lately. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1581.0s)]
*  No, I've heard. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1582.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1583.0s)]
*  I've heard it's crazy. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1584.0s)]
*  I've heard you really can't believe it until you actually go there. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1585.0s)]
*  You can't believe it until you go there. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1588.0s)]
*  So now you have to say, well, what philosophy led to that outcome? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1590.0s)]
*  And that philosophy was being piped to Earth. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1594.0s)]
*  So, you know, a philosophy that would be ordinarily quite niche and geographically constrained, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1598.0s)]
*  so that the sort of the fallout area would be limited. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1605.0s)]
*  But the philosophy was effectively given an information weapon, an information technology [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1610.0s)]
*  weapon, to propagate what is essentially a mind virus to the rest of Earth. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1620.0s)]
*  And the outcome of that mind virus is very clear if you walk around the streets of downtown [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1625.0s)]
*  San Francisco. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1630.0s)]
*  It is the end of civilization. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1631.0s)]
*  And it's not just propagating the mind virus, but suppressing any opposing viewpoints. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1633.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1639.0s)]
*  Well, in order for the virus to propagate, it must suppress opposing viewpoints. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1640.0s)]
*  So. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1644.0s)]
*  Because it doesn't stand up to scrutiny. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1645.0s)]
*  Correct. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1648.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1649.0s)]
*  I mean, you've felt the virus. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1650.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1653.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1654.0s)]
*  People have tried to cancel you so many times. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1655.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's fascinating. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1657.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1658.0s)]
*  I don't think you're melodramatic at all. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1659.0s)]
*  I think it's a, I mean, I don't want to be melodramatic, but it's almost like a death [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1662.0s)]
*  cult. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1668.0s)]
*  It's a death cult. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1669.0s)]
*  No, no, that is exactly right. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1670.0s)]
*  It's essentially the extinctionists. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1672.0s)]
*  Like, it's in the limit. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1676.0s)]
*  It is that they're propagating the extinction of humanity and civilization. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1678.0s)]
*  And there's some people who are, like most of the time it's implicit. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1685.0s)]
*  They don't, but sometimes it's explicit. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1689.0s)]
*  Like there was a guy on the front page of the New York Times who literally has the thing [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1692.0s)]
*  called the extinctionist movement. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1696.0s)]
*  And he was quoted on the front page of the New York Times as saying, there are 8 billion [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1697.0s)]
*  people in the world, but it would be better if there were none. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1701.0s)]
*  And I'm like, well, buddy, you can start with yourself. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1704.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1707.0s)]
*  Does he have friends? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1708.0s)]
*  That's what always fascinates me. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1710.0s)]
*  Well, here he is. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1712.0s)]
*  That guy. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1713.0s)]
*  He looks like he's not long for this earth. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1714.0s)]
*  I mean, he doesn't, he's not young. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1716.0s)]
*  Voluntary human extinction movement. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1718.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1720.0s)]
*  Spend, I'd like to party with that dude. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1721.0s)]
*  I would just like to like. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1724.0s)]
*  That's an explicit version of the death cult. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1725.0s)]
*  Yeah, maybe you live long and die out. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1729.0s)]
*  I mean, it's not, extinction is a word he uses. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1731.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1736.0s)]
*  No, I mean, it's not a, it's literally a self-description. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1737.0s)]
*  Did they cover him glowingly? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1740.0s)]
*  That death cult was in charge of social media. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1742.0s)]
*  And still largely is at Google and Facebook, by the way. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1745.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1749.0s)]
*  So I'm like, I'm not in favor of human extinction. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1750.0s)]
*  They are. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1754.0s)]
*  And they can go to hell. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1755.0s)]
*  Well, that guy is. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1757.0s)]
*  Yeah, he can go to hell. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1759.0s)]
*  That guy seems silly. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1760.0s)]
*  I would like to hang out with him, though. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1761.0s)]
*  I would like to find out what makes him tick. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1763.0s)]

*  I know there's a whole lot of people changing jobs right now and a whole lot of places hiring, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1882.0s)]
*  which means if it's your job to hire, you are probably slammed. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1887.0s)]
*  I see you. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1892.0s)]

*  It's ZipRecruiter. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1901.0s)]

*  I'm in favor of, I'm pro-environment, but in the limit, if you take environmentalism to an extreme, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1969.0s)]
*  you start to view humanity as a plague on the surface of the earth, like a mold or something. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1977.0s)]
*  But this is actually false. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1984.0s)]
*  The earth could take probably ten times the current civilization. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1989.0s)]
*  You could 10x the population without destroying the rainforest. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1993.0s)]
*  So the environmental movement, and I'm an environmentalist, has gone too far. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=1998.0s)]
*  They've gone way too far. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2004.0s)]
*  If you start thinking that humans are bad, then the natural conclusion is humans should die out. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2007.0s)]
*  I'm headed to an AI safety, international sort of AI safety conference, later tonight leaving in about three hours. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2014.0s)]
*  And I'm going to meet with the British Prime Minister and a number of other people. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2022.0s)]
*  So you have to say, like, how could AI go wrong? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2029.0s)]
*  Well, if AI gets programmed by the extinctionists, its utility function will be the extinction of humanity. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2032.0s)]
*  Yeah, clearly. Yeah. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2043.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, particularly if... [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2045.0s)]
*  They won't even think it's bad, like that guy. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2047.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2049.0s)]
*  If you let AI... [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2051.0s)]
*  It's messed up. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2052.0s)]
*  There's a lot of decisions that AI would make that would be very similar to eugenics. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2053.0s)]
*  I mean, there would be some radical changes in what people are allowed to and not allowed to do that allow them to survive [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2058.0s)]
*  that may be detrimental in terms of pollution and things like that, but it may be the only solution they have in their area. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2065.0s)]
*  Maybe AI would come up with some sort of a different structure in terms of how they get power and resources, but... [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2072.0s)]
*  There's no shortage of power. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2078.0s)]
*  Like we talked about solar power for cars, the issue is that cars just have a very low service area. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2080.0s)]
*  But you could actually power the entire United States with 100 miles by 100 miles of solar. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2086.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2093.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2094.0s)]
*  So you could just pick some dead spot that you fly over... [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2095.0s)]
*  Which they owe plenty. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2098.0s)]
*  And you could just hover that sucker up with solar panels and charge the whole country. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2099.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2102.0s)]
*  24-7. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2103.0s)]
*  You need batteries, but yes. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2104.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2105.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2106.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's not hard. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2108.0s)]
*  I mean, it's very feasible. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2109.0s)]
*  In fact, the sun is converting over 4 million tons of mass to energy every second. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2111.0s)]
*  And it's no maintenance. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2118.0s)]
*  That thing just works. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2120.0s)]
*  We have a giant fusion reactor in the sky that is the sun. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2121.0s)]
*  In fact, people are like, someone's like, what about radiation? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2127.0s)]
*  I'm like, the sun is literally a nuclear reactor in the sky. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2130.0s)]
*  Are you scared to go in daylight? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2134.0s)]
*  Rocks of radiation. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2137.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2139.0s)]
*  The radiation risk is greatly overestimated. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2140.0s)]
*  I always wonder why radiation is always bad in real life, but always awesome in comic books. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2144.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2151.0s)]
*  You get bitten by a radioactive spider and suddenly you have spider abilities. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2153.0s)]
*  Get hit with gamma rays. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2156.0s)]
*  You've come to the Hulk. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2157.0s)]
*  What if you were a radioactive cockroach? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2158.0s)]
*  You'd be like the cockroach man. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2159.0s)]
*  Yeah, you could be one of the X-Men. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2160.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2163.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2164.0s)]
*  I think the problem is most people just don't understand what radiation is. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2165.0s)]
*  And so it just sounds like a mysterious, invisible death ray. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2170.0s)]
*  Well, it's almost like drugs. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2174.0s)]
*  We think of it, we put a blanket over it. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2176.0s)]
*  It's all one thing. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2178.0s)]
*  Radiation is Chernobyl. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2180.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2182.0s)]
*  I mean, the thing is you can actually tour Chernobyl right now. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2183.0s)]
*  Can you really? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2186.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2187.0s)]
*  You can actually go to where the meltdown is? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2188.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, this is a war zone. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2190.0s)]
*  Close enough? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2191.0s)]
*  But apart from that, the issue is more getting shot than it is ... you don't have a radiation risk. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2192.0s)]
*  I mean, the problem is I think when people don't understand what radiation is, they can't see it, they can't feel it. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2199.0s)]
*  They think, well, I could just die at any moment from a magic death ray. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2205.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2208.0s)]
*  I've had people say like, oh, the radiation from their phone is going to hurt them or they're scared of the microwave. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2210.0s)]
*  I'm like, when you say radiation, do you mean particles or photons? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2214.0s)]
*  And if you mean photons, what wavelength? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2218.0s)]
*  And they're like, I don't know what you mean. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2221.0s)]
*  They don't know anything about that. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2223.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2224.0s)]
*  They're afraid of the term. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2225.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2227.0s)]
*  But it's because of Three Mile Island and Fukushima. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2228.0s)]
*  We've been told ... [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2230.0s)]
*  Yeah, but nobody died of radiation from Fukushima. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2231.0s)]
*  Not one person. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2233.0s)]
*  True. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2234.0s)]
*  In fact ... but I was asked by people in California. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2235.0s)]
*  Like when Fukushima happened, whether the radiation would get to California. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2238.0s)]
*  And I'm like, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2243.0s)]
*  And so actually to help support Japan, I flew to Fukushima and ate locally grown vegetables on TV. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2245.0s)]
*  And I'm still alive. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2252.0s)]
*  I have a friend, he's very smart, but he won't eat fish out of the Pacific because he's worried about the radiation from Fukushima. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2254.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's irrational. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2262.0s)]
*  There is no physics substance to that, I would say, at all. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2265.0s)]
*  Not even slightly. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2269.0s)]
*  I'm going to send him this clip. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2270.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2271.0s)]
*  Go back to the sushi place, bro. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2272.0s)]
*  Now, you should be ... if you eat too much tuna, you're going to have ... [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2274.0s)]
*  Mercury. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2278.0s)]
*  Yes, correct. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2279.0s)]
*  Mercury poisoning from tuna is a real thing. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2280.0s)]
*  You can get arsenic from sardines too. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2282.0s)]
*  I found that out the hard way. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2284.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2285.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2286.0s)]
*  Ate too many sardines? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2287.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got my blood work done. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2288.0s)]
*  And the doctor says you have arsenic in your blood. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2289.0s)]
*  And I go, is someone poisoning me? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2291.0s)]
*  He goes, no, it's very low level. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2293.0s)]
*  It's like, is your girlfriend angry at you? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2295.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2297.0s)]
*  There have been situations like that. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2298.0s)]
*  He says do you eat a lot of fish? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2300.0s)]
*  And I said, yeah, I eat like three cans of sardines a night. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2301.0s)]
*  That's a lot of sardines, man. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2303.0s)]
*  Yeah, I love sardines. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2304.0s)]
*  I mean, it's ... [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2305.0s)]
*  I love them. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2306.0s)]
*  You love sardines? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2307.0s)]
*  I really do. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2308.0s)]
*  I've always loved sardines. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2309.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2311.0s)]
*  I love them. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2312.0s)]
*  But it turns out, like, you can't eat too much of it because they're ... [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2313.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're not good for you. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2315.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2316.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2317.0s)]
*  I mean, a little sardines once in a while, but not three cans a night. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2318.0s)]
*  Well, for me, it's like I come home late from the comedy club, but I want something easy to eat. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2320.0s)]
*  I don't want to stop. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2324.0s)]
*  So open a can of sardines. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2325.0s)]
*  I get fast food, so I open up a few cans of sardines. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2326.0s)]
*  And I'll watch a little TV, eat a few cans of sardines. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2328.0s)]
*  I was doing it every night. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2331.0s)]
*  And then I stopped doing it, and I got my blood work done a couple months later. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2333.0s)]
*  It was gone. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2336.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2337.0s)]
*  So don't eat too many sardines. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2338.0s)]
*  I think anchovies really pep up a Caesar salad. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2339.0s)]
*  Yeah, they do. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2341.0s)]
*  I'm a fan. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2342.0s)]
*  I'm a fan. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2343.0s)]
*  I'm a fan of anchovies as well. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2344.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2345.0s)]
*  One of my favorite pizzas ever is pineapple and anchovy. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2346.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2348.0s)]
*  I like the double pineapple, double anchovy. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2349.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2350.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2351.0s)]
*  It's the sweet and the salty, and then you got the tomato sauce and the cheese. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2352.0s)]
*  It's my favorite pizza. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2356.0s)]
*  It's very good. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2358.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2359.0s)]
*  I mean, as a kid, I was very much against Hawaiian pizza. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2360.0s)]
*  And as an adult, I like it. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2362.0s)]
*  Hawaiian's good, but I'm telling you, anchovies and pineapple is the bomb diggity. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2364.0s)]

*  It's wild. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2436.84s)]
*  Yeah, once in a while I see someone paranoid. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2437.84s)]
*  On the street? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2438.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2439.84s)]
*  I saw a guy on the street the other day just walking around with a mask on. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2440.84s)]
*  I'm like, okay, buddy, you look like you're about 28 years old. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2443.84s)]
*  I think you're going to be okay. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2446.84s)]
*  Be okay, yeah. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2447.84s)]
*  You're probably not going to be okay breathing that fucking same air in that mask and all [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2448.84s)]
*  the fucking stuff that's on the floor. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2453.84s)]
*  Breathing that fucking same air in that mask and all the bacteria spitting out. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2457.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2462.1200000000003s)]
*  It's attaching to that cloth. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2463.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2464.1200000000003s)]
*  Masks are not like some magic health shield. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2465.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, there are times where a mask is warranted, like if a surgeon is operating on you or whatever, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2469.1200000000003s)]
*  then you know what the surgeon's spitting in your wound. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2475.76s)]
*  Of course. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2478.2400000000002s)]
*  But most of the time a mask is not good for you. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2479.36s)]
*  If you can breathe out of it, that means you're breathing in. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2482.8s)]
*  That means you're also exhaling. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2487.96s)]
*  How much is it filtering? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2490.56s)]
*  Particles? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2491.56s)]
*  I'd say a mask is much like a shield in battle in that it'll help protect you a little bit [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2492.56s)]
*  from arrows and stuff, but it doesn't make you arrow-proof. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2501.1200000000003s)]
*  We're just talking about shooting arrows and stuff. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2503.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2506.6800000000003s)]
*  There's all sorts of arrows. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2507.6800000000003s)]
*  There are times when masks are warranted, but most of the time it's actually counterproductive. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2509.04s)]
*  Well, that was one of the things about the old Twitter was the propaganda and the adherence [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2513.24s)]
*  to whatever the CDC was saying and the dismissing of legitimate scientists, guys like Jay Bhattacharya [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2521.2s)]
*  from Stanford and legit guys. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2530.56s)]
*  They were suppressing them and even banning them. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2534.3199999999997s)]
*  They banned Alex Berenson. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2536.72s)]
*  It was wild. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2537.7599999999998s)]
*  They banned Alex for essentially reading peer-reviewed papers. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2539.7599999999998s)]
*  All Twitter was basically an arm of the government. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2548.08s)]
*  Was that shocking? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2551.7599999999998s)]
*  What was that like? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2552.7599999999998s)]
*  To me, that was the most bizarre was the Twitter files when you let Schellenberger and Matt [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2554.48s)]
*  Taibbi and all those guys get in the response where Matt Taibbi gets audited, which is just [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2559.24s)]
*  wild. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2565.9599999999996s)]
*  It's just so blatant and so in-your-face. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2567.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2569.2s)]
*  By the way, Jack didn't really know this, but the degree to which Twitter was simply [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2576.2s)]
*  an arm of the government was not well understood by the public. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2582.0s)]
*  It was like Pravda, basically. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2587.56s)]
*  It's a state publication is the way to think of old Twitter. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2592.48s)]
*  It's a state publication. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2595.2799999999997s)]
*  And was the justification from their perspective that they are progressive liberals, they have [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2597.3199999999997s)]
*  the right intentions, it's important that they stay in power, the progressive liberals [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2603.92s)]
*  stay in government and power because this is their... [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2608.0s)]
*  There was basically oppression of any views that would even, I would say, be considered [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2613.3599999999997s)]
*  the middle of the road. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2622.24s)]
*  But certainly anything on the right. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2623.64s)]
*  I'm not talking about far right, I'm just talking mildly right. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2625.96s)]
*  Republicans were suppressed at 10 times the rate of Democrats. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2631.16s)]
*  Now, that's because old Twitter was fundamentally controlled by the far left. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2634.44s)]
*  It was completely controlled by the far left. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2640.44s)]
*  And that's why I say San Francisco Berkeley is a niche ideology. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2643.96s)]
*  It's hard to say, is there a place that's more far left than San Francisco Berkeley? [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2650.16s)]
*  Maybe Portland. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2654.16s)]
*  Maybe Portland. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2655.16s)]
*  But it's like... [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2656.16s)]
*  Right there. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2657.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's close to places, are the most far left places in America. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2658.16s)]
*  So from their standpoint, everything is to the right, including moderates. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2665.12s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2671.32s)]
*  So, but if you internalize a far left position, everything seems wrong to you that is not [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2673.04s)]
*  far left. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2682.16s)]
*  And so they naturally oppressed anything that didn't agree with their views. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2683.92s)]
*  That's why I say that it was an accidental far left information weapon. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2689.76s)]
*  So it's like Silicon Valley attracts the smartest engineers, the smartest sort of technologists [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2695.48s)]
*  and programmers from around the world. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2704.16s)]
*  They created an information weapon that was then harnessed by the far left, who could [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2707.54s)]
*  not themselves create the weapon, but happened to be co-located where the technologists were. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2712.76s)]
*  It happened to be aligned politically with the people that possessed it. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2718.4s)]
*  The technologists generally are moderate, maybe moderate left. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2721.68s)]
*  They're not far left. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2727.92s)]
*  That's why I say San Francisco Berkeley, it doesn't even extend to South San Francisco [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2729.7999999999997s)]
*  or even to Palo Alto. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2734.44s)]
*  So SF Berkeley is the most far left. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2736.52s)]
*  Perhaps in a competition with Portland, but I'd say SF Berkeley is more far left even [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2740.44s)]
*  than Portland. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2746.2799999999997s)]
*  Like literally in America, we're talking about an area that's maybe a 10 mile radius. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2748.0800000000004s)]
*  And so normally the effects, the negative effects of a far left ideology that is would [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2755.2000000000003s)]
*  be geographically limited to a 10 mile radius. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2761.1600000000003s)]
*  Any bad effects of that ideology would be geographically constrained under normal circumstances [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2768.2400000000002s)]
*  and have been in the past. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2774.32s)]
*  When you have basically a technological megaphone, which was Twitter and social media in general, [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2777.08s)]
*  suddenly the far left are handed a megaphone to Earth, an incredibly powerful technology [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2785.44s)]
*  weapon that they themselves could not create, but they happened to be co-located with the [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2794.72s)]
*  technologists who created it by accident. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2799.44s)]
*  Is it shocking that more people don't understand how dangerous that is? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2806.24s)]
*  I think some people understand. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2810.7999999999997s)]
*  Some people do. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2814.24s)]
*  Some people understand. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2815.24s)]
*  So I mean from the standpoint of some people who used to be at Twitter, the people are [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2817.3999999999996s)]
*  like, well it's a big shift to the right. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2822.24s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2824.1s)]
*  It is a shift to the right because everything is to the right if you're far left. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2825.1s)]
*  Everything is to the right. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2828.9599999999996s)]
*  But how many far left people have actually been suspended or banned from Twitter now [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2831.76s)]
*  X? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2836.32s)]
*  Zero. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2837.32s)]
*  So it's really just moved to the center, but from the perspective of the far left, it's [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2840.8s)]
*  moved to the right. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2845.7200000000003s)]
*  Everything is relative. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2846.7200000000003s)]
*  The difference in moderation. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2851.96s)]
*  I should say it has propagated that far left philosophy not just to America, but to everywhere [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2852.96s)]
*  on Earth. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2858.6800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2859.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2860.6800000000003s)]
*  And with the same level of suppression in other countries as well? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2862.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2865.2799999999997s)]
*  But the Taliban is on Twitter. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2866.7599999999998s)]
*  Right? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2869.08s)]
*  I always think of like, hey Mr. Taliban, tell him you're banana. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2870.08s)]
*  Hey Mr. Taliban, tell him you're banana. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2876.96s)]
*  But there's definitely some people on Twitter that are... [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2880.68s)]
*  Daylight coming, I want to go. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2884.12s)]
*  So the point is that from my standpoint is that X, FK, Twitter should represent the sort [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2888.24s)]
*  of collective consciousness of humanity. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2901.8799999999997s)]
*  So now that means that there are going to be views on there that you don't like or disagree [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2905.7999999999997s)]
*  with. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2911.9599999999996s)]
*  That's humanity. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2916.44s)]
*  So are you going to exclude them or not? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2918.44s)]
*  Now I mean if somebody breaks the law, then the account is suspended. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2920.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean if they actively advocate murder, then the account is suspended. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2926.8s)]
*  We do have what we call like the kind of United Nations exclusion rule, which is that you [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2931.84s)]
*  say the Ayatollah, who would prefer that Israel didn't exist, for example. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2938.04s)]
*  But he's allowed to go to the UN building in New York. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2950.88s)]
*  And in fact, generally officials from Iran do in fact go to the UN building in New York, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2955.08s)]
*  even though they are a heavily sanctioned country. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2961.84s)]
*  So I think that there's merit to having, just like there's some merit to the UN, one can [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2965.64s)]
*  disagree with the UN and I think we shouldn't have a world government that we bow down to. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2972.72s)]
*  But in fact, that's risky for civilization. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2977.12s)]
*  But I think you do want to have the leaders of countries represented on social media. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2980.2s)]
*  You want to hear what they have to say, even if what they say is terrible. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2987.7599999999998s)]
*  I think that is true across the board. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2991.12s)]
*  I think one of the things you just said that's very important is that's humanity. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2993.12s)]
*  And I think it's important that a social media platform, especially the biggest one, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=2996.7599999999998s)]
*  represents humanity so we understand what we're talking about. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3003.16s)]
*  Because if we have this distorted idea of what people think and want and need because [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3007.64s)]
*  everyone only exists inside this ideological bubble and anything outside of that bubble [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3012.3199999999997s)]
*  gets censored, then that changes, literally changes the tone of the entire country. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3016.36s)]
*  Changes what people think is okay and not okay, makes people feel differently. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3022.08s)]
*  It's not humanity. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3026.6s)]
*  It's different. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3027.7200000000003s)]
*  It's a very forced version of humanity. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3028.7200000000003s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3032.44s)]
*  So I mean the whole point of free speech, free speech is only relevant. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3034.44s)]
*  The First Amendment is only relevant if you allow people you don't like to say things [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3040.32s)]
*  you don't like. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3046.52s)]
*  Because if you like it, you don't need a First Amendment. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3050.32s)]
*  So the whole point of free speech is that frankly even people you hate say things you [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3053.96s)]
*  hate because if they can say, if people you hate can say things that you hate, that means [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3059.76s)]
*  that they can't stop you from saying what you want to say, which is very, very important. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3065.76s)]
*  But the problem with Twitter was it was not the case. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3071.6400000000003s)]
*  It was people that you hate couldn't say. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3075.04s)]
*  And when they didn't like, they censored. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3078.32s)]
*  Or what's called de-amplify. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3080.52s)]
*  Well not just de-amplify, but under the behest of the government would suppress real news, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3083.1200000000003s)]
*  which was very bizarre. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3088.6000000000004s)]
*  So they were very aware of something being accurate and they still suppressed it because [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3090.36s)]
*  the government wanted them to suppress it. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3096.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean in my view there have been severe First Amendment violations by multiple government [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3098.56s)]
*  agencies and there should be repercussions for that. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3102.7200000000003s)]
*  And is it, do different laws apply because it's a privately owned social media company? [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3105.84s)]
*  What laws do apply in terms of like, when you're looking at it, one of the arguments [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3114.56s)]
*  that the leftists would use is it's a private company, they can do whatever they want. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3119.44s)]
*  Yeah it's funny that when the shoe's on the other foot they now say the private company [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3124.4s)]
*  can't do whatever it wants. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3127.96s)]
*  Well, yeah, now they're upset. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3129.44s)]
*  But the government itself is not allowed to censor speech. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3132.52s)]
*  But in my view the government de facto did censor speech and there should at least be [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3139.48s)]
*  a case where that is heard by the public. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3145.08s)]
*  Because if the government severely coerces a platform, it sort of coerces the press, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3149.68s)]
*  I think that should be a First Amendment violation. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3160.96s)]
*  Well they can't do it with other media forms, right? [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3165.2799999999997s)]
*  They're not allowed to do it with any other media. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3168.52s)]
*  Right, if they try to do that with a newspaper, they're going to get in trouble. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3171.3599999999997s)]
*  Or would they? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3176.44s)]
*  You know, that's the question. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3177.44s)]
*  You didn't know about the federal government, you didn't know about the intelligence agencies [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3179.24s)]
*  inside of Twitter until we found out. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3184.12s)]
*  Do you think that this is ubiquitous? [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3186.56s)]
*  It's absolutely all the social media companies. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3189.84s)]
*  In fact, right now, ex-formula notice Twitter is the only one that is not cow-tying to the [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3192.0s)]
*  government. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3199.96s)]
*  It's the only one. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3200.96s)]
*  There isn't, all the others just do exactly what the government wants. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3201.96s)]
*  That is wild. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3206.5600000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3207.5600000000004s)]
*  What I was getting at, do you think that that's everywhere? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3208.5600000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3209.8s)]
*  Do you think that that's CNN? [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3210.8s)]
*  Do you think that that's the New York Times? [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3211.8s)]
*  Do you think that that's the Washington Post? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3213.28s)]
*  Because if they were going to infiltrate media, if they were going to infiltrate social media... [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3216.84s)]
*  I mean, it is weird the degree to which the media is in lockstep. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3221.2400000000002s)]
*  Like, why is the media in lockstep? [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3225.2400000000002s)]
*  And why doesn't the media question the government? [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3228.84s)]
*  They used to. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3230.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3231.4s)]
*  Why don't they do that anymore? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3232.4s)]
*  It seems weird. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3233.4s)]
*  Something doesn't add up. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3234.4s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3236.96s)]
*  Well, there seems like there's a bunch of factors, right? [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3237.96s)]
*  I think one of the big factors is pharmaceutical drug companies allowed to advertise on television. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3239.6400000000003s)]
*  And we're one of two countries in the world that allow that. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3245.36s)]
*  I actually agree with pharmaceutical advertising provided it is truthful. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3248.04s)]
*  Because there could be some drug that is helpful to someone. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3252.1200000000003s)]
*  But obviously the claims need to be accurate. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3255.0s)]
*  So I actually think pharmaceutical advertising, if it is accurate... [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3258.7200000000003s)]
*  I think it actually, you know, play devil's advocate here, I think pharmaceutical advertising [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3262.56s)]
*  is generally accurate. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3267.4s)]
*  I think that's actually okay. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3270.96s)]
*  Now I should say that a lot of the censorship that we see is coming from, indirectly from [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3274.64s)]

*  And from PR companies who want a particular viewpoint pushed. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3284.44s)]
*  Or are being driven by non-profits to push a particular... [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3290.1600000000003s)]
*  What will happen is there will be a sort of a group of non-profits that push advertisers [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3296.88s)]
*  to advertise or not advertise on a particular platform. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3304.6800000000003s)]
*  Often he has the sort of George Soros bogeyman. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3310.04s)]
*  But I mean Soros actually, he is I believe the top contributor to the Democratic Party. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3312.28s)]
*  The second one was Sam Banquet-Fried. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3319.6800000000003s)]
*  And Soros, I don't know, I mean he had a very difficult upbringing. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3325.16s)]
*  And in my opinion he fundamentally hates humanity. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3331.3599999999997s)]
*  That's my opinion. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3336.04s)]
*  Really? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3337.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3338.52s)]
*  I mean, well he's doing things that erode the fabric of civilization. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3339.52s)]
*  You know, getting DA's elected who refuse to prosecute crime. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3342.8799999999997s)]
*  That's probably the problem in San Francisco and LA and much of other cities. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3346.6s)]
*  So why would you do that? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3351.98s)]
*  Was it humanity or is it just the United States as a whole? [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3355.44s)]
*  I mean he's pushing things in other countries too. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3358.76s)]
*  He's doing the same thing? [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3361.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3363.68s)]
*  Now George at this point is pretty old. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3364.68s)]
*  I mean he's not, you know, he's basically a Betsy now at this point. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3367.6s)]
*  But I mean he, and he's very smart. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3374.32s)]
*  And he's very good at arbitrage. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3378.92s)]
*  You know famously he shorted the British pound. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3379.92s)]
*  That's sort of how I think he made his first money was shorting the pound. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3384.0s)]
*  So he's good at spotting, basically arbitrage like spotting value for money that other people [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3389.8s)]
*  don't see. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3395.08s)]
*  So one of the things he noticed was that the value for money in local races is much higher [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3396.68s)]
*  than it is in national races. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3405.36s)]
*  The lowest value for money is a presidential race. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3407.08s)]
*  And the next lowest value for money is a Senate race, then a congress, then, but once you [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3410.16s)]
*  get to sort of city and state district attorneys, the value for money is extremely good. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3415.04s)]
*  And Soros realized that you don't actually need to change the laws, you just need to [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3422.4s)]
*  change how they're enforced. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3426.08s)]
*  If nobody chooses to enforce the law or the laws are differentially enforced, it's like [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3428.96s)]
*  changing the laws. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3432.56s)]
*  That's what he figured out. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3435.3199999999997s)]
*  It's stunning that this trend, that people haven't pulled the brakes on this and have [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3437.2799999999997s)]
*  it reverse course. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3443.68s)]
*  They're pulling the brakes? [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3444.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3446.68s)]
*  Yeah, pulling the brakes right now. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3447.68s)]
*  Yeah, you are. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3450.68s)]
*  But you might be the only one. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3452.8799999999997s)]
*  Well, I think more people should. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3453.8799999999997s)]
*  Most people just don't want to rock the boat. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3456.8799999999997s)]
*  Most people are looking for acceptance from society and if there's some negative press [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3463.68s)]
*  article, they're like shattered. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3469.68s)]
*  I couldn't give it up. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3470.68s)]
*  Go ahead, make my day. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3472.68s)]
*  Well, it's fascinating where if you're a high profile public figure like yourself, it's [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3477.68s)]
*  impossible to make everybody happy. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3484.68s)]
*  So there's going to be someone who says something shitty about you. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3486.68s)]
*  Somehow or another when it's in print, does that mean more? [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3490.68s)]
*  Because other people are going to see this shitty thing? [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3493.68s)]
*  That's where it gets odd. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3495.68s)]
*  Because essentially an article in the New York Times is just a single person's opinion [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3500.68s)]
*  and whatever editor gets involved. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3504.68s)]
*  A lot of people will read that. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3506.68s)]
*  I mean, less people these days than in the past. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3508.68s)]
*  But I think people know that now. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3510.68s)]
*  I find the New York Times these days to be hard to read. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3512.68s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, they make some grave errors. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3516.68s)]
*  Like that Hamas bombing the Israeli bombing the hospital. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3520.68s)]
*  Chickpeas? [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3529.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3530.68s)]
*  It's delicious. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3531.68s)]
*  I think we should cut off Chickpea exports. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3532.68s)]
*  That'll bring them to the knees right away. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3536.68s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3538.68s)]
*  Take a chip and dip it in nothing? [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3540.68s)]
*  What we need to do is introduce them to pineapple and anchovy pizza. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3542.68s)]
*  I hope that's coming. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3546.68s)]
*  Is that coming? [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3548.68s)]
*  Do we have a pizza name like a company? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3550.68s)]
*  I'll get some information. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3552.68s)]
*  Is this a good one? [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3554.68s)]
*  Pizza Leone. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3556.68s)]
*  Oh, that's legit. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3557.68s)]
*  It's pretty close. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3558.68s)]
*  There we go. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3559.68s)]
*  Nice. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3560.68s)]
*  Did they give us a timeline? [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3561.68s)]
*  It shouldn't take too long. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3563.68s)]
*  They're not too far away and it's late. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3564.68s)]
*  I would have bet 20 minutes, 30 minutes, maybe. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3566.68s)]
*  All right. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3568.68s)]
*  Max 40. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3569.68s)]
*  Taking care of your health isn't always easy, but it should be simple. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3571.68s)]
*  And that's why for the last three years, I've been drinking AG1 every day. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3574.68s)]

*  This episode is brought to you by Oracle. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3656.68s)]
*  AI might be the most important new computer technology ever. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3658.68s)]
*  It's storming every industry, and literally billions of dollars are being invested. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3662.68s)]
*  So buckle up. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3668.68s)]
*  The problem is that AI needs a lot of speed and processing power. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3669.68s)]
*  So how do you compete without costs spiraling out of control? [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3674.68s)]
*  It's time to upgrade to the next generation of the cloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3678.68s)]
*  or OCI. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3683.68s)]
*  OCI is a single platform for your infrastructure, database, application development, and AI needs. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3686.68s)]
*  OCI has four to eight times the bandwidth of other clouds, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3695.68s)]
*  offers one consistent price instead of variable regional pricing, [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3700.68s)]
*  and of course, nobody does data better than Oracle. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3705.68s)]
*  So now you can train your AI models at twice the speed and less than half the costs of other clouds. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3709.68s)]
*  If you want to do more and spend less like Uber and thousands of others, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3717.68s)]
*  take a free test drive of OCI at oracle.com slash rogen. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3722.68s)]

*  You know, that's something like after I say I've got a lot of respect for somebody's like willing to make pizza late at night. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3736.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3742.68s)]

*  You know. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3747.68s)]
*  Late night food. I appreciate the fun. If you can get a really good late night meal. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3748.68s)]

*  Wigs off. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3754.68s)]
*  I'm upset. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3755.68s)]
*  Yeah. I'm a giant fan of very good late night food. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3756.68s)]
*  And that's one of the things that like Los Angeles really used to have. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3758.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3760.68s)]
*  They had a Pacific dining cart where you can get a legit steak 24 hours a day. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3761.68s)]
*  Really? [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3765.68s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know if it's still open in downtown LA. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3766.68s)]
*  I believe the one in Santa Monica closed, but a Pacific dining cart in downtown LA was a legit steakhouse. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3768.68s)]
*  And you get it. We would leave the Comedy Store two, three in the morning, get a legit steak. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3775.68s)]
*  That's cool. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3781.68s)]
*  Is that still open? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3782.68s)]
*  Temporarily closed. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3783.68s)]
*  Ah, fucking COVID got them. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3784.68s)]
*  COVID just took out so many restaurants. It's crazy. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3786.68s)]
*  It's not coming back. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3788.68s)]
*  Other websites seem to be down too. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3789.68s)]
*  Yeah, they're not coming back. Motherfucker. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3790.68s)]
*  We've got 70% of the restaurants in LA at one point. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3793.68s)]
*  Wow. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3795.68s)]
*  Not COVID, I should say. Policies. Lockdowns. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3796.68s)]
*  The mind virus. I mean, it's like just crazy. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3800.68s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's why I moved here. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3803.68s)]
*  One of the reasons why I moved here is we came here in May of 2020 and you could go indoors and eat in restaurants. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3806.68s)]
*  And my kids who were pretty young at the time, 10 and 12, they were like, we want to live here. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3811.68s)]
*  So it's like they're freaked out. Like LA was weird. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3816.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, for most of COVID, I was actually in South Texas building this Starship factory. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3819.68s)]
*  And, you know, we're just, no masks, no nothing, just building a factory, building rockets. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3825.68s)]
*  And then, you know, you would have teams from California visit all masked up. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3831.68s)]
*  And they'd freak out that we're not wearing masks. And we're like, we're still alive, man. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3837.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3842.68s)]
*  So. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3843.68s)]
*  Did you lose anybody? Did anybody from your factory die of COVID? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3844.68s)]
*  Not that I'm aware of, no. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3848.68s)]
*  So part of it is that, like, that I kind of saw a dress rehearsal, which is that, you know, I kind of started in Wuhan. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3850.68s)]
*  And so Tesla's got 20,000 employees in China. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3859.68s)]
*  And so, you know, the first wave happened in China and we had nobody died or got seriously ill. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3866.68s)]
*  And I was like, OK, well, like, this is, you know, can't be that bad. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3873.68s)]
*  And we're not relying on government statistics. We literally know who shoot out for work. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3877.68s)]
*  You know, did they badger or not? [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3881.68s)]
*  And we had no one die and no one got seriously ill. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3886.68s)]
*  So I'm like, well, I don't know what the big deal is. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3891.68s)]
*  Well, there's a problem that people still want to stick to this initial narrative that they believed and that they espoused. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3893.68s)]
*  They like they repeated it. And so they'll still fight you on this today. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3901.68s)]
*  People still fight you today on the merits of the lockdowns, the importance of vaccine mandates, closing schools. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3906.68s)]
*  There's people that stated an opinion in 2020 and they still are doing mental gymnastics to try to make it seem like that was the right choice. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3914.68s)]
*  No, it was just a panic. Yeah. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3924.68s)]
*  And a lot of deaths got ascribed to COVID that had nothing to do with COVID. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3927.68s)]
*  And in fact, I'd say in the beginning, the cure is worse than the disease. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3931.68s)]
*  So because people panic too much and so that somebody would get diagnosed with COVID, they put them on intubated ventilator for a week. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3935.68s)]
*  And this was going to basically cook your lungs. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3944.68s)]
*  So if you if you if you aren't pure or two under pressure with a tube stuck down your throat and under anesthetic, this is this is very bad for you. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3948.68s)]
*  Like, it's one thing if you do that for a couple of hours for an operation, but you do that for a week. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3958.68s)]
*  It's going to it's going to roast your lungs. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3962.68s)]
*  The air that we're breathing right now is 78 percent nitrogen, one percent argon, about 21 percent oxygen and some miscellaneous. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3965.68s)]
*  So if you ask what are you breathing, say oxygen, now you're breathing nitrogen. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3974.68s)]
*  Only about a fifth of it is oxygen. And there's about one percent argon. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3979.68s)]
*  So I know quite a lot about life support systems, because we make spaceships and you have to keep people alive in a vacuum. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3985.68s)]
*  So you got to say, OK, what percentage nitrogen, what percentage oxygen you can do, what's the pressure going to be? [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3992.68s)]
*  And so like sea level pressure is about 15 pounds per square inch. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=3998.68s)]
*  The partial pressure of oxygen at 20 being 20 percent is therefore roughly three pounds per square inch of oxygen. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4003.68s)]
*  So in a spacecraft, you want to especially if you're in a space suit, you want to lower the pressure. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4011.68s)]
*  So you want to keep the oxygen still still get people enough oxygen to function, obviously. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4017.68s)]
*  But you want to lower the nitrogen content so that you don't have a space suit that's at 15 psi, because at 15 psi you just, you know, just pop out like a balloon. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4022.68s)]
*  It's like hard to move. So you want to try to lower the pressure, you know, down to around six, seven psi, maybe even five psi. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4032.68s)]
*  So you'd lower it to try to keep the oxygen partial pressure of oxygen roughly the same. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4045.68s)]
*  So maybe around three psi and then three psi of nitrogen. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4050.68s)]
*  So you got 50, 50 mix of nitrogen, oxygen and and then you see it's getting pretty hot in that way. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4054.68s)]
*  I'm sweating. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4061.68s)]
*  It's going to be sweaty and itchy. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4066.68s)]
*  A little bit. Yeah. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4068.68s)]
*  I can't believe people wear them all day. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4069.68s)]
*  Yeah. So anyway, so I know a thing or two about keeping people alive in a vacuum, you know. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4071.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4077.68s)]
*  So, you know, we designed the life support system for keeping humans alive in a vacuum, the vacuum of space, which is very difficult. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4078.68s)]
*  So we know quite a lot about what it takes to keep people alive. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4087.68s)]
*  So you don't want to feed people, you know, 100 percent oxygen. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4090.68s)]
*  That's actually for an extended period of time. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4095.68s)]
*  This is not good for you. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4097.68s)]
*  Well, 80 percent of the people they put on ventilators died. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4098.68s)]
*  Yeah. So in fact, I actually posted about that because I called doctors in Wuhan and said, [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4101.68s)]
*  what are the biggest mistakes that you made on the first wave? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4108.68s)]
*  This was early on. And they said we put far too many people on intubated ventilators. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4111.68s)]
*  So then I actually posted on Twitter at the time and said, hey, what I'm hearing from Wuhan is that they made a big mistake in putting people on intubated ventilators for an extended period. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4116.68s)]
*  And that this is actually what is damaging the lungs, not COVID. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4127.68s)]
*  It's the treatment, the cure is worse than the disease. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4131.68s)]
*  And people yelled at me and said, I'm not a doctor. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4134.68s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, but I do make spaceships with life support systems. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4136.68s)]
*  What do you do? [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4139.68s)]
*  I like that. I twiddle knobs. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4141.68s)]
*  I'm like, OK, great. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4142.68s)]
*  Yeah. Rock on. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4144.68s)]
*  Well, again, it was there was this very bizarre narrative that you had to believe everything that the government was telling you. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4145.68s)]
*  You had to believe everything the CDC was telling you. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4153.68s)]
*  And that even as it time went on and we realized, hey, it looks like this came from a fucking lab. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4155.68s)]
*  Like even as time went on, disputing that would get you banned, would get you kicked off YouTube. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4162.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think to this day, there's certain things you're not allowed to say in regards to the vaccine on YouTube. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4168.68s)]
*  As I said, the the only media that is not does not have crazy censorship at this point is X. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4175.68s)]
*  Yeah. That I'm aware of. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4183.68s)]
*  Everyone else either is everything else is censored. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4184.68s)]
*  Spotify isn't. That's why this is Daniel. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4188.68s)]
*  Oh, Daniel X, the man. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4192.68s)]
*  Yeah, I love that, too. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4193.68s)]
*  And, you know, I think more companies should follow suit. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4194.68s)]
*  I don't think it has to be this way. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4198.68s)]
*  Fortunately for us, they're they they're in Sweden and Stockholm, Sweden. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4200.68s)]
*  They have a very different perspective on all this shit. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4204.68s)]
*  Yeah. What is wild about the nitrogen is that like that's mostly nitrogen from fertilizer. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4209.68s)]
*  We suck out of the air. Sorry. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4214.68s)]
*  What do you mean? Most of the nitrogen for fertilizer we suck out of the air. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4217.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's a no. One of the actually the big inventions in chemistry was binding nitrogen. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4220.68s)]
*  It's it nitrogen is actually fairly inert. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4227.68s)]
*  So it's quite hard to to actually pull nitrogen out there and bind it into like ammonia. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4229.68s)]
*  Like basically the process for creating ammonia was was actually a very the harbor method. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4236.68s)]
*  Yeah. Pritz Harbor. Yeah. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4240.68s)]
*  Same guy invented Zyklon gas. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4242.68s)]
*  But the it was actually very important to bind nitrogen from the air to fertilizer. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4245.68s)]
*  So that that actually was frankly as a life saving invention at scale because you just run out of nitrogen. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4253.68s)]
*  So like not nitrogen pure nitrogen is a low energy state. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4266.68s)]
*  So to try to bind it into fertilizer is requires light energy to do that. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4272.68s)]
*  It's quite quite tricky. So that was a very important breakthrough. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4276.68s)]
*  Yeah. I read that 50 percent of the nitrogen in most people's body comes from that method. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4279.68s)]
*  Fifty percent of the nitrogen in most people's body that they've consumed from food. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4286.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Because of because of that. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4291.68s)]
*  That might be true. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4295.68s)]
*  It was a fundamental problem for most of civilization is how do you get nitrogen for the plants? [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4298.68s)]
*  The limiting factor, in fact, even in the rainforest, is like the nitrogen is bound nitrogen. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4306.68s)]
*  What are the when you do eventually colonize Mars? [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4312.68s)]
*  What what's the idea in terms of terraforming? [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4316.68s)]
*  Is it contained ecosystems that were are under domes? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4320.68s)]
*  Like what what what are you planning on doing to make it habitable? [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4324.68s)]
*  Well, at first you would have to have a life support system because Mars has a low density atmosphere, only about one percent the density of both. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4329.68s)]
*  And it's primarily CO2. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4338.68s)]
*  Now, over time, you could you can terraform Mars terraform means make it like Earth, essentially. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4341.68s)]
*  And if you warm Mars up, you will there's a bunch of frozen CO2 that will evaporate, densify the atmosphere. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4348.68s)]
*  And you'd actually want kind of global warming on Mars. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4355.68s)]
*  Mars is about 50 percent further away from the sun than the Earth. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4359.68s)]
*  So it gets about less than half the solar energy that that Earth does. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4364.68s)]
*  And it's believed at one point in time Mars had a much different environment, right? [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4368.68s)]
*  It is it appears highly likely that Mars had liquid oceans a long time ago. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4374.68s)]
*  There's a lot of ice. So there's this Mars is covered in ice and ice is then covered in dust for the mostly except at the poles. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4380.68s)]
*  So there's there's just there's a lot of ice. In fact, I believe if Mars was warmed up, you'd have an ocean about a mile deep on 40 percent of the planet. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4391.68s)]
*  So it's quite a lot of water. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4401.68s)]
*  Do you think that it was like that at one point in time? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4403.68s)]
*  The evidence suggests that it is most likely that Mars had liquid water. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4406.68s)]
*  What's the prevailing theory of its demise? [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4411.68s)]
*  Well, just over time, the solar system cooled. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4414.68s)]
*  So Earth used to be much like it in the very early Earth was like molten rock. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4417.68s)]
*  You know, so really almost nothing could survive in the beginning. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4423.68s)]
*  We're just a ball of lava. We're still mostly a ball of lava. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4426.68s)]
*  It's like a crème brûlée. Like there's a thin crust and and it's mushy rock, super very hot mushy rock underneath. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4431.68s)]
*  And technically that rock is in a semi solid state. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4440.68s)]
*  But as soon as it gets to a low pressure, like pops out of the ocean, you have a volcano, obviously, with lava. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4443.68s)]
*  So it's at surface ambient pressure. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4448.68s)]
*  We were basically covered in liquid rock. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4454.68s)]
*  Are you aware of the thin crust on liquid rock? [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4456.68s)]
*  Are you aware of the origin myth of the Dogon tribe? [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4459.68s)]
*  No. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4462.68s)]
*  There's a tribe in, I believe it's a tribe in, I forget what part of Africa, but they believe that they came from Mars and that there was a civilization that left Mars, you know, many, many eons ago. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4463.68s)]
*  And it's it's a really weird. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4477.68s)]
*  It's a really weird theory because they know some things about Mars. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4481.68s)]
*  Yeah, I'm pretty sure they didn't come from Mars. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4487.68s)]
*  Oh yeah, I'm pretty sure too. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4489.68s)]
*  But I mean it's, I wonder. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4491.68s)]
*  Do they have any spaceships? If there aren't any spaceships, then I'm like, I don't believe it. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4493.68s)]
*  Well. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4495.68s)]
*  If they do have a spaceship, I'll believe it. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4496.68s)]
*  If you parked a spaceship, how many thousands of years? If you parked a metal spaceship. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4498.68s)]
*  Like if you left a cyber truck in the desert, how many thousands of years do you think it would be there for? Before it's gone? [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4502.68s)]
*  If it got buried in dirt, you'd find it even like a million years from now. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4510.68s)]
*  A million? [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4514.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4515.68s)]
*  Wow. Really? [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4516.68s)]
*  Well, what you'd find is. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4518.68s)]
*  Because it's stainless steel. So it would have to be some sort of an alloy. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4520.68s)]
*  It would. It's kind of like. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4522.68s)]
*  But iron wouldn't, right? [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4524.68s)]
*  Yeah, but you'd have something similar to like fossils basically, you know, like the fossils. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4526.68s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4532.68s)]
*  They essentially discolor the rock. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4533.68s)]
*  So eventually, whatever the fossil is, and sometimes the fossil is like an amber or something like that. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4536.68s)]
*  That's where it's still does survive more or less intact. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4541.68s)]
*  But I mean, there's fossilized like dinosaur fossils and tree fossils. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4544.68s)]
*  That's essentially re-mineralized, right? [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4549.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4552.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4553.68s)]
*  So you'd see it like a cyber truck shape in the rock, basically. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4554.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah. But that's it. You wouldn't find the actual cyber truck. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4557.68s)]
*  So if they did have a spaceship and it came here 30,000 years ago. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4563.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. We'd definitely find it. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4568.68s)]
*  We'd definitely find evidence of it. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4570.68s)]
*  Well, I mean, if it was one spaceship, maybe not. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4574.68s)]
*  But if it was a lot of them, sure. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4577.68s)]
*  That is the origin myth of the Dogon tribe, right? Am I getting that right? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4579.68s)]
*  I didn't say Mars specifically. It's a hidden star and a Sirius. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4582.68s)]
*  Oh, it's somewhere else. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4586.68s)]
*  System, yeah. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4587.68s)]
*  You cannot be Sirius. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4588.68s)]
*  Sirius XM. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4591.68s)]
*  It's just very strange when people have this bizarre origin myth. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4593.68s)]
*  I wonder who was the first one to tell them they came from stars. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4601.68s)]
*  And when we eventually do, I mean, how bizarre. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4606.68s)]
*  Imagine if you're successful. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4610.68s)]
*  We eventually do colonize Mars and you're correct. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4613.68s)]
*  Earth winds up through human folly or natural disaster getting wiped out. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4617.68s)]
*  And there's only the colony on Mars. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4624.68s)]
*  And that colony exists for 10, 20,000 years. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4626.68s)]
*  And they have their origin myth that we all came from Earth. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4629.68s)]
*  I mean, ultimately, that's going if this does happen, you do colonize Mars and Earth does get destroyed. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4634.68s)]
*  And if there a period of time takes place, like, look at the period, [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4641.68s)]
*  at least the conventional timeline of the Great Pyramid, which is 4,500 years ago. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4645.68s)]
*  5,000 years. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4650.68s)]
*  Yeah. So that's not that much time. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4651.68s)]
*  It's not that much time. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4654.68s)]
*  No, I mean, if- [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4655.68s)]
*  It's nothing on the galactic time scale. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4656.68s)]
*  Right. So if we're talking 20,000, 30,000 years from now on Mars, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4658.68s)]
*  and people talk about time square and what Earth used to be like. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4662.68s)]
*  Wow. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4667.68s)]
*  I mean, it is, I think there's some debate. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4668.68s)]
*  It's like, how do you say what the, when did civilization start? [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4672.68s)]
*  And I'd say like probably from the first writing. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4675.68s)]
*  And the first writing is only 5,500 years old. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4680.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4684.68s)]
*  It's worth reading about the history of writing, but only 5,500 years. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4685.68s)]
*  And one has to credit basically the ancient Sumerians who aren't around anymore with the first writing. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4689.68s)]
*  Are you aware though that there's hieroglyphs that depict a history of Egypt that goes back far longer, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4697.68s)]
*  maybe even 30,000 plus years ago, but archaeologists dismiss it because they think that that's mythical. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4704.68s)]
*  But non-conventional archaeologists who believe in what's called the Younger Dryas Impact Theory, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4710.68s)]
*  that somewhere around 11,800 years ago civilization was essentially all but wiped out by common impacts. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4717.68s)]
*  Okay. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4724.68s)]
*  And that is the reason why they keep finding these insanely old huge structures, [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4726.68s)]
*  megalithic structures that are carved out of stone. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4733.68s)]
*  Like when you go back to like Gobekli Tepe, which is 11,600 years ago. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4736.68s)]
*  Okay. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4740.68s)]
*  That's an insanely old structure that they didn't even know people were capable of building until they discovered it in the 1990s. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4741.68s)]
*  So the conventional timeline of people when you go to 11,600 years ago was just hunter-gatherers. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4750.68s)]
*  But now that they have Gobekli Tepe with its 3D carved things. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4757.68s)]
*  And have you seen Graham Hancock's amazing series on Netflix called Ancient Apocalypse? [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4762.68s)]
*  I know. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4767.68s)]
*  You should check it out. It's amazing. But it's about that. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4768.68s)]
*  It's all about that. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4771.68s)]
*  There's a lot of physical evidence of an advanced civilization from far, far, far longer ago than we have conventionally dated, [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4772.68s)]
*  which is ancient Sumer, which is we put it about 6,000 years ago. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4781.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4786.68s)]
*  Like the first, it's difficult to date with precision, but at least within a few hundred years, but roughly 5,500 years. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4787.68s)]
*  Like what is the oldest stone tablet? [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4794.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4798.68s)]
*  Because this is, if you're like an archaeologist, if you were to discover something older than that, you'd be very famous. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4799.68s)]
*  You know, it's like they really looked hard. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4805.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4807.68s)]
*  And 5,500 years really is kind of the, if you say like any kind of evidence that I've seen that is actually substantial is writing is 5,500 years old. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4808.68s)]
*  Yeah, in terms of writing. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4822.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4824.68s)]
*  Well, what they believe is that there's very little left of this ancient civilization other than things like the pyramids, other than things like the Sphinx. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4825.68s)]
*  There's a geologist that really stuck his neck out. His name is Dr. Robert Schock from Boston University. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4834.68s)]
*  And what he said was his theory is that there's deep water erosion all over the temple of the Sphinx where the Sphinx was carved out of that is indicative of thousands of years of rainfall. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4839.68s)]
*  And the last time they had rainfall in the Nile Valley was around 9,000 BC. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4850.68s)]
*  So what he believes is because back then the whole Nile Valley was a lush rainforest and eventually receded into desert. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4855.68s)]
*  Okay. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4862.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4863.68s)]
*  So the entire that whole area, like even the Sahara used to be rich rainforest and it receded into what it is now. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4864.68s)]
*  But if you go back then, he believes that's when that thing was constructed. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4873.68s)]
*  And he says the physical geologist, the geologists look at it. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4877.68s)]
*  And if he shows it to them in terms of like just shows an image of the erosion and doesn't tell them where it is, they'll almost all of them will say that's water erosion from thousands of years of rainfall. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4881.68s)]
*  I think even if you say like, okay, even if, you know, even if you say like, okay, civilization is like 9,000 years old, there's still nothing. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4893.68s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4900.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4901.68s)]
*  So, you know, we're still talking about like a very tiny fraction of Earth's existence. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4902.68s)]
*  Like the geological evidence suggests Earth is about four and a half billion years old. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4906.68s)]
*  So human civilization has been around for roughly one millionth of Earth's existence. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4911.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4918.68s)]
*  Which was basically nothing. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4919.68s)]
*  And even if it's 10,000 years, even if it's 30,000 years, yes, still nothing. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4921.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4924.68s)]
*  What they're saying, though, is that civilization is insanely fragile. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4925.68s)]
*  That's exactly. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4929.68s)]
*  And much, much more fragile than I think we realize. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4930.68s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4932.68s)]
*  I think we should view civilization as being fragile. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4933.68s)]
*  Yeah, but we don't. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4936.68s)]
*  It's one of the weird things about people is that we, unless the threat is in front of us, it's abstract. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4937.68s)]
*  Unless it's like, is the pizza here? [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4945.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4947.68s)]
*  Pizza's here. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4949.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4950.68s)]
*  From civilization. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4951.68s)]
*  No, actually, one of my sons who, he just has these profound observations. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4953.68s)]
*  You know, he asked me what was LA like 4,000 years ago? [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4958.68s)]
*  I'm like, it wasn't around. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4964.68s)]
*  And he said, what will it be like in 4,000 years from now? [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4966.68s)]
*  Probably buried under rubble again. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4969.68s)]
*  Probably very similar to what it was like 4,000 years ago. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4971.68s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4974.68s)]
*  Except less radioactive. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4976.68s)]
*  And he asked me, did they speak English 4,000 years ago? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4977.68s)]
*  I'm like, nope. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4979.68s)]
*  It's like, did they, will they speak English 4,000 years from now? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4980.68s)]
*  Probably not. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4984.68s)]
*  I should point out that I never eat pizza. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4985.68s)]
*  Really? [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4988.68s)]
*  No. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4989.68s)]
*  Never. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4990.68s)]
*  Why not? [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4991.68s)]
*  Because it's not really good for you. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4992.68s)]
*  Well, I don't think anyone's going to accuse pizza of being like the healthiest thing in the world. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4994.68s)]
*  This looks awesome. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=4999.68s)]
*  That does look awesome. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5000.68s)]
*  You want to play with the jammy? [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5002.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5004.68s)]
*  Get in there, sir. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5005.68s)]

*  And what's the name of this pizza person? [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5010.68s)]

*  That's legit. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5022.68s)]
*  I mean, I'm no Dave Portnoy. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5024.68s)]
*  I'm not like a pizza analyst who probably, I'm not going to rate it. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5028.68s)]
*  It's excellent. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5034.68s)]
*  Does Portnoy really get into pizza? [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5035.68s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5038.68s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5039.68s)]
*  Have you ever seen Portnoy's videos where he analyzes pizza? [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5042.68s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5047.68s)]
*  It was like a whole method. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5048.68s)]
*  Is that a number system? [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5049.68s)]
*  All right. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5051.68s)]
*  He's into the crust and the flop and all these different things. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5052.68s)]
*  Wow. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5056.68s)]

*  Everybody knows the rules. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5061.68s)]
*  One bite. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5062.68s)]
*  You only get one bite of a pizza? [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5063.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5065.68s)]
*  One bite to taste it. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5066.68s)]
*  That's the rule. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5067.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5068.68s)]
*  He bites into it and then he just starts nodding his head. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5069.68s)]
*  He's basically like a Somalia pizza. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5073.68s)]
*  A pizza Somalia, okay. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5075.68s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5084.68s)]
*  We spent so much time on pizza. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5085.68s)]
*  And it's New Haven, New Haven, Connecticut. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5086.68s)]
*  Really? [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5088.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5089.68s)]

*  It seems like something that can be replicated. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5118.72s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5120.72s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5124.04s)]
*  The thing is, the people that are making pizza are not like the people that are making rocket [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5125.04s)]
*  ships. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5133.4s)]
*  If they were, they would replicate it. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5134.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5137.68s)]
*  They would go, what are these guys doing? [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5138.68s)]
*  Let's back engineer it. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5140.68s)]
*  Sure. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5141.68s)]
*  It can't be that hard. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5142.68s)]
*  You know, all these secret sauces and shit, well, fuck what's in there. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5143.68s)]

*  Oh, so good. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5197.92s)]
*  High calorie, high carbohydrate foods. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5198.92s)]

*  The whole pyramid, the bottom of the food pyramid was carbs. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5212.599999999999s)]
*  What would the Egyptians say? [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5217.04s)]
*  We're out of our fucking mind. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5220.04s)]
*  What are you eating? [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5222.04s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5225.04s)]
*  This stuff is just... [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5226.04s)]
*  That's the bizarre thing about... [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5227.96s)]
*  It's like 4th of July in your mouth. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5228.96s)]
*  How many human beings eat just processed food? [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5231.639999999999s)]
*  The majority of their diet is processed food. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5234.16s)]
*  The entire center of the supermarket is shit. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5236.72s)]
*  You really probably shouldn't eat, except every now and then. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5239.2s)]
*  It's good, Jamie. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5246.2s)]
*  I bet. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5247.2s)]
*  You want one? [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5248.2s)]
*  I don't. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5249.2s)]
*  You seem offended. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5250.2s)]
*  No, it's two of my favorite... [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5251.2s)]
*  I don't like either of those things, honestly. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5254.2s)]
*  Have you tried it? [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5256.2s)]
*  That's not my... [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5257.2s)]
*  I feel like you should try it. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5258.2s)]
*  I understand. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5261.2s)]
*  This show's all about trying it. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5262.2s)]
*  We shot an arrow at a car. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5263.2s)]

*  I don't want to offend Pizza Leo, and I like that place. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5266.2s)]
*  I would be offended. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5269.2s)]
*  It's hard to mess with pizza, frankly. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5272.2s)]
*  Unlike the creeps who used to run Twitter, I don't care if someone has a different opinion [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5276.2s)]
*  than me. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5281.2s)]
*  I just don't like fish, to be that honest with you. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5282.2s)]
*  I've tried it many times, and I still haven't liked it yet. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5283.2s)]
*  Basically, the day that's going to be... [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5286.2s)]
*  I'm going to be won over. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5288.2s)]
*  You like any fish? [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5289.2s)]
*  Not really, no. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5290.2s)]
*  You ever go fishing? [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5291.2s)]
*  I can do crab meat, yeah, but I don't like the whole... [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5292.2s)]
*  Do you like sushi? [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5294.2s)]
*  No. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5295.2s)]
*  I'm going to try some of Philip's on Thursday, though. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5296.2s)]
*  You're going to try it, but you don't like fish. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5299.2s)]
*  I'm like DC. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5302.2s)]
*  I'm afraid of that whole thing. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5303.2s)]
*  I've talked to Philip about it in detail. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5305.2s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5308.2s)]
*  I don't eat fish that often. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5309.2s)]
*  I like it. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5312.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5313.2s)]
*  It's particularly good when you catch it yourself. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5314.2s)]
*  You want to eat it fresh? [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5317.2s)]
*  Fresh fish really is way better. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5319.2s)]
*  Way better. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5320.2s)]
*  Way better. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5321.2s)]
*  Yeah, fish goes bad quick. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5322.2s)]
*  Unlike meat. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5323.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5324.2s)]
*  Meat, you can let it sit around for a while. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5325.2s)]
*  Kind of marinate. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5328.2s)]
*  Before you cook. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5329.2s)]
*  You don't marinate fish, I think. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5330.2s)]
*  Well, they do. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5331.2s)]
*  They actually dry-age fish. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5332.2s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5333.2s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of places dry-age fish. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5334.2s)]
*  Dry-age the fish. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5335.2s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't know that. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5336.2s)]
*  I wasn't aware of that, but that's actually a common practice to dry-age fish for certain [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5337.2s)]
*  sushi dishes, like really gourmet places. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5342.2s)]
*  Have you ever been to sushi by scratch? [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5345.2s)]
*  Is that in town? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5348.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's just outside of town. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5349.2s)]
*  He used to run Sushi Bar, and then he sold it to my friend Philip Franklin Lee. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5352.2s)]
*  He's a Michelin star chef. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5356.2s)]
*  He used to run Sushi Bar in town. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5357.2s)]
*  He sold that, and then he opened up Sushi by Scratch. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5360.2s)]
*  But because of the contractual obligations, he has to be outside of the Austin proper, [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5363.2s)]
*  so he's about 30 miles away. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5369.2s)]
*  It's fucking fantastic. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5370.2s)]
*  If you like sushi, it's the best sushi you'll ever eat. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5372.2s)]
*  Okay. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5374.2s)]
*  I mean, it's really insane. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5375.2s)]
*  I say that with ... You eat it, and you love it. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5376.2s)]
*  I say that with ... You eat it, and you're like, Jesus Christ, the best sushi of all [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5379.2s)]
*  time. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5384.2s)]
*  Sushi by Scratch? [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5385.2s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5386.2s)]
*  They have ones in Miami. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5387.2s)]
*  Why do they have it now? [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5389.2s)]
*  Chicago. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5391.2s)]
*  They got a bunch of them. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5392.2s)]
*  It's not allowed to go in Austin? [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5394.2s)]
*  No, it's not in Austin proper. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5396.2s)]
*  I think once his contract is up ... He had a non-compete in Austin for three years or [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5398.2s)]
*  something. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5403.2s)]
*  I don't know how long it was. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5404.2s)]
*  Okay. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5406.2s)]
*  Maybe eventually he'll open up one in Austin, but it's about 30 minutes outside of it. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5407.2s)]
*  What city is it again? [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5411.2s)]
*  Cedar? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5412.2s)]
*  Past Cedar Creek. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5413.2s)]
*  It's out at a Lost Pines area. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5414.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's 30 minutes. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5416.2s)]
*  It's no big deal. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5417.2s)]
*  Sushi by Scratch. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5418.2s)]
*  Got it. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5419.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5420.2s)]
*  It's a shit. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5421.2s)]
*  Let me know if you want to go. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5422.2s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5423.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5424.2s)]
*  It's awesome. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5425.2s)]
*  It's really worth it. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5426.2s)]
*  If you like sushi, it's a mind blower. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5427.2s)]
*  It's a mind blower. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5428.2s)]
*  And it's on Macassay. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5429.2s)]
*  So you sit down, they bring you food. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5430.2s)]
*  That's it. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5433.2s)]
*  That looks good. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5434.2s)]
*  It's pretty fucking cool. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5435.2s)]
*  You've been to Mozzahizza in LA? [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5436.2s)]
*  Yes. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5437.2s)]
*  The Macassay Brothers is great. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5438.2s)]
*  Yes. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5439.2s)]
*  That place is outstanding. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5440.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5441.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5442.2s)]
*  I love good sushi. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5443.2s)]
*  And one of the things that's amazing is how many good restaurants there are in Austin. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5444.2s)]
*  For a city that's relatively small. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5449.2s)]
*  Good restaurants per capita is excellent. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5451.2s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5454.2s)]
*  And they're so good. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5455.2s)]
*  There's so many like artisan restaurants. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5456.2s)]
*  We just found a new one that Brian Simpson told us about. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5458.2s)]
*  It's called Bacalar. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5461.2s)]
*  It's this Mexican restaurant that's a town. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5462.2s)]
*  It's fantastic. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5465.2s)]
*  Really good. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5466.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5467.2s)]
*  They just opened up. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5468.2s)]
*  I think they were only open for like six weeks. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5469.2s)]
*  So shout out to them. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5470.2s)]
*  Just ate there the other night. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5471.2s)]
*  Okay. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5472.2s)]
*  It's just there's so many good places here. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5473.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5475.2s)]
*  Like you can't have a bad restaurant in this town. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5476.2s)]
*  You will go under quickly. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5477.2s)]

*  What part of Texas is that? [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5741.84s)]
*  Well, the Starship stuff is in South Texas, near the border, just right on the rear grand. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5743.84s)]
*  And how did you pick that location? [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5749.84s)]
*  I was just literally looking at satellite images. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5754.84s)]
*  And for going to orbit, you kind of need to, you want to launch eastward so that you can [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5760.84s)]
*  take advantage of Earth rotation to get to orbit. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5765.84s)]
*  So it's a little counterintuitive that reaching orbital velocity, getting to orbit is about [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5768.84s)]
*  your speed parallel to the Earth's surface. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5776.84s)]
*  It's like how fast are you zooming around Earth? [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5778.84s)]
*  It's not a, like the gravity at the altitude of the space station is almost the same as [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5781.84s)]
*  it is on the ground. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5787.84s)]
*  The reason the space station is actually up there, it's kind of the wrong terminology. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5788.84s)]
*  It's actually moving around the Earth at 17,000 miles an hour. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5792.84s)]
*  So the space station goes around the Earth at roughly every 90 minutes. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5796.84s)]
*  So, and because Earth is turning and the speed at which it is turning, or the way you experience [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5802.84s)]
*  velocity is, it's moving at roughly 1,000 miles an hour at the equator. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5814.84s)]
*  So the closer you are to the equator, the more you can take advantage of Earth rotation [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5818.84s)]
*  to reach orbital velocity. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5822.84s)]
*  So you want to, and since it's rotating eastward, you want to be on the east coast to get, to [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5825.84s)]
*  make it easier to get to orbital velocity. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5832.84s)]
*  So you need a section of coast that's on the east, fairly southward, that is not occupied. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5835.84s)]
*  So, like most of, really almost all of Florida, except for Cape Canaveral, is wall-to-wall [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5843.84s)]
*  houses on the beach. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5851.84s)]
*  Like there's almost no section of Florida that, every section of Florida has houses, [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5852.84s)]
*  except for Cape Canaveral, which is government based. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5857.84s)]
*  So one of the few spots that wasn't occupied was the area just adjacent to the border with [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5862.84s)]
*  Mexico. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5870.84s)]
*  And it just wasn't super well suited to holiday homes. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5872.84s)]
*  And there was at one point a development that was going to take place, but then a hurricane [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5880.84s)]
*  came and destroyed the entire place. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5884.84s)]
*  And in fact rearranged the land, so some of the plots were underwater. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5886.84s)]
*  So it's kind of a, it's a tough spot to build a home, and that's why it was unoccupied. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5891.84s)]
*  So we needed a piece of, and it needed to be US territory, because if we go outside [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5899.84s)]
*  the US, there are export restrictions, because rocket technology is an advanced weapons technology. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5903.84s)]
*  So we can't just like, you know, arbitrarily go to another country. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5909.84s)]
*  So it needed to be US land, east coast, and fairly southward. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5915.84s)]
*  That's fascinating that rockets... [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5922.84s)]
*  It's one of the few spots that exists like that. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5924.84s)]
*  That rockets fall into the category of weapons technology. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5926.84s)]
*  Yeah, intercontinental ballistic missiles. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5930.84s)]
*  I mean, it makes sense. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5932.84s)]
*  Yeah, we could drop a rocket anywhere. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5934.84s)]
*  Nobody could stop us. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5936.84s)]
*  Wow. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5938.84s)]
*  That is crazy about the space station too. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5940.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5942.84s)]
*  It's going 17,000 miles an hour. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5943.84s)]
*  Yes. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5946.84s)]
*  I mean, you've seen the videos of the rocket landing, right? [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5948.84s)]
*  Yes. It's amazing. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5951.84s)]
*  It's very precise. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5952.84s)]
*  It's pretty fucking amazing. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5953.84s)]
*  We could make land basically anywhere. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5954.84s)]
*  No. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5956.84s)]
*  Or not land. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5957.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5959.84s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't have to turn on the thrusters to slow down. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5960.84s)]
*  What is it like to try to juggle these different things in your mind on a daily basis? [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5964.84s)]
*  Like, what is it like to try to juggle X, Tesla, SpaceX, all these different things at the same time? [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5972.84s)]
*  It's a lot for a human brain to handle. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5980.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5985.84s)]
*  I would imagine. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5986.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5987.84s)]
*  It strains my meat computer. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5988.84s)]
*  I mean, do you need something like that though? [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5992.84s)]
*  Does your meat computer need more problem solving than the average one? [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=5995.84s)]
*  I mean, is this something like if you only had one thing to work on, do you think you would get bored? [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6002.84s)]
*  Or you would get distracted or you would not be satisfied? [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6009.84s)]
*  Like, do you need these things to be so complex and have so many of them simultaneously juggling? [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6013.84s)]
*  Because you didn't pick three easy ones. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6021.84s)]
*  You picked three of the fucking hardest things you could ever get into. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6024.84s)]
*  You already detailed how difficult manufacturing is. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6027.84s)]
*  Rockets, duh, it's one of the craziest things. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6030.84s)]
*  Not only that. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6033.84s)]
*  Rocket science. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6034.84s)]
*  Completely innovative rockets that land. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6035.84s)]
*  That never happened before, so you're doing that. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6039.84s)]
*  And then you said, you know what, we've got to save humanity. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6042.84s)]
*  Let me go spend $44 billion on Twitter. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6045.84s)]
*  Man, that was expensive. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6048.84s)]
*  What's it worth? [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6050.84s)]
*  What do you think it was actually worth? [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6052.84s)]
*  Everything. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6057.84s)]
*  Yeah, not for the market. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6058.84s)]
*  I mean, like, for humans, yes, I agree with you. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6060.84s)]
*  I mean, I really genuinely do think this, and I've said this many times publicly, [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6064.84s)]
*  I think you did humanity an immense service. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6068.84s)]
*  And that if that didn't happen, the narrative of this country would have gone further and further down that road [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6072.84s)]
*  to the point where people would have been scared to speak their mind. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6078.84s)]
*  And they would have been scared. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6081.84s)]
*  And it changes the way people communicate at their jobs, which changes the way, [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6082.84s)]
*  it just changes the way people, when they leave universities and they go to get jobs, [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6089.84s)]
*  the way they're allowed to communicate, and people don't like to be on the outside. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6095.84s)]
*  They don't like to be ostracized. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6101.84s)]
*  They don't like to be kicked out of communities. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6102.84s)]
*  So people would adhere. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6104.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, absolutely. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6106.84s)]
*  I feel like I guess are afraid of being ostracized. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6108.84s)]
*  If you're being ostracized, I think is probably the biggest issue. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6111.84s)]
*  And they're just being totally shut down, where you have no outlet [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6116.84s)]
*  and you can just basically disappear except for in-person meetings. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6121.84s)]
*  So, yeah, it was important to steer, have at least one social media outlet that wasn't canceling people. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6127.84s)]
*  What I really enjoy is reading the tweets. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6146.84s)]
*  I guess you still have to call them tweets. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6150.84s)]
*  I don't have a good word for it. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6152.84s)]
*  Yeah, you can't say the exes. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6154.84s)]
*  All my exes live in Texas. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6156.84s)]
*  Reading the words, I should say. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6158.84s)]
*  I enjoy reading the words of people who proclaimed that they were leaving and going over to threads. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6162.84s)]
*  That's an interesting thing about momentum. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6168.84s)]
*  Very difficult to start a whole new social media platform. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6173.84s)]
*  Even one that initially got like, what do threads get? [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6177.84s)]
*  Like some crazy number of initial people signing up for it. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6181.84s)]
*  But it just dropped off within like a couple of weeks. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6185.84s)]
*  Now it's a fucking ghost town. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6188.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, wild. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6190.84s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6192.84s)]
*  I mean, Zach himself doesn't post. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6194.84s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6196.84s)]
*  You got to use your own product. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6198.84s)]
*  It's interesting though, because they're sneaking them in now in Instagram. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6200.84s)]
*  They sneak a little thread in there. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6204.84s)]
*  Because every now and then I'll see something, oh, that's interesting. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6206.84s)]
*  And I click on it. Oh, you motherfucker. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6208.84s)]
*  And it opens up threads for me. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6210.84s)]
*  Fuck, you got me. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6212.84s)]
*  Because they're integrated. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6214.84s)]
*  I don't use Instagram. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6216.84s)]
*  It's fascinating that, I'm sure you don't. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6218.84s)]
*  Why would you? [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6220.84s)]
*  If I bought X or Twitter, whatever, I wouldn't use anything else either. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6222.84s)]
*  Yeah, but I didn't use Instagram for a while. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6225.84s)]
*  I mean, there was a time when I was posting on Instagram, but I found myself doing selfies. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6228.84s)]
*  And I'm like, what the hell is wrong with me? [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6236.84s)]
*  Why am I posing with selfies to get likes? This is crazy. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6240.84s)]
*  Bizarre. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6244.84s)]
*  So then I was like, if you post with selfies on Twitter, people would jump all over you. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6246.84s)]
*  Yeah, they would. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6255.84s)]
*  That's true. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6257.84s)]
*  They were like, what's wrong with you? [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6259.84s)]
*  That's so true. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6261.84s)]
*  I don't use Instagram for some strange reason. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6263.84s)]
*  It's like pretty pictures, basically. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6265.84s)]
*  Yeah. Pretty pictures and a lot of bullshit. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6268.84s)]
*  There's a lot of weirdness that comes with Instagram, like filters. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6271.84s)]
*  I've caught grown men using filters on their pictures. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6275.84s)]
*  It's very strange. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6280.84s)]
*  I am concerned that, say, Instagram actually leads to more unhappiness, not less, [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6282.84s)]
*  in the sense that it just looks like everyone's having a great time and is way better looking than they really are. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6290.84s)]
*  And so you're like, man, everyone's good looking and having a great time. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6298.84s)]
*  And then you sort of compare yourself to that and it's like, damn, I'm not as good looking and I seem to be sad a lot. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6301.84s)]
*  And then you're like, man, I think it could make you kind of depressed. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6310.84s)]
*  Yeah, and also, you're a grown man and you experience this. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6315.84s)]
*  You're also very intelligent. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6319.84s)]
*  You experience this. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6320.84s)]
*  Imagine being a young kid. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6321.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6322.84s)]
*  Jonathan Haidt documented that in The Coddling of the American Mind. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6323.84s)]
*  There's a direct correlation between the invention of social media and its ubiquitous use and self-harm amongst kids, particularly girls. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6327.84s)]
*  It's really bad for girls. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6335.84s)]
*  And around 2007-ish, there's this big uptick on suicide, self-harm, depression. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6337.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6347.84s)]
*  People can't just make themselves be better looking with the limit. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6349.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6353.84s)]
*  Yeah, and then surgery. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6355.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6358.84s)]
*  There's a big uptick in people getting their jaws reshaped and shit. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6359.84s)]
*  I mean, yeah, that's too bad. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6362.84s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6364.84s)]
*  I think, you know, I think like the FCA, like is Instagram a net happiness generator or not? [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6365.84s)]
*  I'm not sure it is. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6377.84s)]
*  Speaking of distorted images, have you seen the court artists' drawing of Sam Bankman Fried? [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6378.84s)]
*  I mean, it looks like they lost money or something. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6384.84s)]
*  What the fuck happened? [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6386.84s)]
*  It looks like it melted. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6387.84s)]
*  Have you seen it? [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6388.84s)]
*  It looks like a supermodel. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6389.84s)]
*  Oh, wait, SPF does? [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6391.84s)]
*  Yes. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6393.84s)]
*  The guy who drew him. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6394.84s)]
*  One of them I saw. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6396.84s)]
*  Maybe there's more than one artist. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6398.84s)]
*  Maybe there's more than one artist because some of those ones I saw were unflattering. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6399.84s)]
*  He looked like an anime superhero. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6403.84s)]
*  You're joking. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6405.84s)]
*  No, no, like perfect chiseled jawline. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6406.84s)]
*  Ridiculous. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6409.84s)]
*  He looked like he lost 30 pounds, started working out. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6410.84s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6412.84s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6413.84s)]
*  Are you kidding? [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6414.84s)]
*  What the fuck, man? [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6415.84s)]
*  Look at that guy on the left. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6416.84s)]
*  That guy looks like Superman. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6417.84s)]
*  Doesn't he? [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6419.84s)]
*  Look how hot that guy is. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6420.84s)]
*  I almost feel like it's not accurate. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6422.84s)]
*  It's like Clark can't do something. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6424.84s)]
*  It might be. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6425.84s)]
*  I feel like someone's fucking with us. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6426.84s)]
*  There's a few other pictures when I Googled. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6427.84s)]
*  There's some rough pictures, though. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6429.84s)]
*  It seems like someone's fucking with us because that guy's handsome as fuck. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6431.84s)]
*  Because there's this one that's not the same. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6434.84s)]
*  No, that one's terrible. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6436.84s)]
*  What is that? [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6437.84s)]
*  That's not real. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6438.84s)]
*  That's Satan's drawing. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6439.84s)]
*  But that one right there, if that is real, it's like, come on. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6440.84s)]
*  That's not real. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6444.84s)]
*  This is bullshit. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6446.84s)]
*  That's bullshit because look at what they did with the girl. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6447.84s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6450.84s)]
*  Look at that picture. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6451.84s)]
*  Even that picture is hilarious. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6452.84s)]
*  Carol looks like she's melting. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6453.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6454.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6455.84s)]
*  I have to ... [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6456.84s)]
*  But she's probably massively depressed. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6457.84s)]
*  I bet that's also like it's artist's interpretation of the energy she's giving off in court. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6461.84s)]
*  She has to rat on her boyfriend and she's already pleaded guilty and for a lesser sentence, [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6467.84s)]
*  she's going to rat him out. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6472.84s)]
*  That whole thing is ... [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6474.84s)]
*  SPS, a PR team is, but they're doing an incredible job. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6475.84s)]
*  For real? [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6479.84s)]
*  Well, I mean, the dude, tons of people often stole their money and yet he's getting basically [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6480.84s)]
*  back rubbed from the press. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6490.84s)]
*  Well, don't you think that's because of the amount of money that he donated? [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6491.84s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6495.84s)]
*  I don't know what the deal is. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6496.84s)]
*  It might have something to do with that. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6497.84s)]
*  I'm not that cynical. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6499.84s)]
*  I generally don't think people are influenced by money. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6501.84s)]
*  Well, I don't know what he's doing, but ... [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6503.84s)]
*  Something's going on. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6505.84s)]
*  The number of articles they've seen where it's basically a misunderstood philanthropist [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6506.84s)]
*  is ridiculous. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6517.84s)]
*  Well, your bullshit meter went off when he was offering money to buy in with you with [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6518.84s)]
*  Twitter, correct? [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6525.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6526.84s)]
*  A large amount. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6527.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6528.84s)]
*  I mean, a lot of people fell for his bullshit. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6530.84s)]
*  First of all, I hadn't really heard of the guy. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6537.84s)]
*  I'm like, who is this guy? [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6542.84s)]
*  What did he do? [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6544.84s)]
*  He's in the Bahamas. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6545.84s)]
*  That's pretty sus to begin with. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6546.84s)]
*  Very sus. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6549.84s)]
*  If you're on a tropical island, finance organizations in tropical islands generally have a bad track [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6550.84s)]
*  record. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6557.84s)]
*  And he's involved in crypto. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6558.84s)]
*  And crypto is ... [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6560.84s)]
*  Which is like ... [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6561.84s)]
*  There's a lot of ... The scam probability in crypto is high. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6562.84s)]
*  It's high. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6565.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6566.84s)]
*  I'm not saying it's all scams, but ... [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6567.84s)]
*  No. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6568.84s)]
*  I would leave that distinction for ... What are those fucking NFTs? [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6569.84s)]
*  I think that's like 80% of scam. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6574.84s)]
*  Except for Beeple. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6577.84s)]
*  Beeple's legit. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6578.84s)]
*  I mean ... [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6579.84s)]
*  What gives you digital art? [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6580.84s)]
*  Yeah, Beeple's stuff is great. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6581.84s)]
*  But, I mean, NFT is the funny thing is that the NFT is not even on the blockchain. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6584.84s)]
*  It's just a URL to the JPEG. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6587.84s)]
*  So it's not even like ... You should at least encode the JPEG in the blockchain. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6590.84s)]
*  Because if the URL ... If the company housing the image goes out of business, you don't [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6596.84s)]
*  have the image anymore. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6601.84s)]
*  I never understood it. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6602.84s)]
*  I tried so hard. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6604.84s)]
*  I tried so hard. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6605.84s)]
*  I know. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6606.84s)]
*  I have a friend who made millions selling NFM artists. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6607.84s)]
*  I'm like, okay. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6611.84s)]
*  Save that money. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6612.84s)]
*  Because eventually people are going to figure this out. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6614.84s)]
*  With art, there is a fair bit of money laundering and tax avoidance that is ... So some of these [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6617.84s)]
*  things that seem inexplicable ... [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6624.84s)]
*  Like Hunter Biden? [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6626.84s)]
*  You're going to talk about Hunter Biden's paintings? [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6627.84s)]
*  Did he actually sell paintings for large sums of money? [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6630.84s)]
*  Immense sums of money. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6633.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6634.84s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of dollars. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6635.84s)]
*  Probably that seems unlikely to be a legit transaction. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6636.84s)]
*  Unlikely, right? [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6640.84s)]
*  Unlikely. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6641.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6642.84s)]
*  The work's not bad though, I've got to say. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6643.84s)]
*  That kind of bullshit art, it's not that bad. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6646.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6649.84s)]
*  The thing is that it's hard to price art because it's in the eye of the beholder. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6650.84s)]
*  How can you say whether something ... [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6655.84s)]
*  This is his stuff. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6657.84s)]
*  How much does that go for? [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6658.84s)]
*  $225K. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6659.84s)]
*  A steal. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6660.84s)]
*  It's not that bad. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6661.84s)]
*  It's not that bad. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6664.84s)]
*  I would buy that. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6667.84s)]
*  I wouldn't buy it for $225K, but I'll buy it for $5K. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6668.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6671.84s)]
*  It's not bad. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6672.84s)]
*  Look, a lot of crackheads are good artists. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6673.84s)]
*  You get crazy on drugs and splatter some shit around and you got a unique vision. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6676.84s)]
*  That's not bad. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6681.84s)]
*  That's not bad. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6682.84s)]
*  That is not bad at all. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6683.84s)]
*  How much does that one go for? [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6684.84s)]
*  $500K. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6686.84s)]
*  So he's probably a legit ... Meanwhile, we're going to find out he had a ghost artist. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6687.84s)]
*  I suspect he ... [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6691.84s)]
*  He's probably a ghost artist. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6692.84s)]
*  I think he's not untalented. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6693.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6696.84s)]
*  I actually don't have any issues with his lifestyle or anything. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6697.84s)]
*  There's his stuff. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6702.84s)]
*  That stuff's not bad. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6703.84s)]
*  Whatever that dog wolf thing is on the wall, that's pretty dope. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6704.84s)]
*  I like that. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6708.84s)]
*  What does it say underneath that? [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6710.84s)]
*  Can you read it? [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6713.84s)]
*  I can't read it. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6714.84s)]
*  Either way, not bad. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6718.84s)]
*  It's not bad. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6721.84s)]
*  Have you ever heard the theory that the entire modern art movement like Jackson Pollock and [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6722.84s)]
*  the like was a CIA Psy-op? [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6729.84s)]
*  I have heard that, but I have not heard any evidence for it. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6736.84s)]
*  I read the article a couple years ago. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6739.84s)]
*  At least. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6741.84s)]
*  Modern Art is a Psy-op? [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6742.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6743.84s)]
*  Every day I wake up, there's another Psy-op. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6744.84s)]
*  It maybe wasn't that long ago. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6745.84s)]
*  But it was fascinating. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6746.84s)]
*  Repeat. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6747.84s)]
*  Yeah, every day. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6748.84s)]
*  There's always something. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6749.84s)]
*  Cat with a tinfoil hat. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6751.84s)]
*  When was this? [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6752.84s)]
*  The beginning of 2020. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6753.84s)]
*  Was modern art really a CIA Psy-op? [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6754.84s)]
*  But if you can get someone to spend that kind of money on that kind of shit like the Jackson [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6755.84s)]
*  Pollock stuff. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6764.84s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6768.84s)]
*  Preeminent culture war, Cold War, what is it? [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6772.84s)]
*  The relationship between modern art and American diplomacy began during World War II. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6775.84s)]
*  Museum, MoMA, Battle for Hearts and Minds. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6780.84s)]
*  It's an interesting article. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6785.84s)]
*  I read the article a couple years ago. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6789.84s)]
*  I can't remember what their argument was. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6791.84s)]
*  But it's one of those things. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6793.84s)]
*  It starts there. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6795.84s)]
*  They spent money to buy paintings directly from artists. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6796.84s)]
*  Oh. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6799.84s)]
*  In the 40s. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6800.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6801.84s)]
*  Even though modern art and American diplomacy were of a piece, Soviet propaganda asserted [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6802.84s)]
*  that the United States was a culturally barren capitalist wasteland. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6807.84s)]
*  To make the case for American cultural dynamism, the State Department in 1946 spent $49,000 [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6812.84s)]
*  to purchase 79 paintings directly from American modern artists and mounted them in a traveling [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6820.84s)]
*  exhibition called Advancing American Art. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6826.84s)]
*  That exhibition, which made stops in Europe and Latin America, included work from artists [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6829.84s)]
*  like Georgia O'Keeffe and Jake. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6834.84s)]
*  Georgia O'Keeffe is the lady who makes vaginas, right? [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6836.84s)]
*  Isn't that her work? [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6838.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6840.84s)]
*  I think that is some of what she does. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6841.84s)]
*  I think she makes like vagina flowers and stuff. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6843.84s)]
*  I think so. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6850.84s)]
*  It was pretty good. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6851.84s)]
*  Well, the Jackson Pollock one, I was like, how did, come on. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6853.84s)]
*  What happened there? [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6856.84s)]
*  That one is just wild because I really think I could do that. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6857.84s)]
*  Some of this shit is like Jackson Pollock and the CIA teamed up to win the Cold War. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6861.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6866.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6867.84s)]
*  I think that's the article I read because that's 2017. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6868.84s)]
*  I don't remember. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6871.84s)]
*  Well, I think art is very much in the eye of the beholder. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6873.84s)]
*  It's like, what does it make you, how does it make you think and feel? [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6877.84s)]
*  And if it makes you think and feel in a way that you like, then it's good. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6880.84s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6884.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6885.84s)]
*  But it's also a way to launder money. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6886.84s)]
*  Yes. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6889.84s)]
*  A number of these like very high price art things are tax evasion and money laundering. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6890.84s)]
*  Have you ever seen the documentary on the lost Leonardo? [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6897.84s)]
*  No. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6900.84s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6903.84s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6904.84s)]
*  MBS purchased this. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6905.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6906.84s)]
*  And he purchased it for some insane amount of money. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6907.84s)]
*  It turns out it probably isn't Leonardo da Vinci's. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6909.84s)]
*  Leonardo da Vinci's, not only that, but the vast majority of the painting was made by a modern age woman who recreated everything. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6912.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6921.84s)]
*  Like so she in restoring, air quotes restoring, she essentially repainted the image in the style of da Vinci. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6922.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6932.84s)]
*  And it's very sketchy because if you look at the original painting, it was all fucked up and missing paint and there was many layers. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6933.84s)]
*  Someone had painted over it. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6939.84s)]
*  It's really an incredible documentary because it just shows how much fuckery is involved in these high dollar transactions. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6941.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6949.84s)]
*  And I think it went, I think it was the most expensive painting that was ever sold. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6950.84s)]
*  I think it went for something in the neighborhood of four hundred million dollars. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6954.84s)]
*  Four hundred fifty million dollars. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6957.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6959.84s)]
*  The Lost Leonardo, a new film solved the mystery of the world's most expensive painting, is the four hundred fifty million dollar Salvatore Mundy, a fake. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6960.84s)]
*  This film featuring tearful sycophants, sneering experts, dodgy dealers in a secretive super yacht may finally settle the great da Vinci controversy. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6968.84s)]
*  Apparently there's multiple layers and different styles of painting involved in it. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6979.84s)]
*  And when they do some sort of a comprehensive examination, whether it's like, you know, I don't know what kind of imagery they're using, they're doing something where they could say like, this has been painted many times and fucked with. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6985.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6997.84s)]
*  It might have originally been one of Leonardo students. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=6998.84s)]
*  Might not have been Leonardo. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7001.84s)]
*  Like there's not a real clear. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7003.84s)]
*  It's dated to that time? [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7005.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7006.84s)]
*  OK. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7007.84s)]
*  But whether it was Sotheby's that sold it? [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7008.84s)]
*  I think so. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7010.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7011.84s)]
*  So they were kind of aware that there were some shenanigans with this piece, but they also were aware that this was gonna cha-ching. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7012.84s)]
*  This was Three Lemons. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7020.84s)]
*  This was, they were going to hit the jackpot with this bad boy. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7021.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7024.84s)]
*  And so they went through with it and yeah. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7025.84s)]
*  Christie's. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7029.84s)]
*  Christie's. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7030.84s)]
*  That's it. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7031.84s)]
*  The other one. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7032.84s)]
*  Christie's was aware. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7033.84s)]
*  It's a fascinating documentary. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7034.84s)]
*  I don't know what's right. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7036.84s)]
*  I don't know what's wrong. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7037.84s)]
*  It might be real. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7038.84s)]
*  But at the very least, it's been retouched mostly by this woman. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7039.84s)]
*  Isn't it like 90 percent of the painting? [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7043.84s)]
*  It's some. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7047.84s)]
*  There's some very high percentage of the painting that was actually made by this woman. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7048.84s)]
*  And they show her. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7052.84s)]
*  She worked on it forever, for years and years, worked like painstakingly to retouch this piece of art. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7053.84s)]
*  Which is very odd. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7064.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7065.84s)]
*  That they do that. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7066.84s)]
*  Because like, wouldn't you just want it all fucked up and old? [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7068.84s)]
*  Sure. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7071.84s)]
*  I mean, that's the real piece of art. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7072.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7073.84s)]
*  The real piece of art is not like some woman in 2001 painting over it. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7074.84s)]
*  That's just crazy. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7079.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7080.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7082.84s)]
*  I enjoy art for the aesthetics, but not for the name value. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7086.84s)]
*  Yeah, I feel the same way. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7090.84s)]
*  I enjoy art just because I just... [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7092.84s)]
*  What it makes you, how it makes you feel. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7095.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7097.84s)]
*  It's a cool thing. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7098.84s)]
*  I mean, obviously my studios fill with it. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7101.84s)]
*  You go outside. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7103.84s)]
*  I love art. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7104.84s)]
*  It's everywhere out there. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7105.84s)]
*  I'm just... [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7106.84s)]
*  I love it. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7107.84s)]
*  Have you seen... [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7108.84s)]
*  Have you seen the woman? [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7109.84s)]
*  Have you seen the piece that she made of you? [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7110.84s)]
*  This Melania Blackman? [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7112.84s)]
*  Have you seen that drawing that she did? [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7113.84s)]
*  Is that the weird one? [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7115.84s)]
*  It's everything... [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7117.84s)]
*  It's enormous. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7118.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7119.84s)]
*  She draws it, and you're essentially made up of all these different characters and different [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7120.84s)]
*  things. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7127.84s)]
*  See where you find her work of this. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7128.84s)]
*  She did one of me, and she did one of Anthony Bourdain that I bought that's out there as [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7129.84s)]
*  well. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7133.84s)]
*  She's super talented, this woman. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7134.84s)]
*  So, this is her. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7137.84s)]
*  She's really hot too. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7138.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7139.84s)]
*  See if you can find her standing next to it. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7140.84s)]
*  There it is. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7144.84s)]
*  Instagram Bandit or something. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7147.84s)]
*  Instagram Bandit? [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7151.84s)]
*  Oh, that was right. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7152.84s)]
*  Why the fan? [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7153.84s)]
*  There was something that happened where Instagram did something... [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7154.84s)]
*  What happened? [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7158.84s)]
*  So, Instagram has not only banned me from promoting this artwork, but also shadow banned [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7159.84s)]
*  me altogether after I posted my latest piece. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7166.84s)]
*  This is after probably you said that you wanted to fight Zucker. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7169.84s)]
*  Well actually, I was just... [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7172.84s)]
*  The Zuck fight is funny because he was posting all these fight videos, and then someone on [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7173.84s)]
*  Twitter at the time said, hey, you should fight Zuck. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7181.84s)]
*  And I said, well, I'm willing to fight if he is. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7186.84s)]
*  And then Zuck posted, I think on Instagram or something, name the place or something, [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7191.84s)]
*  something of that effect. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7197.84s)]
*  And I was like, okay, how about the Vegas Octagon? [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7199.84s)]
*  And then Italy actually was willing to let us use the Coliseum. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7204.84s)]
*  So, then I was like, well, let's... [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7211.84s)]
*  Can't turn that down, you know? [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7214.84s)]
*  And then I was like, well, if it's going to be in the Coliseum, I like UFC and everything, [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7217.84s)]
*  but we don't want to have tons of ads and UFC branding on the Coliseum because it's [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7223.84s)]
*  a historical place, it's a place with great history. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7228.84s)]
*  You don't want to just have it be all like NASCAR. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7232.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7237.84s)]
*  So, then Zuck pulled out. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7238.84s)]
*  He was the pull out method. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7241.84s)]
*  So, he pulled out of it? [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7244.84s)]
*  He pulled out of it? [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7246.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7247.84s)]
*  Oh. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7248.84s)]
*  What was the narrative? [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7249.84s)]
*  What did you hear, Jamie? [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7251.84s)]
*  I don't remember. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7252.84s)]
*  Well, I know you did. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7253.84s)]
*  I'm willing to... [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7254.84s)]
*  So, he was like, oh, no, it's got to be UFC rules. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7255.84s)]
*  I'm like, well, okay, we're going to have UFC rules in the Coliseum. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7257.84s)]
*  It's fine, but we just don't want to have... [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7261.84s)]
*  We've got to respect the historical integrity of the place. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7262.84s)]
*  The Coliseum just seems like the coolest place to do it. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7266.84s)]
*  That's why. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7268.84s)]
*  I mean, gladiator, you know? [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7269.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7270.84s)]
*  Come on. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7271.84s)]
*  If they said it's okay. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7272.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7273.84s)]
*  So, he just wants it to be in the actual UFC, like in Vegas? [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7274.84s)]
*  So, then he said, oh, well, you know, he accused me of not being serious. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7277.84s)]
*  I said, look, listen, at the end of the day, I'll fight you any place, anywhere, under any [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7281.84s)]
*  rules. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7287.84s)]
*  Oh. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7288.84s)]
*  Zuck, that's what I said. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7289.84s)]
*  Wow. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7290.84s)]
*  So, I'm, you know, name the... [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7291.84s)]
*  He said name the place. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7292.84s)]
*  I'm like, I'm happy to fight him in a house, on a mouse, with a louse. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7293.84s)]
*  We're like, go for Dr. Seuss here. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7300.84s)]
*  Now, how much time... [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7302.84s)]
*  I'm way bigger than him. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7303.84s)]
*  This is unfair. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7304.84s)]
*  I know you... [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7305.84s)]
*  I don't think you should fight me. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7306.84s)]
*  Because you're so much bigger than him? [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7307.84s)]
*  Yeah, I'm like 50 percent bigger than him. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7308.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7309.84s)]
*  I'll just use a wall... [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7310.84s)]
*  I've got my patented walrus move. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7311.84s)]
*  I'm just lying to him. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7312.84s)]
*  A walrus move? [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7313.84s)]
*  Well, you know, like a walrus doesn't need martial arts training. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7314.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7317.84s)]
*  Because it's really big. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7318.84s)]
*  You don't want to go wrestling a walrus. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7319.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7320.84s)]
*  Because he's going to roll on you. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7321.84s)]
*  Have you ever been... [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7322.84s)]
*  Ever rolled with someone who's much smaller than you that does jiu-jitsu? [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7323.84s)]
*  Yes. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7324.84s)]
*  I've never rolled with someone who's much smaller than me. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7325.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7327.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7328.84s)]
*  No, I did 10 years of martial arts. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7329.84s)]
*  How much have you trained personally? [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7330.84s)]
*  I did for a decade. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7331.84s)]
*  Well, you did a lot of karate, right? [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7332.84s)]
*  I did... [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7333.84s)]
*  Judo? [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7334.84s)]
*  Judo, Kai, Shun Kai, karate. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7335.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7336.84s)]
*  I did some jiu-jitsu, taekwondo, street fighting, which I was involuntary. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7337.84s)]
*  I did a lot of karate. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7342.84s)]
*  I did a lot of karate. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7345.84s)]
*  I did a lot of karate. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7348.84s)]
*  I did martial arts competitions when I was a teenager. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7352.84s)]
*  Really? [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7355.84s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7356.84s)]
*  So look at you. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7357.84s)]
*  George St. Pierre, Elon, John Donahue, the great master, and Lex Friedman. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7358.84s)]
*  But like Lex is... [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7359.84s)]
*  I think he's got like 20% heavier than Zuck. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7360.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7361.84s)]
*  And I'm way bigger than Lex. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7362.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7363.84s)]
*  That's why they have weight categories. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7364.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7365.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7366.84s)]
*  Did you get a chance to compete with someone who's a little bit bigger than you? [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7367.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7368.84s)]
*  I did. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7369.84s)]
*  I did. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7370.84s)]
*  I did. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7371.84s)]
*  I did. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7372.84s)]
*  I did. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7373.84s)]

*  I did. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7378.84s)]
*  I did. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7379.84s)]
*  Did you get a chance to talk to Donahue at all? [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7380.84s)]
*  The guy on the left? [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7383.84s)]
*  That guy's fascinating. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7384.84s)]
*  Yeah, no, no. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7385.84s)]
*  Do you know his history? [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7386.84s)]
*  No. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7387.84s)]
*  He's from New Zealand or something. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7388.84s)]
*  He was a professor of philosophy at Columbia. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7389.84s)]
*  Okay. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7391.84s)]
*  And fell in love with Jiu Jitsu. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7392.84s)]
*  Okay. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7393.84s)]
*  I mean, fell in love with it to the point where he was sleeping on the mats and teaching all [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7394.84s)]
*  day long. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7397.34s)]
*  He's an obsessive. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7398.34s)]
*  He is a real Kaizen disciple. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7399.8s)]
*  He seems Zen. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7402.84s)]
*  Oh, man. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7403.84s)]
*  He is one of the most unique characters I've ever met in my life. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7404.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7408.34s)]
*  He's one of the most resilient men I've ever met, and he's completely dedicated to Jiu [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7409.84s)]
*  Jitsu. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7413.7s)]
*  And he has raised through this, particularly this one disciple, Gordon Ryan, who also lives [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7414.7s)]
*  here in Austin. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7418.68s)]
*  He's the greatest Jiu Jitsu competitor of all time. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7419.9400000000005s)]
*  There's no question. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7421.9400000000005s)]
*  And he's only 28. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7422.9400000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7423.9400000000005s)]
*  He might even be 27, or maybe he's 28 now. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7424.9400000000005s)]
*  But I mean, he is universally regarded as the greatest of all time. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7427.06s)]
*  And he is John's greatest student. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7430.3s)]
*  Okay. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7432.14s)]
*  And the two of them together, because Gordon has insane work ethic. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7433.14s)]
*  They work 365 days a year. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7436.56s)]
*  They do not take any days off. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7438.6s)]
*  They train every day. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7439.88s)]
*  That's Gordon to the right of John with the crazy beard. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7441.120000000001s)]
*  He doesn't really have that hair. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7444.240000000001s)]
*  He bleaches it. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7445.240000000001s)]
*  But the two of them together are literally an unstoppable combination. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7446.240000000001s)]
*  I like how he looks ripped. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7449.84s)]
*  He's pretty ripped. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7451.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7452.06s)]
*  He's a combination of gigantic, brilliant, and insanely dedicated with the most incredible [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7453.06s)]
*  instructor that's ever existed. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7458.200000000001s)]
*  I mean, John Donahue is universally regarded as the greatest Jiu Jitsu instructor alive. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7459.88s)]
*  And his student is universally regarded as the greatest Jiu Jitsu competitor alive. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7466.16s)]
*  And it is because John is like a complete, like a guy out of a superhero book. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7471.72s)]
*  Like you wouldn't, you're not going to find another one of those. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7477.68s)]
*  A guy with a genius level IQ who's one of, I mean, you talk to him, he's fascinating. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7481.32s)]
*  And he is obsessed with combat sports, warfare, like strategy. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7486.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7493.84s)]
*  Brilliant guy. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7494.84s)]
*  I was impressed when I met him. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7496.52s)]
*  I mean, the things that like, if I was fighting someone who I was not, where I was not much [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7500.16s)]
*  bigger than them, then I would be more concerned. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7505.64s)]
*  How much time did you need to prepare? [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7508.64s)]
*  I don't need any time. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7513.16s)]
*  No time at all? [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7514.76s)]
*  No. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7515.76s)]
*  How's your cardio? [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7516.76s)]
*  No, it's not, that will not be a factor. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7517.76s)]
*  Really? [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7520.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7521.76s)]
*  Very likely. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7522.76s)]
*  What's the likelihood of this actually happening? [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7524.68s)]
*  I'm willing to do it anytime, anywhere, anyplace, any role. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7528.08s)]
*  Well, I think that stating it this way might accelerate this process, especially on this [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7530.52s)]
*  platform. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7534.84s)]
*  I mean, I challenge him to a duel under any circumstances. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7535.84s)]
*  Sword fight? [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7540.56s)]
*  Sure. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7541.56s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7542.56s)]
*  Pistols at dawn. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7543.56s)]
*  That's not necessary. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7544.56s)]
*  I think physical hand-in-hand. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7547.280000000001s)]
*  Nerf guns at noon. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7548.64s)]
*  Yeah, nerf guns at noon. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7549.64s)]
*  You could slash it out in the metaverse, in the real world. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7552.52s)]
*  Listen, there's just a reason they have weight categories. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7557.6s)]
*  So there's a friend of mine who is pretty good at fighting, but she weighs about half [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7563.0s)]
*  of what I do. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7572.700000000001s)]
*  And I said, let me show you why there's weight categories in fighting. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7575.700000000001s)]
*  I'm going to do a move called the walrus, and I'm just going to lie on you. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7580.12s)]
*  I'm not going to put you in a lock or anything. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7584.04s)]
*  I'm just going to lie on you. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7585.04s)]
*  But I'm going to position myself such that it's hard to get out from under me. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7586.84s)]
*  And I'm just going to lie crossways on you, and you try to get away. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7592.64s)]
*  You won't be able to get away, because you couldn't. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7597.28s)]
*  Like if a horse falls on you, you can get trapped under a horse. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7603.64s)]
*  But you're not a horse. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7606.36s)]
*  What do you weigh, about 230? [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7607.36s)]
*  Yeah, 240. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7608.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7609.839999999999s)]
*  So no, I'm not a horse. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7610.839999999999s)]
*  But I'm saying in the limit, if something's heavy enough, if a horse falls on you and [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7613.839999999999s)]
*  dies, you can get trapped under a horse and not be able to get yourself out. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7619.24s)]
*  Right. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7622.24s)]
*  But if someone's good enough, I'm sure you've seen absolute weight classes in jiu-jitsu, [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7623.24s)]
*  where you'll get a 145-pound competitor who strangles a 220-pound competitor, and they're [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7627.4s)]
*  both well-trained. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7631.679999999999s)]
*  Because if someone is that good… [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7632.679999999999s)]
*  That's unlikely. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7634.32s)]
*  That's not unlikely. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7635.32s)]
*  It happens quite often. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7636.32s)]
*  When you get elite competitors, like elite black belts at the 145-pound, 155-pound weight [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7637.8s)]
*  limit, you'd be shocked. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7643.92s)]
*  There's a ton of videos of these guys who will strangle much larger black belts. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7645.28s)]
*  I'm not saying it's impossible. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7650.52s)]
*  It's just not highly unlikely. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7651.92s)]
*  And if this were not the case, there would not be strict weight categories in martial [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7654.08s)]
*  arts. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7657.68s)]
*  That is true. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7658.68s)]
*  That is true. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7659.68s)]
*  But the reason why they allow absolutes in jiu-jitsu is because it is the thrill of watching [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7660.68s)]
*  these smaller people go against much larger people. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7667.86s)]
*  And sometimes they win. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7671.139999999999s)]
*  No, just like armies, people take note when a small army defeats a big army because it [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7672.98s)]
*  is so unusual. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7682.74s)]
*  Yes. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7683.74s)]
*  Not because it's normal. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7684.74s)]
*  Right. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7685.74s)]
*  If it was two against 10,000, and boy, it would beat those two guys up. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7686.74s)]
*  More likely, what happens. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7693.099999999999s)]
*  If you're severely outnumbered, you will lose, almost certainly. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7695.3s)]
*  So look at the size difference between these two guys. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7700.5s)]
*  Play it out. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7704.26s)]
*  Well, it's the end of the video. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7705.26s)]
*  This is Mikey Musimichi, who is another fascinating individual. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7706.46s)]
*  This guy is another super genius who trains every day, 12 hours a day. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7710.400000000001s)]
*  And he is competing against a black belt in the heavyweight division. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7715.900000000001s)]
*  Mikey Musimichi might weigh 145 pounds, and he beats this guy. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7719.62s)]
*  That doesn't look to be in super great shape. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7725.14s)]
*  Well, he's enormous. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7727.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7728.02s)]
*  I mean, he's enormous, and he's a black belt, so he's skilled. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7729.02s)]
*  I forget how Mikey wins this. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7732.780000000001s)]
*  He catches him with something. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7735.1s)]
*  I sort of skipped ahead. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7736.1s)]
*  I couldn't tell what exactly happened. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7737.1s)]
*  Get it a little bit further here. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7738.1s)]
*  I think... [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7739.660000000001s)]
*  What happened here? [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7740.660000000001s)]
*  It seemed like he got penalties or something. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7741.660000000001s)]
*  Oh, they pushed him out of bounds? [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7744.660000000001s)]
*  I don't know what that one on the side. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7745.660000000001s)]
*  I think they're out of bounds. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7746.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's all that it was. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7747.660000000001s)]
*  That's just out of bounds. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7750.660000000001s)]
*  So scoot ahead and see what happens, what he catches him with. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7752.7s)]
*  What happened? [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7756.3s)]
*  I was saying it's impossible. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7757.3s)]
*  It's just very unlikely. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7759.3s)]
*  Oh, so he won by points? [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7760.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I wasn't sure exactly what happened here. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7761.3s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7762.3s)]
*  So he won by points. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7763.3s)]
*  I think you're making the point for me here. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7764.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7765.3s)]
*  Well, in that case. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7766.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7767.3s)]
*  That guy's strangled a lot of much larger people than him. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7768.3s)]
*  But again, he's extraordinary. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7772.0599999999995s)]
*  He's a world champion. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7773.74s)]
*  He's a world champion for one, which is this huge organization in Singapore. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7774.86s)]
*  They do these events where they have all kinds of martial arts. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7779.42s)]
*  They have MMA, Thai boxing. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7782.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7784.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7785.099999999999s)]
*  So you would do it under any rules? [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7787.099999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7789.099999999999s)]
*  All right, let's go. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7790.099999999999s)]
*  I like it. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7791.099999999999s)]
*  I like the fact that you're interested in doing this. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7792.099999999999s)]
*  It's fun. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7794.099999999999s)]
*  It makes it fun. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7795.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7796.099999999999s)]
*  I mean, I could, you know, this could be an exercise in hubris. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7797.099999999999s)]
*  We'll find out. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7802.66s)]
*  We could find out. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7805.78s)]
*  I like the fact that Zuck's interested in it too. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7806.78s)]
*  I like the fact that he trained so much. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7808.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there aren't very many ways to actually, if you stick to the rules that [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7811.3s)]
*  you do, for example, if you want to put someone in an armlock, you have to be able to extend [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7816.58s)]
*  their arm. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7821.660000000001s)]
*  And if somebody is strong enough that you cannot extend their arm, then you're limited [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7822.660000000001s)]
*  to chokes. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7827.38s)]
*  And you can do an armlock across the groin with both arms and legs, like Hoise Gracie [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7830.38s)]
*  did upside down. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7836.06s)]
*  And it was like the third UFC fight or something like that. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7837.06s)]
*  He was pretty severely damaged. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7841.9400000000005s)]
*  That was when he fought Kimo. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7842.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, that enormous guy. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7844.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7846.1s)]
*  And he did upside down armlock across the groin because he could not do an armlock, [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7847.1s)]
*  you know, a sort of sidebar armlock. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7851.660000000001s)]
*  But after that, people were like, why is that move? [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7855.9800000000005s)]
*  So they were like, we're not going to allow themselves to get an armlock across the groin [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7858.120000000001s)]
*  without, you know, that was like a, you know, overconfidence, I think. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7862.820000000001s)]
*  Well, it was exhaustion. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7868.42s)]
*  I mean, they fought like tooth and nail for something like seven or eight minutes. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7870.82s)]
*  And you know, Hoise survived and then eventually wore the guy out. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7876.42s)]
*  Well, when you're a big steroided up guy like that to the oxygen depletion, like the amount [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7879.9400000000005s)]
*  of oxygen your muscles require, you gas out pretty quickly when you're that big, unless [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7885.08s)]
*  you're insanely conditioned. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7888.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7890.46s)]
*  But like there's no way for him to do, you know, armlock like a single arm armlock. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7891.46s)]
*  He couldn't do it because single arm armlock. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7897.58s)]
*  If you try to do a lock on the side. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7900.700000000001s)]
*  So like it's high control. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7903.1s)]
*  So from some legs across your face, is that what you mean? [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7904.580000000001s)]
*  If you try to do an arm bar on the side, you know, one arm across the knee, you know, across [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7908.18s)]
*  the thigh, like you have to be able to extend the arm. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7914.26s)]
*  You're essentially your triceps have to be able to exceed the strength of their bicep [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7917.3s)]
*  is what it comes down to. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7925.34s)]
*  But if you cannot exceed the strength of their bicep, then you will not be able to do an [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7926.34s)]
*  arm extension. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7930.58s)]
*  I'm not sure what I'm, are you talking about like a camura, like a straight arm bar? [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7931.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7935.34s)]
*  So you're talking about like with just the arms? [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7936.34s)]
*  Where you just have one arm, like, if it's one arm versus one arm. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7938.9s)]
*  But that's never the case. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7945.099999999999s)]
*  It's almost always the whole body's engaged. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7946.179999999999s)]
*  That's the, I think that's it's well in judo, that's a very common hold, a very common one. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7949.82s)]
*  A one arm arm bar? [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7955.9s)]
*  Yeah, one arm. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7957.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7958.62s)]
*  You know, you have your one arm around the neck and you take their arm and you extend [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7960.42s)]
*  it across. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7965.42s)]
*  Oh, I see what you're saying. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7966.42s)]
*  Okay. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7967.42s)]
*  So like from a scarf hold. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7968.42s)]
*  So scarf hold, you would take the arm and put it over and you would push it down with [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7969.42s)]
*  one arm. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7973.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's unusual though. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7974.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's an unusual arm bar. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7975.54s)]
*  If one person is much stronger than another, then that one, that is, that's the move. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7978.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7982.7s)]
*  But it's a very fast move because you can take someone right from a throw, drop them [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7983.7s)]
*  on the floor, right into an arm bar. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7986.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7989.259999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7990.259999999999s)]
*  That's a very specific arm bar. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7991.259999999999s)]
*  10 seconds. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7992.259999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7993.259999999999s)]
*  That's a rare arm bar. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7994.259999999999s)]
*  You never see that in MMA. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7995.259999999999s)]
*  What you do see though is the two legs isolate the arm and then the person grabs a hold of [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=7996.259999999999s)]
*  it with a thumb up and uses all their body weight. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8001.419999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's what Gracie did. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8004.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's what most people do when they apply an arm bar. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8006.339999999999s)]
*  Whether it's from the back, like, you know, a lot of people have done that or whether [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8009.74s)]
*  it's from side control, which is a little more easy because you have control of the [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8014.0599999999995s)]
*  body. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8017.419999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8018.9s)]
*  I mean, it's also just that UFC is not just jiu-jitsu. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8019.9s)]
*  You can punch people. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8023.38s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8024.38s)]
*  That makes a big difference. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8025.38s)]
*  Big difference. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8026.38s)]
*  Big difference. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8027.38s)]
*  Huge. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8028.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8029.38s)]
*  MMA has changed the ideas of jiu-jitsu because there's a lot of techniques that people do [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8030.38s)]
*  where it works well in competition when someone's grabbing your leg when you can't just rain [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8035.22s)]
*  down punches on their face. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8038.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8040.46s)]
*  There's a lot of unrealistic positions. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8041.46s)]
*  If somebody's pounding in the face, it's pretty hard to be chill, you know? [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8042.46s)]
*  Especially if they're waving. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8045.9s)]
*  If somebody's got Gorilla Fists in your face. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8046.9s)]
*  Yes. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8049.7s)]
*  It's not going to be a good day. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8050.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8052.7s)]
*  Carlson Gracie famously had a phrase that if you take a black belt and you punch him [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8053.7s)]
*  in the face, he becomes a brown belt. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8057.34s)]
*  Punch him again, he becomes a purple belt. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8060.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8062.42s)]
*  And so on and so forth. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8063.42s)]
*  I mean, most people have not been punched in the face. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8064.42s)]
*  That's true. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8067.0599999999995s)]
*  So, you know, it comes as a surprise. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8068.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8073.78s)]
*  Yeah, it probably does come as a surprise. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8074.9s)]
*  I mean, there's also like, even the UFC has a lot of limitations, like you can't do 12 [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8076.38s)]
*  o'clock elbows, you know? [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8080.86s)]
*  So... [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8081.86s)]
*  That's changing. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8082.86s)]
*  They're getting rid of that. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8083.86s)]
*  You're allowed to do 12 o'clock elbows? [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8084.86s)]
*  Yes. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8085.86s)]
*  Finally. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8086.86s)]
*  Finally. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8087.86s)]
*  I've been singing that from the top of the roof forever. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8088.86s)]
*  Okay. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8089.86s)]
*  It's so nuts. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8090.86s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8091.86s)]
*  You know where it came from? [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8092.86s)]
*  No. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8093.86s)]
*  It came from Big John McCarthy, who was the original UFC referee and pioneer of the sport. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8094.86s)]
*  He was bringing this to athletic commissions and they were allowing certain techniques, [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8099.82s)]
*  but one of them they wouldn't allow was the 12 to 6 elbow, because they saw those late [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8103.58s)]
*  night karate demonstrations where someone would smash bricks like that. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8107.66s)]
*  They thought someone would die if they hit them with this. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8111.3s)]
*  Definitely going to sting. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8113.86s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not even harder than this one. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8114.86s)]
*  This one's harder. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8118.32s)]
*  Because this one, you can throw your body weight into it and it's a more natural movement. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8119.68s)]
*  This is an unusual movement. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8125.14s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure you could train it and get it probably as hard, but I think for most [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8126.66s)]
*  people, for me, I can tell you for sure, this elbow has more power. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8130.82s)]
*  Well, I think any elbow in the face is going to be a big wake up call if you've never had [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8135.219999999999s)]
*  an elbow in the face. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8138.7s)]
*  It fucking sucks. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8139.7s)]
*  Yes. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8140.7s)]
*  It fucking sucks. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8141.7s)]
*  Did you watch the Tyson Fury, Francis Ngano boxing match? [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8142.7s)]
*  Is it the one where you bite the ear off? [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8144.26s)]
*  No, that's not my Tyson. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8146.26s)]
*  I've been under a Holyfield. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8148.26s)]
*  That's from the 90s. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8149.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8150.98s)]
*  No, this fight that took place this last weekend. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8151.98s)]
*  Francis Ngano, who was the UFC heavyweight champion, he vacated the belt so he could [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8153.94s)]
*  take this fight with Tyson Fury. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8158.34s)]
*  This was his dream fight. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8159.86s)]
*  Okay. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8160.86s)]
*  Tyson Fury, who's the lineal heavyweight champion, Francis Ngano had never had a boxing match [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8161.86s)]
*  ever in his life. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8166.54s)]
*  Had zero boxing matches, but he was the UFC heavyweight champion. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8168.259999999999s)]
*  Knocked down Tyson Fury in the third round, beat him up in the eighth round. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8172.9s)]
*  Most people, including me, thought he should have won the decision, including most boxers, [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8177.219999999999s)]
*  most boxing pundits. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8182.82s)]
*  And he lost by one point on one judge's scorecard. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8184.339999999999s)]
*  He won on one judge's scorecard. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8188.22s)]
*  Another judge who should go to jail had it 96-93 for Tyson Fury, which is fucking outrageous. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8190.360000000001s)]
*  But Francis Ngano, who is a literal freak of nature. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8196.36s)]
*  This guy grew up in Cameroon and was working in the sand mines when he was a child, like [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8200.58s)]
*  a fucking Conan movie. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8206.74s)]
*  Like full on, yeah. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8208.54s)]
*  This great warrior. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8209.54s)]
*  Conan's pushing the thing around in a circle. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8210.54s)]
*  Yeah, pushing the wheel. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8212.82s)]
*  He's developing his body, digging in the sand all day. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8213.82s)]
*  He's supremely physically advanced. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8216.78s)]
*  He's not just fit. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8219.7s)]
*  He's the hardest puncher ever measured in all of MMA. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8221.74s)]
*  There's a machine that we actually have outside at the gym. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8225.380000000001s)]
*  If you hit this thing, Francis has hit it harder than any person who's ever lived. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8228.94s)]
*  Yeah, well look at him. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8233.300000000001s)]
*  Can I hit it? [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8234.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we set it up. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8235.300000000001s)]
*  I have the record for the kick for a while. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8236.300000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8296.38s)]
*  What happened there? [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8298.38s)]
*  It still hurts a little bit, actually. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8300.38s)]
*  I've had four operations. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8302.38s)]
*  Really? [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8304.38s)]
*  From that? [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8305.38s)]
*  Well, I had some childhood injuries. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8306.38s)]
*  Like I said, I was in some pretty severe fights as a kid. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8309.38s)]
*  I was almost killed at one point. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8313.38s)]
*  Really? [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8315.38s)]
*  What happened? [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8316.38s)]
*  I was just in school in South Africa. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8318.38s)]
*  It's a very violent place. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8320.38s)]
*  So, there's been many involuntary fights. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8323.38s)]
*  It's just the way it was. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8328.38s)]
*  But anyway, so I had some rugby injuries as well. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8331.38s)]
*  I saw South South Africa won the World Cup, which is cool, and in rugby. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8335.38s)]
*  So, I think that was not a good starting position. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8339.38s)]
*  But then, the World Champion Sumo Wrestlers, they did kind of like a demo bout for my birthday. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8345.38s)]
*  And since it was my birthday, I guess they just call up the birthday boy and say, [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8353.38s)]
*  like, hey, do you want to sumo wrestle? [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8357.38s)]
*  This is where it's a similar weight differential. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8360.38s)]
*  It was 50% heavier than me. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8363.38s)]
*  So, like, I don't know, 360, 370 pounds. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8365.38s)]
*  And I knew you would take it easy on me in the first round. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8369.38s)]
*  So, the only way I'm going to knock him over is momentum. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8374.38s)]
*  So, I got to basically run at him. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8377.38s)]
*  So, I did. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8380.38s)]
*  I ran at him, did a judo throw, knocked him over, and smashed a disc in my neck in the process. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8381.38s)]
*  It's like, it would be like running at that wall. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8387.38s)]
*  If you run at a wall, it's going to hurt. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8390.38s)]
*  Did you have to get it fused or anything? [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8394.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8396.38s)]
*  Oh, man. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8397.38s)]
*  So, it's like you can knock over someone. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8398.38s)]
*  You can defeat someone bigger than you if you're willing to smash a disc in your neck. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8401.38s)]
*  Well, if you know what you're doing and you're willing to smash a disc in your neck. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8406.38s)]
*  Those two things. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8410.38s)]
*  So, he wasn't expecting me to beat a total lunatic on round one. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8411.38s)]
*  He defeated me, obviously, in round two and three because he was like, oh, he knows what to expect. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8416.38s)]
*  So, I had like five minutes of glory and a decade of pain. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8422.38s)]
*  Now that you've got your neck fused, that creates problems with the upper and lower discs as well, doesn't it? [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8429.38s)]
*  Over time, if there's too much neck rotation, it can damage the... [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8436.38s)]
*  How long ago was this that you had this operation? [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8441.38s)]
*  Man, I had three operations. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8444.38s)]
*  Where you got it fused? [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8447.38s)]
*  How long ago? [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8448.38s)]
*  I had two artificial discs. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8449.38s)]
*  I'm actually in favor of artificial discs. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8450.38s)]
*  They put the wrong disc in. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8452.38s)]
*  But then eventually the third one is like, let's just fuse it. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8454.38s)]
*  They put the wrong one in? [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8458.38s)]
*  Yeah, twice. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8459.38s)]
*  How so? [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8461.38s)]
*  Because I have friends that have artificial discs. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8464.38s)]
*  I'm actually in favor of artificial discs. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8466.38s)]
*  You just need to have the right one. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8468.38s)]
*  So, in my case, at this point I know a lot about it, the C5, C6 right facet is impacting. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8469.38s)]
*  The facet is like the outriggers. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8478.38s)]
*  You've got the center core of the spine. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8480.38s)]
*  That's the outriggers. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8482.38s)]
*  Then they're shingled. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8483.38s)]
*  So they're like one on top of the other like this. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8484.38s)]
*  There's a little nerve that goes out in between the C5, C6. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8487.38s)]
*  And if those vertebrae come close together, they grind the nerve. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8491.38s)]
*  So they just sort of start shearing the nerve. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8496.38s)]
*  Now, so my C5, C6 right facet, it shows up clear as day on like a technetium scan. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8500.38s)]
*  So if you could do like a radioactive scan with technetium, it's very clear where the problem is. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8512.38s)]
*  So what should have been done was a simple hinge. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8519.38s)]
*  Basically, to move the vertebrae, basically the C5 vertebrae back about maybe an eighth of an inch to sort of unload the facet and then put a simple hinge. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8524.38s)]
*  So just rotation. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8540.38s)]
*  But I was given what is called a MOBY-C, which is a more mobile disc. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8542.38s)]
*  The MOBY-C allows it not just rotation but also translation so it can move back and forth. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8547.38s)]
*  So that then didn't solve the impacting of the C5, C6 because it could slide. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8553.38s)]
*  And when it would slide forward, the C5, C6 would bang and crunch the nerve. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8560.38s)]
*  And what does the normal neck do? Does the normal neck move forward in that way? [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8566.38s)]
*  The disc is like a gummy bear, basically. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8571.38s)]
*  So it allows rotation and translation. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8574.38s)]
*  So it's like sitting on like a jello pillow. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8578.38s)]
*  Like one of those BOSU balls that people sit on sometimes when they work at a desk. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8582.38s)]
*  It's like a rubber pillow, basically. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8586.38s)]
*  So the natural disc allows for rotation and translation. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8591.38s)]
*  So they basically put a disc that had too much mobility in and did not solve the C5, C6 nerve impact. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8597.38s)]
*  So then the third time around is like, listen, I just don't want to take a chance here. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8606.38s)]
*  Let's just fuse it. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8611.38s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8613.38s)]
*  And so it just limits your mobility? [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8615.38s)]
*  No, I'm fine. I'm like I can look right and left. It's okay. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8617.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's okay. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8621.38s)]
*  I'm not like totally stiff-necked. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8623.38s)]
*  No, you don't seem like you're stiff-necked at all. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8625.38s)]
*  There was a guy who fought in the UFC named Yoel Romero, and he's a real freak too. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8628.38s)]
*  He's an amazing athlete. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8632.38s)]
*  And he came from the Cuban wrestling program. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8634.38s)]
*  He was one of the greatest wrestlers that ever competed amateur-wise. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8637.38s)]
*  He had his entire neck fused, and when he runs, like his neck doesn't move, it's kind of freakish. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8641.38s)]
*  Like you see him running, and his neck looks like it's a stick. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8647.38s)]
*  And the whole body is like moving around, but the neck is just locked in place. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8650.38s)]
*  It's very bizarre to look at. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8656.38s)]
*  I mean he runs like a man whose entire neck is fused. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8658.38s)]
*  Like watch him. See if you can show the image of him. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8662.38s)]
*  Here, watch him run. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8665.38s)]
*  Wow. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8667.38s)]
*  See how his neck? [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8668.38s)]
*  He's in good shape. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8669.38s)]
*  Oh yeah, you think? [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8670.38s)]
*  I mean you don't get in any better shape than this guy. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8672.38s)]
*  By the way, he looks like that now, and he's 46, 47 years old, and still competing at the highest level in Bellator. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8675.38s)]
*  I mean he's an unbelievable athlete, and one of the most explosive guys that's ever fought in the sport. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8683.38s)]
*  Just insanely powerful and fast. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8689.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8691.38s)]
*  Cool. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8694.38s)]
*  So you competed at the highest level with your neck fused. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8695.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not too worried about that. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8698.38s)]
*  Aljomain Sterling, who was the UFC Bantamweight champion, he got his neck fused, or got a disc replaced rather, in his neck, and then went on to defend his title three times. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8700.38s)]
*  Still fighting at the highest level, with a fake disc in his neck. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8713.38s)]
*  Well, I guess it'll be okay then. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8716.38s)]
*  Yeah, well medical science is pretty fucking incredible what they can do now. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8719.38s)]
*  I mean, injuries that would have been fucked for the rest of your life just a few decades ago. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8722.38s)]
*  Now you're good to go. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8729.38s)]
*  So I'm excited. We've kind of rekindled this Zuck versus Elon Fire. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8732.38s)]
*  I mean he's checking out. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8738.38s)]
*  I don't think he's checking it out. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8739.38s)]
*  Yeah, there's no way he's checking out. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8740.38s)]
*  Do you think so? [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8741.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8742.38s)]
*  Well, maybe he's listening. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8743.38s)]
*  Zuck, zuck, zuck. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8744.38s)]
*  Zuck, zuck, zuck. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8745.38s)]
*  I'll go to him into fighting, using taunts. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8749.38s)]
*  It might work. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8751.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8752.38s)]
*  I mean, somehow or another you got him to agree in the first place. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8753.38s)]
*  I was stunned. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8757.38s)]
*  Surely he will respond to a taunt like that. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8758.38s)]
*  Yeah, surely. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8760.38s)]
*  I mean, how can he resist? [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8762.38s)]
*  How can he resist? [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8764.38s)]
*  Yeah, how can he resist? [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8765.38s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8766.38s)]
*  Let's go full schoolyard taunting. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8767.38s)]
*  What if there was like real consequences on the line? [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8770.38s)]
*  Like what if you guys had a real bet? [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8773.38s)]
*  Okay, sure. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8775.38s)]
*  Like the moderation team from X takes over moderation of Facebook if you win. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8776.38s)]
*  No problem. Sounds good. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8780.38s)]
*  And if he wins, vice versa. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8781.38s)]
*  There's a fight for civilization. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8783.38s)]
*  Yeah, a literal fight for civilization. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8784.38s)]
*  I mean, I'll do it. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8787.38s)]
*  Wow. Heavy. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8788.38s)]
*  Sure. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8791.38s)]
*  And you wouldn't even train for this? [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8793.38s)]
*  No, I'd train a little bit. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8794.38s)]
*  Train a little bit? [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8796.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8797.38s)]
*  Like how many weeks do you need? [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8798.38s)]
*  I mean, I don't have to train. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8802.38s)]
*  I could do it like tomorrow. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8803.38s)]
*  I tried going to his house actually. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8806.38s)]
*  Did you really? [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8807.38s)]
*  Yeah, because he lives in Palo Alto. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8808.38s)]
*  And we're doing some Tesla full self-driving testing. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8810.38s)]
*  So I'm like, well, I've got to pick a destination. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8814.38s)]
*  Did you press the button and go, do do, navigate to Zuck's house? [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8816.38s)]
*  Yeah, basically. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8819.38s)]
*  He's not far. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8821.38s)]
*  He's like three miles away from the Tesla California headquarters. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8822.38s)]
*  Wow. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8826.38s)]
*  But I don't know, there's nobody there. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8827.38s)]
*  He was probably in Hawaii. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8831.38s)]
*  According to a spokesman, he was traveling. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8833.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8836.38s)]
*  It would have been wild if he was there. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8837.38s)]
*  What would you have said? [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8839.38s)]
*  Yeah, literally, like anytime. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8840.38s)]
*  I just thought it was funny to go like, you know, I'm coming over to your house. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8842.38s)]
*  I'm going to get you. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8847.38s)]
*  Well, it's even more funny when it's two of the richest guys in the world. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8849.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8853.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8854.38s)]
*  So anyway, he didn't answer. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8855.38s)]
*  Well, too bad. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8859.38s)]
*  Yeah, too bad. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8861.38s)]
*  It's just fun. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8862.38s)]
*  It's fun. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8864.38s)]
*  And I'm glad you're just for the fun of it. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8865.38s)]
*  I mean, I think it would be well, actually, like Dana White thinks it would be like the, you know, a really big ticket fight. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8868.38s)]
*  It would be fucking huge. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8875.38s)]
*  I would commentate on that. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8877.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the proceeds could go to charity and stuff. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8878.38s)]
*  It would be crazy. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8880.38s)]
*  People would want to see what the hell is going on. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8882.38s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8883.38s)]
*  It would be fucking huge. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8884.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8885.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8886.38s)]
*  It would be really crazy. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8887.38s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8888.38s)]
*  Like if they close the thing and Bruce Buffer is in there, it's time. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8889.38s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8895.38s)]
*  The place would go fucking bananas. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8896.38s)]
*  Bananas. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8897.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8898.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8899.38s)]
*  Let's do it. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8900.38s)]
*  Does it have to be in the Coliseum? [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8901.38s)]
*  Would you agree? [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8902.38s)]
*  No, I'd do it anywhere. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8903.38s)]
*  I literally said anywhere, anytime. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8904.38s)]
*  You know where you should do it. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8906.38s)]
*  Any rules. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8907.38s)]
*  You know where you should do it? [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8908.38s)]
*  The Sphere in Las Vegas. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8909.38s)]
*  The Sphere is great. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8910.38s)]
*  I was just there. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8911.38s)]
*  The Sphere is amazing. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8912.38s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8913.38s)]
*  Yeah, I was there. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8914.38s)]
*  I've only seen it on the outside, but it looks incredible. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8915.38s)]
*  No, the inside's even better. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8916.38s)]
*  I've seen video. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8917.38s)]
*  I haven't seen it live. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8918.38s)]
*  I was there on Saturday night, and it's awesome. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8919.38s)]
*  It's really good. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8924.38s)]
*  I think it might be the best show on Earth. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8925.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8926.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8927.38s)]
*  I mean, if you have visuals that accompany the music, if you have something like Roger [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8928.38s)]
*  Waters, which his show is insanely visual, something like that in the Sphere, it would [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8933.98s)]
*  be incredible. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8938.58s)]
*  The art on the show that I saw on Saturday night was incredibly good. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8939.58s)]
*  Who was it? [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8942.099999999999s)]
*  I don't know who did all the art, but- [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8943.82s)]
*  What was the band? [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8945.26s)]
*  It was U2. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8946.26s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8947.26s)]
*  But I've been to U2 concerts, and U2 is great, but the Sphere is really ... If U2 hadn't [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8948.26s)]
*  been there, it would still be great. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8955.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8957.06s)]
*  Yeah, U2's ... It's like a ... On Sunday, there was a movie. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8958.06s)]
*  They played a movie there. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8963.460000000001s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8965.1s)]
*  Where do you look? [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8966.1s)]
*  In all directions. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8968.1s)]
*  It's great. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8970.1s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8971.1s)]
*  Are you ... [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8972.1s)]
*  I mean, it's like actually being in virtual reality. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8973.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8976.1s)]
*  In fact, it was such ... It was so wild, the Saturday night one especially, that you step [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8977.1s)]
*  outside after the show, and you're like, why is reality so boring? [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8982.7s)]
*  Oh, so this is Postcard from Earth. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8987.1s)]
*  It's Darren Aronofsky's thing. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8990.7s)]
*  Oh, wow, and you're watching this. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8992.1s)]
*  I saw that on Sunday. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8994.5s)]
*  And it covers the whole ceiling. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8995.62s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8997.02s)]
*  It's really great. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8998.02s)]
*  You saw it there? [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=8999.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9000.300000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9001.3s)]
*  That's incredible. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9003.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's really good. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9004.38s)]
*  That would be the greatest place to see a movie ever. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9005.38s)]
*  I think it's like Saturday night ... The Saturday night show, and obviously, YouTube adds to [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9007.779999999999s)]
*  it, but I said that the Sphere is really special in and of itself. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9012.019999999999s)]
*  I think it's probably the best show I've ever seen. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9016.74s)]
*  Wow. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9019.82s)]
*  I can imagine. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9020.82s)]
*  I mean, it's just ... What an amazing venue, and what an incredible idea to have the entire [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9021.82s)]
*  ceiling wall-screen. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9026.14s)]
*  Yeah, it was really cool. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9027.14s)]
*  I got to hand it to Dolan. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9028.14s)]
*  That was pretty great. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9029.14s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9030.14s)]
*  Absolutely amazing. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9031.98s)]
*  I'm so glad that he did that. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9032.98s)]
*  And then also the outside ... Oh, that's incredible. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9034.5s)]
*  They really play with perspective. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9037.38s)]
*  God, that's incredible. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9038.38s)]
*  Because it's round, but it doesn't look round. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9039.38s)]
*  So it'll simulate all sorts of shapes. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9042.42s)]
*  And then also the outside of it. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9048.34s)]
*  They had the outside of it. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9050.46s)]
*  It looked like Earth. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9051.46s)]
*  It's just amazing. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9052.46s)]
*  It's really cool. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9053.939999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9054.939999999999s)]
*  Super cool. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9055.939999999999s)]
*  I like these epic things. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9056.939999999999s)]
*  That's the venue. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9057.939999999999s)]
*  It's really cool. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9058.939999999999s)]
*  That's where it needs to go down. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9061.42s)]
*  In the sphere? [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9062.7s)]
*  Sure. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9063.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's even better than the Coliseum. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9064.7s)]
*  Okay. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9065.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9066.7s)]
*  Especially if the United States falls, that would be our Coliseum. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9067.7s)]
*  This would be our Rome. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9069.140000000001s)]
*  Vegas would be our Rome. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9070.78s)]
*  I mean, the sphere did remind me of being a modern-day Coliseum. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9072.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9076.58s)]
*  Yeah, like a modern-day version. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9077.58s)]
*  What would they do with our technology currently? [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9079.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9082.300000000001s)]
*  And then Vegas is kind of Rome-esque in the sense that when we think about the hedonism [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9083.300000000001s)]
*  of Rome and its final days, that's Vegas. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9089.18s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, totally. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9092.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9093.18s)]
*  Perfect. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9094.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9095.18s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9096.18s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9097.18s)]
*  Are you not entertained? [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9098.18s)]
*  You will fucking be entertained. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9100.54s)]
*  You'll be fucking entertained. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9102.54s)]
*  You'll be fucking entertained. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9103.54s)]
*  So entertained. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9104.54s)]
*  No doubt. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9105.54s)]
*  Let's do it. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9106.54s)]
*  There's one important time where you were trying to get people to do a pause on AI. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9108.5s)]
*  I mean, I signed onto a letter that someone else wrote. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9114.62s)]
*  I didn't think that people would actually pause. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9117.94s)]
*  But you thought it was probably a good idea if they did. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9121.539999999999s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9125.98s)]
*  I think so, too. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9126.98s)]
*  I mean, making some sort of digital superintelligence seems like it could be dangerous. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9127.98s)]
*  It certainly has the potential. [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9136.82s)]
*  And certainly has the potential. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9138.859999999999s)]
*  Well, when you were talking about what this mind virus, how it was able to propagate through [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9140.38s)]
*  the social media and being in control of social media platforms, think about what that means [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9148.26s)]
*  if that same mind virus gets in control of a superintelligence. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9155.26s)]
*  And that is possible. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9160.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9161.22s)]
*  No, that's actually what I think the biggest danger is for AI is that if AI is implicitly [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9162.22s)]
*  programmed, I don't think they can do it explicitly, but implicitly programmed with values that [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9167.74s)]
*  lead to, that have led to the destruction of downtown San Francisco and a bunch of these [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9172.82s)]
*  AI companies are in either in San Francisco or in the San Francisco Bay Area, then you [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9178.78s)]
*  could implicitly program an AI to believe that extinction of humanity is what it should [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9186.06s)]
*  try to do. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9190.539999999999s)]
*  I mean, if you take that guy who was on the front pages of New York Times and you take [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9191.539999999999s)]
*  his philosophy, which is prevalent in San Francisco, the AI could conclude like he did [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9196.02s)]
*  that there are eight, where he literally says there are eight billion people and it would [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9206.26s)]
*  be better if there were none and engineer that outcome. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9209.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9214.82s)]
*  Well, especially if it doesn't need us anymore. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9215.82s)]
*  If it becomes sentient and then has the ability to make its own decisions and make a better [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9219.42s)]
*  version of itself, it would find us to be nothing but a problem. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9225.3s)]
*  We have nothing to offer anymore. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9230.699999999999s)]
*  It's a risk. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9231.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it is a risk. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9232.699999999999s)]
*  So, you know, and like if you query chat GBT, I mean, it's pretty work, you know? [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9233.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9240.699999999999s)]
*  So, I mean, people did like experiments like write a poem praising Donald Trump and it [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9241.699999999999s)]
*  won't, but if you ask write a poem praising Joe Biden and it will. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9248.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9252.179999999998s)]
*  So I'm like, you know. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9253.179999999998s)]
*  It's a little sketchy. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9254.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9255.66s)]
*  Well, it's unfortunately it's programmed. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9256.66s)]
*  Yes. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9259.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9260.26s)]
*  It's programmed to be that way. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9261.26s)]
*  Is it possible to overcome those problems? [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9262.74s)]
*  Is it possible that we could realize the dangers that are involved in creating this, but somehow [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9267.220000000001s)]
*  another engineer in a way that would be ultimately beneficial to people? [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9273.74s)]
*  Or is that just a whim? [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9277.86s)]
*  Is a hope and a prayer a utopian version of what could happen versus the most likely outcome? [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9279.18s)]
*  If you say like, what is the most likely outcome of AI? [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9291.82s)]
*  I think the most likely outcome to be specific about it is a good outcome, most likely a [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9294.02s)]
*  good outcome, but it's not for sure. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9300.14s)]
*  So I think we have to be careful how we program the AI and make sure that it is not accidentally [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9303.02s)]
*  anti-human. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9311.7s)]
*  So, you know, the accidentally extinctionist AI, you wouldn't want that. [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9312.7s)]
*  Or even pruning. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9326.74s)]
*  Well, that is kind of how it works is that these, what they call large language models, [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9329.62s)]
*  but you know, it's really just a big pile of numbers. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9334.94s)]
*  And how you tune those numbers matters. [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9340.5s)]
*  It's like pruning a tree. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9344.1s)]
*  You know, you could have a mighty oak. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9346.220000000001s)]
*  You could be a little bonsai or a mighty oak. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9348.42s)]
*  So depending on how you prune it. [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9351.78s)]
*  Right. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9354.78s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9355.94s)]
*  Like if it decided to prune, if it decided the real issue, perhaps we cause problems. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9356.94s)]
*  Or maybe it would prune places in the world that are, you know, overwhelmingly polluting, [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9365.34s)]
*  like third world countries. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9371.34s)]
*  Maybe it would decide that they're not very necessary, particularly if we use computers [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9373.18s)]
*  or AI or some sort of robotics to do human labor. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9378.380000000001s)]
*  And then you have these areas where human beings are doing this labor and they're polluting [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9383.54s)]
*  and you know, there's all sorts of issues that come about because of that. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9387.82s)]
*  You say, well, we just eliminate those people. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9392.34s)]
*  We eliminate that issue and then we have 30% less garbage in the ocean. [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9394.54s)]
*  And then it makes this call. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9399.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9401.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9402.18s)]
*  It's just that- [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9403.18s)]
*  It's something we should be concerned about. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9404.18s)]
*  And I actually want me to go- oh, shit, I, sorry, I need to go- [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9408.18s)]
*  Should we wrap it up? [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9412.66s)]
*  Yeah, because I have to go to the airport. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9413.66s)]
*  I have to fly- I'm flying to London. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9415.66s)]
*  Yeah, you were explaining that. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9418.66s)]
*  Yeah, just for AI safety. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9425.66s)]
*  The AI safety conference in London. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9427.66s)]
*  So, yeah. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9429.66s)]
*  I'm leaving in about an hour and a half. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9432.66s)]
*  What do you hope to get out of this conference? [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9435.66s)]
*  Well... [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9439.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9452.74s)]
*  I mean, I'm just generally concerned about AI safety, but it's like, what should we do [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9454.74s)]
*  about it? [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9461.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9466.74s)]
*  I think we should have some kind of regulatory oversight of some kind. [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9469.74s)]
*  It's like, you can't just go build a nuclear bomb in your backyard. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9473.74s)]
*  You know, that's against the law. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9476.74s)]
*  And you'll get thrown in prison if you do that. [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9478.74s)]
*  How much of a concern is it- [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9480.74s)]
*  I think this is maybe more dangerous than a nuclear bomb. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9482.74s)]
*  Really? [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9484.74s)]
*  Yes. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9485.74s)]
*  How much of a concern is it if another country develops it before us? [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9487.74s)]
*  I don't know if- [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9492.82s)]
*  We should just be concerned about AI being anti-human. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9499.82s)]
*  That's sort of the thing that matters. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9506.82s)]
*  So, potentially. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9509.82s)]
*  I'm just saying it's like letting a genie out of a bottle. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9514.82s)]
*  It's sort of like a magic genie that can make wishes come true. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9517.9s)]
*  Except usually when they tell those stories, that doesn't end well for the person who let [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9522.9s)]
*  the genie out of the bottle. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9529.9s)]
*  Do you think we're creating a life form? [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9533.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9539.9s)]
*  I mean, it's something that is indistinguishable from intelligence and intelligent life form. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9540.9s)]
*  I keep coming up against this idea, I keep banging it in my head that we're some sort [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9544.98s)]
*  of an electronic caterpillar that's creating a cocoon. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9550.98s)]
*  And we don't even realize what we're doing. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9553.98s)]
*  And we're about to give birth to some technological butterfly. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9555.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9561.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9562.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9572.06s)]
*  Well, I think that's- we're on the cusp of an artificial intelligence revolution. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9573.06s)]
*  And, you know, for the longest time, or for a very long time, we've been the smartest [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9579.06s)]
*  creatures on earth. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9590.14s)]
*  That's been our defining characteristic. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9591.14s)]
*  I mean, speaking of mosh-lots, I mean, I don't think anyone should challenge a soul-of-vac [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9592.14s)]
*  gorilla to a fight. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9598.14s)]
*  You know, even if you're very good at mosh-lots, that thing's going to kill you. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9600.14s)]
*  You know, it literally walks on its fists. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9605.14s)]
*  Those fists meet your face. [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9610.14s)]
*  Game over. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9613.14s)]
*  So, we're not stronger than a gorilla. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9614.14s)]
*  We're not faster than other animals. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9619.22s)]
*  We're smarter. [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9622.22s)]
*  Now, what happens when there's something way smarter than us? [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9625.22s)]
*  Where does it go? [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9630.22s)]
*  That's a good question. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9633.22s)]
*  Well, listen, go talk to those people. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9635.22s)]
*  Go school them. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9638.22s)]
*  And I hope something good comes out of it. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9639.22s)]
*  And thank you for your time. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9642.22s)]
*  Appreciate you coming in here. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9644.22s)]
*  It's been fun. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9645.22s)]
*  Good to see you. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9646.22s)]
*  Always good to see you. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9647.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9648.3s)]
*  Thanks for everything, man. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9649.3s)]
*  Thanks for buying Twitter, too. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9650.3s)]
*  You're welcome. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9651.3s)]
*  Really, it means a lot to people. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9652.3s)]
*  Hopefully it was a force for good. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9653.3s)]
*  You know, that was aspirationally a force for good. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9654.3s)]
*  I think at the very least, it stopped a lot of bad. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9656.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9659.3s)]
*  All right. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9660.3s)]
*  Bye, everybody. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9661.3s)]
*  All right. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAJUwiAqW38&t=9662.3s)]
