# JRE MMA Show #94 with Brendan Schaub
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 10, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF7_AaY9tCg)
*  Quarantine baby. How you holding up?
*  Getting through man. They weirded out or just accepting it. I'm accepting it and I'm trying to stay positive
*  I send you guys all the positive stats I get
*  Well, I know several people that have gotten it and gotten over it
*  The worst was Michael yo and I need to confirm this with Michael
*  But I'm pretty sure Michael had a cold and then caught the corona and then got pneumonia
*  Jesus he got it real bad. He's bad. He got it real bad. He was hospitalized for a week
*  His post choked me up. She's Instagram. Yes. Yes, and you see him coughing while he's doing it. Yeah, he's such a good guy
*  He's the nicest guy. He's the nicest guy if we lost him that'd be fucking to be ashamed devastating
*  Um, I know people that have gotten it gotten over it not not much of a problem, you know
*  And they they just felt like shit for a couple days and they're fine
*  But that's the majority of people Joe my jar. I know people get upset when I say that and it's true though
*  It's true though. Those are the numbers the majority the people get it and they're fine
*  Yeah, what I'm hoping is they come up with with a legitimate treatment where it's like this is confirmed that if you take
*  Hydroxychloroquine, you know with the Z if they say something like that
*  This is confirmed if they say we got it covered folks
*  We no longer have to worry about people dying of coronavirus. We just catch it real early
*  Sort of like tamiflu or some other things that look staff used to fucking kill the shit out of people
*  You know killed a lot of people infections killed a lot of fucking people now they give you antibiotics
*  I mean imagine if jujitsu killed people imagine if you went to the gym and you got staff and you died
*  How many fucking people would train I wouldn't train no one train. He'd be so terrified of staff, right?
*  Well, that's how we are right now with this coronavirus
*  We're worried because we don't have like a rock-solid legitimate treatment or a vaccine but that hydro
*  Chloridine whatever the hell it is
*  Z pack supposed to supposed to work the trials that they've seen right? Yeah, well for some people
*  You know that was what they call anecdotal evidence
*  It's not a hundred percent proven clinical trial peer-reviewed where they can say hey
*  We had 160 people that were coronavirus positive. We put them on this hydroxychloroquine takes a lot of time takes a lot of time
*  We don't have time right but the guy there's a few doctors in New York that have implemented it and some
*  Some very positive results according to them now is that?
*  Enough to you know to say hey, we're good. I don't know. I don't think so
*  I think what's funny is in our group of friends you have some who are they won't step a foot outside their house
*  They have some who are kind in the middle. They have some who are super loosey-goosey
*  The real problem is with people who or are compromised
*  Old people, you know people whose immune system is already fragile
*  And now the thing is if you or I got it we'd be fine
*  Hopefully, but then what if you gave it to your grandma, you know, don't go around your grandma
*  Don't go around your grandma
*  This is the real that I think the real way to handle this moving forward is
*  probably going to be something along the lines of
*  Make sure that old people aren't exposed make sure that high-risk people are not exposed and make sure that you don't expose yourself to
*  Them if you have it, correct and then you know back to work
*  Yeah, and hopefully there's some sort of a treatment but get your ass back to work is really important
*  Hell, yeah, it is so many businesses are going under I don't think we've seen anything like this
*  Never ever and I don't think ever in the history of America. There's been a thing where everything just like instantly shut down
*  No one works. No one does anything everyone stays home when and how long are we gonna do it for though, right?
*  I think they're saying the end of May now
*  Really?
*  California that's what I've heard
*  California the the governor's kind of a pussy and he's he was talking about you know
*  This we might go on it might be like this for a year, you know, so did he say yeah, he said that so
*  Again, he's giant pussy. But when you hear Trump he was talking to some reporter
*  That's what question and he said I'm thinking, you know, we're not far off from after Easter open things back up. Mm-hmm
*  Yeah, look if people
*  It's so tough it's so it's so tough like look if it's just us in this room
*  I'm not that worried because I take a lot of vitamins. I'm in the fucking sauna every day
*  I have a very strong immune system fit. I take probiotics you walked in. I said I will lick your face right now
*  I said, what are we doing hugging? What are we doing? I said I will lick your fucking face Joe. I'm not scared of shit
*  I'm healthy as hell
*  Yeah
*  But that's the difference between someone who's actively taking care of their body and does so all year round
*  Versus people who are always boozing have high blood pressure are overweight. I'm talking you Burke Rieger
*  Look I love the guy I don't want him to die too
*  There's a lot of people like that though that we're friends with it that's on you homie. I know get in shape, dude
*  Yep, if it if it bounces right off you but it kills someone that's your age
*  Whose fault is that if there's fairly out of shape it's kind of their fault
*  That's on you man kind of their fault unless they have a disease see that and then there's people that have yeah
*  There's people that have diseases and those diseases prevent them from being healthy. That's a different animal
*  So then you have to think about that percentage of the population
*  There's so many variables dude. I went to this market. They had this giant market. They selling bats
*  No, but I would have bought one. I love bats not for soup. I'd save them
*  But yeah, there's like this fresh market and their peeps it was packed man
*  I'm like god damn, but everyone had mask on and I saw two like I'm not even trying to be funny
*  They're probably equal 800 pounds one probably 400 pounds his wife another four pounds with mask on like you
*  That's what you think the mask that's what that's not what's gonna kill you homies. Yeah
*  You're already you though. Yeah, you're super fucked
*  Send out the herd man
*  Well, I hope this is a wake-up call for people that aren't taking care of themselves
*  Because there's a lot of people that just think it's not necessary and they look at someone like you or I that's vain
*  That take that you know, like so like I get up in the morning. I look at my body in the man
*  I'm like, oh every morning good every morning
*  It gets it. I'm straight up old school. Mr. Venice
*  I do it in front of my kids to us like
*  But it's fine me too. Yeah, they do it too
*  I got my son
*  We have a hot tub and pool in the pools freezing and I've been mountain biking every day so my legs are sore
*  So I go hot cold hot cold now. He's doing it. Oh, it's pop and he gets like
*  Said you're getting there dude, you're getting there
*  My daughter got up real early today
*  Like she was set her alarm for eight and I go why'd you get up at eight?
*  She goes cuz I realized when I get up at 10 that I don't get as much done during the day and the day shorter
*  Wow
*  She's she's a little beast my 11 year old's a beast and it crazy to see that it's crazy. It's weird
*  She's got all of my attributes my like obsessive attributes, but without any of the I didn't have a good childhood
*  Trouble what's in a good way? She's super confident. Yeah, she's not like doing it because like I want someone to love me
*  Yes, I want to come from a dark place. It's not coming from I want to be value
*  She's like I want to be awesome at everything and that's when she's gonna thrive. She's always laughing. She laughs at everything
*  She's funny kid, man. She's always laughing. I love it. Yeah, she's always like crack like she's she'll say something like
*  She thinks things are funny like she's got a very interesting sense of humor. It's weird seeing kids grow up
*  You know with no
*  No fear, you know, like I grew don't you worry about it though. Yes
*  I worry about that's the problem because they're so well taken care of I feel like
*  when
*  All of our friends like I'm almost everyone I know to a man. That's interesting
*  Into a woman had some sort of fucked up chaotic childhood. There's some darkness. Yeah, that's what made them interesting
*  It's what made them successful in a lot of ways
*  But I don't know if it's necessary
*  I feel like there's valuable lessons that you can get like for you
*  I think a lot of your lessons you got in sports, right? Yeah, I think that's I think every kid
*  I really all my friends that are fucked up like emotionally that can't deal with loss
*  They don't play sports. They never played sports. There's a lot of people that I know that didn't play sports
*  They don't know how to lose and that's such a disadvantage because when you're playing sports when you're young it
*  It's hard times man, oh my god, and then we get as you get to the higher level, you know in college
*  It's you know, it's pretty cutthroat man
*  You learn to deal with heartbreaking issues and pick up your boots and keep going to also develop a thick skin. Yes
*  Chip on your shoulder a chip on your shoulder and a thick skin the biggest chip on your shoulder
*  So important to get through life though. You need that you need to understand what competition you need to look at that person like, you know
*  Sparring there's always there was always a one dude. You don't want to spar
*  Fuck this guy. I do not want to spot this guy, but you have to and then you have to it's only way to get better
*  And then you there's this moment where you're lined up and there he is like, oh boy time to get my ass kicked
*  But also in football, that's when I realized oh everybody's not treated the same and that's that's the real world
*  Like we're not treated the same. Like I remember the star running back Bobby purify
*  He you know, I've always been a huge shoe guy. He would get custom
*  One of one designer cleats and shoes in his locker
*  And then they'd give me these old ones and he was next to me. I was like I get it
*  I get if you hurt my feelings forever, man
*  I was like those look sweet people get mad at people that are like uber successful
*  But those those people like him like, you know, the Jordans of the world the people that are just like the fucking
*  The guy who's the what David Goggins likes to call uncommon amongst uncommon men. Yes, you know
*  That's just how life is and you see that you realize where the benefits are in being that person and then you also see
*  The drawbacks you see a huge drawback, especially in the personal life. Oh, you're a crazy person
*  It's tough to manage outside that core act outside that octagon. It's tough to manage
*  Talk to Tyson talk to Tyson about who he was when he was the king of the world. He couldn't manage it
*  I mean no one can maintain that you talked to John Jones talked to John Jones right now right now. Yeah right now
*  Yeah, I mean I guess this is the last the last one with John Jones I got sad
*  That's the first time about all the John's this recent one. Yeah, I got sad. I've been disappointed before but this one I got sad
*  Because I watched that video the video the arrest video the arrest video. It's such a bummer when you watch that video
*  You know, you know what was a little alarming there when when I think CT has something to do with this
*  I know we harp on CT, but when he goes
*  Hey John, I need you to do this this in this year's I'm gonna warn you my short-term memory is terrible
*  Yeah, so it's not because I'm drunk and that would even as he's drunk
*  He was cautious enough to say that saying hey man
*  My my short-term memory shit because I get punched in the head all the time
*  Yeah, so that so if you're based off that we're gonna be in trouble. I was like, oh no
*  I think that was a little nice legs were so skinny
*  Oh
*  His calves are crazy his calves are so much smaller than mine and I'm so much smaller than him it's insane
*  It doesn't mean how about will Sasso's calves? Oh my god
*  Those are the most ridiculous things Kalin and I spent 15 minutes on will Sasso's cast the other day
*  They're crazy. How nice good cast too. They're not bad, but they're not well
*  Seems like he should be able to jump over a building like he should be able to just from a standing position
*  Just long looks like Hulk. It looks like Hulk when fucking cut off jeans
*  Yeah, no John Jones now imagine like the Tiago Santos fight. Look at this his calf. That's preposterous
*  That's when Brian had here you see but Brian shaved his head and it's a
*  Two days ago, no, where's the pictures? I mean I post on my Instagram
*  Yes, I don't want to go too hard on them. You should I need to see this. I need
*  Why didn't he send me a picture? That's a good move for him to shave his head
*  But he needs to go he needs to go even more because the top oh, yeah
*  Yeah, well, does he have the hair transplant scar? Yes, he does. He does. That's what I said
*  I said, oh you have the same thing Rogan has yeah, but his is small
*  I go you need to you need to shave down more. Yeah, he needs to go all the way. There he is
*  Just go all the way. Yeah good good for him. He probably feels free that way
*  It's free now that he looked he fucked up the kids cut himself
*  So it's like all uneven so I could not stop laughing. We need to just get some trimmers
*  I've got cut my myself, but I fucking go bang, but you're seasoned back your season vet
*  Yeah, but even the first time I did it you just go all the way down to the bottom
*  Just go to the bottom. He's he's got one of them trimmers on it where you leave a little bit of hair
*  That's what he has
*  I go to the bottom and then I let it grow like a few days and go back to the bottom again
*  Looks a little like Bruce Willis, he looks it doesn't look bad. He needs to shave it more. You gotta see in person
*  It's a little so I could not stop laughing. I could we couldn't get through the show. I could not stop laughing
*  He's trying to be all serious. I just have laughing Wow
*  That's Cal. Yeah, the best he's he's such a fucking character. I don't know a single human like him try to find someone like
*  He's going crazy at the corona. He gets mad. God. He gets real mad. Why's he mad?
*  Because we're on lockdown he's when's this shit gonna end man, we're going back to restaurants the text message that he sends
*  He gets very angry
*  For himself, that's his big anger. He can't go to via Veneto or Felix get hang out with his friends that place Felix
*  We were supposed to go
*  Right before well, I went on the 14th with gallon
*  No, I went with my wife on the 14th right before the lockdown and we were like should we go out?
*  Let's just go out let's just do it we had reservations
*  But we had them like five days earlier and started getting as it getting closer and closer
*  It seemed like everything was like kind of shutting down
*  You can pull me away and then it was like a couple days later that they shut down everything but you did eat there
*  Yeah, we did. It's good, huh?
*  Fucking fantastic. That place is awesome. Apparently they and a lot of other restaurants they have to go
*  I think Felix is doing Felix to go and so you just all have to do that
*  Freaking flappers hit me up because they they have to that's how they're making money
*  That's other covenant or their rent right now is they have to sell the and they have good food
*  But they have to do the takeout. Mm-hmm. Just keep the doors open
*  I'm glad people are innovating and they're coming up with ways to stay open
*  But it would be a real bummer if places like Felix went under or that other place that count loves via Veneto
*  That place in Venice that place is excellent to excellent the thing about those that high rent. Yes high rent off Main Street
*  Yep, I mean they're they're right on Abbott Kenny, right? They're off Main Street. They're all Felix off Abbott
*  Yeah, even higher rent. What the fuck? Yeah, I was most expensive road in California. Is it really? Yeah. Yeah
*  Why does everybody like that area? Is it the homeless people that tracks them? There's a it's like it's a weird vibe
*  It's like the poorest of the poor and the richest of the rich. It's so strange
*  We were driving there and we stopped at a red light and there was like this nice house to left like this super
*  Modern looking Venice style house and right across the street on the right was 20 tents. I know camped out
*  It's such a bummer. Why do they let that happen? That is the dumbest thing that they let that happen
*  You know what they do take over the sidewalk
*  You know what these bums do to get to get money is if a house goes for sale or rent these bums squatting from the
*  House so the seller the renter has to come up like you guys got to get out of here and like pay us
*  So they give them money they leave and then they rent the house
*  There should be a service a hustle sure service that cleans that up called COVID-19
*  Affecting them. They're already had tuberculosis and fucking the black plan Legion Neers disease. They got everything. I don't give a fuck
*  They were finding what was that a crazy medieval disease they were finding in
*  Bums in homeless people in skid Row
*  Jesus Christ. It was a crazy disease that they hadn't found
*  God damn it. Do you remember Jamie? We're talking it's it sounds like the crazy crazy one, but it's like it's all typhus
*  It's a precursor to type. Yeah, she's just crazy found that
*  Look, I don't know you do. I mean people are worried about bats. How about people that shit on the street?
*  What kind of mean we're talking about diseases that have come out of these Chinese wet markets
*  There's easily could be diseases that come out of LA out of these these homeless encampment, but no one's eating homeless soup
*  Well, I don't know what they're eating who knows what they're doing, but it's not a matter of eating
*  It's a matter of being around all that that's that's how the how this all got started is
*  Eating it. No, really? I think it's being near them
*  The whole they think the patient zero I believe the theory is the current theory is patient zero
*  See you can find this was traced to a woman that worked next to the bat stand
*  Right that may or may not be the actual patient zero
*  Yeah, I don't think that could be she's still alive. I don't think they really really you know, what's crazy
*  They can trace the genetics of this virus and they're saying that it came from people that came from Europe
*  The what yeah in New York City, I should say
*  I mean it obviously came from China
*  But the people that got it in New York City got it from people who traveled to New York City from Europe and those Europeans
*  Were in China went back home. Yes, thank him to New York
*  Yeah, and they think it might have gotten here as early as December and maybe even November like they don't even know I heard
*  November I think November they think they think
*  they got their two weeks at least before the first case and
*  There's many people that could have gotten it that did not know that they got it and got it over it
*  And I know I know it's the cool thing to say right now, dude
*  I'm telling you when I was doing an Ontario improv in end of November December
*  I was the sickest I've ever been and it lasted for 12 to 14 days
*  I told my brother you might have taken me to the emergency room after I get done my last show
*  I was like we're driving home like we might have to go to the emergency room
*  I felt so fucking the sickest I've ever been in what way were you I had shakes cold sweats
*  I I was just sick man. Just coffee's coughing horrible coughing
*  Huh is bad. So the thing is that could also be a bad flu. Yeah, who knows?
*  Yeah, look this is one of the things that we in this text thread that you and I are in we we started sharing the numbers
*  Of people that have died from the flu. That is it's stunning. It's alarming. It's stunning. I didn't know
*  I mean, I knew a lot of people died from the flu, but until you see it on paper, you're like what?
*  Imagine if CNN did a whole marketing thing on how the flu is killing everyone every day and there's this fucking
*  Puts all this fear in everybody if they did every day like they're doing for Corona, we'd be scared shitless true
*  But there's some preventative measures
*  And then we have we flew shots and we also have tamiflu. There's a bunch of different remedies
*  We know what the flu is
*  Yeah
*  This is a this is a really dangerous one because it does something to your respiratory system where it scars the lining of the respiratory
*  System it scars people's lungs and there's so much inflammation that they can't get oxygen
*  Here's the other issues. They're saying that you probably have it two days before you start start showing signs if you show signs at all
*  Yes, I'm not at all it yourself
*  But apparently never showed any signs Stanford studies coronavirus early spread in California looks at herd immunity potential
*  Richard Stanford University trying to determine if the novel coronavirus may have been circulated in California as early as last fall
*  Your boy had it and whether it's playing a role in the relative slow spread in the state Wow
*  I hope we do have herd immunity. Let's get back to the store
*  Herd immunity come on Joey Diaz called me the other day
*  Just to reach out to tell me last me making sure I'm doing the right things
*  You know the right thing dog. Yeah, I fucking love you Brendan Chubb. All right, man
*  But yeah, we're talking about the comic store and I was like, they'll be fine though. He's like maybe yeah, maybe it's a big maybe
*  It's a lot of money to run that place. I'm sure she'll sunset fortunately for the last
*  Six years they've been making a shitload of money
*  Really well, okay, I think they are well Peter Shores very very bright man
*  There's very smart and I think he's doing the right thing and I think I think they'll be okay
*  Look, we could always do a shitload of shows when the store comes back and donate all the money. I'm happy to do that
*  I'm happy I'd give them rent right now
*  I'll tell everybody if you didn't see my Instagram my shows with Dave Chappelle have been moved to September
*  But when I say it moved to September I go like this you're gonna do in September I saw your post on New York
*  We're like Kofi. When is that November? October 3rd? You're doing it. Hey, dude, it's happening October. I bet I hope so
*  I hope so come on that Fauci guy said people aren't gonna shake hands anymore. Did you see that shit?
*  I'm bound everyone from now on bowing
*  Just cuz it's cool like that or you could do it tie style just
*  No, it's not bad Steven Seagal style I'm gonna wear beads but not I'm just gonna wrap them around my wrist
*  There's been a lot of knuckleheads online with this coronavirus talking about healing and positive energy and
*  No
*  So much
*  Nonsense, there's a lot of nonsense a lot of bro science
*  I throw a lot of bro science out there, but I go off a lot of numbers
*  I get from way smarter people than me. Yeah, but you're you're what you're doing is you're tweeting actual facts
*  And then throwing a little bro science is in the correct
*  That's also my career in general talking about just so many people that are just you know, this is a global transformation
*  And this is our opportunity. I hope everybody gets better out of this
*  I hope I hope people recognize that our society is fragile
*  Don't you see a lot this is another positive you see a lot more people working out like when I get ready to go on my
*  Bike ride. I see so many more people walking kids families. I think they have time
*  This is what it took to get you guys to fucking walk outside
*  well most people you know, they they don't I mean unless you're working from home or you know, you're
*  If you're in any kind of service industry your job is gone for now, so they have time
*  There's a lot of people whose jobs are shut down
*  I don't know what the numbers are but there's a lot more people that are home during the day
*  A lot of people are homeschooling their kids
*  Yeah, that's it. There's part of me that
*  When Dana came out said he's gonna do the UFC there's part of me that was super proud of him
*  Just you know, I I know
*  He was gonna get a lot of blowback for it and you see he's getting a lot of blowback for it
*  But a partner was like fuck. Yeah, dude. Good for you man for figuring it out. Good for you
*  Good for you
*  Pretty gangster move go to an Indian reservation really get and then went and for international fights up on an island bitches
*  Is this more common? I bet someone who'd enter the dragon
*  Yeah, don't worry about it I'm not gonna tell you where it's at I'm not telling anybody we're just gonna you're gonna get on
*  Flight private flight and we're flying to the island you and your team. I was like I
*  Can't hate on the guy. I can't hate on the guy anymore man. I was like in the sand. Oh so sick
*  Right on the beach. So do you remember Bo dog when Bo dog had fights on the beach? Yeah
*  Bo dog was interesting man. People forgot about Bo dog fador started their cane started there. Well, if it or didn't start there fator
*  I'm sorry to start there, but he did fight on their cane. I think
*  Yeah, he can't start there. Yeah. Yeah, it's Mazvodil fought Eve Edwards there. That's right. I'm with a head kick. Fuck
*  Yeah, dude, there were some great fights. Remember what fator did fator fight Matt Lindland on Bo dog
*  Was that Bo dog in Russia or is that affliction? No, I don't think so. I think you're right
*  I think fator and Matt Lindon was Bo dog and and I think Matt Lindon was about to take fator down and fator grabbed
*  A rope. It was a big and then he knocked him out. Well, right. Yeah, he
*  Submitted him. I think he submitted him. Here it is Matt Lindon fator
*  Yeah, so I know he slams on Matt Lindland who at the time I pretty sure he submitted him
*  Got him in an armbar. He did he submitted him, but I remember slamming him for some but go before that though
*  Matt Lindland's knees always scared me. He got double under. Yeah, he's got him in an armbar there
*  So Matt Lindland made got the clinch. I believe he got double under hooks
*  Yep, and now look he's elevating fator and fator's grabbing the fucking rope
*  Totally grabbed the rope and look who is that Dan Murgliano? Who's trying to look like Eve Edwards?
*  But look you kept grabbing the rope and milk Matt Lindland
*  Fucking Russians
*  Well in that moment that's just straight-up cheating I mean and that's how he got top position Matt Lindland took him down
*  Yeah, but I mean my Lindland is a fucking guy who fought at
*  170 fought 185
*  He was so tough 185
*  He was so tough tough as fuck
*  But as tough as it gets you hear the stories about him out of with him Hendo Chael Sonar
*  Oh, yeah, just the yeah who have fucked there though. Yeah, that's bullshit. Hey, man. That's the problem with ropes though, right?
*  Remember when there's a couple moments in pride where guys got trapped in the ropes and then submitted somebody got triangle whether
*  Was trapped in the rope and then they got triangle
*  There's also nothing worse when you get knocked out and you fall through the ropes. Oh my god. It's so embarrassing
*  Well, how about Bernard Hopkins last fighter's career when you fought Joe Smith Joe Smith chaos him. Well, he drops him and and
*  Bernard goes through the ropes and hits his head on the ground, which is crazy
*  No, like how do you fucking guys not have what like our is the apron of a?
*  Ring for boxing that expensive. Why can't you make it bigger?
*  Why can't you make it so that a guy doesn't fall or have security where if you see something, you know
*  Well, they would have to act quickly and be there in time and so they'd have to be around
*  Standing on the ring that be a little distracting
*  It would be hugely distracting and it'd be terrible for the people that were watching
*  But I mean all you have to do is like what do you remember what Bellator did what Bellator did when they were doing kickboxing and
*  MMA at the same time
*  So they have this round ring for Bellator and then they put a square ring in the center of that for kickboxing
*  So if you fell through the ropes, you just fell out into that round area where the Bellator cage would be it was perfect
*  Well to be played doubles advocate if you're boxing though, they're like dude
*  How many times have people fallen on the fucking ring? We know it's Bernard Hopkins Bernard Hopkins died from that
*  I mean, he's also 70 years old fighting. So it's 51 or 52. I think I mean, come on dude
*  Crazy fighting this young fucking oh, yeah
*  Caught in a triangle inside the ropes
*  So his leg is wrapped up in the rope and the dudes caught in a triangle crazy Jesus Christ ridiculous
*  Yeah, it's happened more than once too
*  People have been arm barred that way too. Did you think the UFC 249 was gonna happen?
*  I didn't know what was gonna happen when Khabib couldn't make it
*  I was like I bet this is gonna be the end of me too
*  I was like, oh it's over
*  But then I saw Kamaru Usman saying you better get ready to make weight bitch and I was like, oh my god
*  Usman fights Masvidal. Holy shit like that's worth it. That's a fight
*  But then when I heard is Gagee and Ferguson, I'm like, oh shit first team all-violence
*  I don't know what Gagee's been doing though. Has he been training like he's training for a fight
*  I don't know. They they asked him I saw I think is Brett
*  Akamoto goes how prepared are you and it took him a while to answer and then he said something though
*  I was like, oh, this could be tough. He goes I have 18 minutes in me
*  He goes all you know all my fights I don't go decision I either get knocked out I knock somebody out he goes
*  You know, I talked my family talked my coaches. I don't have 18 minutes of fucking fury
*  He goes then it's pretty tough to deal with and I was like god
*  It's tough to deal with but if it's the toughest deal with but if there's anybody that has the endurance
*  To take it to that 18 minutes and keep going Tony
*  Tony has the most endurance I've ever seen but the only thing that's a little scary when I heard him say that he does
*  Throw caution the wind Gagee does and it's tough to deal with cuz probably the hardest hitter at 55 and Tony gets hit man
*  That's one thing about Tony. He does like to get hit. He I think actually enjoys it and he welcomes it with Gagee
*  I don't know if you can play that game especially for 18 minutes. Well, I don't know if he enjoys it
*  I just think that he has this pressure Ford style. He's game for yeah
*  He's game he's game 100% game for it
*  But he has such a pressure style that it's inevitable that you get hit, you know
*  He's not fighting like Wonder Boy or something like that. He's not fighting elusive or mighty Mouse. He's fighting. He's trying to break you
*  I mean in Tony's fights, there's somewhere around the second or third round where you see the look in these guys faces like
*  Motherfucker I know how is he keeping up this pace Justin's kind of the same way
*  He just goes forward like a little tank. Yeah keeps going. It's such a good fight
*  my favorite fight with Justin is Barbosa because Barbosa is a savage and
*  Justin just ran him over ran him over his fight with poor in his fight with Eddie Alvarez
*  Although he lost both but all of them are good man. Oh, they were great. The poor yeah
*  His leg was almost done was almost done
*  But poor I pulled it out with the knockout poor actually came out on record and said he thinks Gagee's gonna win really
*  Yeah
*  That's cuz he's never fought Tony
*  You know, he's fought Gagee and beat him and it would be great if Gagee beat Tony and then it makes him look good
*  We don't necessarily know if that's I mean, it's not that Tony can't win. It's not that
*  That Gagee can't win either. It's like in my opinion is a who the fuck knows it's a who the fuck knows especially in these conditions
*  It's like what camp have they had especially?
*  Justin well, I know Tony's had a camp Tony's had a camp but you got a real everything's everything's not normal
*  Like you're not getting the same amount of guys. Tony's not normal
*  Tony's not normal Tony if anyone's gonna thrive in the situation. It's Tony. He didn't you know, he didn't spar at all
*  Apparently according to everyone that I've talked to just can't for the Pettis fight. Yeah after his surgery
*  So the guy has knee surgery like a really complex knee surgery where his ligament is
*  Reattached to his leg and he is a massive scar
*  I mean, he's got a 12 inch scar on the side of his leg five months later. He's fighting again. He's crazy
*  That's nuts. That's nuts and didn't do any sparring just just rehabbed everything got himself in shape. He looked pretty good
*  He looked fucking fantastic wobbled in that fight. Of course he did fighting Pettis Pettis is a master striker
*  Pettis knocked out Wonder Boy with a Superman punch 100%
*  Yeah, I don't know if you can take those same hits the wage Gagee hits a good question Gagee
*  You know Gagee comes after you man. He comes out and he's got
*  Phenomenal leg kicks his leg kicks are sensational and he throws leg kicks from crazy angles, too
*  Like he'll be like right up tight with you like right here and he's chopping at your leg. It's kind of amazing
*  It's interesting how he does it like he's not a he's not he doesn't have a Muay Thai background
*  Which is really crazy just learned to kick about four years ago. Well more than that cuz I remember in the PFL
*  I'm just saying like he's not he has no kickboxing background
*  He came from University of Northern, Colorado to grudge training center with Trevor Whitman all of us and came in
*  There's a pure wrestler with terrible eyesight. He'd always take his glass off and squint and he's just this fucking monster
*  And then he started teaching the leg kick and like holy shit the guy can like kick but it's crazy
*  How good he does it? He's amazing at it
*  His leg kicks are sensational like you would think that he was some Muay Thai champion or something like that. It's amazing. Yeah
*  Yeah, this is what I want I want to see
*  Tony shoot for a takedown. Mm-hmm. I don't know why I know obviously Justin Gaethje has phenomenal wrestling
*  He's so athletic and he was an all-american at Northern, Colorado. Tony's a stud too. I think he's a juco champ
*  So let's someone shoot in on the fucking guy. Well, no one does it. Yeah, no one does it
*  Well, what's interesting about Gaethje is you never see him wrestling. That's what's so crazy
*  It's like the guys get this great wrestling pedigree, but he just strikes with everybody and smashes
*  And smashes real strikers like Barbosa. He wants to be violent. Yeah, that's it all violent. It's so nuts
*  This fight's actually not that you know, obviously I want Khabib Tony. That's the greatest fight in UFC history
*  I think at lightweight. It's cursed. It's fucking dude
*  You might be five times five times five times. What the fuck? I want to see that
*  That's the fight of the two the best 155s on the planet
*  But Gaethje Tony I think will be more entertaining are you serious so violent
*  They're so fun. Think of these two fucking maniacs. There's this fight can't be boring. It's impossible
*  I don't think I think you're right. I don't think it can be boring. However, I
*  Said that about style Bender versus yo, al Romero. I thought you know, yo, I wasn't gonna fight
*  Yeah, I guarantee you Gaethje and Tony are gonna fight
*  Well, I bet my bottom dollar that about in ganu and Derek Lewis
*  I didn't know Derek Derek Lewis fucking back gave out
*  I know Francis had a blown fucking ACL or whatever it was. Did he Francis?
*  So he was injured in that fight both of them were injured. I didn't know Francis was injured
*  I thought he was just his mind was
*  Apparently both of them had injuries. Oh, I didn't know that bro. That's a fight this weekend
*  No one's talking about you know, it's coming event knows it's coming. It should be I
*  Should be they had Greg Hardy and whoever the fuck he's fighting
*  Above that. Oh, I'm like, what are you guys doing? That was because it was on ESPN
*  The other one was on ESPN plus I think the idea was that you're gonna have in Ghana when Rosenstrike
*  Which is just like the main event for ESPN plus that's Disneyland at the end of the night
*  That fight is crazy Rosenstrike
*  People better not be sleeping on him man. No, he's a terrifying man
*  He's a professional kickboxer and he takes a tremendous shot. You look at over him didn't do nothing to him
*  They fought for the entire five rounds
*  He didn't do nothing to him until Rosenstrike caught him with that bomb
*  Rosenstrike was gonna lose that fight to us gonna lose that he was gonna lose that fight. He was gonna lose that fight
*  It's in the prelim still
*  It's coming event now. I talked to his agent last night. Oh, this is because the
*  Rose Nama, you know his fight is pulled. They still have Rose on there
*  Okay, you're right. I kept it there and jacarÃ©e Sousa people were saying that it was Ryan Hall
*  Yeah, you guys text that and I didn't text back. I thought you guys were joking. No, somebody sent me a meme
*  That said Ryan Hall versus jacarÃ©e Sousa and I was like, is that real and Eddie goes can they even do in the weight class?
*  I thought you guys I was like, uh, they're joking so I didn't respond to it. I didn't think of course
*  Look Ryan Hall has such a hard time finding opponents. You got a fight though. Did he he got a fight
*  Oh
*  Stud he's fighting a stud is he?
*  Ricardo Lamas. Okay, that's a good fight for him. That's a tough fucking fight. Nobody wants to fight Ryan Hall man
*  Exactly finally gets returned. Yes Ricardo Lamas in May. Yeah, he's he's so difficult because
*  Hall is so tall and long but also how dare you guys think he was fighting?
*  I didn't understand it. I thought maybe he just said fuck it. I have no camp, but I want to fight
*  Weigh 185 I'd watch the shot
*  Imagine I mean, I don't think he's losing 40 pounds in between fights, but he's a tall guy. He's like six feet
*  Is he yeah, he's not he's not yeah, it's not short for the division
*  Yeah, he's thin but I mean fuck and he's also he's a for us a hobby guy, right?
*  Hall yeah, I'm pretty sure he's training at a tristar. No, he trains down here now
*  He's at a Cal he has his own gym in Orange County and he trains at Kenny Florian's. Did he ever train with Sahabi?
*  Maybe did early on but he's been out of Cali
*  Interesting his own school and then Kenny's what is his what's his camp? Like who's putting together the camp?
*  I don't know who said guys
*  Alexander Hernandez comes back. That's a great fight. I don't know
*  Dude, I don't think people realize that the fucking depth dude
*  Francis in Ghana versus Rosenstuhl is insane
*  That's gonna be amazing and and if you if you just people in Viera of Ray Borg that's ridiculous
*  But people give Francis enough credit you look at his record
*  You're like, well, I'll see he had his hiccup against steep and then the Derrick Lewis
*  I don't count but besides steep a dude the run and the dudes that he's beat
*  If he were to become champion, you're talking top five of all time that yeah, you look at his record like holy shit
*  If he becomes champion, I mean
*  Knocked out Cain Blasquez knocked out JDS Alistair Overeem. Yep
*  Andre Olovsky. Yeah, I mean the whole I mean the who's who and the way he knocks him out. That's the thing
*  It's just the way he knocks him out, but he's getting old. I mean, he's getting up there in age
*  He's like 37 now, I think dude, you know something to think about with could be Tony and these guys
*  Yes, we 30 something, you know Tony's 36 is he and for a lightweight for a heavyweight doesn't matter for a lightweight
*  Yeah long in the tooth. It's not gonna say it there
*  They hide that information
*  But let me see the main card what's what's what's the main card the card so filthy
*  Jeremy Stevens Calvin K. Dard
*  What down on the bottom of the screen if you can see that okay, that's the Jeremy Stevens Calvin K. Dards fantastic fight, dude
*  How about fucking your boys on there? Nico price?
*  So, okay, it still says Greg Hardy is the co-main but that's been changed, right?
*  That's from what I understand Nico price now from what I understand. He's the coming event
*  Jeremy Stevens and Calvin Kater. That's the sleeper of the night. I think Calvin Kater is the dark horse of the 145 pound division
*  That motherfucker scary
*  He's a beast. I mean he he's had I think he's had two losses inside the octagon. I think
*  Um
*  God that's a fucking fight. I'm not to my Kano beat him with leg kicks. He
*  Made a real good adjustment and started catching him with leg kicks and won a decision and then he beat
*  He beat a bunch of guys and lost his a beat and he lost his a beat in a fight where he was
*  He was dominating a third round. Yeah, that was a toss-up dominating that third round and I was like man
*  This is a five round fight. I like cater me too all day. He fucked up llamas
*  That was a fight where right away you could see the the difference in the hands Calvin trains a lot with boxers
*  He's got vicious hands like super accurate and really long
*  Like if you see if you go to his Instagram, he put up the KO of llamas
*  It's very interesting because he ranges him
*  He ranges him and then he drops these super long punches on he's a Boston kid, right?
*  Yeah, but the it's the like watch how he sets this up like he moves his hands one to see the range
*  the length of that and
*  He's huge for a 45 or two real tall and long
*  But the fucking torque in that right hand he
*  Spins him around with the left and then puts the lights out with the right. Look at that is fucking picture perfect, man
*  Picture perfect. Oh shit Irish Mickey Ward says good luck Calvin Wow, how about seeing that looking down?
*  Six guns Gibson. Yeah, but that one too was sensational dude him for Stevens is a phenomenal fight
*  Nominal fight and now you look at all the fights. It's like man fire the night. Good luck. I know Nico price
*  I know okay. I know Vicente. Luke is an animal and Nico price is an animal both those guys together
*  That's a I can't believe that go back to what you just
*  the whole full full card I
*  Couldn't there it is. Hmm. I can't believe when the UFC announces some people hate it
*  I'm like you fucking negative bitches
*  That's insane
*  We're in the Corona Times and Dana pulled this off
*  This if this was a run time when the Corona Times
*  If this was a regular pay-per-view would make my dick hard let alone with Corona. This is amazing
*  The Greg Hardy de Castro listen not not a highly skilled fight. Somebody's going to fucking sleep
*  Hopefully but to be coming event is a little crazy
*  Well, I was interested that Greg Hardy stepped up and fought volkan and didn't look bad didn't look bad didn't get annihilated
*  Didn't get annihilated against one of the best heavyweights in the division. Correct. Alexander is a really
*  Technical fighter and real long real tall and long
*  I mean look at what he did a Fabrizio Verdun Fabrizio Verdun was the UFC heavyweight champion
*  He fucked him up and Greg Hardy went the distance with him and did not look bad and had one hand
*  Yeah, and yeah broke his hand early in the fight. He's going to get better
*  He's a stud athlete the difference between like guys like first of all, he doesn't have another way, right?
*  He doesn't have a fucking football career anymore. He's not gonna play pro baseball. This is it. This is it. There's no podcast
*  Then he's got a dicey pass in terms of the law. I would say the dicey is it's pretty dicey
*  Then John Jones says hold my beer
*  But Greg Hardy's a fucking elite athlete he's a guy who knows how to be a professional athlete and he was all Projo
*  Yeah, he's legit man super stud athlete
*  But there's a thing about guys like that where from the time they're young they realize this insane work ethic is how you make it
*  And they also they're they're used to these regimented programs, right? Where a lot of
*  Football players are used to this kind of stuff
*  And they're used to this kind of stuff
*  And they also they're they're used to these regimented programs, right where a lot of
*  Football players and you can speak on this they're used to these programs where everybody's doing the same kind of work
*  Versus boxers or MMA fighters. You're on your own. You're on your own and sometimes you half-assed it
*  And sometimes you're not disciplined you fuck off
*  You don't go to kickboxing you decide I don't want to go to jiu-jitsu today and want to fuck my girlfriend
*  That kind of shit doesn't happen in football doesn't work that way especially at like University of Colorado
*  Ohio State so if you're one of ten linebackers and you're all doing the exact same thing
*  You're all fighting for your job every day. Yeah, if you for whatever reason don't do something well, and this guy does
*  He's probably gonna play over you. So you're like it's this heightened
*  Frickin competition all the time man, and it brings the best out of you. It does
*  Eric Anders was a football player too right? Yeah, another Alabama stud
*  Go watch his fight with Khalil roundtrip
*  Oh he looked amazing
*  And the motherfucker doesn't flinch Khalil roundtrip was lighting him up lighting him up. He never flinched
*  Khalil roundtrip was fucking his legs up in a way very rarely you see
*  His leg was so fucked up
*  And Khalil was full Muay Thai light on the front legs
*  Whack! Whack!
*  He looked phenomenal
*  Dude when Khalil's on his game he he displays some of the best Muay Thai you're gonna see in the UFC
*  Eric Andrews just I know you don't watch football Joe so he played at Alabama and it was on the national champion team
*  So that that's like creme de la creme doesn't get better than that
*  That's like wrestling at Ohio State or Oklahoma like he's high level football player
*  Well, he's a stud that guy is an animal in terms of like in his ability to endure pain and his ability to press forward
*  And you know and fights a lot takes fights take fight a light heavyweight take a fight 185
*  He's game. He's game as fuck
*  And again, that's the thing that's like these elite athletes these guys who know what it takes to be a winner
*  You know if you those Greg Hardy guys Eric Andrews guys, and we're gonna get more of those
*  There's gonna be more guys like that
*  Let's see a path and there's there's more guys like that that
*  Don't want to rely on a team. You know they don't like if the team they're on sucks. They don't shine
*  They'd rather kill what they eat
*  100%
*  You know what I mean? Yeah, there's a lot of guys like that where they'd rather just go out and do it themselves and MMA is
*  A sport where they can do that. Yeah, so you see a lot of these guys they start practicing MMA, you know offseason
*  They train a little bit offseason. I wouldn't be surprised if John's brother Arthur gets into MMA both of them
*  I mean Chandler's all pro to Pro Baller, but I was Arthur trains with him a lot doesn't a ton. Yeah, he's huge
*  He's such a huge
*  So big and he could fight man if he decided to start fighting take out a few pro fights
*  I mean, I think John said in interviews, but I remember when John and I were talking he I mean Arthur gives him problems
*  Oh, yeah, like if they wrestle it's problem huge and explosive
*  He's and he's huge and the nicest guy the nicest guy, but he's so big
*  The brothers don't have problems though, huh? The bread you don't really hear much about the brothers fucking up
*  Well, they both been popped for steroids. Yeah, I mean sports though
*  I'm talking about like
*  Hanging out at Albuquerque get four in the morning with bombs and fucking shooting guns. Oh, yeah
*  Well, they don't well they do get hit in the head they get hit in the head football style
*  Which by the way, I got through the Wandery series on I still haven't watched the Netflix documentary on your boy
*  That looks exactly
*  But goddamn dude that Wandery
*  Podcast series warrior. It's so good. So good
*  Was gripped it was one of those, you know, sometimes you get a podcast series like that like another one is
*  the dropout about that Elizabeth Holmes chick that robbed everybody with that
*  Theranos that's right. Yeah, that's another one. Is it good? Holy shit
*  There's a few of those we start I mean you like what the fuck dude
*  Sometimes I'll sit in my car and wait till that so it's done. It's I'm like so into it
*  I'm on something right now that I know you're you're you read you that chaos book the Charles Manson book
*  He's coming in who Tom O'Neill is coming in next week. Yes. I'm in the middle of that book right now. It's
*  Holy shit, holy shit. You look at man. It's a little different. You look at the whole thing a little different
*  Yes, you're like what?
*  Yeah, I don't want to say too much because I want Tom to explain when you having him on next week that book so fucking good
*  Dude, I'm balls deep in that I'm in writing about that book for grip
*  Well, well the things that are absolutely
*  Absolutely provable that he knows Charles Manson the CIA in the secret history of the 60s
*  The the things that are absolutely 100% provable just those things are mind-blowers
*  We like whoa and it's documented to how the CIA and the SD house and in
*  Hey, Ashbury in San Francisco and yeah how he was doing wild shit and the CIA would let him go
*  Yeah, or how he was out here at that ranch and the cops never they people go dude
*  He's doing wild shit arrest them. They're like we're told not to touch him. You're like what?
*  Yeah, do they fuck they killed the caretaker at that ranch. They didn't find that guy's body until the site the late 70s
*  Yeah, they they did a lot of books. It's a very good book
*  They did a lot of shit in the
*  1970s with drugs and people for experiments in 60s and the 70s and that's how they created the Unabomber man
*  Ted Kaczynski was a part of the Harvard LSD program. Yeah, what did you watch that documentary the net?
*  It's on Netflix. Which one is it? I forget but it's about the Unabomber and I I didn't know that
*  I'm like, why is he such why was he so fucked up man hunter? I think so. Yes. I haven't watched it's so good
*  Is another one? Yeah, see how the one called. Oh, that's what you know bomber in his own words
*  What's the first time that he only let one person ever interview him and it's all the tapes from the interview
*  Oh
*  You know his legal his defense team goes listen, dude
*  You're not gonna get the death penalty if you just plead insanity goes fuck. I'm not insane
*  He goes do I seem insane to you? He goes I'm not insane
*  And so he fired his defense team because they wanted to say he was insane. He goes I'd rather die than be called insane
*  He's like I'm not insane. I'm a genius
*  It's a goddamn dude he was smart as fuck
*  Well, he might be too smart because he's actually
*  Look, he's not correct to kill those people, but he is correct that
*  Technology is eventually gonna overcome people now imagine
*  This is we're going deep down the Eddie Bravo rabbit hole. I love it. Imagine if you were
*  Artificial intelligence and you had decided you wanted to assimilate with people but you had to convince people
*  One of the best ways to convince people is to get them addicted to technology
*  Check done. All right, everybody's a different technology and then get them connected through social media apps
*  Get them connected to technology. I mean how many times you go to a restaurant?
*  We don't know right now not at all
*  But anytime you go out in public before the quarantine everybody was on their phone check buddy
*  Now you throw a virus in there
*  So now they can't be with people and then you make it so when they see people they can't touch them
*  They can't hug people they can't shake hands. They have to make distance
*  So now the only way you can connect with people is through zoom or FaceTime
*  Technology technology and then and then while we're all quarantine you're installing 5g towers
*  Do you see that did you post that with that little devol little devol yeah, tell me
*  Five G towers and why five countries have 5g towers
*  100 countries have coronavirus fucking idiots
*  It's the best point the best point is one of those points where you go. Oh, yeah, I saw Tyrese posted
*  He's like y'all need to look at this 5g. That's what's causing all this and killing kids and corona virus
*  I was like, oh buddy. Oh, buddy. This is just make fast and fierce 19. Shut the fuck up
*  So many fucking people that think of 5g is what's killing people
*  But it's like there's always gonna be that thing where whenever something happens people look for some nefarious
*  Backwoods sort of fucking I also I also think you know in this time
*  It's very easy to get down and depressed and a lot of people thrive in that so they want it to be bad
*  It's like God get out of here. Do you write get out of here? You're right. You're right
*  There are people that are like they're happy. They're thriving. Yeah
*  Thriving I saw some lady write some post about Justin Bieber
*  She's making fun of Justin Bieber's house, which by the way looks pretty pimp. They're like fucking dope. Yeah, I know
*  They're like, it's so disgusting. It looks like it looks like a stupid Sim City house. But then she wrote eat the rich
*  And like what?
*  Mike he's a singer. Meanwhile, she looks meanwhile. She looks like an armadillo. Yeah. Yeah, I'm you bitch
*  I
*  Dillo on the Barbie
*  People are so crazy though, like because they're angry and they're frustrated like it's like is it his fault that he's a super successful
*  Musician that has a crazy dope house and super talented and also that house. Let me look at your house bitch. Yeah, let me look at
*  That's what she's angry. That's what she's like. Yes the rich
*  Well, I saw one guy post this thing mean count talk to us where he goes
*  Hey, I've heard horrible stories about Ellen for every bad story you guys share I'll donate two dollars to this, you know
*  Corona I'm like dude, what's wrong with you man? Do something positive. You think this is positive? Hey, I'm fucking Ellen
*  People are cooped up and they're filled with anger and they find a target for that anger. They're filled with
*  anxiety and depression and
*  Rage and you know, so do something to get to be creative man. Do something to get out of it. Yeah, good call
*  Yeah, but don't hate on the people who are doing it that's why you're in that position
*  Do you see what Ellen did? This is really really kind of funny. She said
*  Being stuck here in quarantine is like being in prison. I haven't changed my clothes in days and everyone's gay
*  It's funny
*  She got attacked. Do you think this is present my other guy?
*  You're living in a mansion that kind of shit
*  But I think it's probably partly because that guy came out and said hey Ellen's mean post your stories about Ellen being mean
*  Do you see the stories?
*  Nothing too bad man. What was it? She was like, oh I came on her show and before I left she didn't say hi
*  It's like Ellen takes down video after jail joke about coronavirus self-quarantine
*  Wow, she's she's shook. She's shook right now go to your root your comic stand by it
*  There's a several other articles written about her being an asshole. Oh, yeah, listen people capitalized. I've heard about it
*  I've heard it, you know in entertainment all around it's like don't you also think that she's one of those
*  Tooth-and-claw get to the top. That's why she became Ellen correct first place and that makes a lot of enemies
*  She's a type. She's a personality. It's her show. It's her way of the highway and it runs people wrong also
*  Probably maligned most of her life because she was a lesbian had to keep it in tight
*  There's some darkness. Yeah, some darkness in there some anger in there, you know
*  But the fucking jokes hilarious hilarious, that's a great joke hilarious joke
*  I like we're the same clothes and everyone's gay. That's funny
*  That's funny
*  Real funny fuck you
*  Fuck you eat the rich
*  My favorite hate not Justin B. Have you seen that fucking crib? You know what that looks like inside you fucking morons
*  You know, it's dope that crib is yeah, but the thing is like
*  it's
*  Saying it's the ugliest house ever. It's so crazy. It's weird-looking
*  Yeah, but when you're Justin Bieber look at that, bro
*  That looks like some sort of you know what that looks like
*  It looks like a museum like you would go there and they'd be like a dinosaur in there
*  It looks like it looks like the opening Jurassic Park. Yes
*  Yeah, that's a dope house. I bet it's all glass. You just walk around butt naked with his girl and shit
*  It looks like a giant salad spinner now you can lease it
*  Well, no one's gonna wanna lose it now social media users mocked this Beverly Hills house
*  But tweeters got a few things wrong. First of all
*  You're let me see your house. You're mocking this house
*  Push your house post your house bitch post your shitty little apartment in Studio City
*  You're mocking this castle from this fucking Tony Stark castle 60 grand a month. Ooh, that's it
*  Dude that thing is fucking sick
*  That house is sick
*  Look at the inside
*  Look at the inside. That's it. That house is dope as fuck. It makes me like him more
*  Yeah, you know when I heard Justin Bieber songs, I thought it was sung by a girl
*  At first you didn't I had no idea. I thought it was a girl song
*  It's like that's Justin Bieber. I'm like what like the yummy song. It's like I did. Why are you laughing? I didn't know
*  I didn't know bro. I listen to
*  98% classic rock, okay
*  I'm that old dude, but your your but your kids are listening to Justin Bieber. I don't know if they do no
*  No, I shut that shit off. I throw it in the shit out of here. Here's some Leonard skaters. What?
*  Yeah, if they work out at the gym I make them listen to fucking Skinner and Zeppelin but I'm sure they have the stuff
*  They like yes. Yeah. Oh my god. It's terrible. Yeah
*  My kids sing a lot. Yeah
*  Yeah, wonderful Lizzo scared of Corona
*  She should be that's what I'm saying. Yeah
*  She should be a lot of people should be scared, you know, my dad hasn't left this house
*  But he's also like 63 so I'm like I get it Papa. Yeah, my parents got real spooked
*  My parents got real spooked. They don't they don't do shit. They're holding up. I think that
*  When the remedy comes out
*  Hopefully even they figure out what it is. We're all gonna relax
*  Fouchi was saying that we're not shaking hands anymore ever no shaking hands again ever
*  Bro, I can't come on man. Do come on. That's it
*  That's why I kind of like that the UFC is doing their thing and also it's like this is the UFC the the
*  Dana White and for Tita's like they're Cowboys man. They take risk. They're cage fighting promoters. There's no safety in that
*  Do you think that when Francis and gone who fought Alistair Overman knocked him into another dimension?
*  Do you think there's any safety in that? No, where's the safety?
*  But I would rather have Corona than eat that uppercut. I'm saying it's like
*  Also, you know, I mean Tony's probably the oldest guy in the car at 36
*  Yeah, look at the odd if if Tony let's say worst-case scenario all the fighters got Corona
*  Look at the odds. They're all gonna be just fine
*  Especially in the shape that they're in odds are they me fine now Tony Ferguson gets Corona
*  You'll see him the next day running hills. Yes with a mask on so it other people correct
*  Now as long as those fighters don't go back home and that and their grandparents are around that's where it gets icy
*  But I'm assuming they're not fucking idiots. Yeah, that's where it gets dicey
*  I just wish there was a way to tell if you had it because so many people are asymptomatic
*  You know, there's a lot of people that didn't feel any symptoms at all and they found that they had it and like whoa
*  You know, I wish there was a better way to know if you had it
*  But but even if there's not again you look at the odds the chances are and this is why Dana and the guys are going
*  With the fight. It's like everyone should be fine. Yes
*  COVID-19 tests expected for fighters coaches prior to UFC 249
*  So they're gonna test them and I think what they're doing at the event is gonna they're gonna temperature test everybody
*  temperature testing
*  Again to play devil's advocate. It's a little tough because again some people have and don't show symptoms
*  Yeah, show symptoms at all expect to send test kits to fighters and teams ahead of the event
*  Which is currently rumored to take place at Tai Chi
*  Tachi Tachi Palace house, you know in Lemora, California
*  A second round of testing is also expected to take place on site at 249 testing is one of the strongest measures
*  The promotion can take to ensure that those who attend the event are negative for the coronavirus
*  Which is an incubation period of up to 14 days
*  It doesn't completely eliminate the possibility of spreading the virus according to CDC
*  It's possible a person the early stages of infection could test negative on the test recognized by the Public Health Institute
*  Oh great. I got an update on Francis
*  They're still finalizing the lineup, but they believe Francis will be co-main event
*  Would you not why would you not?
*  But who do they have of the main event on ESPN? That's the that's the fucking sweetener
*  That's the little taste of meth that gets you to buy the pay-per-view. I know who would you
*  Let me see the card again. Well, how about Stevens and cater? When is that? Is it on the main card?
*  It's main card. It should be on the main card. That's my fight. Luke a Nico price
*  The whole fucking card dude, yeah, I just I wish it was free though
*  Mmm, no, they don't have to make that they gotta make that cheddar
*  William WME, you know, like you gotta think all their touring acts musicians me. Okay. I'm WME
*  All their all their touring acts everything's been canceled. Oh 420 has been moved to October 420 in Vancouver has moved to October
*  24th
*  24th that's gonna be in high October 24th. We're gonna get highest fucking Vancouver. Hopefully hopefully
*  Covid 2 doesn't come out. So that's uh, that's the main card and go to the
*  Prelims and see who's gonna be there if it's not jacarie. You're right. All right, that's it right there
*  Just move that one up and then the bottom is Marlon Vera and Ray Borg now go to fight past prelims
*  so what they'll do is they'll move up Michael Johnson and
*  Comma worthy they'll do that's a great
*  Yeah, those are great to the move that DSP. Do you know I heard I heard the fighters gonna be fine
*  But I heard the commentators gonna be in super danger of getting Corona. So you shouldn't do it and we should do a fight companion
*  I
*  Selfishly don't want you to do it and also we can do a great fight. I don't want to do it too
*  But I also I'm very curious about what it's like to see a fight in an arena with no one there
*  Have you ever been to the ultimate fighter? No, I mean granted within the arena, but no, it's just
*  It just feels it just feels different. Yeah, I'm sure you can literally hear that
*  Oh god, I know it's gonna fail. It's gonna sound really weird because I scream a lot, too
*  I'm gonna be like everyone's gonna hit. Yeah, it's gonna be very strange. They're gonna hear what I think should be done
*  They're gonna hear that might help. Yeah for DC if DC is gonna be there with me if someone's wrestling
*  So you think you're gonna do it? I don't know. You still don't know do it's next Saturday after the side
*  Well, listen I said that I would do it if it was gonna be in America I talked to Dan I said look
*  Man, you got you do it in America. I'm gonna do it, but it's not really in America
*  It's on an Indian reservation, which means it's not sanctioned by any athletic commission. So does it not count?
*  It counts. What's that?
*  Will be sanctioned event how?
*  All of their international events they work together with the Nevada Commission to sanction them and this the ABC which is the Association of Boxing Commission
*  Sports as this will be a section of how I pulled out all the stops
*  That's interesting so how do they
*  Skirt the California rules for combat sports then because it's not they're technically not on the nine
*  Jurisdiction right? So they're using the go back scroll back up again, please
*  Scroll back to the beginning of the article. Here's something to think about if any
*  Boxing Commission in combat of sports
*  So the ABC which is the Association of Boxing Combat of Sports released a statement
*  Saying that it's taking place on tribal land
*  Did how great is tribal land? They can do anything they can do whatever they want. It's fantastic
*  I mean just during these times they had a
*  rough
*  Reason for why the roughest I mean they used to own the whole country
*  When the UFC does international events they regulate themselves using the Vata State Athletic Commission inspectors in this event
*  On sovereign land is no different
*  Fantastic sovereign land we have little countries inside our country. It's fantastic
*  Here's what's interesting is
*  Any other like if Bella tore?
*  World's here PFL if they were like fuck California Commission
*  We're gonna do our Native American land in California
*  They would never be allowed to work here again that that athletic commission like dude you fucked
*  So that's true not doing it, but do you have see such a juggernaut?
*  I don't think California is gonna flex on him and the end the UFC has a close relationship with California
*  Well, California Athletic Commission is run by Andy Foster. I'm a big fan of that. I like Andy
*  He's the best with the whole John Jones stuff. Remember all that
*  So he has a pretty tight relationship with the UFC and Dana White
*  So I don't think it's gonna be an issue for them. Well, I don't think so either. It's being sanctioned
*  Not by the California Athletic Commission. Yeah, but ABC Commission
*  Good enough it here's here's what else is kind of inch about this is
*  It's great Dan is putting on he made it happen
*  But you realize that one of the reasons they're making happen is there's a little bit of desperation
*  Because they have to put on 40 something fights. How many did I how many did I say Jamie?
*  I read this article 42 for the year
*  They have to they have to put on 42 fights to get their 750 million bucks from ESPN
*  They have to do that. How many weeks are left in the year?
*  38 we get a ton of fights on wait a minute
*  Put on so how many have they done they've done seven seven thirty five to go
*  38 weeks left if you're fighting a fight every week back to back to back and then they're gonna go to fuck island
*  Right, I think great are they read to Jeff Jeffrey Epstein's island. Is that true? Jamie?
*  That's so awesome
*  Yeah, I can we would treat events held on mystery islands the same way as well mystery islands
*  We are in a goddamn movie
*  So the UFC again you can sense it and you know this I'm not saying you don't know there's a little bit of desperation where
*  They have to put on the fights to get that 750 million bucks the word goes fuck you pay me
*  Desperation is a word that you could use another word is innovation
*  They had to innovate they had to figure out how to keep having fights
*  It's desperate because you know they have they need to do something WME needs the money everybody needs the money
*  I mean the UFC is one of the rare people that WME owns
*  That's not fucked right now in terms of like firing employees and there was an article written that the UFC fired a bunch of employees
*  It's not true. No, it's really more like go some of the agents employees, but UFC didn't I'd say that's more credit to Dana than
*  WME yeah
*  Yeah
*  I think it's both innovation and desperation like dude. We have to get this money. Yeah, we have to get this money
*  We're gonna figure out how to make these fights happen. Well, they canceled three cards, right?
*  Postponed postponed three cards. They're just Jam those motherfuckers on fuck Island, dude. Fuck Island the fry Island
*  Then no one knows where the island is though, right? No, Dana won't tell anyone. Mm-hmm
*  It's it's in international waters, right? That's the idea. Yeah, and then all the international fighters gonna fight there. That's so strange
*  Henry said who though the real Kings already told you that we're fighting May 9th see there PS I'll bring bring your other tiny little friend
*  They said that a lot of Brazilian fighters couldn't get visas for the UFC 250 Oh, is that why all those not fine? Oh
*  Couldn't get visas to leave Brazil
*  Because Brazil doesn't want people leaving is that the idea? Hey, but also
*  To be fair Don McCrews verse Henry Sudo is a better fight. It's a very good
*  Oh, no, I don't know about that all those coming off a loss
*  Bullshit, it's a loss. Really? I thought you want to fight. Yep. That's fine. I mean that's fine
*  Well, what's the record show though it does show it on the record, but I thought that was a bad decision horrible decision
*  But it's tough to give him that nod not not if you're the UFC you go fuck those judges
*  Now I get it it's the Wild West yeah, we're fighting on fuck island guy that lost a fight skin a title shot
*  We got an interim belt. It's like
*  Tony's made a two-time interim belt champion. They better not take it from him this time. They stole it from before
*  Yeah, they did. I mean it's on the longest winning streak in UFC history
*  I think you know what's gonna happen, isn't he? Yeah
*  Yeah period long as in lightweight, right? Yeah. Well, I think period though, right?
*  Record yeah in terms of like years, I mean he hasn't lost since he got his arm broken the Michael Johnson fight
*  Here's something else. Yeah, I think about
*  Tony first and Justin Gaethje can be complete violence Tony's probably gonna fight for a little while
*  Khabib has Ramadan in August
*  So I'm assuming we're gonna be back to normal Khabib's gonna want to fight before then Tony's not gonna be ready
*  Unless he smokes Justin Gaethje with no one smokes Justin Gaethje
*  So you're gonna get Connor could be to in between that in July. Yes
*  Good good good good good. But we're in we're in March. Yeah
*  April April but also I'm thinking May June July August is Ramadan Tony gets still fighting July
*  Yeah, Connor's Connor's Connor's chomping at the bit to go is he yeah, yeah, but Khabib doesn't want to fight Connor
*  The
*  Thing is it's the UFC dude that he went through with Connor talking shit Connor's already talking shit
*  He's already talking shit again. Like it's not like he's gonna stop talking shit
*  He's gonna wrap it back up again. So Khabib has to endure all that stuff again until he can get a hold of him one more time
*  That's what I think they're gonna do. I have no I think I have to beat one more person other than cowboy
*  You would think
*  It's it's it's Connor McGregor, he's the biggest
*  Fame most famous fighter of all time. Would you not watch could be Connor too? Oh, I'd watch it for sure
*  Especially if it takes place on fuck Island
*  Dun dun dun
*  Oh, yeah, I saw that Anderson's front kick Ron DeSarbo handles H bomb crow cops
*  I kicked John's side kick the knees over and over again
*  It's actually the only thing at this stage Khabib's little mermaid leg wrap thing. He does. Why did he delete that?
*  He said way worse
*  Oh
*  He's Connor
*  Yeah, but yeah, I think you need a little bit of a layoff. Oh, yeah
*  so so then you know because you're doing this fight which praise the fight gods were getting but
*  Ramadan's in August so we got it could be passed to fight in between there
*  Maybe or he just rides it out rides it out
*  Fights in the December 31st card God once fights when he knows that there's going to be fights
*  They'll do it in Vegas the duty mobile big deal boom boom fireworks, he doesn't fight for money. It doesn't give a shit
*  He's probably got so much money right now, and he's in Russia. They like worship one. He drives a Toyota
*  That's a bummer. You know that which which Toyota the island of emerald isle of the island is emerald isle of Ireland. That's not true
*  Silly silly Connor. He drives a fucking like a Toyota Tundra. Those are cool. They're fine, but I mean that's him
*  Yeah, guys a multi multi millionaire and doesn't floss and time time over at least you're looking at me where it's like sweatsuits and shit
*  Doesn't have a fancy watch doesn't know
*  Nothing nothing. What are we does with his money puts in a nice grizzly bears and shit
*  He's the total polar opposite of Connor in that regard that's why it's fantastic
*  Yeah, Connor's wearing half a million dollar watches while he's hitting the speed. I love you see that shit
*  Yeah, I love it. He's hitting the Cobra bag with a fucking half a million dollar watch on it's great
*  You need that I don't know how much that watch cost but it looked expensive because it cuz you got Tony who's
*  Labeled as the crazy guy right yet Tony who's labeled well. He's just he's he's a different bird
*  Let's just put it in cone Tony had sunglasses on he's staring down with Khabib and he's telling Khabib to take your glasses off
*  Yes, so take your sunglasses off take your sunglasses off and keep you like what?
*  He's a he's a brilliant madman
*  I
*  Get deal with this guy I do with Connor throwing money my face
*  Weightlifting gloves and he's got his sleeves rolled up
*  I'll tell you if just we're able to pull this off Justin Gagey Khabib is a fucking fight
*  Oh my god, cuz Justin can wrestle. Yes. Yeah phenomenal phenomenal fight
*  He can wrestle and he's super dangerous standing up and it's really hard to take him down
*  If he doesn't want to get taken down, it's a real hard go
*  and he throws
*  everything into those punches and he's
*  He's wild but calculated, you know
*  Gagey. Yeah. Yeah. He got he came on food truck diary and we actually got into it and I love when guys address stuff because
*  You know, I'm known Gagey for a long long time and I always said he's pretty he just knows caution of the wind and goes
*  Fucking he's he just brawls. He's like dude. You keep saying that man. People keep telling me that he's like it's calculated
*  You got to go back and watch the thing like got mad that's interesting. Yeah, he's like he goes
*  I know exactly what I'm doing like alright dog Tony. Well, he does know what he's doing, but it is very risky
*  It's both and I think he's calculated in that he's he's realizing there's a high risk high reward thing
*  So he calculates that that's worth it. Whereas a lot of people calculate now. I'm not doing that. I'm not fighting that way
*  He's his style of fighting, you know, that's not a long career. He's not in that no
*  And this is that's one of the reasons I think you took this fight and you know, like Chuck Liddell perfect example real similar style
*  In a lot of ways sprawling brawl just fucking throw caution to the wind and let the hammers fly
*  I mean that style doesn't get you
*  I mean we all see how Chuck went at the end the end and couldn't take a shot anymore
*  You can't do it this day and age in the UFC guys are too good. Yeah, guys are way too good
*  Like style bender wouldn't beat you'll remember if you do caution to the wind you gotta knock the fuck out right right
*  Guys are too talented these days. Yeah, I think so too. I think but but the way
*  Justin does is not totally caution to the wind
*  No just takes risks a lot of risk, but with it you get the rewards like the Edson Barbosa knockout
*  I mean got in Barbosa's face. He did he broke Barbosa
*  Smashed him James Vick to smash the way he does it the guys to but but then think about the the highest level guys that
*  He's fought you look at Dustin Poirier. You look at his fight with Eddie Alvarez. He lost
*  What is his full record? Like who who is his best wins Don's Ronan? It's in Barbosa
*  And then the time he fought, you know who I think is a top three top four guy doesn't pour
*  He lost right Eddie Alvarez at the time monster, right?
*  Lost yeah, and then the World Series of fighting stuff. It's just not it's hard. Yeah, it's hard to do those
*  But I feel like yeah those two fights in a row that he lost
*  But I feel like when you look at his his style in the Vic and Barbosa fights and the soroni fight
*  I think he's gotten better. I think I don't think you're beating those top boys like you ain't being Khabib fighting like that
*  I don't think oh knows man. I mean, we don't know I don't know but I would say the odds are in my favor when I say that
*  Interesting now can can Justin Gaethje beat anybody in the world?
*  Yes, but the odds are with that fighting style going against Khabib or Tony for that matter. It's tough, man
*  Right, but you've got to give him an advantage striking versus harder than all of them, right?
*  100% but then we're not gonna be that Khabib wants to take him down, right?
*  Do you think Khabib is gonna be able to take him down easily easily you think?
*  Yeah, I you know talking to some guys. I know Khabib would go against you know, like Penn State like Ed Ruth
*  Who's whatever four-time all-american? I think three-time national champion. He has like a fucking statue at Penn State
*  I know he wrestled with him and it does not go well for him Fred Ruth really
*  Really? I know guys come and get fucking mauled up by Khabib world-class wrestlers way heavier than
*  Fucks him up. Really guys we know that good that good. God damn
*  Talk to DC about it. Oh, yeah, I have I have but I want to hear from you. Yeah
*  He's such a monster man
*  Yeah, you when when when you hear someone like Josh Thompson and here these guys tell the stories about Khabib
*  Like I don't know if I'll ever lose
*  He's that good and they get we've never seen him lose around in practice
*  Well, he lost one round ever in a fight and that was around three against Connor where it looked like he was kind of taking
*  The round off. Yeah
*  You know, but I mean that's what guys do when they want a final push to finish a guy
*  And then you run to finishing him in the next round
*  I think that rematch is it again. I don't can Connor beat him
*  I don't know but I think if Connor's focus has a full camp. I think that fight does go a little different
*  I do give Connor a better chance. Hmm interesting
*  Yeah, I don't know. I mean you never know who knows it's fun. It's so it's the funnest. Yeah, it is fun
*  It's the best there's no basketball basketball can't perform right now
*  Well the thing about the difference between basketball and everything else and MMA is in MMA. There's two guys
*  In MMA, there's two guys they're fighting and then there's one referee
*  Those are the ones in contact with each other with basketballs. Everyone's fucking on top of everybody five on five
*  You got the best coaches shooting in each other's faces and football same thing colliding
*  Football's gonna be they're not gonna miss a beat. You don't think so. Well didn't didn't Gavin our
*  Governor say something about football not coming back
*  He doesn't count when he talked to him
*  He doesn't count when you talk to like Trump and you hear some of these other people talk like Trump told the NFL the
*  Commissioners like I'm planning for NFL season to not skip a beat dude
*  You want to see people piss in America fuck with football?
*  Fuck without shoe football or Georgia football college football. See what happens you think things are bad now fuck with the college football
*  You know, this is a weird time too because right before the election
*  You know election comes in November like imagine if this had this shit was going on right now in the elections like next week
*  God
*  Imagine chaos your boy Bernie dropped out. Yep
*  It's a wrap
*  Binding ain't beating Trump. No, that's your bass. That's the guy
*  It shows you how crazy the system is that they wanted him that they wanted Biden to be their guy that they don't they can't
*  Admit that he's in cognitive decline. I mean I very strange listen. I fuck up all the time. I speak for a living
*  I fuck up all the time, but I didn't but Biden no, he fucks up man. You're politician
*  I fuck up all the time too
*  But we're also talking live for hours and hours and hours at a time if I had a prepared thing that I was doing
*  Like my stand-up, I don't fuck up
*  You would be sharp as fuck if you're having one of those conversations
*  They're asking you look if someone wants to ask me questions about things that I understand like MMA or like comedy
*  Like if you want to ask me questions about things that I think about and talk about all the time
*  You have your black belt in both. Yeah, I can talk to you and really clearly about those things and make a lot of sense
*  He can't do that about politics and he's been a politician forever and that's your shit
*  He's he's an you know, he's a guy who's suffering
*  He's in decline and they're gonna try to wail him out and whoever his VP is whether it's Kamala Harris or Michelle Obama
*  Maybe whoever it is, but that's who you're voting for
*  You know, he's I mean it's sort of like when Dick Cheney was basically running the country. Yeah, George Bush was the president
*  Yeah, I
*  Don't know. We'll see there's no way he beats Trump. He doesn't beat Trump not a chance
*  No, not a chance, especially because of the timing of this right now. We're in the shit, right?
*  We're in the April shit is the worst time of the corona a lot of people are dying
*  There's a slight drop off in New York people dying less today than yesterday slight drop off yesterday from the day before
*  So things are looking pretty good California. It's gonna be yeah, California looking very good, right? Yeah, we're crushing it
*  Very good. So and then
*  And so and then you go June July
*  August hopefully everything's up and running again economy starts coming back on track Trump makes a couple of great speeches
*  Biden is more in decline. It's not gonna get better. No those two face off Trump's gonna light him up like economy central roast
*  He's already dismissing him. Yeah, he's like he's sleepy Biden
*  He's like but he's saying like someone said Biden said this he goes he did first of all
*  He didn't write that was Democratic operative. He probably doesn't even know what it says. He's gonna destroy him and kill him man
*  I mean, it's such an easy target. It's like Mike Tyson versus a three-year-old. It's true. It really is
*  It's it's it's a terrible fight. I thought Bernie had a legit chance Bernie had a legit chance
*  He had a legit chance because there's a lot of people that are in the middle that are you know, a lot of people that are
*  casually
*  Acquainted with politics that would listen to his message of doing good for the working-class people
*  I think you helped out with that people. I think you made him human we is on here
*  I was like, oh, I like that guy. Would you have Biden on?
*  No, really? No. Oh man. What if he was like this awesome, dude?
*  Well, I'm just really nervous on stage and comes here and just drops knowledge. No, he never was like that
*  That's the thing if you go back and listen to him from when he was younger
*  He was whip smart very smart guy very very clear. Sure all those very clear talk. Yeah
*  This is this is a sign of decline. It's it is what it is
*  You wouldn't have money of open conversation done with all that shit that that Bernie Sanders thing was such a bummer
*  Why because they turned all the stuff that I did in stand-up and like things that I've said drunk
*  I'm stoned on a podcast and put it in quotes as if I'm a homophobe or a transphobe or a racist or they just lied
*  To make it look like Bernie was supporting some right-wing person when meanwhile, I'm left-wing
*  Never been right-wing my life, but also those people don't matter
*  But it didn't matter as much as it made me feel like this is a dirty business
*  Like I don't want to be a part of your dirty business
*  It's it's they're trying to change people's opinions with deception
*  It's not like they're trying to tell you how good their guy is. They're using deception. Yeah, they're using fuckery
*  It's sleazy. It's sleazy. It's a sleazy business. It's not a meritocracy
*  After Bernie came on did other politicians reach out? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah sure a lot
*  Yeah, and they denied it too. I got emails
*  I'll release the email
*  The a lot of them I bet out well they reached out to the publicist
*  But I'm not interested in look
*  I'm only interested in interviewing people that I thought were interesting that I was interested in like Andrew Yang interested in that guy
*  I like him too. I like him smart guy. I love Tulsi Gabbard
*  I just think she's good too, you know, she's so dangerous to those people that they they just they wouldn't want they were trying to change

*  It's a lot harder when you're running much harder going up hills and shit. Oh my god, you're doing trails trails
*  Yeah trail bike right behind my house on like legit trails
*  The thing that bugs me though is you look like you're running away to a mountain line
*  Mountain lines have gone after bikers before I know I thought I thought of you two days ago
*  I was on the trails at 7 a.m. I was the first one there so you can just see the fresh mud
*  I see these huge paw prints and I was like I remember you going dude
*  You don't have a knife or anything
*  And I have this fanny pack that I ride with keep all my stuff and I'm like and I looked down like I have nothing
*  I have a knife from this company called half half face blades and
*  The the and what is it like when you take a bunch of letters like ABC
*  What is it called when you when you just say ABC, you know the American boxing commission?
*  Just an abbreviation
*  It's
*  sh
*  P o s that's the name of the the knife. It's a subhuman piece of shit. Oh damn so it's
*  It's made it's like a spike
*  Like it's it's shaped like if you really wanted if you were in combat, it's got a loop for your thumb
*  So if you really wanted if I don't damn tacked by a cat, I've thought this out another one
*  Yeah, I have another one. Yeah, four of them. I'll give you one of them. You want one. Okay. Okay. No, I don't have it here
*  But I'll get you. Yeah, please do. Yeah, I was so scared shit. It's an it's a Navy SEAL run company. Oh, hell yeah, but
*  This is the it's it's perfect. I keep it on my I have a neoprene fanny pack that I run
*  My cell phone sits in here and I have that motherfucker. That's what I do from now
*  I used to I was running with earplugs on and listening to music but
*  Problem is I run with the dog all the time. I want to be able to hear him and then also
*  Rattlesnakes. Yes, do you see the picture? I posted this round my god, dude. I saw I was on the trail
*  I sent it to you. Yes. I like dude. Look at this fucking round. It was a dragon a straight-up dragon
*  I have nothing it was so thick. So the thing is like you're not fighting a rattlesnake with a knife
*  You know what I mean? Look at the fucker. No, that was someone someone sent that to me. It's on his it's right there
*  That's that fucking thing, dude. Look at the look at the size of this fucker
*  Yeah, that's a big snake man. Look how thick he is. Whoo
*  And I was like, oh look at field. That's a serpent brother
*  Tim dillon, that's my agent
*  God I love Tim. I didn't see that comment. That's so fucking funny, dude that so again
*  I usually run with headphones on and that day I was running I was on my bike and I just I took one out for whatever reason
*  I'm running and I hear something and I looked down I see I'm like, holy
*  Fuck and I'm not scared of a lot. I'm scared of snakes
*  You should be scared of rattlesnakes because if they get you it's a mess. Well, I'm usually with my son
*  mmm
*  Magic kid gets bit by fucking rattlesnake think about all the time. I
*  Was looking at a house once and there was a rattlesnake right in the front yard. Oh, that's a bad sign
*  I killed it. Did you stomped on its head? Yeah, fuck? Yeah, cuz I was like first of all, it's these people's house
*  You know, even if I don't buy this house if they have kids or dogs, they did have a kid. Oh, dude
*  Yeah, you have to but my wife is like, that's a bad sign
*  She's right. Yeah
*  But with that I'm like and I wanted to go that way I was going back home downhill
*  I'm like, dude, please don't make me go back around six miles uphill. It's such a nightmare
*  And I was like, I'm just gonna fucking run by it and I just had this vision my head of him fucking
*  Leashing out if I like
*  So I was like, I'm gonna get some rocks. So I throwing rocks at him. This thing didn't give a fuck dude
*  It was hitting him in the head and just staring at me. He's pretty gangster. I'm gonna go back the long way
*  What the long way dude, I was so scared man, you should be you get bit by a rattlesnake. It is a real nightmare
*  I'm in the middle of nowhere. I'd be so fucked. It causes necrosis all around the injury like your tissue rots away
*  There's some horrible websites
*  They'll show you what it looks like when someone gets bit by a rattlesnake and then they have to have
*  multiple multiple surgeries
*  Skin grafts all this show all the tissue around the injury dies
*  This one guy got bit on his arm and I want to say it took him like 13 surgeries to get back the use of
*  His arm, but I mean over years and it was like huge like huge
*  Rotting hole where the bite was where you could see the bone and they were the mountain land
*  I'm thinking because I saw the big print. I'm like, that's a big fucking cat man
*  How big was it? Oh, like a hand a little small in my hand. They're big and they're out there
*  Lot of them man, they're hungry try finding deer these days was the last time you saw a deer can tell you especially around
*  Our yeah, I could tell you there should be deer everywhere
*  If there's a deer and there's a buck and a doe and then there's a there's a bunch of other does
*  There should be deer everywhere
*  It should be like Pennsylvania where you like you can't drive at night for you worried about hitting them
*  Pennsylvania doesn't have any mountain lions. We got a fuckload of cats and we have bobcats too. We have coyotes
*  I'll fuck a bobcat up, but you think you would I don't think
*  A 40 pound cat trying to kill you you'd be freaked out. Oh for sure
*  The thing about it's stupid thing about a mountain lion killing you is like it might be able to kill you
*  But I want to have something where I'm gonna plunge it into his fucking eyeball. Give me that knife, dude. Yeah
*  Please it's like a spike. I thought of you website go to the half face bit blades website
*  And I thought of you coming on the show being like you guys you and Brian sad and Eddie's there and I'm gone
*  And you've been like I fucking told them I fucking dude if you got killed by a mountain lion become the mountain lion
*  Food out I'd set food out there and wear a fucking ghillie suit and be hiding in the bushes
*  That's what it looks like. Yeah, but it's wrapped with it's not a metal handle. It's wrapped with paracord
*  So you see there's an image of it with the paracord. Yeah, well either way
*  I'm shoving that thing into some mountain lions eyeball
*  It's so stressful. Yeah, I stopped taking my son on that path. We go on a much smaller one now
*  Yeah, man, there's a lot of wildlife out there, but at least we don't have grizzly bears, you know, at least we don't have
*  God man. I'm just so scared now
*  Scared you packing heat. I gotta do something and I go I go deep man. I go down the mountain on my bike
*  That's a good one to a spike I think sick. Yeah, but I want to be able to cut to not just puncture
*  I'll just fucking
*  Yeah, the subhuman piece of shit is my knife. That's what I thought it through
*  But but your dog hasn't encountered any snakes or anything. No
*  No, he hasn't but my other dogs had my
*  Frank Sinatra my pit bull great name when he was alive
*  He had been bitten three different times by rattlesnakes on the never on the nose. Yeah on his face
*  That's when they died though, right? He was good that dog with a tank. He'd be so crazy
*  His face swole up like a balloon. I had to bring him in. Have you seen the
*  Saw some research they're saying is rattlesnakes are aware that the rattle gives them the way and people are killing them
*  So they're not rattling as much anymore. Oh, jeez. That's the study they found out
*  So they're evolving they're evolving realizing the rattles give them away to humans
*  So and they get killed so they got smarter and they're not rattling as much Jesus Christ
*  So I see that big snake I go the other way. I see an old man walking down. I go dude
*  There's the biggest rattlesnake you've ever seen about 500 yards away. He goes really?
*  Oh, yeah, he goes I have to go this way my wife and kid are down there and they're coming up
*  He was can you show me where I go? Sure. I walked down there. I go he's right. He's not there and then behind us
*  we hear
*  Dude
*  So scared I was running with my dogs once we're going down this hill on this trail and I ran over this stick and
*  As I'm in the air over the stick. I realized it's a rattlesnake. Oh shit
*  Yeah, it's a big one like as thick as my forearm. I'm like, holy fuck. That was the biggest snake
*  I've ever did he do anything?
*  Nope, just laid there and then I started throwing rocks at him and I screaming at my dogs to back up
*  Jesus through rocks at him. He got off the trail and he slithered into the bushes
*  It's so scared. That was a long time ago. That was more than 10 years ago, but I remember why it was happening
*  I was like, whoa. I was like that is a big fucking thing fat thick around
*  Like an old one and you're not gonna do shit like it bites you it's not like there's gonna be this tussle
*  No, no, no if it bites you you're fucking out. Yeah, you're fucked and it's so bad
*  You don't suck the poison out or cut it or any of that stuff that people say you wet it with a cold damp cloth
*  And you get to a doctor as quick as what about a tourniquet? I don't think so. I don't think you're supposed to do that
*  I don't I think that's all bullshit. I think what it does is it digests the meat
*  See what a what a rat would rattlesnake venom does is like when it stabs a rabbit or some shit. It's it doesn't have
*  Like it's it's not an animal that
*  Digests things the way that we do and I think one of the things it does is the poison helps digest the meat
*  Because they're poison doesn't just like kill the thing and paralyze thing but it also breaks down the tissue
*  So then when it's eating it's like the necrosis of the tissue might have made all that up. No, it sounds sounds legit
*  Did you hear that? There's that rapper? I think Mike Mike not Mike said Mike Posner. So he was running from
*  In Colorado, I think I forget where is that?
*  Yeah bit by a baby rattlesnake, which is more dangerous because babies don't know how to control their venom
*  The big ones do babies just like off fucking they release all their venom
*  So it's supposed to be more dangerous to get bit by a baby. I heard that's a myth
*  I might have made that up. No, I don't think you did
*  Yeah, I heard it before but then I remember reading that baby rattlesnakes are no more deadly than regular rattlesnakes
*  Really? I know Mike Posner was fucked up
*  Yeah, cuz he'd do a rap in every city and then he was like doing a rap from his hospital bed. Fucked up
*  He was he was it ruined his shit. He was stuck in there for weeks weeks
*  Yeah, cuz the baby rattler really fucked him up. Mm-hmm
*  Well, my dogs got fucked up three different times my female she got fucked up once and my male got fucked up three times
*  So three different times I had to bring them in one time. They both got fucked up, but they're fine
*  Yeah, but they had to get anti venom and it's expensive. Yeah, it's expensive. It's several thousand dollars for the anti venom
*  So think about four think about milk in the snake. Yeah, of course. It's expensive
*  You have some fucking dude milk in the snakes, but you know you can get immune to that shit guys
*  They milk snakes and then they give themselves like a little bit of the time and eventually they get immune to it
*  And then nuts pretty nuts. Yeah, like those snake handler dudes
*  Fuck you ever seen them those dudes who handle snakes in in church services. Oh my god
*  Fucking yeah, man. What the fuck? That's some old-school fired brimstone shit man handling snakes. Have you seen that evil?
*  Priest he has like this real evil. I was in his boys. Yeah, I'm gonna blow
*  The race
*  Yeah, that's that same guy that he got interviewed by some woman. She was asking him
*  Do you think that poor people are demons? I never said that he's so scary
*  You can tell you wants to hit a bitch yeah, what is his name again?
*  Kenneth Copeland is that it yeah god. He's a scary scary dude, and he got a lot of money tons of flies private and shit
*  But now you can't have a crowd so just him and his boys and they all they're all praise G blow it away
*  Yeah, a lot of way crowd. Yeah, it's really weird. He's doing the show with no crowd
*  I think he bought his jet from Tyler Perry. Hello. Yeah, Tyler Perry's jet fucking right he did
*  You know what? It's weird is WrestleMania did it with no crowd
*  Yeah, you thought wrestling was weird before try and watch it with no crowd so strange. It's so weird
*  Things with no crowd like people that are doing stand-up with no crowd need to stop doing stand-up with no crowd
*  Please stop doing it stop doing that we got our text. I already said videos of people doing stand-up without the crowd. It's tough
*  Well, not only that but the people that are doing stand-up with other crowd. They're not good at it to begin with
*  They're not good at it with a crowd so then they do it with no crowd like oh my god. This is a disaster
*  It's such it. It's the biggest disaster. Yeah, doesn't work. Oh my god
*  It's so tough to watch on stage with no crowd and then yeah like they're punchline. It's just like oh fuck
*  I know people are talking about doing zoom stand-up get the fuck out of here. I'm gonna wait this out
*  I mean is ever it's really it's gonna come down to can't if they can do that with snake venom
*  Can't they do that with the fucking Corona just figure it out. I'm so
*  Optimistic about things. I got a show end of June and spoke in Washington. Do you really? Yeah
*  Gangster yeah, you think it's gonna be open by them Washington had a lot of deaths
*  But now they're the best because they've gone through it. So now it's way down there
*  That's interesting Washington, California is kicking ass the Washington's kicking more ass than California because they fucking peaked
*  What's the Jamie? What's the latest and when California is gonna open up?
*  See if it says that it's interesting Los Angeles County tried to have gun stores shut down
*  Saying that they're not essential and they put the kibosh on that with a quickness hell no quickness
*  Do your your shooter now, I'm a shooter now that was fun. I like it. That's fun as fuck
*  It was a good time, right? That's fine. It's good to know. It's good to know how to shoot accurately and yeah
*  Cuz I have my guns at home, but I can't I mean I've only shot it once and it was just like, you know
*  Some bullshit not like with legit trainers and coaches. Yeah, it's great. Right? So fun. You get good at it
*  I'm gonna go back out there. Did you have to shoot the cool gun, right? Did you or no calendar?
*  I've shot you shot it before but that day you have to get going. Yeah, I left shortly after you can't talent state
*  Yeah, no, it's um, it's a good thing to learn
*  It's a good thing to learn to learn how to handle a gun to learn how to use it correctly
*  Learn all the safety procedures, but learn how to do it accurately use the proper technique
*  It's like everything else like martial arts or everything, you know, you need to know how to do it, right?
*  You get familiar with it. Yeah makes a big difference man, you know and doing it at Terran tactical where they train
*  Keanu Reeves for John Wick and Halle Berry trained there for John Wick 3 and you know, he trains a bunch of people for movies
*  The real deal. Yes
*  Nice guy to a lot of cops there too
*  You know a lot of a lot of people practice in that need it for the line of duty
*  Yeah, it's interesting. He was saying he has a lot of special forces guys there and I was like, oh do they just kill this?
*  He goes it's not really their thing
*  He goes a lot of them come and they don't they don't do great because that's not it's just not what they practice that
*  He was once they get it down. Yeah, they're monsters, but at first no. Yeah, the thing is killing bad guys
*  Yes, thing is not hitting metal targets. No. Yeah
*  They're you know, they the training training with a gun. It's like training with everything else
*  You know, it's like the more you do it the better you get at it. It's that simple
*  It's just most people don't get the opportunity to do what we did to train with a guy like Terran and learn
*  Correctly learn how to do it from a real master like that. A guy was one, you know countless competitions
*  He's fast with it. It's a weird thing, right? They'll be able to be really good at shooting something
*  How about I go? Can you imagine I was telling you and Brian I go
*  Can you imagine shooting a human like this? You sure can sure can imagine if someone broke in your house Brandon?
*  Oh, yeah, no doubt. You could yeah, you could
*  Yeah, we're that's one of the weird things
*  There were so many people that I know that are real anti gun that got guns when this whole thing went down a buddy of mine
*  I want to say his name, but his wife was like you can never have a gun in this house
*  He's like, okay, okay soon as this shit went down
*  We need to get a gun get a gun immediately. Yeah. Yeah
*  Immediately damn right full change Anthony Smith fights home intruder man charged with criminal trespass
*  Yeah, you were telling me about that. Apparently the guy was tough to like Smith said and smaller than him
*  He said the guy was like 170 pounds and the guy took everything you could throw out of which is on math
*  Said no normal human being is is able to fight like that
*  He said I am by no means the baddest dude on the planet. Listen, he's top 100
*  Ah that all the humans on the planet Anthony Smith's with top 100 baddest motherfuckers straight out on the earth
*  But he's a regular Joe and I had a hard time dealing with him and he took everything I gave him every punch every knee
*  Every elbow he took every single one of them and kept fighting me at one point Smith said
*  His mother-in-law brought him a kitchen knife, which she held to Habermann who continued to fight him
*  Why didn't you just choke him unconscious? That's a legit point. Why don't you just choke the fuck out of them? Yeah, I just
*  Habermann said hey, I'm sorry as he walked by after things calm down. Hey, man, I'm sorry
*  I'm sorry. I tried to kill you. He said there was blood all over the computer and Habermann was cut and had swelling on his face
*  Yeah
*  Did he but he didn't land anything on Anthony after you just beat the shit on this guy took it
*  But the guy took it the fact that the guy only weighed 170 pounds and it says Smith fights at 205 pounds
*  He's walking around 230. Oh, yeah
*  He's walking around 230 yeah, he's smashing this dude that's you know, a legit 60 pounds lighter than him, which is crazy
*  Said experience a wide range of emotions afterwards. I like Smith a lot. He's a very intelligent dude. Have you heard him as an analyst?
*  Yes, he's really he has a future in that
*  He's got a future in fighting too. I want to you know, I mean I think after he fought John Jones
*  He got the rub and he looked fantastic
*  With Gustafson if you remember that fight he could have easily won that fight with that DQ
*  He remember that man. I think John hit him and they go do you want you want to continue fighting?
*  Or do you want to come in? He goes to hit him with a low knee or I forget down
*  Do you remember that?
*  It was a knee when he is down and he goes you want to stop the fight and he would have won the fight
*  And he goes that's not my style. He doesn't continue the fight. That's interesting. I don't remember that but yeah, I remember it vaguely
*  He's a badass man. He is he's a very very smart guy
*  What do you if you're gonna act out and make the news now's the time?
*  Cuz like with John like yeah, like what do we're trying to not die? We don't give a fuck what John's doing
*  There's a little bit of that right, but there's also like we know about John angry. We know about John
*  Yeah, but the world doesn't you think no, but like like even with Kobe's death
*  Like have you heard anyone talk like that you before this came that was it was so heavy with Kobe
*  No one's really even mentioned it because we're so focused on this fucking virus, yeah
*  Yeah, it's interesting. I'm uh, I'm curious to see when all is said and done
*  How many more people die of the flu than have dying of COVID?
*  Yes, cuz it's gonna be higher the flu numbers are gonna be higher
*  It's what I mean imagine if we just do this every time there's a
*  flu
*  There's a shutdown don't you don't you think at some point with society?
*  We're gonna get to a point where people are sick of being quarantined and they're gonna look at the numbers and go
*  Okay, these are the odds of me get it and thought to me surviving it
*  I'm not I'm not gonna live my life like this man
*  Yeah, you shouldn't because the odds are you you know dying from driving in the same way
*  I mean the other thing is when people leave the house, they're gonna you're putting people at danger. Okay, do you drive?
*  Well, you're putting people at danger, you know
*  People die every year 30,000 people die every year from motor vehicle accidents in the United States
*  Well think about think of my lives have been saved because the quarantine of because the no car crashes
*  That's good point except have you noticed how people are driving like fucking idiots. I drive a hundred 70 miles an hour
*  Everywhere I drive like I robbed the bank and it's out of the other day. I went I gotta calm down, dude
*  So I spun my car out getting on the 405. I'm like, oh dude. No one's out. It's fucking
*  Baghdad fucking yeah, am I fucking GT2? I never get to drive like this car is so crazy
*  You can't drive like that in that car. That car's two bonkers. It's so fun, dude
*  And no one's on Topanga Canyon or Malibu Canyon, dude. It's so weird, right?
*  I'm gonna put a GoPro on you guys should see the way I drive one of the things this makes me realize is how much
*  I would love living in a smaller town
*  Me too. I like it when there's no traffic man. It's nice
*  It just feels different when you're driving around feels more relaxed
*  I'm realizing how obviously LA is huge but like to get to Pasadena or Hollywood or Santa Monica with no traffic easy
*  Everywhere's like 18 minutes away
*  It's so nice. Yes. Yes
*  Two hours if it's regular shit. I know right like how much is it just get to San Diego right now?
*  It's an hour and ten minutes. So easy. Yeah, San Diego is a nightmare
*  Driving to San Diego dude when I do La Jolla, you have to do a Thursday night show. Yeah, what time do you leave?
*  I leave at noon. I leave at noon. I left at 11 last time. It still took me three and a half hours
*  Yeah, 11 is probably better because then you don't get that three o'clock traffic
*  No, you hit that three o'clock if you don't get past the OC by two o'clock. You're fucked man
*  The OC is the worst traffic on earth. It's like right up there with Mexico City Orange County. So crazy
*  There's so many people jammed in Orange County. Fuck how many they must have a lot of COVID-19 in
*  Not as bad as us really
*  All of California's kind of kicking ass. I don't know
*  Do you two and a half hours to downtown San Diego right now? It says that yeah, that's a nice drive like a bitch
*  Two hours. Yeah, I drive my car about an hour and a half. I
*  Started looking at ways to kind of mod it even but you know
*  When you talk to a Porsche enthusiast like dude, don't fuck don't touch it
*  Don't touch your cars too fast as it is. You're not gonna make it faster. You're not gonna it's just so good
*  The GT2 is a rare
*  Perfect car it's perfection. They just it's one of those rare cars were right off the assembly line. They nailed it
*  I love that fucking guy. It's a beast of a car man. Do you think you could ever live in San Diego?
*  That's one of the places I think I can live dude me too
*  I was talking about with Cal and I said if I didn't have to be in LA for entertainment purposes and stand-up
*  I'd move to La Jolla. Yes
*  The house in La Jolla and it's quiet good families. Yeah, very nice and restaurants coffee cliffs
*  Do you know how many restaurants are they gonna be open?
*  How quick do you think everything bounces back people have to they have to bounce back?
*  So I bet people gonna be eager to bounce back man, right but the restaurants that are going under
*  It's gonna take a long time for they rebuild and reopen
*  The other thing is cuz you're obviously a theater slash arena act
*  I think it's gonna be I think September October is gonna be fine for you, but June July August in theaters me tough. Mm-hmm
*  Yeah, unless they ask people to wear a mask or some shit or maybe maybe maybe at the you know
*  The the regular kind of comedy places like the comedy zones and helium's
*  What if there's many people coming in test their temperature coming in?
*  You know
*  But then you're in line with all those people like imagine if you're in line and some dudes got the fever and you
*  He's right in front of you and they test him like sir. You have to leave never like ah, I know back away back away
*  I
*  Saw World War Z the other day not a good idea
*  Not a good idea during all this dude those people were talking about out of shape if zombies come you're even more fucked
*  The first was yeah, you know
*  My thing about zombies were always in the Walking Dead. Why is this lasting years? How are there still zombies?
*  What do you what the fuck? What are they eating? How are they staying alive?
*  Sure
*  Slow zombies the slow zombies I feel like we could wipe them out in a day
*  Yeah, why are they so slow and then then Z world was like fuck that and running zombies?
*  Well, the 28 days later were the first fast on that's true. They were the first fast zombies
*  They were the scariest zombies 28 days later still to me for my money. That's the scariest fucking horror movie
*  It's a scary zombie movie. I should say most realistic
*  World War Z's up there though, man
*  It's not as violent there's some violence in 28 days later be like Jesus Christ
*  Where people have to hack other people apart that their loved ones?
*  Yeah, like boyfriends and girlfriends hack each other apart when they realize the person just got it and they're about to turn
*  Well, how about bad pit with his girl? They're on the plane. She got been he fucking hacks her arm off
*  Remember
*  But before they on the plane she got bit and he's like, let me see your arm and he's like bite down this
*  Hey, she cuts her arm off then they're on the plane and they're chilling everything's all good
*  And then someone out the zombie comes out the back and he's like, oh shit takes the grenade throws it on the plane
*  Why don't I have to remember this?
*  Do this movies fantastic?
*  Brad Pitt's my favorite
*  Yeah, yeah cuz they're there and she's biting down and he's like bite down now it's on the plane
*  You know on the plane is when he throws the bomb. Oh, see she got bit right here. Oh
*  See I got this race saves her life. Oh, that's right. He's like, right he's boom bitch
*  Mmm Brad Pitt style dog. Oh, yeah. I
*  Think Brad didn't get that far in the movie. Oh, well, yeah in the middle
*  I watched it the first time I got that far but the other night only got an hour into it great
*  I'm not even I think got 40 minutes into it fantastic movie and I was like
*  Do you think Brad Pitt sleeps with NAD drips or what do you think? Why does he look like that?
*  I know I know weird right like how's he doing that? I don't know
*  Genetics we when he took off his shirt for once upon a time in Hollywood. I'm like, look at this guy
*  I'm peace cuz he's 32 years old ridiculous
*  Yeah, not fat at all. Nothing
*  What do you think? That's just constant exercise genetics and then meanwhile no Instagram posts of him lifting at all
*  Does he even have an Instagram
*  Got famous you have to be there not have an Instagram how about Chappelle Chappelle doesn't have an Instagram either nothing
*  Another people that are smart. They're just like why am I doing this? You could do you could do without it?
*  You didn't you like it, but you could do without it. Nothing would change for you. Yeah, but it helps to have
*  Ability to express yourself if something comes up, you know
*  and like if you want to promote something if
*  You need to let people know about something like why like your shows. Yeah, I think you'd be all right
*  Yeah, but when you do an arena's you really kind of need something like that
*  You know, you're selling 15,000 tickets
*  Let people know because otherwise they have to let them know through other means that cost money how does she do?
*  He does banks unlike live nation he does mostly theaters to him
*  Like people find out he's in a place that has 3,000 tickets. They're gone like going
*  it's like when you go from 3000 to like
*  Mass square garden and then you're into the 18 thousands and in New York. Are you doing regular Mass square garden?
*  Yeah, you're doing big boy
*  I'm doing Boston garden the week later
*  Back to back son. I love it. Yeah, it's crazy. How about the comics?
*  We got their special on Netflix like right during the quarantine
*  Segura, Chrysler
*  Next week. Delia's Tuesday up Delia's Tuesday. Yeah, it's a good move. It's the best move
*  Yeah, and the comics like Andrew Schultz and fucking Theo von who were gonna who were gonna shoot it like last month and air
*  They're fucked. Well, they're not fucked
*  It's like it's always better. Anyway, just tightens your material up. You spend more time with no one can do material though
*  Yeah, but you're gonna have time to think about it. It's true time to change your perspectives on things
*  I think all those any thought that you have as a comic is almost there's a time where it's too much
*  But most of the time you put them out and you're like God I wish I had a couple more time
*  Yeah, almost always everything I've ever done. I wish I had three more months. Yeah, I wish I would wait at six more years
*  But also I tell everybody when you're doing stand-up and you're doing a special the special is only
*  60 to 70 percent as funny as it is being there
*  It's never as funny as me matter who it is because they're part of the fun is you're at a live show with all these people
*  You know trance and fun
*  You're missing most of that with the Netflix
*  Hey, you stop watching Tiger King. Did you go all the way? I finished it
*  I'm only on we did episode 5 last night. So I have two more to go
*  Okay, but you're kind of in the thick of it. I'm in the thick of it. Did you get where the guy has the hot nanny?
*  No, that's coming up. Okay. He's like the hottest nanny you've ever seen really
*  well, it's
*  This show is fucking so strange
*  But if you had a TV show like a fiction show that was that strange you wouldn't believe it
*  You wouldn't believe it you go this shows too over-the-top
*  How about the straight kid? He just turned gay just needed meth Trump moles a Joe exotic pardon
*  I was gonna bring this up. Have you seen that? You know how he's doing his his press conference someone asked that question
*  Yes about Tiger King, but that's not what he said
*  He said he said I'll take a look just to shut the guy up and he's like who took who said that Don?
*  Was it my son? It was it was his son. He goes which one was it Don?
*  Like he knew it was Don cuz Don's kind of crazy, but it's um, I don't know
*  I didn't get to the part where they go into detail about the murder for hire
*  Conviction so I don't I don't know if he did or didn't do it my thing. Yeah, I mean I'm like a spoiler for you
*  I don't know if he did or didn't light his place on fire
*  Definitely did
*  Definitely did okay. Did that woman feed her husband to the tiger? I don't know but you know what sucks for her
*  Let me stop definitely did definitely did but you know what sucks for her
*  You know what sucks for her got away with it. Yeah, because things such a hit now everyone's they open back up the case
*  She's all fuck. Well, they should I'm saying it sucks for her and was worth millions
*  He disappears she runs a tiger sanctuary strange. She's got tigers
*  She has meat grinders and she has things that will eat hundreds of pounds of meat and Callum pointed this out
*  Something should be noted is someone says something about killing a person with a tiger and they go
*  Yeah, you could just rub some sort of meat on the boots and she goes just put sardine just put sardine
*  Yeah, sardine oil on super particular. Yeah, it's like sardine oil
*  Okay. Yeah
*  Have found the video of his wedding online and is it real? Yeah. Yeah, cuz they played it in the show
*  Yeah, but like I they uncovered the full video of it like people
*  And this this is apparently a pretty wild tape to its 23 minutes long and these two guys that were both straight are
*  Kissing it though. Well, how does that mean?
*  What is straight?
*  Did they get their dick hard? Did they fuck guys like you're gay? Well now they said, okay
*  Well, but the one can't call him straight. Well, no the will the one homeboy who was like six six
*  It was kind of the dying piece
*  Yes, I came here to fuck with these tigers and the next time I'm sucking his dick he cuz he goes and he actually
*  That boy wanted to play with them tigers so bad
*  But Joe exotic goes he was I told him this and this is actually a joke who I forget who it's from
*  But I knew when he said I'm like, where do I know it's someone's joke that he that it's not his it's not original
*  Because he goes in he goes when you watch porno
*  Do you like do you like guy with a little dick with big dick and he goes well big dick
*  He was then you ain't that gay that's somebody's joke. I think it's Ron whites or Dom Areris, but it's a joke that I've heard
*  That's interesting. You said Joe exotic said that in the show. Yeah, and I was like, oh, that's funny. That's straight
*  He said yeah. Yeah, so that's his new guy. That's the new guy. I got to that. Why is Joe exotic so thick?
*  He's in a coronavirus isolation
*  Believe he contracted it really he said he did that boy do anything sell some fucking Harvey Weinstein
*  I got it. Well, you think think about you're inside a fucking prison
*  There's no ventilation you're in there with a bunch of dudes who have nothing to live for
*  Everyone's cooped up. No windows. Nothing's open. You can get any air in there
*  If someone's got something everybody gets something right gets it
*  It goes like fire through bushes through the whole cell block. I would imagine we're gonna do let them go. Yeah
*  Chicago jail is top US hotspot as virus spreads behind bars at least
*  1324 confirmed coronavirus cases are tied to prisons and jails across the United States
*  Including at least 32 deaths
*  Wow
*  What's that percentage 32 of the 1300? It's pretty good. I like my odds like mad
*  I'll take those odds you ever have these CBD kill cliffs. No, I haven't drink that is there caffeine in them? No
*  25 milligrams of CBD why not? Whoa?
*  Yeah, that's a little whiskey man. You want to fuck. Yeah. Okay. When else when else you're we gonna drink at home?
*  Go get Jamie's gonna get some glasses get up some glasses and a little bit of ice you'll show after this
*  Yeah, I'm doing something with Ari. I'm doing Ari's
*  Video he's doing some video series. How's that? How's Ari doing? He's hiding. He's in hiding. He's he's in a
*  State not New York until everything
*  Like people stop dying and then he's gonna go back. He got freaked out. He fled the city
*  He should yeah, no smart man
*  Yeah, no smart move. Yeah, I like so many people fled the city. I mean this the city's basically I mean John Joseph
*  Sent me a video the other day of me on the Madison Square Garden
*  Billboard and I saw you post this the streets. It's crazy. No one there. It's it's crazy. It's everyone's dead
*  Oh already left because I scared of Corona. Yes
*  I thought you're saying already left because the Kobe thing people forgot about that by now. Are you good, baby?
*  Yeah, it probably forgot about it, you know, there's a few people that have not forgot about it
*  Thank you, sir. A few people that have not but
*  He won't do that again. No
*  I hope so Jesus Christ. That was a bad move. Oh, you said Ari's always been nice to me
*  He's been nice to me cheers brother
*  Hey
*  Not good for the immune system but good for the head be alright a little bit
*  It's a little drinky poo a day not bad for you. I've been drinking one glass of wine every day
*  Really supposed to be really good. I've never felt better. You don't realize how much traveling and flying fucked you up
*  I feel great. It fucks you up bad. I've been thinking about that a lot. I've been
*  Re-evaluating a lot of choices, you know how comics do residencies in Vegas
*  Yes, why don't you a residency in LA?
*  If you want to come you want to come see me I'm at the fucking ace theater. I'm at he should do that
*  I'm thinking about it man. You're at that level. You should deaf. That's a brilliant idea
*  I'm thinking about going on the road sometimes but being here a lot more to get many people to travel to LA to see you
*  Yeah, well we get a lot of that at the Comedy Store, man
*  We got a lot we get a lot of international tourists to people that know that I'm not going to Ireland
*  So I'm not going to Scotland. So they'll come here. Sorry should do that
*  I'm sure I should but I know I'm not going to know I'm gone. But I'm saying you should see yeah, LA
*  I'm going to Ireland. Yeah April 2020. Yeah, I would go but I mean I'm still doing a lot of shows
*  But I'm doing shows in LA too. Like I'm at the forum on October on November 1st
*  Yeah, boy, too. Yeah
*  I'm still doing
*  Like the regular shows I'm assuming, you know, I'm assuming there won't be a second wave of Corona or some sort of crack
*  I'm gonna be fine, man
*  Yeah, that's a brilliant idea the residency in LA. How come no one's ever done that? I
*  Don't know they just do Vegas Vegas sucks cock
*  Well think about what I do with the improv and at the store or have this Joe Rogan and Friends shows and you do them
*  All the time every two three times a week. Yeah, I think I made people that is well
*  That's what I'm saying. No one else a lot of other guys aren't doing that either, but you can do that
*  Could yeah, so you do I'm doing but that to me is like the best way for me to stay sharp
*  You're different animal 45 minutes an hour
*  How many guys you know at your level who are doing 45 most are just doing their 15-minute spot at the store at the improv or?
*  Factory you're a different animal. You gotta
*  You gotta do that though. You have to name one of the guy Joe who's doing that
*  I don't know go. I'll wait. I'm not paying attention, but I am there's no one else that does that like you well
*  I do it because I I'm doing arenas, you know, and you're doing an arena man
*  You got to be and I've only started doing arenas the last two years
*  You got to be sharp. You can't you can't be fucking around when there's 15,000 people paid money to hear you talk
*  I know I'm just constantly I've I've worked harder this past year to like ramp everything up than I ever have with stand-up
*  Yeah, that's inspiring makes me realize that there's more you can get more out of it
*  You can get more you know
*  You can put more work in you get a little bit sharper more listening to sets more writing more more thinking
*  You know, it's more you know, the thing is like people expect you as a stand-up to drop off after a while
*  That's what a lot of comics do their material drops off. They run out of things that are interesting
*  Well, especially when they get famous. That's the problem. They don't relate to the to the average person
*  Also, they don't take as many chances. No, they don't say as much
*  Yeah, you're it's different. Yeah, I get it is what it is man
*  You know, you're gonna you're gonna break a few eggs, but you're gonna make a lot of omelets. Yeah
*  I just miss I in this whole chronicle thing. I missed most besides going on the road miss it so bad
*  It's just hanging out with seeing everybody
*  I mean I text everybody but she's not the same is it
*  No, it's not Joey. I'd offer you this joint, but I know you don't want to I'm good. It's getting really weird if I not
*  Yeah, Joey Joey just calls so I spent a lot of time talking to him
*  Yeah, but it's um, it's not the same. It's not the same going to the store. It's like
*  Dude the party when we get back
*  What is that gonna be like when we get back to the store and everyone's at the back bar and everyone's hanging out
*  Everyone's doing shows again
*  We're gonna be so thankful because we know it's never been taken away before in the history of comedy
*  There's never been a time where you couldn't perform never never I
*  Guess the only time where the LA comics when there's the strike, right?
*  Yeah, but you could do the road
*  Yeah, not too many guys were doing it though
*  There's like Leno doing the road back then you'd be back then law those guys weren't big enough names. That's interesting
*  I wonder how many like comedy clubs were around back then because I was in what the 70s or 80s 70s right late 70s
*  You had Lemma Leno
*  Do you read that book dying up here? No, that's what the series was based off of yeah
*  But the series is real dark the books makes it seem like it was a fucking like a
*  It seemed like it was a fucking like the store was fun man. Do you think the store was more fun than I'm more fun now
*  You tell me dude, you're you know, I don't know. I don't know though. I don't know anything different
*  Like I read those times
*  I think back then it was like a lot of guys were doing stand-up to get TV shows or to get noticed and now you
*  Have like a bunch most of the top guys all they want to do is be really good comics
*  Well, you get your freedom that way and you don't have anybody telling you what to do and you don't have to worry about
*  So many different things you have to worry about if you have a TV show
*  TV shows you have to worry about the other actors the writing the network doesn't get picked up
*  Does it this does it that there's a lot of chefs in the kitchen so many things outside of your control and
*  You know if you have a controversial controversial act a lot of times the networks don't want you to do stand-up
*  Like apparently they did that to Tim Allen when he had that a home improvement show. They told him stop doing stand-up
*  Yeah, like stop. He's making so much money. He's like, all right, you think Bob Saget too when he was doing full house
*  He didn't do any stand-up and you watch a stand-up miss surprise. You're like, oh damn. He's a dirty boy. Yeah dirty
*  Yeah, it's a dirty boy and people here Danny Tanner's dirty. I know and you hear that you're like what I know this is outrageous
*  yeah, there's a
*  There's a freedom to stand up
*  But it's also like I think more people appreciate it as the art form now
*  Whereas back then it was like it didn't get respect. It was if you got respect when you're on TV, you know
*  That's how you made your nut and that's how you got famous TV or a movie you were doing movies, you know
*  Now once you say it stand up and podcasting. Yeah, really? Yeah. Well podcasting is
*  Right now it's emerging as a different beast
*  See before people would joke about it. They would go. What are you doing?
*  Like Howard Stern used to make fun of it like why not just yell out your window
*  Yeah, what are you doing? And you know, but he was coming from you got to think
*  He's a pioneer and radio and traditional radio and he made his bones and radio and he carved this path and radio
*  And then all sudden this thing comes along where anybody can do it. That's a threat. It's a little bit of a threat
*  It's a little bit of that
*  But it's also see in a way
*  I understand his perspective because in his day when he made it he had to compete against all these other killers
*  Alright, so you got all these other morning guys all over the country and then when he goes and syndicate so he'll invade Chicago
*  He's invading Los Angeles trying to take over taking over but there was only a few slots, right?
*  So you couldn't you couldn't listen to his show later. You had to listen to it then
*  Yeah, so everyone's competing during these slots. So you have this slot that is 6 a.m. To 9 a.m. That's drive time, baby
*  Even now he doesn't know podcasting like I remember I used to listen to Howard for a long time
*  And I like maybe a year ago
*  They brought up something cuz you shit on podcasting is the podcasters even make money and one of the guys got on there
*  You know, I forget his crew's name. He was I think Joe Rogan does he goes I know but what not not tons of money
*  Like he's not he's not set. I want to call him like a longtime listener first time caller. Hmm
*  well
*  Doesn't matter. Well, man, I just thought it was weird. Like dude, you still you still don't give it respect that you shitting me
*  Who do you think he's hanging around with though, you know, like his wife? Yeah
*  It's probably hang around his wife. Maybe a few other really rich friends that are probably famous
*  I mean, I don't know how much but you gotta have your ear to the ground being a guy on radio on the fucking time
*  People get so famous. It's almost impossible. It's almost impossible to keep it together
*  You know what bum me out and again, I'm a huge Howard Stern fan
*  I think you would I think maybe I forget who sent it to me by sent to you
*  When Howard Stern it released that to his employees. He has like a a yearly like meeting with his employees
*  Someone recorded it. Yeah, it makes you feel so sick like fuck, dude
*  Such a bummer. You realize how Hollywood is you're all fuck, dude
*  mmm, I
*  Think people get seduced by it man. I think they do they get seduced by the idea of you know, what first of all so
*  You need friends you need really good friends that are like you that are in your world
*  I think one of the things that separates us all of us as comics from the rest of Hollywood is like
*  Goddamn, we're glued to each other. Yes, we're glued and we shit on each other and we laugh and we compliment each other
*  And we love each other and we call each other and we tell each other. We love each other
*  Yeah, a hundred percent full support. It's different man. It's different
*  We're a different thing and no one but also it's not a dog eat dog
*  No, just trying to know dude when someone murders it
*  Everybody's running out of that room telling everybody that murdered it when you see Bilber
*  Go on stage in the main room and crush it you're coming out and saying it and I'm coming out and saying it and
*  Cowan's saying it we're all excited like god damn that was awesome. What a set
*  Holy shit and we'll telling people you see burr crush it. Oh my god, he crushed it, you know, there's a there's a love
*  for the art and a love for each other and the the the camaraderie
*  Like the the wanting people to be good you realize like it doesn't have to just be about you and they didn't
*  I don't think they I think that's you know, we're talking about competition earlier
*  We're talking about Jordan and Tyson and the crazy things. Yeah, the like that's Howard Stern when it comes to radio man
*  Yeah, you're right. You gotta realize like that's the motherfucker that he he fucked them all
*  Have you heard him apologize for it the way he treated some people? Yes
*  I think one guy like commits suicide and he's like I felt bad for that, you know, you see would go in he was like that
*  That time that's what I had to do
*  Well, that's what he did right whether he had to do it or not. That's what he did
*  It worked though, don't like yeah, it did work and he felt like he had to do and look
*  he's also we have to everything you have to look into you got to look in it with perspective and
*  in my head
*  What Howard Stern is always gonna represent is the guy who paved the way?
*  Yeah, like without him you got to realize there was nothing like Howard Stern before Howard Stern
*  The what didn't exist you had Don Imus who's kind of risque and then here comes this
*  Really tall long-haired rock and roll type, dude
*  It doesn't give a fuck and he just wants to have porn stars on and girls are riding
*  Vibrators and people are farting songs in the microphones
*  It's madness and he's getting sued by the government man
*  So the the government that they're coming down with these huge judgments against the company that owns it and he keeps going
*  And he keeps going
*  podcasts all are you know Patrice used to say like Patrice used to say about other comics that like
*  David-tell David-tell's got a lot of babies and what he meant is that there's a lot of other comics that would imitate David-tell
*  Yeah, they would do it just out of the fact that they were fans and they were insecure and they're doing they're not they're not
*  Plagiarists they just were not that good yet when I was young man
*  I sounded I used to sound exactly like Richard Jenny really I heard myself on stage when I had been doing an open I caught myself
*  Doing like a bad
*  Richard Jenny impression with my material when I was like 21 or something like 22 I was like, oh my god
*  I'm terrible because I was such a Richard Jenny fan at the time that I was like mimicking him on stage
*  A lot of comics do it man, we find ourselves doing it with different acts
*  I'll find my
*  Myself and it's not that I'm copying. I have a lot of mannerisms like Brian or Deleah
*  You're around the most those are my I'm molded by that. That's my normal
*  Yeah, but then eventually like you break out of it. Yes, and you become your own thing. Yeah, we got to all realize that
*  What Howard Stern did before anybody was he created this
*  Radio chaos he created this chaos
*  We had these these people those whack packers were out of their fucking minds
*  And he would interview them and and and talk to all these nutty fucking people. That was the first one
*  First one then remember yet celebrities on but he wasn't like, oh, how's your movie? He'd be like who you fucking? Yeah
*  They'd be like what and then they wouldn't answer it, but then he would circle back down somehow get it out of him
*  dude
*  It was a different world back then the world was different and
*  And he made it possible for people to talk the way we talk and then opi and Anthony were the next important phase
*  Because what opi and Anthony where we're a hang?
*  Whereas Howard is the man behind the switchboard and Howard is in control was in his universe
*  With opi and Anthony people would just show up
*  Like I'd be on the air and it would be like four or five other comics there and we would we would love it
*  And Jim Jim Norris on all the time all the time Jim was a regular. He's so talented
*  He's he's one of the more unique comics ever. He's a very interesting guy. I love Jim his love of
*  Transsexuals and how he just sees the way talks. He's just so honest and raw
*  But would open Anthony where were the first loose hang?
*  You know, it's like Anthony would kind of be orchestrating it a little bit where you like keeping everybody making sure, you know
*  Keeping an eye on everything making sure it didn't get out of hand and then Anthony is this
*  very
*  He's a guy who grew up doing construction and and that's literally how he got into radio
*  But is also very intelligent and very inquisitive. So he's got like a regular guy sensibility, but he's also very fucking smart
*  Yeah
*  And then he would have you would have all these comics and then Norton who's a great comic himself would be there
*  It'd be Colin Quinn and and bill burr and me and Shafir and all those madness man
*  It was nothing like that really now not radio radio, but that's what made
*  Podcasts become what they are because like those guys let comics just hang out and talk
*  No one had ever let comics just hang out and run the show before opi and Anthony
*  So the big steps to podcasting where Howard Stern is the most important and then after Howard Stern
*  These are Howard Stern's babies. Howard Stern's babies are like opi and Anthony were Howard Stern's babies
*  But they became their own thing just like a comic would imitate David Tell when he's a young guy
*  And then as he gets older he finds his own speed and there's a lot of comics right now that are like top-level guys
*  that I bet if you watch them 10 15 years ago, they would sound a lot like someone else and
*  then opi and Anthony open up the door to podcasting because they made comics where they could just hang and then
*  Everyone's got their own style like Ron Funches has his own style
*  Eric Griffin has his own style you and Brian have your own style
*  Theo's got his
*  Completely unique style all of us have these different things Segura's got his style Christina Pazitzky and him together have their style
*  Segura and Kreischer, Kreischer's got his style, R.O. has got his style. Burt and Burr. Yes
*  They have a great podcast too, but it's just like the world is
*  More bountiful than it was back then it's not like Burt and Burr are competing against Burt
*  What if Burt's show was run by one production company
*  But Burt and Burr were run by a different and they're both gonna be at noon
*  And you have to listen to one or the other and Burt and Burr are in this fucking argument you've traitor
*  You know you were you it was us together fuck you and you know now they're gonna take us out of noon
*  You know like that's that's that was what they had to deal with it was a totally different dynamic now
*  It's a totally it's like we were trapped in these tunnels
*  Fighting for air and pop and we got to the top of the tunnel and there's all the air you want it's free air
*  Free air you can just put up a podcast put up a video
*  Put up a put up a make a video make a sketch do your own sketch
*  You do whatever do you want and then it might get seen by a million people like that fucking coronavirus song that I
*  Reposted on my Instagram those dudes are hilarious
*  How many millions of views did that get millions and millions of views so these guys?
*  They create this coronavirus song they paid it's on my Instagram. Who are the who are the gentleman that I?
*  Got a couple people saying that they've also created the song first or whatever so I don't know who oh no
*  It was smart nobody got robbed, but whoever did it those dudes were hilarious, and it got millions and millions of views
*  There's nothing from 20 years ago 30 years ago
*  Something and by itself would get millions and millions of views but today if you see some shit
*  That's really funny, and you send it to me, and I send it to Jamie and it just starts going
*  If that's what happens it goes through people these dudes. I haven't seen them four million six hundred eighty five thousand six hundred forty four views on
*  My Instagram alone can we play it or no no I'm sure they have the their song
*  Yeah, it's Reggie Reggie baby
*  To and somehow or another I he's got he's doing so well that he's got fake Instagram sites
*  Or people pretend they're him, but all of his shit is funny all the shit is just they're doing sketches
*  So these are Chicago based guys
*  It's just funny dudes in Chicago that are hustling and are constantly making content constantly
*  They have new videos up all the time and who else is on him is Instagram
*  That video just go to it so we could see it the other guys uh the other one is sticks XS
*  STI X underscore 808 and then funny man
*  Gaitlyn G AI TL I N and then laid three those are the dudes who did it and then
*  Vinny pazienza box cutter Pazzy who was has been on the podcast before I found it on his
*  Instagram so I reposted his but it's
*  That see but imagine that
*  30 years ago or one one dude could make something and it could go to something like you know
*  Instagram or in this case three or four dudes could do it and go to something like Instagram and then also millions of people are
*  Singing it laughing and it's hilarious
*  Oh, but even think with Burt and birth that okay
*  We want to do a show think of the 80s or 90s you'd have to pitch it to network right have them approve it
*  Yeah, they bring in writers you're looking at how long would that take to evolve into a legit show
*  They're sitting green lit then get a pilot then test well. Yeah, no no chance
*  Yeah, it would also people would start fucking with it. It would come in burr. I want you to dress different
*  I want you to dress that's something about I want you to I want like Sinatra
*  I see you people taking you more seriously if you're wearing a suit custom too much burr
*  Can you tone it down you seem aggressive?
*  Imagine if I went to a production company and said yeah
*  What I want to do is like smoke weed and talk a lot of shit and say things
*  I don't really mean, but I think it's funny at the time that I regret it and I'm gonna drink a lot
*  Oh, and then we're gonna air the fights. I'm at my three dumbass friends
*  We're gonna smoke weed and we're gonna talk shit
*  but but also I'm gonna have presidential candidates and really serious and scientists and
*  Me a guy with brain damage. I'm gonna debate important
*  Topics to them
*  I
*  Have everybody
*  Get the fuck out of this office. Well, we when Brian and I were at Fox
*  They they wanted to make it a TV show like a legit TV show. I remember that mass dude
*  I remember when they were telling you to not curse. Yes, and I was like get out now. I remember yelling at you
*  They're like vampires. They're trying to bite you. They're trying to turn you
*  Remember me and Brian in that meeting cause I was like this is what?
*  But meanwhile they liked you because of who you were before they came along before they came along you were cussing and then they
*  Want to do a sport they didn't know what to do is they want to do a sports show with then they brought me in
*  And go
*  They go they go so we know it's a fine kid
*  What if we really what if we replace Brian count with Michael Rappaport? No, yep
*  They want to get rid of Brian. Mm-hmm
*  What is it cuz he's old?
*  Is it cuz of his hair cuz he's old and he just talks shit
*  Is it the way dresses cuz I can fix that that's crazy what a bunch of dummies
*  This is great. Let's fuck it up and this thing that I really like let's ruin it
*  But then they they're like wait, they're making how much money and we signed no no, no
*  So what hey next year the deals up in December. We need half and I went oh, that's not happening to it
*  All right. Well December's your last last month and I think we're not October. I go that's fine
*  We're just gonna go do our own thing and take all the money
*  Okay, and they went and when I never forget this goes I don't want here about the southern podcast just right out December and I went
*  Well, I can't do that. Do I get the listen? No, I'm leaving. He was don't do that. I went. All right, cool
*  Next day I go on the pipe. So so in December our contracts up cuz I want half our shit
*  I try going back the next day and with their security out front. They wouldn't let me in really
*  That's my last day at Fox. Yeah, really? Yeah
*  Then we just started doing it randomly
*  Well, that's the real clear changing of the guard
*  Where that old-school mentality they think they do they own the talent
*  I think they owned you the idea that they think they should have 50% just that but what are you doing?
*  What are you doing? The guy gets I'm never forget this guy gets my podcast the guy gets in my face
*  I don't want to say his name. He goes
*  Just how you have your black belt and fighting of my black belt and entertainment
*  Like great my god, I would I would fall on the ground and start curling up in a fetal position laughing
*  I said that to me. I was like, I have no idea what you're referring to
*  Why does that leave now? You know how to rob people out of the percentage that they really deserve? What are you bringing?
*  Well, that's why I said that's why I told him I went fit if you can show me why you guys do 50%
*  I'll give you 50 go because well, it's our studio, you know Fox it Fox gives you the platformer
*  No, no, no, hold up. We had a platform before even got here
*  I can do this up the street and we get more views dude. What now? Why would you get 50%?
*  He's like, I don't know man. There's no reason I had a guy not that long ago
*  I asked for 50% of my podcast to be a part of a network
*  Not that long ago. You got your god damn mind four years ago, maybe I was like, what are you talking about?
*  50% well even now like certain comics want to start podcasts go
*  Hey this network podcast one came to me they want 50% but they can give me a student. No, no, stop
*  Don't do that yourself. That's a weird number like you're you're pretending that they couldn't do it without you if you want 50%
*  50% is like if you and me right if it's the Brendan and Joe show
*  Well, it kind of has to be 50% because it's both of us, right? So it's like there's two of us
*  Yes, so you're part of the show. I'm part of show
*  We need each other with the gear together should be 50% them. It's our friends
*  It should be 50%
*  But we could do it with Tom the producer or we could do with Steve the network
*  This isn't you guys don't matter. So you can't have 50%
*  Maybe you definitely deserve something 50 50s crazy. It's insane. That's crazy. That's a crazy number
*  That means you're saying I couldn't do without you
*  That does that doesn't make any sense
*  But that's what they used to do with TV shows
*  You got to realize if you're thinking about Hawaii five
*  Like the production company has a deal with the network and they put it together and everybody gets paid and the people that are putting
*  it on television
*  Have a giant chunk of that. That's the studio executives
*  Yes, the network execs you go to their houses their big fucking parties, dude. I'd go to some of their houses man
*  They'd have parties and you'd be like wow these guys are ballin, but what are they doing? What are they doing?
*  They're taking your stuff and they're the critical mechanism that is necessary to get you on television
*  Well now the world is television our heads are through the fucking holes and now we're looking out this open air
*  There's no need for someone to take 50% anymore. No, no one people don't give a fuck if it's on Fox HP
*  They don't tell me we operated and those those those fans those subscribers or whatever network
*  They're gonna follow me if I'm here if I'm here if I'm here
*  They don't get it though these guys went through the Fox system people went through the ABC system
*  They went through the CBS system and if they were in that system 20 years ago
*  This was the system the systems you make deals you put together shows you're you're getting it on the air
*  It's clear you're you're giving you're giving you're very valuable
*  It's a very important thing to if you got on CBS back in you know
*  Game-changer was a very important thing. So it made sense the deal made sense
*  But it doesn't make sense on the internet the internet is everybody's it's like everybody has a CBS
*  Like these gentlemen who made that video on the corona virus
*  They they they don't have a network. They don't need they don't need it
*  All it has to do is get to one of these
*  Also, if it's good
*  He has to be tagging their video they made a video I believe of his song
*  Okay, this is gm a see cash
*  Gm a gmac cash he's Detroit's finest. So he so he made the original song for sure. I believe so. Yeah, okay
*  Once again, that's gm a follow him right now. So here great avatar pic, by the way. Yeah full body
*  I feel one of that. What's up with the avatars?
*  I don't see a lot of times I text someone all of a sudden they send you back
*  Would you like to update your contact picture? I know some weird avatar
*  What is that what's happening here? Why are people losing their mind? Why are you sending me a picture of you?
*  Yeah, I don't need a picture gmac cash
*  To find them. Yeah
*  74,000 followers. Yeah right now you have 74,000 blow them up. Oh, he has a video his own video of that song
*  Yeah, and it only has one fucking comment. It's the same song. This is him
*  Can't hear it
*  What's happening you have no sound looks like he's saying the same words
*  That's the song okay, so it's he's the original he's the he's the guy who made this on and then those other boys took
*  And just blew it up. They had a great dance routine though. They have they did something to added a little they had a great video
*  They're jumping around spraying Lysol. He said for that. These are doing backflips somebody said for that place. They did something
*  Yeah, it's good
*  But they do a bunch of shit. That's this is their coronavirus video. So just running around spraying it great shoes
*  Yeah, but you know, this is one of those things that happen sometimes like you don't know who the fuck made a video
*  Someone sends it to you. You don't know who made a song someone says this to you you add on things
*  The video is fun. Did you see this? I meant with that
*  That's like what's going on with tik-tok like someone makes a great video and then everyone else kind of jumps on that trend taking
*  Sound there was a video I saw just yesterday or two days ago about the government telling all
*  Government employees not have tik-tok on their government issued cell phones. Why because it's a issue
*  Well, they think it's a security issue. It's a Chinese company to talk
*  Yeah, and someone made some really grandiose statement like a tick-top is like a government operative
*  Application or something like that never know. Yeah, it's like that. It's like some sort of fucking espionage tool
*  Read that Charles Manson book
*  Us army has banned tik-tok from use on government phones reversing its policy on the entertainment app
*  Which it recently used as a recruiting tool
*  What the fuck the army used tik-tok they were doing like army dances they have their own video game to recruit people
*  Yeah, I know army does they had a reality show that a buddy of mine was filming. Oh sick
*  Yeah
*  So but there was also it was there was another company that was saying that it was dangerous, you know, Google
*  Did something like that recently here goes tick-tock banned tick-tock three one was senators want to gone to yeah
*  That's how senators want to ban tick-tock from government phones
*  Tick-tocks for younger kids, right? I'm not on there not anymore
*  Well, a lot of people are on it now
*  But the point is like if you have an app like that and say some shady person makes that app
*  Who knows if that apps turn on the microphone listening to you all the time, you know, dude
*  There's so many times where you'll talk about something and then you see that thing
*  You talked about mentioning your Google ads and you're like what the hell man
*  Like if we'll talk about Porsches or those knives fans that send me screenshots of like do I was your podcast?
*  Then I went to go search the web and I got this ad it's like a Porsche or the knives or the whiskey
*  crazy, man, it's
*  Just way too much influence on us
*  We have to like take back our our personal sovereignty our mental sovereignty
*  There's so many influences on us all the time and there's nothing wrong with them
*  Sometimes like advertising there's nothing wrong with advertising sometimes but sometimes it makes you think like man
*  How much is this changing the way I look at stuff?
*  I think what's scary is how the most disciplined people I know who are addicted to their phones
*  Like man this thing it's more addictive than any drug any alcohol any I mean the cell phone the most disciplined people
*  I know I'll see him on their cell phones like fuck. I know it's so disappointing guilty as charged me, too
*  Yeah, I have an addict folder on my phone where my Twitter my Instagram and my Instagram
*  Repost thing is all in one folder says addict and all capital letters and you still go to it, right?
*  Still click on it once a day at least yeah way better than I used to be but still every now and then but sometimes
*  it's also it's a the problem is to that there's a mixture of
*  Business stuff that I have to do like I get emails and have to respond to important things
*  But then while I'm on the phone, I'm like, hmm, let's see what's on YouTube. Let's see what silly videos there are
*  I'll be like what UFC news is there and I'll click on Twitter and that's right all my news
*  Yeah, click on it. Yeah
*  And then you have a thought and you Google that thought and then you go down a rabbit hole and like
*  Motherfucker and then someone will send me something cool and I click on that. I'm like god damn
*  There's so much content
*  Right now has never never been a time where there's think about what a better time it is entertainment wise to be quarantined
*  I'll think we're a quarantine in the 90s. Oh my god you be fucked
*  What are you gonna watch back in those blockbuster days? You can't go the blockbusters is closed
*  I think you do you know, I was having a conversation with my wife about this last night and she's like I think theaters are done
*  And I'm like it brought up to him just before this they
*  Small potential because there are lots of different companies that could do it
*  They could maybe open up to like maybe 50 people and you just separated by two chairs or something
*  How dare you?
*  That's a movie theater you mean yeah
*  I think they think movie theaters are done too in that Apple TV has opened up the door during this
*  Quarantine to get new movies and trolls hits Friday. My son's crunk is fuck for it
*  But they had a bunch of new movies that were supposed to come out in the movie theater on got pushed back to November
*  I don't think they should push them back. I think that's a mistake
*  I think they should release those bitches and make all their money is listen, but still
*  Everyone is watching now everyone if they come out with a badass James Bond film
*  All over and everybody texts their friend do this fucking new James Bond movies this shit Daniel Craig better be James Bond
*  Is he James?
*  Any I think is the new DB 11 in it listen if you're gonna have a female James Bond or whatever nonsense you're gonna do
*  No fuck out of my face, please make it double oh nine. Yeah below eight
*  Seven son keep Daniel Craig is the greatest James Bond of all time better than Sean Connery. He's the best
*  All of them can eat shit
*  All of them they can all eat shit Roger Moore dude shit no disrespect sir Sean Connery's
*  Daniel Craig is the only one I believe I don't believe he's really kicking anybody's ass
*  I believe Daniel Craig is fucking people up. I believe he's shooting people. He's the only one I believe the only one that means a lot
*  Pierce Brosnan
*  How dare you?
*  Wonderful man. That's right man. I don't use golden eye the greatest game of all time
*  I don't believe him as he's an amazing actor. He's a beautiful man. I don't believe him as a murderous
*  You're a English fucking spy character. I believe Daniel Craig fucks people up come on son
*  The guy on the right is the real deal. He's got a like a face that looks like he's been punched 150 times right?
*  He's a man's man. Oh, dude the original far left come on son eat some shit
*  Eat it eat it is one guy Daniel Craig they can all eat shit
*  Elba was gonna be bond I'll buy that I buy that really I don't care if bonds black
*  It's but it's he has to be a bad motherfucker and Idris Elba's a legitimate bad motherfucker
*  I'm in have you ever heard who's the guy who does the Trevor knows bit on a black James Bond?
*  No, it's so fucking funny
*  Why don't they have it? What do you look Trevor Noah talks about it? It's like we're seeking a hide
*  He has a whole bit. It's so fucking good. That's fun. Yeah, Daniel Craig is it's right now
*  As of right now, he's the best ever is the only one I believe but I believe if they had a similar movie with Idris
*  Elba I believe that too
*  That guy's had a legit Muay Thai fight as a professional actor any movie star you had a legit Muay Thai fight
*  Yeah, training guide was paid off to take a fall, but you know, I hear you I like yeah, that's the rumor
*  It was at the room. That's the rumor without so I would say I think the opponent came out was like, you know
*  They paid me to take a fall right? But if that beautiful man beat my ass, I probably say that too. Me too. Idris Elba
*  I know so charming now that kicks your ass to embarrassing you might have to tell people you took a fall
*  Do I don't believe you you took a fall first of all if you say you took a fall
*  You might be even telling the truth, but you're the type of person that's willing to take a fall so I can never believe
*  Yeah, I know you're scum. It's not that many people
*  I agree people like Anthony Smith that won't win the world title versus John Jones by
*  Disqualification because they have character and then there's people who take dives
*  So if you're the type of people who takes a dive how am I gonna believe you anyway shit?
*  How am I gonna believe you anyway? I think Idris Elba fucked you up probably I think I think scar fucked you up
*  I think double oh eight fucked you double. I hate that be sick. I think he fucked you up. You don't like it
*  Do I don't think movie theaters gonna be dead because I think everyone likes the the experience of leaving the house, right?
*  But they like blockbuster too. It was great. You get to go out of the house. You pick whatever you want
*  Do a little flirty, you know that you're not really gonna watch the movie because you plan on deep dickin
*  Right get those red vines. You'll let them pick some stupid movie that you never gonna watch
*  Reese Witherspoon
*  Legally blonde to like yeah. Yeah. Yeah, the dog's so cute. Come on. Let's get out of here
*  You're thinking of the mauling you're gonna do

*  $75. Oh my god late fees were brutal. Oh my mom would like can we just listen?
*  Let's just get through this and then we'll be back next week
*  I will pay it and she would never pay it late fees were brutal bro
*  Very brutal. Why don't we just keep the fucking movie?
*  You know what else is brutal does a little mom and pop little fucking ones that had the porno section
*  They had to kick open like the outdoor Josie Wales. Yeah, they had they had the curtains, you know
*  The outlaw Josie Wales when do I always kick open those saloon doors? Yes
*  That's what Joey Diaz is famous rep with the one of the biggest references
*  He's always talking about kicking open saloon doors like the outlaw Josie Wales, but they always had beads
*  They always had the first songs. Do you remember those? I've made curtains. You're you're a lot younger than me
*  How old do you now 37? Yeah, but there was a video store and I'll never forget this
*  How old were you when you're looking at the porn section of the?
*  Sneak in around 10 or 11 just to peek back there cuz they were velvet like crushed velvet maroon
*  Open those beads and people would hear the clickety-click clack of your pervertedness
*  That's what those beads are saying they were sending out a Morse code
*  I'm jerking off and then you all like pass each other like
*  No one would be friendly no one would make eye contact
*  So weird just picking up
*  Boxes looking at him like you're like you look at a normal movie like you're reading the plot on the back
*  It was so stupid man. It was so stupid, but also fantastic. There's none of that now
*  It's a it was a weird time where like everybody knew that everybody else watched porn too. So we're like, yeah
*  Yeah, I don't Mike what's up?
*  And then you know, maybe that was like if you have good friends good friends would tell each other they beat off
*  Yeah, there's a lot of guys out there lying to each other
*  I don't even like porn stacks of it
*  shit, dude magazines
*  Jacking off the magazines bro jacking off in the forest to magazines
*  Hi, I used to have a bit that I I never wound up putting this on a special like I wrote it and I perform
*  But then like my special was too long
*  I think it was triggered or one of the other ones
*  But I had a whole bit about when I was a kid we would find porn in the forest
*  Some dudes who were so scared
*  They're so scared of the fact they beat off they have to hide their shit in the woods
*  Oh my god, if they go to the should release that bit is it like I need to just redo it
*  I should just read and release it
*  Yeah
*  because I I think it the problem the problem was sometimes I get a
*  Subject and I do too much on that subject. I might have had too many jerking off jokes
*  Jerking off joke you have to fucking but you have to if you're doing a whole special and you have
*  Got to edit out ten of that put it aside tighten tighten up your ship
*  But that's a thing like that back then, you know, it was it never existed before
*  So when I was a kid when I was in high school
*  That's when the VHS tape became common in households in my neighborhood. At least I don't remember what the year was
*  They invented the VHS tape VHS tape
*  I remember the first time I ever saw TV on a thing that you could push into the television and watch it and play it
*  And then people figured out that this is a good way to watch people fuck
*  By the time I was a senior in high school it went from
*  Freshman in high school. Nobody watched people fuck the first senior high school
*  All of my friends were like is stealing tapes from their dads and buying them off other dudes
*  Was faces of death big when you were yes, that was that was just after high school
*  Yes, just after high school
*  Faces of death and then there was also shit like barnyard Betty where there was this this poor
*  fetal alcohol syndrome baby that
*  Grew up to be a fucked up lady who was on drugs is having sexually different barnyard animals and you're like, oh my god
*  And so I was at my friend Billy's house and we went down to his basement
*  We're watching another TV and our other friend Ron is guarding the door
*  He's making sure that nobody opens up the door for parents
*  So he's gonna he's like look out at the door while we're watching this chick suck off a German Shepherd. Oh my god
*  This is crazy
*  Because you know we were like 20 or something like that and we couldn't believe that
*  To any 20 year old kid if you said you know that there's ladies and if you pay them enough money
*  They'll suck off dogs. They're like what the feel like but they'd be like duh. Yeah. Yeah, here's a whole reddit fucking sub threat
*  I know now ready a sub reddit dedicated entirely to chicks who blow dogs of VCR was released in
*  1977 in the United States faces of death came out the next year
*  And then in 1985 a mathematics teacher
*  Showed it to his class in Escondido high school
*  Do you get fired?
*  Two of the students were so traumatized
*  I was on natural fear of dying and suffering emotional distress
*  Yeah, yeah, I couldn't watch that when it was in high school. The other thing is how much of it was real though?
*  It's a good question. I'd have to see it now
*  And so what you I'm sorry what you do say the the VHS was invented 76
*  77 so I was in I was in ninth grade in
*  1981 that was my first year as a high school student
*  So that was like right when that was kind of kicking in when you know when it was getting into you know when a
*  New invention like a thing that you can play tape and you can watch movies in your house
*  That should take took a year or two back then. Oh, yeah to spread across
*  Oh, yeah, Beta Max was the year and a half fish before it because VCR took off in Japan
*  And this is this as Beta Max came out in 1974
*  Yeah, yeah weren't the first one is VHS
*  Yeah, VHS was inferior to Beta Max but Beta Max was a Sony product and it was it was only Sony
*  So it was you you had to only use their stuff, right and it apparently was way better and smaller
*  They fucked up a mini disc, you know, they fucked they've had that problem a few times. Are you a sonyator?
*  No, but they've won a few times Discman and like some other
*  Two was the first one it was it would pop open on top
*  Yeah, you wouldn't put it straight in and pop up top and then you put it bro
*  I remember we go to the gym and dudes would have a disc man on their hip. Yes a big yellow
*  Plastic thing with a CD would sit in and they'd be at the gym
*  Lifted and like look how cool that guy looks. He's got his own music
*  They called the skip protection ESP because they had a lot of music in there
*  I remember when they first figured out how to do that in cars
*  I was like god they nailed it because before if you were driving in your car
*  You hit a bump your fucking music would ruin it would fuck the song up
*  What a nightmare it was basically you're driving around at a record player, but they did have
*  A record player and they had a record player and they had a record player and they had a record player
*  And they had a record player and they had a record player and they had a record player
*  It was basically you're driving around at a record player, but they did have a record player for a car even before that
*  They had record players for cars and like the 50s
*  Record like a 78 really yeah. Yeah, see if you can find that we've talked about this before record players in cars
*  It was really old. I want to say
*  Terrible
*  They didn't know what to do there was some form of it
*  Being quarantined just all back then yeah, well they basically were quarantined. Yeah, that's what they were doing
*  Kind of life was that?
*  Living in the 20s and where all the CDs you have there all this that you'd have the black case and be full
*  You remember those things you have those towers?
*  CDs are stacked up
*  Buy one right now for 150 bucks. Oh my god. That's a little airy see that's way pricey for a record player though
*  That works a Phillips record player for your car, but but what year did they invent it?
*  Oh, I mean look at that guy's car look at that lower look at that right there
*  Look at that black and white picture that gets get a fucking
*  That's my that's Muhammad Ali holy fuck holy shit. He had a record player's car. He's got stacks of records there, too
*  You know the thing is we don't know if that's photoshopped I know that's real weird
*  But here's what's real weird in the future
*  You're gonna be able to do like a regular person is gonna be able to do whatever they want
*  What do you mean with it with with CGI with?
*  Pretending like we don't know if
*  Like if you got one of those of Daniel Craig or John Lennon John Lennon's driving around with a record player
*  Yeah, his Cadillac. I don't know if that's real today today. I don't know but in the future gonna be able to watch a video
*  Well, you won't know if the video have you seen they've been other you guys could be on that easily
*  So many chicks do me chicks like people have like taken my face and put on their body especially like
*  ridiculous like workout selfies that take like
*  Working out a little sweaty and feel pumped and people put them on chicks faces
*  Well, have you seen like the deep fakes they do it with porno. They have like huge celebrities
*  Yes, it's pretty fucking real man. It looks pretty real. But here's the thing man CGI is gonna replace all that
*  They're gonna be able to do that with computer programs where you don't need to just put it on an existing video
*  You can do the whole thing
*  Artificially the whole thing they'll probably it'll be like Squarespace like Squarespace has templates for for
*  Websites websites, they're gonna have templates for porn. Like what do you want to do? You want to be a tennis instructor?
*  And it's gonna be a dude and then it's gonna be he's gonna just go in there and you're gonna have whatever girl you want
*  You want to you want to fuck Meg Ryan? Okay, it's gonna be Meg Ryan. That's not yeah, it's good
*  Whoever you want. Well think about it
*  I get rid of the actor cuz they'll be able to put that in movies whoever you want. Yeah, you want a
*  1990 Salma high. Yeah
*  So you you get to hear her voice you get to see her face like there's gonna be pretty dope crazy
*  lawsuits where people are trying to stop people from using their face and their
*  Artificial body in porn and the arguments are gonna be that it's art
*  You're gonna you can't stop freedom of expression. You can't use people's name and likeness
*  Yeah, but it's not if it's a painting of someone. Here's the thing, right if I take you and I paint you
*  Can I sell it?
*  This is what I can you yes, I think so
*  I think if someone paints me and they sell it I don't have any say in that that I'm a public figure
*  They're painting me and they're selling it now. What if they paint me and it's so realistic
*  That it looks exactly like me and I got a dick in my mouth and they're selling it
*  You can't I don't think I can do anything. So let's keep going. Let's keep going
*  What if instead of paint they do a digital photograph so they make a photograph with a computer of me
*  It looks just like me doing something
*  I've never done before robbing a bank like running out of there with a bag of cash and a pistol in my hand
*  Thing that never existed. It's not a pre-existing photograph where they just superimpose my face. It's a completely new image
*  How is that not a piece of art? I?
*  Think it is so why wouldn't it be like especially it's gonna be disturbing for female celebrities
*  What if it's you in a in a KKK?
*  Outfit could be you in anything it could be you with a giant vagina given birth bill Bill Clinton
*  That was a real painting. It was a painting in Jeff
*  If you guys don't know how crazy this Epstein story is and Jeffrey Epstein's house in New York City
*  Which was 70 million dollars worth 70 million?
*  Someone gave him somebody gave it to him
*  Okay, whatever. I have friends. I get it
*  He's got a painting of Bill Clinton in a dress pointing at him. That's Hillary Clinton's dress. Well, whoever's dress it is
*  It's Bill Clinton, but it might have been Monica Lewinsky's dress. Is it the same one that Hillary won?
*  So weird
*  Either way, but that was in his living room. It's so weird
*  So in his living room, he had a painting of Bill Clinton dressed up like a woman
*  I think he had that George Bush one, too. Have you seen that?
*  It's almost like they held stuff over these guys to the point where they get humiliated
*  They're mocking them. So if that guy came
*  Like if Bill came over to his house, he would see that he would see like you're my bitch
*  You're my bitch. I don't care if you're the former president. You're my bitch. I still don't think you show you the videos
*  I still don't think he committed suicide. Of course, you know, cuz he didn't yeah
*  first of all
*  And that's not what do you think Jamie I'm not like a big conspiracy Michael Baden that fucking guy from that HBO autopsy
*  Autopsy series. Yeah, he talks about it like in-depth. He's like no these are injuries consistent with someone who's been choked
*  No way. It's also the position of the cut. It's all lower like when you you hang yourself it goes up like that
*  This shit is down there someone's choking this motherfucker off
*  I think Harvey Weinstein is the next to go. It's too much shit. Yeah, we talked about this yesterday, right?
*  With Michael Shermer, who did I talk about this with with Lex or is it Michael?
*  What'd he say? I don't know mom
*  I've heard that argument before but I think that he's got more
*  To lose than he does to gain because if he says something like yeah all those Hollywood starlets
*  They all sucked my dick and that's how they got famous. It sort of
*  Reinforces he was a monster that he was a monster but also shows they were playing the game
*  They were playing the game but that game is illegal and
*  So the whole reason why he's in jail for the rest of his life is because that game is illegal
*  But he's already in there. So if he goes hey, I know this monster. You like this celebrity
*  She did this with me for years. Who this Jeffrey Epstein's Hollywood pipeline ran straight to Harvey Weinstein
*  Well, I would make up a bunch of stories about aliens now that Harvey's in the pokey
*  Probably for the rest of his life if I ran some of them dubious websites
*  All day I would be firing off shit I would start writing the most ridiculous stories I
*  Am related to someone who proposition by Harvey Weinstein said he could
*  Make her a star. Yeah, she didn't she didn't believe him. She crazy thing is he
*  Sounds like your cousin was a dumbass. It was an Ohio. She had no idea
*  Do your research girl? Yeah, was there no Google back in this fucking it might have been actually she could have been fucking Wonder Woman
*  Insinuating oh
*  No, who knows?
*  Back in the day Wonder Woman he made people famous the Whitney Cummings talks about it
*  She has a really funny way of putting it. She's like, well the guy always told the truth
*  He did he really did it for him. Like if he told me suck my dick
*  I'm gonna put you in this movie there in the movie or in the movie and that was his reputation like Wow crazy
*  But then again, how does a guy like him?
*  Ever fuck a ten
*  By putting my movies I put him in movies and you imagine how stunned he must have been like with
*  Imagine you're banging like some of the most famous hottest women in the world and you're you're this monster
*  You look terrible. You look terrible. You look like an experiment
*  Right. He was so vile
*  Doesn't he have corona?
*  Pretty sure they moved him to hospital
*  Dave Chappelle had a fucking hilarious take on that. He goes there's very few dudes we look at him and go. Oh, yeah, he rapes
*  Oh
*  Those are that that belly room comedy special that he did
*  This Walker god, it's so crazy. He's so foul-looking
*  but
*  If a guy like him like he grew up in that Hollywood system, that's probably he's probably
*  You know like a really extreme version of how they all did it agree
*  Yeah, he's not the first one. No that cat did the casting couch is
*  An expression for a reason correct. It was real
*  It's a huge porno channel to this day
*  I mean but in but we know that that happened right? It's yeah, it's gross
*  100% I'm not in I'm not endorsing it. I'm just saying we know of it as a historical reality
*  You know just like we know barbarians used to be real we know
*  As a historical reality the casting couch was a real thing God he's vile
*  He's got everything he's got pock marks. He's fat. He's balding. Nothing is gross looking. He doesn't look compassionate doesn't look friendly
*  It's all those things barely on a small dick, but it's also it's like there's just like fucking
*  Vortex of things that are happening everything's all happening together and this guy figured out that there's a system
*  If you get people attention to make him famous and you can make a lot of money if you make good choices
*  You're smart around how you do it and you control your addiction just enough to keep making movies. Whoa
*  He's
*  with a bunch of young
*  Starlets he just looks like a complete shit just monster
*  What do you do if you're one of those gals I want to be in the movie I could be
*  Shut didn't you have a bit about it? Yeah, well I had a bit about my son
*  I said different with but if I was if I was a man like
*  It was me and it was my daughter
*  You know like every man in this room like every person's room and that guy propositioned my daughter and offered her money in exchange
*  Or offered her sex
*  Her giving him sex to be cat one change for a movie. I'd be like no I'd want to kick his ass
*  I want to fuck him on to kill him. I forgot the bit but what breaking news why can you some fighters out like this?
*  What I don't like what?
*  Nervous yeah, sorry the fight off
*  Suspense I was trying to get the idea UFC 249 has been canceled all
*  UFC events postponed definitely due to COVID-19
*  Dana White says he's ready to promote the event, but things were taken out of his control
*  Much much more to come the government stepped in on it. You ain't doing shit
*  Wow
*  That's interesting that's interesting well that saves me a lot of fucking thinking
*  Fuck
*  Damn I was 75% ready to go you were gonna do it the only thing that worried me is that if I
*  Contracted something and then I came in contact with other people so what I was gonna
*  do is do it if I definitely could get tested and
*  Then I would have to know the results before I come back fucking even then you don't know
*  Testing was a little dicey like it so Jamie was saying there's a new type of test that they're working on what is that?
*  They don't have it officially done yet
*  I guess but when I was reading the stuff about the NBA it said that they have a potential like
*  Instant test right like a maybe a diabetic type test where you can prick a finger get a little blood and they can get
*  Something within five to ten minutes
*  I believe that also said it was hypothetical and like if they can get that done or get it mass-produced or whatever it is
*  Yeah, and it works, and it's accurate then they will proceed, but I'm so disappointed
*  Dude there's an article in the Atlantic about tracking you with cell phones and tracking you in comparison to trusted people
*  That have tested negative
*  like that that could be the way that we could release people from quarantine and this is
*  We're gonna go full Eddie Bravo on something like this
*  Because if you have to have something you have to have your phone on you to travel like apparently they have to do and I think
*  It's in China right don't they have their phone to travel and they have a health app on their phone
*  It's sort of like they have to keep their health app up to date
*  There's one on every iPhone already. Yeah, but I think this is a different kind of it's not you know
*  it's a different kind of thing that like you have to have
*  Like you have to been certified that you tested clean for kovat, and then it's on your phone
*  Something like that I'm fine with that and that do you can't be
*  Because then they can restrict your travel just based on whether you're sick though
*  But yeah, but but here's the thing
*  We've always just accepted that people can be sick and we prefer freedom over
*  100% safety we've always accepted
*  We're not doing that now
*  But my point is we've always accepted that and if we decide to keep going further down that rabbit hole where we make
*  Someone carry a device where you can track their location you have to have it travel. It's scary
*  Gets weird man it gets weird you have to have a phone and I have to be able to see what you've been up to
*  What have you been partying all night and you go to the airport?
*  And like I think you have cancer like no no I just did coke
*  I've got high blood pressure going back to see my family
*  Yeah, I just I'm trying to go home. I want to go home sleeping for three days
*  Yeah, and they're like you know you're sick. We need to quarantine you
*  But this that's a poor example just for humor
*  But there's a slippery road if you tell people they have to have a phone everywhere they go right now
*  You don't you could have a driver's license and or a passport and you can get on a plane and you're fine
*  You don't have to have a phone
*  You don't have to have a phone right now, and I'm not saying you shouldn't have a phone
*  But I'm saying if someone's gonna tell you that you have to have a phone everywhere you go things are going to get slippery
*  But what is they're gonna be able to track you 100%
*  But what if it's just like like the way you scan your boarding pass what if you scan to make sure you're healthy?
*  But that's the problem is this kind of stuff they don't track you well look think about all
*  Google has done is not a knock on Google
*  But all Google has done with basically just the information that they give to companies on what your activities are
*  Right there's a read the reason why when you're talking about things these Google ads pop up
*  Why why is that why when you look up something you find those ads in everything? What's because they're trying to sell you things, right?
*  They're trying to figure out they're modern what you're looking at yeah, yeah trying to figure out what makes you tick
*  Why wouldn't they do that with this too? Why wouldn't you do that with this too?
*  Why wouldn't like if they if you could track people if you could track who's gonna pay for all that software and all that stuff
*  Like oh, we'll just put a few ads up. Would you rather be going to imagine?
*  Would you rather be quarantine but imagine if you could track people if they could go everywhere and
*  While while they're doing their life, you know everything they do, you know, they went to this grocery store
*  You know they went to this house you check it you gave an app on them that they can't leave behind
*  That checks their health
*  It's dicey it's dicey it's
*  There should never be a group that has more power over an individual
*  Rather than another individual. It's not like like the thing about having a massive group that can tell one person that they can or can't do something
*  Is it can be abused if everyone is even it can never be abused if we all follow the same rules and the same laws
*  Then okay
*  We all agree we all have the same amount of control and power over each other's lives
*  But as soon as you have more control than the person who you're monitoring
*  Then things can get weird. It's just natural people are weird. They control people. They like controlling people
*  They like abusing power a lot of people that have power abuse power
*  so if you give the power of
*  Constant surveillance in exchange for the freedom to be able to go everywhere you want and the relieving of quarantine
*  We just want to know you're healthy. No big deal. You're like, okay. Yeah, we'll let you out
*  If you let us monitor you that's what's going on
*  It's not that they thought this through and this was their end goal. You don't think so. I don't think it's a fucking conspiracy
*  I know I think people take advantage of things that happen. Correct. That's more likely
*  What's more likely is a crazy thing happens and people automatically?
*  Take advantage when they find an opportunity, especially the more predatory amongst us. So it's not like we're
*  We're just looking out for human nature. It's human nature
*  To you like when you look at the stuff that Edward Snowden found out about the NSA like of course they would
*  If they could they're going they're gonna do it. They're gonna find a way. It's human nature. Yeah, it's just how we are man, dude
*  I want to know who shut down UFC 249 because we know how adamant
*  Supposed to happen April 18th has been canceled Dana white confirms
*  Oh, wow, he was asked to stand down by top Disney ESPN executives and he is doing so
*  Damn think of the power at Disney. Hey Dana, let's shut it down. Well, I think they made
*  probably a
*  Risk assessment and then they made
*  Calculation of what the the negative aspects of going against government regulations in terms of like state government would be
*  They probably like can't do this. They're saying it's not worth it
*  Imagine being the president of the UFC fuck all that
*  imagine having all these fights that you have to make and having all this pressure on you and
*  You're also like a famous guy like Dana's imagine being that guy
*  Fuck that job Dana president the UFC is second only to president
*  In the bank account that's nice, but you get used to that you get used to that
*  You do you do compensated well for it. He's compensated well, but we're not making all the fights
*  He's making a lot of fights. He's making the main fights
*  He's making a lot of the main events
*  The most important thing is he's like a psychotic driving force for the most exciting organization in the world
*  And I don't think the organization gets where it is without Dana White
*  I think you have to have a crazy person agree up. I think you have to have a bulldog
*  He's a real man, he doesn't give a fuck. He'll talk shit. Yeah, he'll insult people go back with you
*  He's nuts. And then Disney went. Yeah, you're wild boy
*  Very cool your island. Yeah, hopefully didn't put money down because we're shutting all that down. They're like what what are we doing here?
*  Well, this is the and then they're probably this the only thing that's up and running like this
*  This is up and running they're ready to go right now and I think I wish they would have let him go
*  Because everyone would been just fucking fine. The other thing is
*  $750 million as long as the right precautions are in place. I agree they would have been fine
*  But the thing is it's like you got a measure
*  This if this was like just in any other disease where we understood it better I
*  Would be way more confident. We understand numbers though
*  We do but we don't understand Michael. Yo, okay, Michael. You almost died. Yeah, you know what Michael Yo is doing right now. He's fine
*  Right, but he almost died, but he did it but he was in the hospital for a week. Yeah, but he's fine
*  Okay. Okay now he's fine want people who are less
*  Like robust
*  Then Michael Yo to die so we got to figure out like what the fuck this virus is. How does it get treated?
*  What's the most effective way?
*  When can we ensure when and then then then it makes sense that we're a little bit more loose with our regulations 100% now
*  When now Michael Yo decent shape he's in decent shape compared to a UFC fighter
*  He's fucking Adele, you know I'm saying like he's not in shape compared to Tony Ferguson works out a lot
*  He really does again compared to Tony Ferguson. That's fine. Right? Yeah, but he's also not that old
*  No, and is he you know college football player?
*  Strong got loose term. Yes, I understand what he did. He threw the ball. He was involved
*  That's a very loose do you how funny is it when people get busted
*  Like a fake story of like some sort of athletic past
*  Oh, dude is the weirdest thing Brian had this friend. I know that's why I brought it up. Oh my god
*  He'd be like I fought check Congo in the beach
*  And I've trained with check Congo. I know check Congo. I asked check. Congo's
*  Never fought on a beach. I told Brian went dude. I'm telling you that guy's full of shit Brian
*  I'm telling we can track all this. Yeah
*  Dude I had a guy who made me talk to his friend because his friend knocked out Chuck Liddell and one of the early UFC's
*  and
*  this guy's
*  Insisting that he he knocked out Chuck Liddell and one of the early UFC's and he insists that I know he's like my friend needs
*  Talk to you. It's like a guy was like a
*  He was like a bouncer a nightclub and he made me talk to his friend and I'm like, what are you talking about?
*  I go I go he's had one loss was to Jeremy Horn. He got submitted by Jeremy Horn. This is at the time
*  I'm like you didn't knock him out. No, we can check I can check right now my phone didn't happen never happened
*  That didn't happen. That wasn't a real thing. The best was Brian was defend his friend. He goes dude. He wrestled at ASU
*  I know well my coach
*  Wrestled at ASU. He was on how old is your guy? He goes he's like 40 something. Oh my coach
*  Oh, they've been the same year. No, I'll see him tomorrow. Let me ask him
*  He goes there heard that guy then Brian goes dude Brendan's coach was at ASU when he said you were there
*  He goes dude. I didn't say I was on the team. I'd go in and volunteer
*  Well D1 programs don't let people volunteer to work out with the with the wrestling team
*  Yeah, we got a farmer wants to come in and do backflips. They couldn't be on the gymnastics man
*  What does that mean? I was
*  Volunteered well who volunteers finally got Brian to admit it bro. People are crazy. You'll make stuff up
*  It's too easy to track these days Eddie 90 this guy and
*  He had this dude take him to the woods where he's gonna
*  He's gonna fight in a kumite
*  Okay, and the guy has a fucking big old sack with him like a big old bag that you would carry with you
*  Like a big one like a three foot bag solid bag and it goes yeah, he goes
*  I'll be back in two days
*  You know and hopefully I'll win this thing and he goes into the woods the guy drops him off and he goes into the woods
*  And so then he comes back his friend comes to get him
*  They agree upon this time two days later his friend comes back and he's holding a trophy
*  He doesn't have the bag anymore
*  the bag was the trophy was in the bag and this
*  This guy came out of the woods
*  Hold this trophy saying that he won this in this kumite and the guys like that's the same size as the bag
*  Yeah, and you have the bag anymore. What the fuck are you doing?
*  So this dude basically just went camping and decided that would be the thing
*  He's gonna tell everybody fun some no rules karate tournament in the forest
*  You gotta appreciate the hustle
*  Oh my god, it's such a funny story
*  Guys had dropped me off in this dirt road. I have to fight in a karate tournament
*  Just goes walking down this dirt road like he's fucking quiet chain King
*  Oh my god so stupid
*  That guy's fantastic
*  So stupid
*  Imagine thinking I got these motherfuckers
*  They're never gonna question that
*  Two nights by himself
*  Just like on his back
*  Probably like hit himself a couple of times
*  He's like I got dicey but I pulled it off
*  It got crazy in the first fight but uh the next eight fights were all me
*  Hey and for what?
*  Just to tell us buddy
*  Trophy
*  No rules, kumite
*  In the forest
*  Anything you can do like that in the forest is more
*  You can do it on an island
*  That's what would have been cool about this UFC thing if it really did go to fuck island
*  Not anymore bro
*  Give it a couple of weeks
*  Yeah maybe they'll be back up and running
*  Well the good news is it's pure our response to this
*  Because it happened in the moment
*  The island might still be in play because all the other leagues are still figuring out that like remote situation to figure out
*  Soccer, baseball, basketball
*  So they might
*  Well if you could control an island
*  If it's a small island
*  If you could control the whole island and test everybody
*  How much money is the UFC gonna be spending on these private jets?
*  How much money are they gonna be making with the reality show about moving the UFC to the island
*  Because I'm watching that shit
*  Fuck Tiger King
*  I'm watching Dana White with his crazy screaming and running around
*  Trying to figure out
*  We're gonna put on these fucking fights
*  Trying to figure out how to get a fight to an island
*  And coming up with an idea of an island and international waters
*  And who owns the island?
*  That's one episode bro
*  So that dude's the king of the island?
*  Bro this, this, and then the government shuts him on the phone call
*  Yes Mr. Trump
*  I understand Mr. Trump
*  Disney calling him up, yelling at him
*  He's a wild man
*  Wild man with a few hundred million bucks
*  I don't know what they're gonna do man
*  We told you I have to throw those 40 something fights
*  I think they're gonna relax a little
*  I think people are gonna hopefully realize that the worst is behind us
*  I think maybe the numbers will be like this
*  I'm hoping, I'm hoping they, obviously I'm hoping the current treatment is the one that works
*  Me too
*  But if that's not the one that works maybe they find something just as good
*  I heard zinc
*  Oh that was the other thing, why are people saying tonic water?
*  Why are people saying, this is one of the weird things about home remedies
*  And homeopathic cures to fucking ruthless pandemics
*  But people were saying quinine in tonic water and zinc together
*  Are a good combination
*  That someone was saying that it somehow or another mimics what that, that malaria drug does
*  Sounds right
*  I don't know, tonic water
*  Just looking up tonic water, Wikipedia says tonic water is a carbonated drink
*  In which quinine is dissolved, originally used as a prophylactic against malaria
*  Tonic water usually now has a significantly lower quinine content as consumed for its distinctive bitter flavors
*  So now it's just a taste
*  Oh, okay, so originally, see that's what happens
*  Home remedies
*  But if you can get quinine, forget about tonic water, if you can actually, quinine mimics that malaria drug
*  Again, this is probably when they first made it, back when Coke had Coke in it
*  This is how those people died drinking pool cleaner
*  Fucking idiots
*  That's how they died
*  That dude died, that dude died because he's like, look, it's the same letters
*  The same letters
*  Fucking idiot
*  Probably prescription only, it says quinine is a medication for malaria treatments
*  But I don't think you could just get that
*  But there is a certain amount of quinine from a natural source in tonic water?
*  Like what is the quinine from?
*  Why do they have it in there?
*  Imagine if that was the drink they drank in places where the mosquitoes were bad
*  Quinine powder is so bitter that British officials stationed in early 19th century India
*  Had to mix it with soda and sugar so they could drink it
*  So that's probably how they made the drink to begin with
*  That's deep
*  They made a drink with some nasty stuff that kills malaria
*  Do you know that sickle cell anemia is closely related to people that have survived malaria?
*  Really?
*  Yeah, apparently it's like the genetic
*  Tiffany Hattish is actually the first person to tell me this
*  The genetic, the reason why sickle cell came about was because of an ability to fight off malaria
*  Somehow or another they're connected
*  And that, what's that?
*  Sorry, sorry
*  No
*  But that, then I looked it up and it's like it's really interesting
*  It's like it occurs in people who are descendants of people who were in places where malaria existed
*  So it has something to do with like this resistance to malaria
*  Have you had Tiffany on here?
*  No, I haven't. She was supposed to be on but she got sick
*  There is also, it says at the bottom of this
*  A lover though
*  Yeah, me too
*  I don't know prescribed but it says it's often recommended to relieve leg cramps
*  Huh
*  Interesting
*  Leg cramps
*  Yeah
*  Leg cramps are no different than arm cramps, are they?
*  It says it but the FDA cautions consumers against using off-label quinine drugs to treat leg cramps
*  But mixing it, there's a certain amount of it that can be mixed
*  Weird
*  What kind of a bitch are you that you need to take a drug for a leg cramp?
*  That is
*  How about walk it off
*  Stretch it out bitch
*  Stretch it out
*  Have some water
*  Come on
*  Drink something with electrolytes, get yourself some liquid IV
*  Maybe this is like supercharged electrolytes, I don't know
*  It doesn't have much science about it at all, just as like a sentence
*  Yeah, who knows man, I hope it works
*  If it doesn't work, I hope, vitamin C, sauna, that's what I'm doing
*  A lot of vitamin C, a lot of vitamin B
*  I bet you do, it's three hours and 27 minutes
*  Are we 27? Oh damn
*  Look, it's 3.30 almost
*  Done
*  I think we got a lot accomplished
*  Me too man
*  How about the fucking USP scan
*  And then how about the fact that it happens while we're on the podcast, that was pretty crazy
*  We didn't cover too much of it
*  Listen man, I was hesitant, my thoughts on
*  I know you were
*  I was like, hmm, I really want to go, like I was leaning towards going
*  But I'm like, God, I don't want to hear it from people that don't think it's a good idea
*  I'm not interested in putting myself at risk, but my real concern was
*  How do I know if I contract it and then I bring it back, how am I going to know?
*  And then I had to be honest with myself, I'm like, I really wouldn't know
*  So the only way I would be able to do it is to do it and then be in quarantine until I get tested
*  That ain't worth it
*  I'm like, oh Jesus Christ
*  For what?
*  I want to find out man
*  I want to find out how many people have it
*  I wish they would do
*  One thing that I wish they would offer is like a worldwide antibody test
*  Let's find out what the real numbers are
*  And maybe they're already doing this and I'm just a moron
*  But a worldwide test
*  They're doing more, right?
*  Yeah
*  What's weird to me is the NBA got tested so fast
*  But I mean antibodies
*  I want to find out like how many people went through it
*  It would be nice to have a test
*  It would be nice to have a test of the people that survived it
*  Like let's test you, how many people survived it?
*  Amazing
*  They have those numbers
*  Yeah, they do
*  It would be nice to have that, but it would be also nice to
*  I hate to say this because I don't want to test everybody
*  But if we tested everybody, everybody, it was real simple
*  We tested everybody
*  And then we find out, again, this is a power thing
*  You don't want people having the power to fucking just force you to take a test
*  And that's what ultimately they would have to do
*  If we're going to test everybody, you'd have to make it like
*  The government would have to make it mandatory
*  But imagine if they tested everybody and be like, dude, we got like 99% people have had it
*  And they didn't even know it
*  And they're fine
*  We don't know
*  What if like 99% of the planet had it and a few of them got it really bad
*  And people died from other people just maintained
*  And didn't even skip a beat
*  There'd be no quarantine
*  Weird
*  Isn't that like the chickenpox?
*  Like almost everybody gets the chickenpox eventually, right?
*  Is that true?
*  You can get it again
*  Do they have a vaccine for the chickenpox though?
*  I thought you could only get it once
*  I think they have a vaccine for the chickenpox
*  When a kid gets it, a lot of parents, they want to get their kid near it
*  Yeah, but that was before they had vaccines, I think
*  See if, I mean, I'm really sure they have a vaccine for the chickenpox
*  And that was the idea behind it
*  That's why people would want their kids
*  We haven't heard about chickenpox in a grip
*  When I was a kid, I had it
*  I'm pretty sure
*  But you can't get it twice
*  I had it too
*  You can't get it twice though
*  Once you have it, you're good
*  I have like a little hole in my face where I picked my scab
*  There is one, yeah
*  Varicella, it's called
*  Yeah
*  Varicella
*  I think, Jamie, you're talking about back before then
*  They used to do that
*  Yeah, I guess I mean
*  People would bring their kids over, someone had chickenpox
*  You'd bring your kid over around that kid
*  So they'd get it
*  So you'd develop the antibodies
*  You know, that's the other thing about disease is it's like
*  Think about the flu
*  How many times have you had the flu but your friend didn't?
*  And you were around them
*  How many times have someone in your house, like your wife, have the flu?
*  Yeah, and you're good
*  And you don't have it
*  Or you do and she doesn't get it
*  Like, what is the difference between someone who gets it and someone who doesn't?
*  It's not just contact
*  It's also how well your body fights off that flu
*  Yeah, you're immune to it
*  Yeah, and that's something I think is going to help all of us to concentrate on now
*  You know, I really, really, really, really hope that that's what people get
*  This is the fucking kick in the ass you needed to get your life in order
*  In terms of your health
*  Get your fucking immune system in order
*  Get that workout program in bitch
*  Do something
*  Do something
*  Do something
*  Do something
*  Skip rope
*  Just skip rope
*  You think you're a bad motherfucker?
*  Skip some rope for 10 minutes every day
*  You'd be shocked at how hard it is to skip rope for 10 minutes
*  That's so good for you
*  So good for you
*  So simple
*  Good for footwork
*  Someone was talking about that at some football player
*  I forget what the story was
*  But he was talking to this other football player's kid
*  Or this other guy's kid who wanted to play football
*  And he's like, do you skip rope?
*  And he's like, no
*  He goes, well, why don't you skip rope?
*  Like, that was the first thing that he said to him
*  I was like, I don't know football
*  For receivers and quarterbacks or quarterbacks
*  He was just saying just for football, period
*  That's a great word
*  I think it's great for, like, there's a reason why people do it for striking, too
*  When you're forced to bounce up and down on your ball, your feet like that
*  You get a way better sense of what your body's capable of in terms of movement
*  When I was fighting, I used to do rounds inside the cage
*  I'd do four or five minute rounds with a minute off of jump rope
*  And I'd go in the ring and bounce back and forth
*  Dude, jump rope's the shit
*  I love jump rope
*  Just think about how you're doing like these little explosions
*  Over and over and over again
*  Over and over and over again
*  You get good and mix it up
*  Oh my god
*  Speed
*  And you develop these legs that can explode all the time
*  For footwork, you're always on your feet
*  Yes
*  And then you get that on it, that thick dick jump rope
*  That fucking rattlesnake jump rope
*  That shit works your shoulders
*  But it's just such an underrated exercise
*  There's so many of them
*  So simple, too
*  I know, that's one of the cool things
*  There's some positives to this quarantine for some folks
*  And one of those is you have the time to look at stuff more
*  And that's one thing that maybe was like to sit in there
*  And people are like, I never thought about that for fitness
*  But you're willing to go to take a soul cycle class
*  On the other side of town
*  But you could just watch a YouTube video and jump rope
*  And get a way harder workout
*  Burn way more calories
*  And it's hard
*  You don't have to go anywhere
*  You could watch a movie, watch your favorite movie
*  Watch The Godfather
*  I used to go in my garage every morning, ride that peloton
*  I got a fucking bike now because of the quarantine
*  What are you saying?
*  Part of the fun of those classes, Joe, is not just being by yourself
*  Oh, being around hot roads
*  Talking about them hoes
*  Talking about them hot rods
*  Them cycling hoes
*  Brendan, I don't want you to piss your pants
*  Thanks, dude
*  Let's wrap this up
