# JRE MMA Show #95 with Brendan Schaub
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyX2HaJSIco)
*  Fight week. It's here. It's here. We're just a couple days away. Here we are, Thursday,
*  we got Friday, and then Saturday's fights. And I gotta go. I'm gonna be in Jacksonville,
*  Florida. I'm gonna be doing commentary in an empty arena. No one's gonna be near me.
*  Everybody has to be really far away from each other. We're gonna be on separate corners
*  of the octagon, which fucking sucks. You, DC, and Anik. And Anik. When things go crazy,
*  DC and I always grab each other. I know. You guys vibe off of each other. Can't do that.
*  Everybody's a pussy. But we're all tested. That's what doesn't make any sense. That's
*  what I'm saying. If you all agree, we'll risk it, man. We're all healthy. We're all fine.
*  Well, not only are we all healthy and fine, we're tested for clean. We don't have it.
*  We don't have to be far apart from each other. I got tested yesterday. I got the results back
*  from my nose swab. That's negative. And then two days before that, I took an antibody test.
*  That's negative, too. I'm 100% negative. So whose idea is this? It's fucked in the state.
*  The state just has real rigid guidelines. Apparently, they just want to make sure that
*  everybody's safe. Cam Haynes wanted to come with me. He couldn't come. He can't. Nope.
*  Nope. Do you know what Cam would do to COVID? It doesn't have a chance. Not a chance. That
*  kind of cardio. God, come on, man. Listen, I had Elon on the podcast yesterday and we
*  talked about what the actual death rate is versus what everyone thought it was going
*  to be. Is he good at reading stats? I don't know. He said it's a magnitude of 10 to 50%
*  10 to 50 times less deadly than they thought it was going to be. That's pretty big. That's
*  huge. Especially when they start getting to things like, I don't know if you've seen the
*  there's a prison where they tested these prisoners. 98% of them had it and had no idea. Asymptomatic.
*  Everybody was fine. They're finding that in a lot of places. A lot of people are asymptomatic.
*  And Elon goes hard in the paint too. Yeah, he goes hard in the paint. Which I love. I'm
*  a huge fan. He said yesterday, if you got bit by a shark and died and you had COVID,
*  they would count it as a COVID death. Yeah, 100%. I mean, he's probably making a joke.
*  He is, but he's not. Yeah, but he's not. Yeah. Yeah, he's not. Yeah. It's so ridiculous,
*  man. Did we find out whether or not that's true about the heart attacks, the heart disease?
*  Someone else brought it up to me today. Someone else who's a pretty smart person in New York.
*  I looked like I couldn't even find the numbers. So I don't know where they got those numbers.
*  See if there's an article. I looked hard. I looked hard. Is the podcast out? I looked
*  hard. Sorry. Is the podcast out? Yeah. Yeah, it's out. Does he mention how, isn't it weird
*  that the death rate went down once the flu season's over? Did he talk about that? How
*  they're counting flu as COVID too? Yeah, that was the thing. If you have flu and COVID,
*  they counted as COVID. Yeah. And then the flu, you know, look, COVID's not good, but
*  it's not what we were worried about. It's not what we thought it was going to be. It
*  shouldn't have shut down the economy. No, I don't think so. I think shutting it down
*  for a couple of weeks is not a bad idea to get a sense of it. But once the numbers are
*  back, I mean, I think right now it needs to restart. People need to be precautious. They
*  need to follow social distancing guidelines, wear masks if possible, especially until we
*  get it all wrapped up and figure out what it is in terms of like what the treatment
*  like they have. What does that stuff call again? Remdesivir? Remdesivir. Remdesivir.
*  This new antiviral treatment that they say is supposed to work. Working really well with
*  it. I think you have underlying health conditions. Yeah. And you're over 60 put on a mask. If
*  you don't, it should be up to me if I want to wear it. Did you know that the average
*  age of COVID death user, people who get COVID and die is higher than the average age of
*  death? That's nuts. That's nuts. I'm so glad Elon came on. Is that a crazy number?
*  Just dropped some fucking knowledge. That's a crazy number. You know what's weird? And
*  there's this weird like toxic culture who wants it to be bad. So when Elon spits these
*  facts, I'm sure your podcast comes out, people are like, no, and they start throwing other
*  facts. Like, no, dude, these are the stats. It's tough to argue with these hard cold facts.
*  Dude, people are so scared. Well, Elon's not a doctor. Again, save it, dude. Yeah. We're
*  looking at stats. Yeah, I think you can read stats. Yeah. The dude's gonna get us to the
*  fucking tomorrow. He's gonna build a fucking planet. You know, I think we're gonna be all
*  right. He can read those. I'm gonna listen to that guy. Yeah, it's not what we thought
*  it was gonna be. That's what it is. Everybody was scared two months ago. That's why holy
*  shit the plague's coming. And it's not that. It's not that we got lucky. It's a bad cold.
*  It's really bad. Kill some people. It fucks people up with respiratory disease. It's really
*  bad for people that are obese. It's really bad for old people. Everything's bad for old
*  people and obese people, though. Everything's bad. That's that's reality. That's given shape,
*  man. God damn it. Say it. Say it. Fucking shape. Join the big boys bike club, man. Get
*  your fat ass in there. Bro, how many fucking rattlesnakes are in your neighborhood? Every
*  day you're sending me a video of a new rattlesnake. That's ridiculous. And that's that's that's
*  like that dirt Mahalan Road and the Topanga Canyon. Like that's those dirt roads. And
*  they're everywhere. They go on the road. They go on the road. They go in the sun. Oh, and
*  now I'm just I don't accustomed to I used to be so scared to buy in the morning. My
*  God, here we go. I'd be so scared. But now it's like they're not going to bother me.
*  I mean, if I if I step on one, it's you know, it's going to be trouble. But I'd still rather
*  get I'd rather get COVID than get bit by a rattlesnake. Tell you that right now. 100
*  percent. 100 percent. But they look like these big logs. That Mike Posner guy, he got bit
*  by a rattlesnake. He was fucked up. He was a baby one. Yeah. So they had stronger venom,
*  I guess. No, that's a myth, apparently. Yeah. All right. Well, they all suck. It didn't
*  make sense. You see the one I seen today. How about that bad? He was a little aggressive
*  to a little big. He's a little aggressive. And then he started heading my way. Oh, dude,
*  come on. So I'm trying to make noise. I'm like, come on, dude, go that way, man. Every
*  morning I see him every morning. You know, their venom. Apparently it's like it digests
*  the animal. Like if they kill a rabbit with their venom, it actually helps digest the
*  rabbit. It breaks down the tissue. So when people get bit by it, it makes your skin rot.
*  It makes your meat rot. So it allowed like so if it was going to swallow you, it allows
*  it to digest you easier. I think my big ass be OK. I think I'd be all right. But it's
*  gonna be such a nightmare. You can get fucked up by rattlesnake venom. Such a nightmare.
*  I watched this horrible fucking website where they had a series of photographs of this guy
*  that got bit on the arm and they had a med vacum out of there and they had to do a bunch
*  of procedures and skin grafts and all kinds of shit. And his arm was fucked up. It was
*  like it rotted a hole through his arm. Did you watch that thing I sent you about Alex
*  Smith, that quarterback? Did you see it? I started watching. It was gross. It's in early,
*  man. He got some flesh eating bacteria in his leg, a compound fractured when he's playing
*  for the Redskins did take muscle from his left leg and put in the right leg. It's just
*  a nightmare. I probably would have amputated it. What? He's still under contract. He's
*  gonna try to play again. I mean, how can it was so bad where they're like you're not
*  gonna have motion in your foot. And most the when we see these kind of injuries, it's usually
*  soldiers from stepping on IDs or whatever. So most of the time they just amputate it
*  because your legs never gonna be the same. Otherwise you're looking at 18 months, you
*  know, you're in this cast with braces and screws into the muscle and the bone. You're
*  looking at that long layover. And even after then, you're probably motion your foot. I'm
*  like, do you just take it off? Give me that fucking cool Robocop carbon fiber one. Toss
*  some specialized stickers on that bitch get sponsored. But the thing is, they're changing,
*  like every year they're changing what they can and can't do in terms of like biologicals,
*  like stem cells and different treatments they come up with. You know, they can fix ACLs
*  now without using anything other than your ACL. Oh, damn. Yeah. Dr. Roddy McGee was showing
*  me these videos this guy who they did it to and then he went into the Olympics four
*  months after surgery. That's pretty gangster. It's crazy. They're blowing out their ACLs
*  right the ACL snaps which was game over back in the day. Yeah. Well, it used to be they
*  had to replace it either with a patellar tendon graft, hamstring graft or cadaver. Yeah, I've
*  had a patellar tendon graft on the left and a cadaver on my right. But this thing now
*  they're taking the actual ACL that exists and they have some new way of suturing it.
*  And they squirt some stem cells up in there and it heals up. You're good to go. Yeah,
*  it heals up. Jesus Christ. Yeah, it's pretty crazy. So my thought is that they're always
*  coming up with new ways to don't cut your leg off. Don't cut your leg off just for stickers.
*  Just get sponsored. No, my thing is, is robotics are coming along too. So you might become
*  some badass with this robot leg. My worry is one day artificial legs going to be so
*  good people going to get their good legs removed so they can get an artificial leg. Make sense.
*  It's going to happen. It's going to feel like a regular leg. You just run forever. It's like
*  an e-bike. Jump over buildings and shit. Be sick. You become a superhero. Yeah, six million dollar man.
*  Remember that shit? Yeah. Except it's going to be way more than six million bucks. A lot more. But
*  Alex Smith can afford it. That's what's going to happen in the future. Probably. Yeah, don't cut
*  the leg off. Don't listen to me, Alex. If you're listening to this, don't get your leg off. Have you watched
*  the Countdown Show for this this weekend's event? I watched it. Did you see the trailer that I posted?
*  No, I did not. What'd you post? I got emotional watching it. Well, Dana posted it and someone
*  sent it to me. I'm like, oh shit, I gotta post it. Dana has me blocked so I can't click on his
*  profile and see it. I'm like, what the fuck, man? Yeah, I'm like, we're blocking people now.
*  We're throwing spin and shit. When did you block it? I don't know. Probably when we got into that whole
*  scuffle on Instagram. But that was his doing, not mine. How long ago was that? At least two years ago.
*  That's his doing, not mine. I tried so hard to mend that bridge. I've had so many sit downs.
*  I don't get the hate, man. I don't get it. But I love both of you, so it's a problem. You know,
*  it's like I don't get it. But it's so strange, like when you look at a list of people, like who's a
*  bigger advocate for the UFC? Nobody. Nobody but you. I mean, you? Yeah. And you work for it. Yeah. I
*  don't receive a dime off of them. I know. Yeah. But I shop from the rooftop. Well, you know, some people,
*  they fucking dig their heels in. Yeah, he's like Michael Jordan. He just doesn't let anything go.
*  Oh, is this the thing that talks about, I did see this. Yeah, it's great. Yeah, it might be the
*  best promo they've ever made. It's very good. The Countdown show begins with this. It's so good.
*  It makes me so proud to be part of the UFC. The Countdown show is so good, man. The Countdown
*  show is so good. And you see Justin, first of all, Justin, how hilarious is Justin Gagey? He goes,
*  I hope he breaks my nose so I can get it fixed. Crazy. Because you hear him talk. He's talking,
*  he's talking like this. Yeah. You know his nose is useless. His nose is useless. It's smashed.
*  I mean, his style is so face forward. He's so, such a brawler in a good way. I think, yeah,
*  don't call him a brawler. I mean, I'm a giant fan of that guy. Me too. I'm a fan of his
*  personality, his mindset, the way he approaches his attitude. His attitude, yeah. He's here,
*  he's killer be killed. I think this is actually a tougher fight for Tony Ferguson than the Khabib
*  fight. It's a scary fight for anybody. If you're locked in the cage with Justin Gagey, it is war.
*  It's a different fight. I was telling Countdown, it's like Tony Ferguson was getting ready to go
*  deep scuba diving, deep sea scuba diving, and we know you can go in the deep waters, but we know
*  what to expect. It's me a bitch, dude. But you know what to expect. With Gagey, it's like,
*  you're not scuba diving anymore. You're snorkeling and you're in hurricane waters and you got to get
*  past the initial part and it's a motherfucker. But if you get past that, you can be all right.
*  But good luck, man, because these waves are fucking common, dude. Yeah. He's a different kind of guy
*  because he's so reckless. He takes big chances. He doesn't play it safe at all. And the other
*  thing is Tony gets hit. Yeah. Yeah. He'll stand in front of you. The Linada fight,
*  you look at the Pettis fight, the Johnson fight. The Linada fight is a really good example of that,
*  but I think the Linada fight, first of all, he took it on short notice. And second of all,
*  Linada's nobody knew. Linada's good, man. He's good. He's very awkward. Yeah, he's very awkward.
*  And Tony gets hit basically early on in every fight. He'll get hit. He wants to play that game,
*  the anti-Pettis one. He got wobbled, you know, with Gagey can't really play that game. He cracks,
*  dude. He doesn't. At 55, he cracks. He doesn't. He just cracked. There's no space. He doesn't give
*  you any space. He jumps all over you. If he gets you hurt, he'll throw himself right into the fire
*  is like he's not worried about losing. And that's real. Like people say that sometimes,
*  but I don't think they really mean it. That's a gift. He really means it. That's a gift. Yeah.
*  It's a real gift for him. Yeah. He's got a very unusual mindset. I don't think Tony is either
*  though. That's what makes this fight so fascinating. That's why I think I love Khabib, I want Khabib Tony,
*  but this fight to me is more entertaining. I think so too. I think so too. Which is weird to say.
*  No, I think Gagey is more entertaining than anybody. He's so fucking wild. And then Tony's
*  more entertaining than anybody too. Like everybody who fights Tony looks like they fell off a train.
*  Everybody. They're all look at the Cowboys face was a fucking mess. So once a mess,
*  Pettis Pettis is covered in blood. Everybody gets fucked up. There's a photograph that shows
*  the list of the last like nine or 10 people that Tony's fought. Everyone looks like they got shot
*  in the face. They look like Ted Bundy victims. It's crazy. It's nuts. Yeah. Look at that. Look
*  at those people. Everyone's face is just a fucking holy wreck. Everybody looks dead.
*  And the cardio, the Tony Ferguson cardio. That's why you got to get past that first initial wave
*  of Justin Gagey. But after then Tony doesn't get tired. Never, never gets tired. His cardio is
*  off the charts. I wonder if anybody's going to shoot because they're both such phenomenal wrestlers.
*  People forget how good Tony is at wrestling. He's got zero takedowns in the UFC. Zero,
*  zero takedown attempts. Zero. I go back and forth on picking who's going to win the fight.
*  I, you know, as far as if you want to make money, Gagey is a good dog, but it'd be impossible to
*  pick against Tony Ferguson that lost in eight years. The other thing is Gagey comes in and he
*  does, he comes in with his head lower. Well that's snap city for Tony Ferguson with his Darces,
*  anacondas. And the other thing is we don't really know what kind of jiu-jitsu or jiu-jitsu defense
*  Gagey has. He hasn't been in a scramble with a real high level guy. It's a big unknown.
*  And I think that Tony is one of the trickiest submission artists in the sport. He's very sneaky.
*  He catches Darces and scrambles. He's got leg locks. He's got triangles. He tapped Kevin Lee
*  off his back with a triangle. He basically can do everything. See, I wouldn't be surprised if Tony
*  at one point starts diving for those ankles. Cause if you're not subverts in jiu-jitsu,
*  that's where it gets dicey for guys. You know how it is when a guy comes in and he doesn't know
*  leg locks, you get in this rabbit hole, man. You can't keep up, especially if you haven't been
*  training it. You can't keep up. Right. And Tony has a leg lock game. Eddie Bravo is his coach.
*  Yeah. He's got everything. He's got everything. And his fucking hands are off the charts. He's
*  so weird too. Like the way he moves, Tony is so creative with his striking and he's almost like,
*  he moves almost like he's breakdancing in there. You know, like he's, he's fucking
*  stepping side to side, left, right, pop. And then a jab comes out of nowhere. Like
*  the fuck is he doing? I can't tell you who'd win the fight. I don't know. I can't tell you.
*  I love it though. I love it. I absolutely love it. I cannot wait. I cannot wait. To me, this is one
*  of the biggest UFC fights of all time. It's a giant card. The card is stacked. It is one of the most
*  stacked cards in the history of the sport. Since UFC 100. From top to bottom, UFC 100.
*  There's so many great fights that people are forgetting. Like, Oh yeah. Look, Francis and
*  Gano versus Rosenstrike. I mean that fight. Holy shit. How about Dominic Cruz? The Keno 135.
*  Crazy. And everybody's forgetting. It's so good. People forgot Jeremy Stevens versus Calvin Cater.
*  That's a fucking fight. Look, I really believe Calvin Cater is the dark horse in that division.
*  I think he might be the champ someday. I agree. He's got a real shot. Yep. God damn, that's a good
*  fight. I wish I was five rounds though. Yeah. Cater's better than five. Well, yeah. Well,
*  if you look at the Zabit fight, he was fucking Zabit up in the third round. Yes. I wholeheartedly
*  believe that. He might have stopped him. The third round, he was chasing him down. He was walking him
*  down. Oh man. This is so, I forgot. Srony Pettis. Fabricio Verdun is back. Olenek. Jesus Christ.
*  Hey, you know what I picture is Olenek's team going, dude, you got to fight. He's like, oh yeah,
*  who's getting this ten finger choke? They're all, yeah, it's for doom. He's like, fuck.
*  He's not getting that ten finger choke. He's like, it's for doom out. What's happening,
*  old boy? God damn it. Striking match. Uriah Hall versus Jacare. Carla Esparza versus
*  Michelle Watterson. Stacked. Holy shit, what a card. Even in the pre prelims. Pettis versus,
*  oh my God. Look at that. Vicente Luque versus Nico Price. Holy shit, that's a good card. Dude,
*  Bryce Mitchell, Charles Rosa. That's a great fight. Oh my God. Ryan Spann, Sam Alveola,
*  right from the fucking jump. It's awesome. Fight of the Knights all over the board. All over the
*  place. Good luck fighting for that bonus. It's such a good card. It's such a good card. Well,
*  when you're trying to jam all this goodness into one event because you've had this fucked up
*  situation happen where, how many cards have been canceled? Four or five cards? Yeah. The last fight
*  was in Brazil and was that January? It was March. It was March. It was right after the UFC event
*  that I did, which was the seventh. I commentated on that one in Vegas. So I guess it was the 14th.
*  That was, was that it? I think. I think somewhere around there, the 14th. And that was the one where
*  Gilbert knocked out Damian Mayo. That's right. And he's fighting Woodley. Yes. I like that a lot.
*  I like that a lot. I like that a lot. That means, you know, I love Gilbert, but for Woodley to take
*  that fight, you know, he usually picks and chooses who he wants to fight. So yeah, what is, they said
*  that Dana, I got to talk to Dana this weekend. He probably, if he tells me, I can't tell you,
*  well, I'll tell you. Tell me. I can't tell everybody else. There's some sort of a fight for
*  for Mazvedal. I think it's Connor on Fight Island. That's what my fight brain's going towards
*  because he said we have a bigger fight for Mazvedal because they said Kamau versus Mazvedal for the
*  belt, right? That was the talk forever. He goes, we have a more exciting fight. I'm like, well,
*  there's only two guys who'd be bigger. Connor? No, I'd love if GSP, but I don't think so.
*  GSP. You know why? No belt. No belt. They don't have to worry about GSP taking off. Taking off.
*  GSP fights Mazvedal. That'd be gigantic. The nice guy versus the bad boy. Gigantic.
*  Connor Mazvedal is the fight, but then I wasn't even thinking of GSP. We haven't really seen-
*  Connor. Amazing fight. At 170. Amazing. Well, I don't like Connor at 70, but-
*  GSP Connor at 170. Dude, ready for this? How about Mazvedal? Nick Diaz?
*  Nick Diaz, GSP Connor, same card. Fight Island. Good Lord. I might have to take a trip to wherever
*  the fuck it is. Yeah, I might fly down there. Where do you think Fight Island is? I don't know.
*  They said- It's one of that Bronson's islands. The Virgin Island guy. The Virgin Records or
*  whatever the fuck. That guy? Yeah. I'm pretty sure it's one of his islands. Where'd you hear that?
*  The water cooler. Where's the water cooler? Who has a water cooler these days? That's right. It
*  might be. But dude, Nick Diaz, Mazvedal. Now, does Nick Diaz definitely want to fight? I don't know,
*  but in my brain I'm thinking who's out there who could be bigger than Kamaru Usman Mazvedal?
*  It's either Connor or Nick. Well, Nick would work because Mazvedal beat up his brother. Exactly.
*  And redemption. He asked for that fight, but it's always tough with the negotiations with Diaz.
*  Well, especially with Nick, because Nick hasn't fought since Anderson Silva. It was a long time
*  ago. Dude, I'm pointing Mazvedal, Connor. When Mazvedal was on Food Truck Diaries,
*  off camera, him and his manager were like, dude, it's Connor and Mazvedal. That's our fight. They
*  told us they want it too. That's the fight. Really? That was months ago. That was right.
*  That was after he beat- Who did he beat last? Mazvedal? Yeah. He beat Diaz, right? That's right.
*  That was a lot of fun. Yeah, I had him on literally like a week after that. And he was like,
*  oh, Connor's the fight. They're telling us he wants the fight. We want the fight.
*  Wow. That's a big fight. Mazvedal, Connor? Jesus Christ, dude. The shit talking will be off the
*  charts. Do a press tour for that, man. Yeah. You can't scare Mazvedal either. Mazvedal's a big
*  fella. I know he fought 55 before. I mean, he fought 55 for a long time, but it wasn't his weight
*  class. I don't see Connor fight him at 70, though. He's going to fight him at 70. I guarantee you.
*  Mazvedal's not going to go to 55. Really? Is that what they said? That's what they said? That's
*  what they were talking about. Oh, they want a weak Mazvedal. They want to pull a Floyd Canelo on him.
*  As much as I love Mazvedal, Connor's still the top dog in town. So you got to meet him a little bit
*  halfway. So he's the top dog in town. But I'm telling you, man, when you go to the UFC and you
*  see the pop that Mazvedal gets, there's this change in the public perception. He's a star.
*  He's a huge star right now. I mean, he might not be as big a star over the world as Connor is. He's
*  not. He's definitely not. Connor's eclipse the sport, but Mazvedal's one of the biggest stars.
*  Oh, 100%. He's giant. Easily. I think that fight would be bonkers, just straight up bonkers.
*  Connor said he wants to fight three times this year, but that's not happening, so they're going
*  to give him some big fights. Damn. Man, Mazvedal, Connor. Talk to your boy. See if it's happening.
*  So who's going to fight Usman? GSB or Colby? How's Colby going to fight him? He just beat Colby.
*  He just stopped Colby. You can't sell that Colby rematch yet. Not yet. Not yet.
*  Colby's got to beat somebody good. He's got to beat Leon Edwards. He's got to beat someone good.
*  Leon Edwards is like, boy, he got fucked. He got fucked. He's got to fight Woodley. He can't leave
*  the country. And he's, as far as how good he is versus public perception in terms of the knowledge
*  of him, people knowing how good he is, he's waiting for that one fight, that one big fight.
*  And Woodley could have been that fight. Woodley would have been that fight. Darren Till got Cowboy,
*  right? That's how he got on the map. Then he got Wonder Boy. That's all Leon Edwards needs,
*  like a Woodley and then another, like a Colby or something like that. Well, if he beat Colby,
*  that would be it for him. That would be a good fight. That's a real good fight to make.
*  Colby versus Leon Edwards is a really great fight to make. And both guys, like if both guys win,
*  they've got a real argument to fight for the title again. If Colby wins, he's going to talk mad shit
*  and he's going to, you know, where are you at, Marty? And that kind of stuff. And dude, what
*  happens? Leon Edwards will fight next on Fight Island against high ranked opponents as Dana White.
*  Fight Island. Come on down. Okay. Who's that high ranked opponent? Who would that be?
*  Who else is left? Well, there's Wonder Boy. Wonder Boy is still in the mix. That's a great fight.
*  Who else at 170 is in the mix? Well, you say you got Gilbert, who's going to fight Woodley,
*  which is a great fight. So those two are accounted for. Wonder Boy, there's no fight for him right
*  now. Who else is in the mix at the top of the food chain? Did Wonder Boy not talk about going
*  to 85? Did he? I thought he did. Really? Yeah, that's just a fan question. Maybe he said he would.
*  Okay, let's see what we got here at 170. Maz Badal, Damian Maia, Michael Chiesa. He's my dark horse.
*  Well, Chiesa's very good. He's so big. It's so crazy to think that guy's fought 55 for so long.
*  I'll tell you, he's a motherfucker too. He's at number 12, Neil. Oh, yeah. He's a monster.
*  Jeff Neil. God, 70 is nasty. He's the dark horse of 170, Jeff Neil. He's one of the most technical
*  and talented guys in the division. When he fought Mike Perry and knocked out Mike Perry with that
*  left high kick, I was like, holy shit. He's a monster. Jeff Neil, he's one of those guys where
*  you look at him like he's something special. Dude, when you look at 55, 17, 85, dude,
*  it is Murders Row from top to fucking bottom. Top to bottom. Has Dos Anjos fought Leon? He hasn't,
*  right? No. That's a possibility. He has a lot of possibilities. Chiesa just beat Dos Anjos.
*  Yep. Gilbert beat, I mean, it really seems like Leon and Steven Thompson is the way to go.
*  Wonder Boy and Leon seems like it has to happen, right? Talk to your boy. I mean,
*  that's probably what they're going to do on Fight Island. That'd be a great fight. That's a great
*  fight. I like that a lot. Now, where's Robbie Lawler in the mix? Robbie's at 11. It's interesting,
*  right? Because after Colby, Colby just kind of ran him over, didn't he? Yeah, he did.
*  Robbie versus Jeff Neil would be a crazy fight. That's a great fight. That's a great fight. That's
*  a great coming out party for Jeff Neil. God, what a fucking division. That's all they need is
*  one big fight. Dude. How about your boy Barboza going down to 45? How the fuck does he do that?
*  That guy shredded. He can't be good. He can't be healthy. He shredded at 55. And if you think 45
*  is nearer than 55, we got another thing for you, brother. Who is he fighting at 45? He's fighting
*  someone good. Oh, did they announce who he's fighting? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me see the 45
*  pound rankings. 55 is nasty. What do you got here? 45. Pick your poison. Who is he fighting?
*  Pick your fucking poison, dude. I feel like he's fighting. I can't remember who the hell he's
*  fighting. Is it Shane Burgos? I don't know who he's fighting. That's not an easy fight. No. He's
*  fighting someone very good at 45. See if you can find him. Dude, 35 all the way up to 85 is so
*  stacked. It's so hard to become a champion now. There's a real good argument for opening up these
*  divisions and having one every 10 pounds now when you've got world championship cowl. So stacked.
*  That's a good point. Now I've never been in favor of open up divisions, but now it's so stacked to
*  get to the top. It'd be so fucking hard. Well, not just that. It's like everybody is not going
*  to get a chance because you have so many guys in a division that are world class. It's too tough.
*  The title can't be defended that many times in a year and you only have so many years at your peak.
*  Yeah, you're right. Yeah. It seems like, look, I haven't seen him forever. Every 10 pounds,
*  just open it up. I wonder why they're against it. More belts. You're doing all these interim
*  bullshit belts. Why not open up the weight classes, give more guys a chance to shine?
*  I don't know. I want to have the most delicious beverage of all time. Is it nice? Yeah. Grape,
*  Kielcliff CBD. Is there caffeine in it? No, that's more 25 milligrams of CBD though. All right.
*  Just try that. I'm just some CBD. God damn delicious. Yeah. I mean, where does it go? And
*  in 85, what happens at 85 now? Right? Like Darren Till just said that he wants to,
*  pretty good, right? That's nice. They said Darren Till wants to coach Ultimate Fighter
*  opposite Israel Adesanya. So he put that up on Twitter or Instagram, whatever.
*  Says a lot of stuff on there. Stylebender just writes, no.
*  Stylebender's too big of a star for that. No, that's it. Just no. Why would Stylebender do that?
*  That's the way he wrote it. He's a beast. No, not happening. Just, just, just.
*  Okay. No explanation. Just no. Just no. And Darren Till's got, but, oh, Dan Ege. Ooh.
*  Very, and first of all, Dan Ege has fantastic cardio. He's got great submissions. He's got
*  great strikes. He's fucking ferocious. He's coming up. He's improving every fight. Yeah.
*  I don't know the odds on that, but that ain't, that ain't fun for Barbosa. 45 killing himself
*  to make 45. I mean, unless he knows something, we don't in terms of like, he would have went
*  earlier if he knew something. Angela Hill and Claudia Gadalia is a great fucking fight too.
*  Two dimes. Whoo. Well, here's Alistair Overeem. Dude, what do you do with the winner,
*  Francis Rosenstruc? You give them the interim title. Right. Because Stipe can't fight right now.
*  You know, he's, he's, he was saying, he goes, I can't even get a hold of an octagon right now.
*  I can't even get a full training camp. So I'm not fighting, you know, he goes, no way I could even
*  fight by August. Come on, dude. Well, I don't understand that necessarily that, that argument,
*  but I, I do know that he's got real problems with his eye. Yeah, it's an eye issue. It's a torn
*  retina and you know, it's supposed to be healing and he's doing his best to heal. And I'd actually,
*  you know, talked to him about it and he's, he's been pretty vocal about that. It's not healed yet.
*  And so he definitely shouldn't fight. Yeah. He was talking about seeing if there's some stem cell
*  options, but the people that he talked to are essentially saying that the only thing that's
*  available is intravenous stem cell for overall body healing, you know, which he could do for sure.
*  And it would probably accelerate some of the healing, but it's a real problem. Like your eyes
*  are you talking to Bisming about it? Exactly. He should talk to Bisming because I wonder if
*  Bisming would go through the, I know Bisming said he wished he didn't take the Kelvin fight. I think
*  remember that when he hurt his other eye. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. He hurt his good eye.
*  If you're talking about eyes, be Bisming man. Yeah. But with Steve Bay, all right. So you're on the
*  shelf. You got to give the interim belt to Francis and Rosenstruck. I think so. I think so. I mean,
*  there's no, no one else that stands out. And then if you're DC, he wants the belt, the real belt. So
*  he's not going to fight the winner of Francis. He's not going to fight Francis.
*  You don't want it. Nobody wants to fight Francis. Dude. Have you seen, I touched it. Have you seen
*  Francis shirt off? Yes. What the fuck? He's trained hard. We're not all built the same.
*  He's trained in hard. No, no. Look, man, that guy is like a character in a movie. If you stop
*  and think about his childhood, learning how to fight and then growing up in a fucking like working
*  in a sand mine and talk to just just digging in the sand. Yeah. I mean, it's like a Conan movie.
*  Yes. He's so powerful, man. And he's so big. You're talking about a guy who's cutting weight to make
*  two sixty five and all natural, just genetics. Look at that off the charts, genetics, power,
*  insane power. But I'll tell you, man, Rosenstrike is no walk in the park. He's a real elite striker,
*  man. Yeah. Big fuck too. He's more decorated as far as striking. And he's big, man. He's fucking
*  big. He's built like that, though. No, not built like that. He's got some body fat on him, but
*  he's a solid two sixty five. Rosenstrike is huge, bro. Have you met him? I haven't. He's enormous.
*  Rosenstrike is fucking huge. I mean, he hits on him. He doesn't have the same amount of low body fat.
*  No, he must, though. But he has great stamina. I mean, he knocked out Overeem in the fifth round
*  with a few seconds to go. Right. He's losing that fight. He was losing that fight. But Overeem is a
*  legit elite striker. Now, the difference between the way Overeem fought him and the way Overeem
*  fought Francis, Overeem got stuck in these exchanges with Francis and Francis hit him with
*  that left hook, which is just. It was like a shovel. So one of the worst knockouts in the history of
*  sport ever. Ever. Ever. The head, the fucking head. The back of his head slapped him in the ass.
*  It really did. Ain't that a bitch? I've never seen Francis hit you as hard as he can. Just this
*  African uppercut, this superhero fucking Ironman Jack City. Super athlete, left hook. Boom.
*  Rosenstrike can take it, too. Like he was walking through Alistair's shots.
*  I bet you doesn't walk through Francis's. No one walks through Francis's.
*  Ah, Seepe did a little bit. He got hit by him. Paid the price, though. I think that part of what
*  happened in the second fight or the first fight rather with DC was the damage that
*  Seepe had incurred in the fight with Francis. That's fair because he took some big shots.
*  Big shots. And you only get so many of those. And when he got hit and knocked out like that,
*  it's like it wasn't the biggest shot he got hit with. I don't think he saw it coming,
*  but the way he went out from that shot, it's almost like, hmm. It's like that. You gotta wonder.
*  Yeah. How much of that was like residual damage from battling the scariest fucking
*  striker in the sport? Yeah. I'm just super high on Francis now. I think, you know, he got
*  humbled a little bit in that Seepe fight. He was like, dude, it was just too fast. I wasn't ready.
*  I was too arrogant. Went back to the drawing board. You look at him now and you're like,
*  holy shit, who's going to beat this guy? Yeah. Yeah. He's champ by 2 on 21.
*  Well, I'm telling you, you still got to get past Rosenstrike.
*  Which I think he does. Who knows, though? Who knows?
*  Might not. Rosenstrike is a really talented striker. Super talented.
*  It's going to be fucking crazy. It's going to be crazy. I can't wait for that fight.
*  Jeremy Stevens versus Calvin Kader is a crazy fight too. You can't count. You never can count
*  out Jeremy Stevens. There's a lot of live dogs on this. If you like the bet, you can put together
*  a parlay and you risk like a hundred and you can win 15,000. Yeah. It's like some crazy parlay,
*  but you look at it like, I can see that shit happening, man. Yeah. Yeah. And also who knows
*  what kind of fight camps these guys are getting, right? Like this is- Training partners would be
*  the biggest thing. The only one I'm not worried about is Tony Ferguson. He's a lone wolf.
*  What are gyms? How are gyms dealing with this? What happens to a guy like Dominic Cruz? Is he
*  allowed to go to the gym and train? Like how do, what do they do? If you're one of those big names,
*  I guarantee those guys are getting keys to the gym and going in and doing their thing.
*  But even if you get a key to the gym, are you allowed to do that? Like this is one of the things
*  that's been weird. But this is one of the things that's been weird. They're giving people tickets
*  for shit. Dude, I got a ticket for riding my bike. What? I didn't tell you this? No. Yeah.
*  I got a ticket. Did we talk about this yesterday? I brought it up. I wasn't sure if it was active.
*  What did Elon say? Can you get me out of it? Oh, fuck. Elon's like, I'll take care of this job.
*  What happened? What happened? I'm riding my bike like I do every day, avoiding rattlesnakes.
*  And I get on the descent. I'm in the middle of nowhere, dude. Nowhere. I ride from Woodland
*  Hills to Malibu. I'm in the middle of nowhere in between there. And then I see two Ranger trucks
*  intercept me and they get out and they have masks on. And I start laughing. I go, no way. I go,
*  you think we're going to get COVID out here? Fellas, you think we can take the mask off? Get
*  the mask off. Nobody's getting COVID out here. And they take their mask off. I'm like, I can't believe
*  they listened. They take the mask off. And I go, are you giving me a ticket? And he goes, listen,
*  here's the problem, dude, is the parks are closed. I go, they're closed? Since when? He goes, how
*  long have we been in quarantine? I go, I don't know how long we've been. He goes, I think like
*  over 50 days. I went, I've been out here every single day for the past 50 days. He goes, really?
*  50 tickets? Yeah. He goes, really? I go every day, dude. And he's like, well, you know, he just got
*  lucky. And he goes, here's the problem is if a thousand people had your same mindset and came
*  out here, then we'd have a problem. I go, does anybody ride here? Does anybody ride a bike here?
*  And the big guy's like, I ride a bike. He goes, I'm actually part of the Thickboy Bike Club. I go,
*  I go, so he knows, he knows. I go, dude, have you been out here? And he goes, he goes, I usually
*  don't go this far. And I'm like, well, you got to be in pretty good fucking shape to get all the way
*  out here, man. I'm back. You think those people are worried about getting COVID or spreading it?
*  We're going to be fine, man. And he goes, you're probably right. He goes, it's not my doing. I go,
*  so you're giving me a ticket? He goes, no, I'm not giving you a ticket. I go, oh fuck yeah, dude.
*  He goes, but he is. And then this other guy gets out and gives me a ticket. How much? He says it's
*  the lowest fine you can get. It's like 40 or 60 bucks. And I go, it's like 60 bucks. I go, 60 bucks.
*  He goes, see you tomorrow. And they started laughing. I was there the next day. I was there today.
*  Don't say this. They're going to come, now they're going to make an example out of you.
*  I don't give a fuck. All right. When are those parks open? They're not open yet?
*  Friday. Now, yeah, but you're supposed to wear a mask while you're riding a bike.
*  That makes no sense. Oh my God. You got to use common. Dude, I saw a guy on his bike today
*  out there with me on the trails. He had the mask on. I went like, get the mask off, dude.
*  Get the fucking mask off, man. What are you doing? How are you going to get it out here?
*  It's not, it doesn't make any sense. Everybody's so paranoid. It's so weird.
*  It's a sheep mentality, man. We're not in the ICU. Okay. We're not in a hospital. We're not in a
*  nursing home. Or dude, this is my favorite when we're on these trails, right? And you're pretty
*  far apart and they see me and they put their mask on. I'm like, oh God. I go by, can't be my friend.
*  Whitney told me she crashed and got really fucked up and no one came to help her.
*  Went over the front of the handlebars, almost broke her neck. Nobody wanted to help her and
*  everyone's wearing a mask. Everyone kept going. And people yelled at her for not wearing a mask too.
*  It's fucking dark out there, man. Bunch of bitches, especially out there. You know the sun.
*  Yeah, those guys, I don't think they care. I was even talking shit about government news
*  to them. And they were like, dude, we don't agree with it. We just something we have to do.
*  Yeah. They're just doing their job. Sucks. That's why I told them. I get it, man. What would it be
*  like if a thousand people did it? First of all, a thousand people aren't going to fucking do it.
*  A thousand people ain't coming out there, man. No, it's hard. That's why I told them,
*  are you ride bikes, dude? You're part of the club. You know how hard it is to get out here, man.
*  Yeah. If they're, if they're getting out here, then fucking shape. Even if we all got COVID,
*  we're all going to be fine. Yeah. And he was like, I get it, man. The problem is once the
*  narrative gets established, you know, once the narrative gets established, it's crazy to me.
*  The news isn't held accountable for anything. Like to the, the, the slander, the pun out, you're
*  like, why aren't you showing anything positive? Yeah. That's why I tweet out positive stats. I'm
*  like, why don't you guys show anything positive? You're scaring the fuck out of people. They want
*  to. That's how they make money. They make money off of advertising. They make advertising off of
*  views. They make views off of scaring people. And then China said they're starting to get over COVID
*  release the fucking warrior hornets or the fuck they are. The murder hornets. That's what I thought
*  this was when I walked in, dude. They're about that size though. That's a tarantula hawk. I think
*  those Asian hornets are actually bigger than that. It makes, it makes me feel sick. Well,
*  if they're in Washington, I bet they're fucking thick ass. Is it going to head to California?
*  Everybody loves California. How many, how many of them did they find? I don't know a shit ton,
*  right? Have you seen them? I was like, how bad can they be? And I look on the video, they're
*  intercepting bees and ripping their fucking heads off. They snip their heads in half with their,
*  their mandibles. Yeah. And they kill thousands of bees. Look at the size of these fucks. Oh my God.
*  And they show up on these, at these colonies, these bee colonies, they show up at the hives and do work
*  burn through the hives. They start chopping heads off. There's a horrendous video of these Asian
*  hornets that show up at this beehive and just start chopping them in half. Have you seen that
*  video with that Coyote Peterson guy? Let's one sting him. And it, oh my God, my favorite's the
*  camera guy. What's the, is the guy's like, Oh God, that, Oh God. All right. Now tell us what
*  you're feeling, man. We got, that's why we do it. You got to tell people what you're feeling. He's
*  like, fuck. All right. You can tell he's like super annoyed. It was the worst pain. It seemed
*  pretty bad. Well, and then 20 minutes later, his arm had swoll up, like someone shoved a shoe under
*  his skin. It was like all popped up and puff. He couldn't touch anywhere near it. He was in agony.
*  Dude, have you seen Kings? Is it Kings of pain? Jamie, I think it's King. It's on, I think it's on
*  the history channel. I think it's on history channel, but it's these two dudes, one Australian
*  dude, one regular American dude, who's the Marine. And they're, they're like the, the pain scale hasn't
*  been done since like the 1970s. So we're going to go around, we give it a one through 30. We rank
*  them on the rank them on these, you know, criterias. So they go around all over the world. These fucking
*  dudes, man, they, they collect these wasps. They collect, you know, the tarantula hawk. And then
*  the finale, I'm like, well, what are they gonna do here? They get a, they catch a giant boat constrictor
*  in the forest and then they put mask on so it can't bite their neck and kill them. And then they
*  give the thing their arm. Dude, this fucking Python destroys their arm. Was it a Python or a
*  bar constrictor? I don't know. Yeah. The pythons have horrendous, they have horrendous fangs. Kings
*  of pain. Oh Jesus. Why is it biting the guy's arm? Well, they want to see how painful it, no,
*  no one's ever done a pain scale on a Python. Oh my God. That's a big fuck. Was it Komodo dragon
*  or something? It didn't get off like 10 minutes. Yeah. The Komodo dragon, they did, they couldn't
*  get it off him for 10 minutes. It just kept, it snapped and it would just, they had like soap.
*  They're like, let's spray the soap in its mouth. The lizard like, I don't give a fuck. But Komodo
*  dragons have poison in their mouth. It might've been a monotone. They're crazy lizard bites last
*  10 minutes. Is it a Komodo dragon? Mono lizard. Mono lizard. Okay. Well they're in the same family.
*  Oh Jesus. They can't get it off. They can't get it off. Well, I know how to get it off. You put a
*  bullet in that fucking thing's brain. I'd be like, fuck this game. Oh my God. I won't let them go.
*  Look at that. And then, and then so the one guy does it and then they switched. They both have to
*  do it. Yeah. So I would definitely want to go first. Oh yeah. Well, why don't they put a wedge in
*  its mouth? Like you do with a pit bull. Look at him punching the board. No one knows what to do.
*  Its claws are getting into them too. Oh, this is so silly. My thing is I looked at, I want to see
*  how much they got paid to do this. I don't think much. I was hoping they got paid. Look at the claws,
*  man. Look how it's using its claws. I'm pretty sure the one guy's like a Marine. The other guy's
*  just like, you know, the crocodile hunter rest in peace. But so stupid.
*  This is such a white guy thing to do. This is like what Lil, Lil Duval calls white boy. And he has a
*  Lil Duval. This white boy can't get enough of it. I've been watched all 10 episodes in like an,
*  I couldn't get enough of it one day just through all of it. Why do you like it though?
*  Cause it's insane, man. No desire to watch that. Really? And see which, which animal hurts the most.
*  Really? It all sucks. Don't, don't, don't get bit. I know why I'd standing this off here that the
*  guy DM me cause I keep giving the show praise and he's like, dude, for, uh, for season number two,
*  we're thinking of having celebrities on, man. We'd love to have you on. I was like, Oh, well,
*  maybe I was saying, I'm like, uh, I don't know if I want that. I'm gonna let a crow bite me. Yeah.
*  See how bad those pigeons hurt, bro. What's the, what's the scale of a parakeet? Yeah. I don't know.
*  I don't know. Probably not for me. The fuck out of here. I have this weird, because I see,
*  I think cam Hanes posted video, him Graham, I don't think it was a rattlesnake, but he came across
*  snake. He's like, you gotta save these things. So everyone's like, shop, you got to start doing
*  this man. When you run the snakes. And even before I saw Cam do that, I've had this weird urge to
*  grab the snakes. I don't know what it is. Might be CT, but I have this weird urge to just grab the
*  snake and like, I don't know, fuck with it. Like hold it. You bring anything with you like a stick
*  or anything? I have nothing, Joe. That's why I take you. I'm like, dude, I need that knife.
*  Cause the problem is if I take my specialized, uh, stump jumper, it makes noise. It makes noise.
*  If I take this e-bike, this, this white D and G e-bike, it's silent. So the animals don't hear
*  me coming. So today I stumped on three coyotes, pretty big, pretty big coyotes. Were they looking
*  at you finding? Yeah. And I was yelling. That's all I knew what to do. I had my earphones. I was
*  yelling. Give a fuck. Oh, they didn't give a fuck. So not scared of people. Oh, you know what? They
*  literally just was like, look at this. What's this fucking more on doing out here? I wish you
*  were smaller so I could eat you. Yep. Can't eat you yet. But if you fall down, you fall down. It's
*  on my leg. But I was thinking that's why I text you when I got done today. I'm like, I don't have
*  anything, dude. I don't have a knife. I don't have anything. It'd be a problem. I need a knife.
*  With a rattlesnake, I don't know what the fuck you need. It's just, you know, it is what it is.
*  Well, with a rattlesnake, most of the time you just got to get out of the way of them. They're not
*  interested in you. And the coyote is not interested in you either. But a mountain lion might be. See,
*  and when I went today, there's pictures of mountain lions. Pictures? Like warnings. Oh,
*  yeah. That'll give you the heebie jeebies. Saw a bobcat. I see a bobcat probably once every 10
*  rides. They're weird looking, aren't they? Their feet are fucking fat. Yeah. It's like they're
*  wearing Uggs. They got like Uggs on and they just hang on the tree and stare at me. They're weird.
*  Remember I told you I'd fuck a bobcat up? I regret that because when I saw it, I'm like,
*  here's your chance. They're pretty big. Yeah, they're pretty big. They're pretty big and
*  ferocious. It would be a problem for sure. Yeah. And plus who knows what kind of fucked up diseases
*  they have inside their mouth. Even a house cat, like, I mean, you're fucked with a house, even
*  those cats fuck you up. Yeah. A house cat that wants to kill you, that's a real problem. A bobcat?
*  Think of a rat. Like a rat wanted to kill you. Like a five pound rat. Like a big ass New York
*  City rat. Problems. That'd be terrifying. Terrible. A bobcat is literally like 20 times bigger than that.
*  Problems. I talk all this shit about nature until I run into it. When I saw a bobcat, I was like,
*  dude, talking all that shit. What does a bobcat weigh? It's not even 10 times bigger than a
*  five pound rat, but rats don't really get to be five pounds. Oh, I'm sure. Some of those New York
*  rats that eat good. Five pounds is pretty big. That's what that's for bobcats? Yeah. Yeah, I had
*  a bobcat in my backyard. Problem. Yeah, they're gross. Those little fucks. But coyotes don't
*  fuck with people, right? They will. Coyotes killed a girl in Canada a few years back. 19 year old
*  lady. She was a promising folk singer and she was wandering around the woods and the coyotes found
*  her by herself and they ate her. Circled around her? Yeah, they killed her. That's a terrible way to
*  die too. A really bad way to die. God, that'd be a bummer. I don't think coyotes are gonna fuck with me.
*  Like he's too big. I'll use the bike as a weapon. I would hope so. I would hope so.
*  You nervous at all about going to the UFC this weekend? No. Not at all? No. I'm nervous about
*  how weird people are gonna be. Like people are gonna be acting real strange. I hate people.
*  The COVID's made me hate people. Yeah, I'm not worried about the actual disease. I'm worried
*  about people. I'm worried about people freaking out. Like where I get my coffee at 10 speed,
*  this guy, I'm not even trying to be funny, probably 400 pounds, six foot, just so out of shape. He
*  works security there. He's like, you ain't come in without a mask. There's no line. There's no one
*  in there. I'm like homeboy. That mask ain't gonna be the thing that gets you, dude. It's your fucking
*  cholesterol. Leave me alone, man. Trust me, I'm probably gonna outlive you, my man. Can't come
*  here without a mask. What the fuck, man? What the fuck? I think you're gonna be fine in Florida.
*  Well, Jacksonville is a weird place. I've never been to Jacksonville. I've been to Jacksonville.
*  What's it like? It's not that crowded. It's not like a big, you know, it's not like-
*  It's more country, right? It's pretty country, pretty laid back. Tim Tebow is from there. I used
*  to do this golf tournament there every year. Oh, really? It's nice down there. Super laid back.
*  I wouldn't want to do comedy out there. Well, they're the first people to say,
*  fuck it, let's do it. All Florida did though, right? I think so. I think Florida's basically
*  opened up for everything. Missouri's opened up for concerts. Most of it, I think they didn't open up
*  where Miami and Palm Beach are. There's three counties down there. They will though.
*  Dude, I'm getting so many offers for clubs. Really? In June. So clubs are about to open up again.
*  Huntsville, Wise Guys, Salt Lake, Nashville, Spokane, like all these clubs are starting to
*  come about. Good. I love it. I don't know what's gonna happen. When's the store open?
*  Considered, me and Jamie were talking about, it's probably considered a restaurant, right?
*  This is one guy on stage. Why not? It's a live show. It's a theater. No, it's not a theater.
*  Some kind of a live show. It'd be more, wouldn't it be labeled a restaurant more than anything?
*  Well, there's fucking hundreds of people. It's not- Got a kitchen. They serve food. Yeah. Drinks.
*  That's their main, because you know, servers. Yeah. And just sitting people at tables and you
*  have one guy, you know. Yeah. Because restaurants should open up in phase three. Yeah. Well, yeah.
*  Probably at certain capacity, but yeah, they're opening up way before some other stuff. Oh,
*  that's the thing. These clubs I've been talking about, they're all not at full capacity. It's all
*  less. So that's what's going to happen at these clubs. So you get a reduced rate. Yep. Interesting.
*  Which is 50% less people. I know Wise Guys opened up, they had an open mic night and I think it was
*  150 people. They already opened? I'm pretty sure they did their open mic. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Utah,
*  I know, I looked at some of the restaurants in Utah. Park City, still not open, but Salt Lake
*  City has some restaurants are open, but most of them are open just for takeout. Theo was in-
*  Actually, Wise Guys has their, what they're doing, says they are open. Yep. 65% capacity.
*  Not bad. Hey, that's better than nothing. Customers will be asked to keep a minimum of six feet
*  between groups and while waiting in line, all customers will be seated. By the way,
*  we're all touching the same shit, breathing the same air. It's all crazy. Dude, I'll do the meat
*  and green spoke and lick everybody's face. Hand sanitizer stations are located at club entrances
*  and at the front desk. All high touch surfaces, including, but not limited to tables, chairs,
*  menus, doorknobs, faucets, bathrooms, and more have been sanitized and will continue to be
*  disinfected after every show. Oh, I love this. Customers are not required to wear a mask. I don't
*  want to do a show with everybody wearing a mask. Yeah, fuck that. Be awful. Dude, I'll start doing
*  shows other places. I'll go to fucking Utah and work. 100%. We should go down there. I'm happy to
*  go down there. I mean, I don't know what I'm doing. I have so many gigs that are booked.
*  We're supposed to be doing arenas in September. I don't know if that's going to happen. Here we
*  are in May. It's going to be close. The problem is the ticket sales. It's already sold out.
*  So it's not a problem. You're going to be close. I think you're going to be close because you see
*  the NFL, I think, release scheduled. Is it tonight, Jamie? You know what they changed?
*  Nothing. Really? Yeah. And I feel like, suck this dick. Full arenas? Yeah. I don't know. They
*  haven't said anything about attendance, but as far as scheduling goes, everything's in. Now,
*  what the fuck are they going to do here in LA? Because our governor sucks. He's not, he's not,
*  he's a safety first. Yeah, but you're getting where people aren't putting up with it. He has
*  to change, right? People are freaking out about him. It's not good for him. They protest at his
*  house. Oh, he's fucked. He won't win again. They protested at his house? Yeah, they showed up at
*  his house. Really? Oh yeah. That's like the beach thing. I'm like, dude, I'm telling these
*  people I'm going to get put up with these beaches. When is the ninth? Saturday. Saturday. There's a big,
*  big sort of demonstration that's planned, right? Isn't it? I don't know. It's always weird.
*  I mean, we are opening up. Like I got an argument with my dad about COVID and he's like, I don't
*  know why you're crying. We're opening back up. I was like, I know, but not quick enough, dude.
*  Not quick enough. Not quick enough. Yeah.
*  Just what they should do is quarantine the people that are at high risk at this point.
*  You don't have to quarantine the whole country anymore. But when Newsome goes so far left and
*  he's like, here we are, man, you can't dial it back. He has to be forced to dial it back because
*  otherwise he looks like an asshole. So now you're talking about ego, dude, give it up. Yeah. He's,
*  it's hard to change paths once you've already committed to a certain path.
*  Yeah. It's a bummer. It's just a bummer. We're almost through it. Listen, the one positive of
*  this quarantine is we've all got kind of got to relax. You know, you've got to, when you have
*  stand up, you have shows, you have all this thing going on. We're moving a million times an hour.
*  I've got so much time with my kids, started a bike club. You know, I like rattlesnakes now.
*  I've lost weight. I've really enjoyed not going on the road. I've enjoyed that a lot. I've enjoyed
*  going and they forced me to shut everything down. Yeah. I've really enjoyed the not flying.
*  I've enjoyed that a lot. Flying and fuck you up, man. It's not good for your body, man. You know,
*  I had Jessie May in here last week and she was saying the same thing. She was like, I can't
*  believe how good I feel. Yes. I feel great. Best I've ever felt. We're killing ourselves. Yeah.
*  But it's, but I missed the fuck out of it. I missed the road, man. Yeah. Oh, I missed the shows.
*  I missed the store. I miss performing. I definitely miss, I miss writing new material.
*  I haven't written a goddamn thing. I haven't written any stand up. It's tough to, it's tough
*  to feel creative during this lockdown, man. There's like other shit going on. You can,
*  I mean, you can write, you could write. I could have written. I just decided not to. I decided
*  I'm just going to just do podcasts and work out a lot. How many years have you wrote? I mean,
*  think about how nonstop. I also thought maybe this is a good, this forced break is good for everybody,
*  man. It's good for me. I mean, you can make it good for you. You can decide it's bad or
*  decide it's good. But the other thing that I decided is I want to see how I feel about this
*  organically. You know, instead of trying to make comedy out of it right away, I just want to see
*  what my real feelings are about this. Like let it, let it seep in. And then, you know, once,
*  once I've got a handle on how I feel about it, what my take is, then, then do some, do some writing.
*  What's done for me is that I feel great. I feel better. Started by club, lost weight. But the
*  other thing is I've gotten, I've paid more attention to politics because it's never really
*  affected me. I don't know why that for these guys are fucking all con artists. But then when they
*  lock down your lifestyle, that's like, all right, what are we doing here, man? Then you start to
*  look into things like, holy shit. We went over the list with Hinchcliffe yesterday. We went over the
*  list of all things the governor, the governor has approved for outdoor activities and it's
*  so condescending. It's so ridiculous and so fucking stupid. This is a long list of things you can and
*  can't do. It's so stupid. It's nuts. Yeah. It's also shows you a little power governors have.
*  Yeah. Well, also it shows you how they like that power. They like it. Oh, you don't want to tell
*  you what to do. They're not saying, hey, keep six feet apart from each other and, you know, use
*  social distancing guidelines and be safe. They're not saying that they're saying here's the things
*  you can do. You can enjoy the sunrise and the sunset. You can enjoy yoga. You can enjoy bike
*  riding. You can enjoy golf, but no carts. So that's says no carts. Well, it's like people got upset
*  because they posted that the city of Venice filled the skate park with sand because they want kids
*  stop skating. But this is lame as fuck. And I had all these comments like, no, it's not like,
*  have you ever looked at the mortality rate of young kids? Have you ever looked? It's zero. Yeah. And
*  you're taking away their happiness. What about mental health? Have you thought about mental
*  health and going outside and what that does for those kids? What about that? Well, they're worried
*  that the kids are going to get it and they're going to give it to the grandma or dad or someone's
*  going to get sick. But you don't, you can't mandate good behavior. You can't tell people that you need
*  to be smart in terms of like infectious diseases. It doesn't work that way. Give me a guideline.
*  Say this is what's probably best and then let, let the people of America decide. Yeah. Once they've
*  figured it out, people know what to do and what not to do. You can allow people to make all these
*  bad choices. No matter what you can allow people to drink, you're allowing people to smoke, you're
*  allowing people to take prescription medication. You're there. They're killing themselves left and
*  right doing all kinds of other different things. How many people die every year in America? You
*  know, you ever looked that up? It's not Smith. We don't pay attention to that. We just, we just go,
*  nah, that's just normal. Well, we're willing to put up with that.
*  You know? Well, the thing is about most of the decisions like for cigarette smoke and car accidents,
*  stuff like that. Like you decide, right? You decide to drink, you decide to smoke, you decide to drive
*  your car. And this is, it's not contagious. This is contagious. The worry is that you're, you're giving
*  it to people that they, it's not their choice to get it, you know, old people in particular.
*  Stay away from old people, man. But it's the same thing with the flu, right? Any of it. All of it.
*  Yeah. I don't know. The real problem is if this, if they start doing this for the flu,
*  if they just start, this is a bad flu season. So we're going to institute social distancing.
*  I'll fucking move. I will. I'd be like, Utah, here I come. Yeah, I'm at that point. Going to Colorado.
*  If it got worse, we're going to start opening up. I was at that point. I was talking to the
*  fam about maybe doing something. Where would you go? Colorado is a good choice. From there. So I'd
*  like something new. I'd probably go to Texas. Texas is a very good choice. Texas, they don't
*  give a fuck. They're free. I talked to Adam Curry. He's already eating dinner in restaurants.
*  Yeah. Theo said he was in, he went to St. George, Utah this past weekend. He was like,
*  man, I went to a restaurant. He's like, that place was a shit hole, but best restaurant I ever ate at.
*  Yeah. Man, what is that going to be like eating in a restaurant again? But meanwhile, you're going to,
*  your server is going to be wearing a mask. You're like, what the fuck? You know, what the fuck?
*  Like you smiling to that? Fuck dude. Can't even tell if they're smiling. Hopefully not. Hopefully
*  people read the actual statistics and everyone kind of learns from this. The problem is they're
*  already committed to this doom scenario. You know, millions of people are going to die. Well,
*  millions of people are going to die period. Are millions of people going to die from this disease?
*  I don't know if that's true. Elon Musk said it's not true. Listen to Elon. I know eight people who've
*  gotten it. The worst was Michael Yeo, but he came in sick. I thought came in sick. He did.
*  He had underlying health conditions and came in sick and was flying and he's half Asian.
*  I don't think that no, he's Asian, but I don't think that matters. Okay.
*  Just playing. He's coming here on Monday. Is he? Yeah. Talk about it. I'm going to put him in a
*  plastic bubble in the corner. You can get them tested before he comes in. Yeah. Three times.
*  Oh yeah. At least make him wear a mask. Oh yeah. He's got to wear a mask. Gloves too. Oven mitts.
*  He's fine though. Look at him thriving. He actually got tested three days ago. He said he's fine.
*  Sturgill Simpson. He caught it. He was fine. He just said fatigue felt a little bit. The entire
*  Utah jazz team got it. Nothing asymptomatic. They were pissed. Of course they're fucking super
*  athletes. You think that shit has a chance in the body of a super athlete? You think that shit has
*  a chance of every UFC fighter on the card this weekend? Yes. Well, how many Jiu-Jitsu, I want to
*  know how many Jiu-Jitsu guys are getting it. You want to talk about people that are like constantly
*  being exposed to other people's funk. Non-stop. Yeah. Non-stop. You're rolling with five, six
*  people a day. Everybody's in a room together sweating like crazy. Literally rolling in puddles
*  of other people's sweat. Like the immune systems that you must have from doing Jiu-Jitsu, it must
*  be off the charts. What phase is gyms? Is that phase three? These phases are lame as fuck. Is it phase three?
*  Yes. Phase three. So that's when they can open up. Yeah. But even when they can open up, can a Jiu-Jitsu
*  gym open up? A regular gym, they're going to spray down the surfaces. I mean, I think they're talking
*  about like spin glasses and shit. I don't know if they're talking about Jiu-Jitsu. I don't think
*  they're detailed enough. I bet your Jiu-Jitsu gyms open up. God, I hope so. Me too. I hope so. They will.
*  So weird. And then the requirements for all the fighters this weekend,
*  did you read the whole list? Like these poor guys. Yeah, it's crazy. It's crazy. The requirements
*  are nuts. And the winner goes to another tunnel where the interview is included. Yeah. I wonder
*  what kind of restaurants are going to be open in Jacksonville. Room service. Yeah, I don't even know
*  if Jacksonville's restaurants are open yet. Like where are we going to be able to eat?
*  I'm in and out, man. I'm in there on, I'm getting there Saturday morning and I leave Sunday morning.
*  There's no weigh-ins. No weigh-ins. No public weigh-ins. I mean, the whole deal is just,
*  weigh-ins are supposed to be public anyway. The only time I'm there is to do it on ESPN.
*  And I'm there for the presentation and I announce the fighters' weights and
*  interview the people in the main event and co-main event. How cool would it be if Florida was like,
*  hey, we're going to open it up. If you want to go, you're at risk. Sign this. Oh, great. Sold out,
*  I bet. Oh, yeah, for sure. Dude, it would be sold out. I want people to buy this pay-per-view, man.
*  They're going to buy it. It's going to be huge. I hope. It's going to be giant. I hope.
*  It's going to be giant. I guarantee you people are so looking for something to do. Even with the
*  economy down like this? Yes. 30 million people out of jobs. There's so many people. Look, there's so
*  many people that are out of jobs. That's a fact. But people have some money and they need some
*  fucking form of entertainment. They need something. UFC is going to get people together too because
*  people watch UFC's with their crew. Yeah. So it's like, hey, dude, are you really that scared of
*  COVID? I got the fight. All right, coming over. I'm going to order a pizza and then everybody's
*  going to get together. Can you imagine watching fucking the fights with your boy and he's wearing
*  a mask? Dude, my producer, Chen, I go, you're watching the fights? He goes, yeah, me and my
*  buddies are going to zoom it. We're all going to watch it and get zoom on it. Don't talk to me for
*  the rest of the day. Oh God, they're going to zoom together? God damn it, Chen. I hope they get zoom
*  bombed by some fucking asshole. Yeah, I hope someone fucking gives you a virus through that zoom,
*  dude. You deserve it. Those zoom bombers, they show up, people are having zoom meetings, they find it
*  and they just fuck you. Fuck you, suck my cock. It's like a serious meeting. People need to grow
*  up, man. They pull their pants down, put their ass on in front of the webcam. They're just bored as fuck.
*  It's going to be real weird over the next six months when you see the economy because, you know,
*  the way a friend of mine put it, he goes, there's so many people that are out of work right now and
*  they don't even know it yet because their business is not going to be able to survive.
*  Whatever they're in, whatever they do in small businesses, they think at the high end and we
*  might lose as many as 40% of all small businesses. That's insane. And for what? For what? When we
*  look back on it, for what, man? Well, I wonder, it's going to be a huge mistake, what the death
*  rate is going to be when it comes to suicide, depression, hunger. One in five kids are starving.
*  One in five right now, I just read. Where? In America. One in five are starving. Look that shit up, Jamie.
*  One in five during the, when there's a depression, one in five.
*  Domestic violence is up, suicide will be up. Swartzen told me he was talking to the sheriff
*  and the sheriff said they usually deal with about one suicide a week and now they're dealing with
*  five a day. No one's saying this, yeah, but let's keep the old healthy, man. Let's stay quarantined.
*  It's like you have no idea the re-migrations. This is awful, man. I wonder how this is going
*  to affect the governor politically. Newsom? I really want, yeah, I really wonder.
*  Everybody wants to piss down his throat. Even Democrats. Really? Yeah. Are you sure?
*  No, I don't know that. I think his poll numbers are actually high. It was one in seven before this,
*  so one in seven. One in five kids are starving. One in seven before this shit hit. Yeah. And it's
*  all a fair amount of them were getting food at school. That's the thing, school programs.
*  Cutting out, they lost their ability to eat meals. They have found ways to,
*  new programs that have started to get a little bit of food, but yeah,
*  that was their whole day. That was their childcare. And if you're a mom, if you're a mom with little
*  kids, toddlers, your break, your fucking grace for the day is those kids going to school,
*  going to daycare. When you don't have that, dude, it's a, you know how it is with little kids.
*  Right. Now what happens to those moms if they're single moms and their kids are at home and they
*  have to go to work still? Most of them don't, they're out of job too, but they're stuck with
*  the kids and everyone's just going fucking crazy. What do they do if they don't? But they're not
*  out of work. Who knows? They have to work and the kids can't go to school because school's locked
*  down. Newsom doesn't care about that, man. Let's make sure that the old people are okay. The
*  economy goes to shit. Do you think that's his perspective? Do you think he's looking at it
*  politically? I think he's looking at it politically and if they can ruin the economy and that's what
*  Trump's known for, then it's going to give Biden a better chance. Hot take. Two term Trump. Just
*  kidding. I was looking at this article where this woman said that I believe Tara Reed, the woman that
*  says that Biden sexually assaulted her and I'm voting for Biden anyway. Just to get Trump out of
*  office. I saw that crazy bitch. How crazy is that? Then how about Biden comes out and was like,
*  we got to believe these victims. And when I become president, I'm going to change the law. They should
*  be heard. It's like, huh? Yeah. What the fuck are you talking about, dude? It's all horse shit.
*  It's crazy. They're all full of shit. All of them. It's just some weird ideological battleground
*  and Trump's not doing a good job either. It's hard to defend him. He's so worked up about all
*  this stupid shit and telling the media he was being sarcastic so that they reported that he said,
*  you know, I really didn't mean inject Lysol and it's all effective. It's all bull. It's all nonsense,
*  man. When you, when you look at all these politics, you're like, oh, this is all a bunch of
*  nonsense. I know, but to see how combative he is, it's not so silly. It's such, it's such a waste of
*  time and energy. Exactly. It makes him look so bad. But that lady, that new press secretary, she's,
*  he sent me that video, dude, she's a gangster. Have you seen that video? You've never seen someone
*  more prepared for a question in your life, Jamie. Have you seen that? Yeah. Small point on that.
*  Not the big point, but small point. She was so prepared. Yes. That's what I'm saying. Well,
*  she's supposed to be prepared. That's why I said you've never seen someone more prepared for that.
*  They're, they're prepared. Yes. Because they're prepared and you know why they're prepared?
*  Cause they're trying to play gotcha. So she played gotcha with them. She checkmated them. She came
*  in there with that fucking Elon Musk flame thrower. Play that video. Play that video. Like leaning
*  on a cap. You're on the, you're on the other side. I was saying, Oh, you're a biting guy.
*  No, hey, listen, before everyone jumps in, I almost was saying that it almost seems like she
*  was working with that reporter to say, Hey, feed me this so I can shit on everybody. No, that guy
*  got, cause that guy was, that guy was yelling. He was like, no, you were ready for this. Hold on.
*  What do you just say? He served her up a softball so she could fucking fire off the machine. No,
*  I don't know. No, he didn't. That's not what he did at all. Like I tried to play gotcha with her.
*  Do you want to take your word back? Because she said that Trump is not going to let the coronavirus
*  come into the country. And what she's saying, the reason why they're shutting down travel from Asia
*  is because they're worried about the coronavirus coming to the country and Trump's not going to
*  let that happen. So they, they tried to take what she said and, and take it out of context or frame
*  it in a way while she was saying that Trump is not going to let the country get infected by the
*  coronavirus. What she's trying to say is that she, he's not going to have free travel where
*  people have coronavirus because it's going to bring the virus in. Not that it's the only way
*  the virus is going to get here. The virus got here anyway. She came with the fire regardless, Jamie.
*  Are you going to take that back? First of all, it's a douchey question. Like all those journalists
*  are kind of douchebags in the first place. They're trying so hard to have these moments where they,
*  they fucking play got you. But when, when do these journalists quit being journalists and become like
*  fucking trolls off Reddit? Like some of their questions to Trump. That's why Trump goes so
*  hard in the pain on them. I know, but he goes too hard. The problem is he cares too much. He cares
*  too much about what they think. A lion should not be so concerned about the opinion of sheep.
*  Correct. And that's not, it's not becoming of someone who's in such a powerful position.
*  You're the president, dude. That guy's a fucking writer for the Washington Post. The way she
*  handled it though. Oh my God. She just dropped a fucking. It was sexy. It was sexy. Wildy coyote
*  with the TNT. Boom. She's like, you ready? You want to do it now? Yeah. And then she had a big smile
*  and walked off as they're trying to say, and he's like, you prepared for that. Thank you. Have a good
*  day. Oh gee. You think she prepared for it with all those stats that she read right in front of you?
*  Dude, they need to hire your boy, Elon Musk to get on that fucking committee. Where's the video pal?
*  The first thing I have didn't have the video links. I'm looking for it. I retweeted it. He's holding onto
*  it. He doesn't want to give it to us. Oh Jesus Christ. He doesn't want us to know.
*  I get shit because of this. I'm in the middle of doing five things and switching the cameras.
*  We're just playing. No one online thinks you guys are playing. Oh, come on. People online. I love
*  Jamie Vernon and we're just playing. However, I do know that he's on the wrong side. Oh,
*  oh, he's on the side of the bad guys. Jesus Christ. That'll be fun for you, Jamie. Let me go to the
*  fight companion. Oh, here it is. Here. Play this. Hold on. Full page and make it loud. President
*  Trump will not allow the coronavirus to come to this country. Given what has happened since then,
*  obviously, would you like to take that back? Well, first let me note, I was asked a question
*  on Fox Business about President's travel restrictions. I noted what was the intent
*  behind those travel restrictions, which is we will not see the coronavirus come here. We will
*  not see terrorism come here, referring to an earlier set of travel restrictions. I guess I would
*  turn the question back on the media and ask similar questions. Does Vox want to take back
*  that they proclaim that the coronavirus would not be a deadly pandemic? Does the Washington
*  Post want to take back that they told Americans to get a grip the flu is bigger than the coronavirus?
*  Does the Washington Post likewise want to take back that our brains are causing us to exaggerate
*  the threat of the coronavirus? Does the New York Times want to take back that fear of the virus
*  may be spreading faster than the virus itself? Does NPR want to take back that the flu was a
*  much bigger threat than the coronavirus? And finally, once again, the Washington Post,
*  would they like to take back that the government should not respond aggressively to the coronavirus?
*  I'll leave you with those questions, and maybe you'll have some answers in a few days.
*  You very much just you were you were you were prepared.
*  Drink that shit in Jamie. Drink it in. You were prepared for that. Oh, yeah. Oh, like you
*  with your practice bullshit question. Imagine you have one opportunity to ask her a question,
*  and that's what you ask her. This stupid. But then you get lit the fuck up. You got lit up.
*  And then you get out of there and everyone's like, damn, that's crazy. Yeah, you got served. You got
*  fucked up. Yeah, he got served. I want I want Dana Jamie's asking a question. I'm throwing it out
*  there. You guys can say that's not it, but I'm just asking a question. Go ahead. Ask her. That was it.
*  Oh, he was a softball setup. Now he's a cunt. You could see. I'm just asking. I don't know.
*  He was doing like that. That was a is a cunty question. I don't know if he's kind of maybe
*  a really nice guy. You look at his face, though. That's his job. His job is to try to get attention
*  and get some gotcha. So he played gotcha and he got caught. He got smacked down in the game of
*  politics. He might get one back in two months by helping her out now. And now they're going to be
*  a little bit of friends because they play both sides of the game. Keep an eye on it, Jamie.
*  This is that one YouTube video that everybody's sending me that is there was you got to look
*  into this about that lady who apparently worked for Fauci. What do you know about that? What I
*  read is she didn't work for Fauci. So she's a liar. I'm not saying that, but that's what
*  it what did you read and where did you read it? Is there an article that you could pull up?
*  God damn it. Ten fucking people. You got to look into this seems pretty legit. What is it?
*  She used to work for Fauci. I don't have the time to watch the whole thing. Yeah, I watched a few
*  minutes of it and then I try to click on the link 20 minutes later and it's taken down and a new one
*  pops up. YouTube keeps pulling it down. God, Fauci talk about a pussy. Well, he. Hey, dude,
*  come up with a. Do you have any solutions? Well, it's just shut the world down for a couple. It's
*  just doomsday all the time. All you want to shut down everything nonstop. I do got to say that
*  Bill Gates seems really excited about vaccines. And you know what? What I've heard from more than
*  one person is that first of all, I don't know if there's ever been a coronavirus vaccine.
*  I don't think there has been. Right. I don't think so. And to the other thing is they're saying that
*  even if you get vaccinated for this, you might have to get vaccinated every year for it. It might
*  be something that returns every year in some new form and you have to get vaccinated again. Jesus
*  Christ. And there's no there's no indication so far that people who have antibodies are 100% immune
*  to it. Also, they found out there was an article. See if you can find this. Forget about that Fauci
*  thing. See if you can find this. There was an article that said that they've determined that
*  the people in Korea at least who tested negative for the coronavirus and then tested positive,
*  that these were some I think they do way described as latent antibodies in their system
*  and that they're just such a small amount that even though they're testing positive,
*  it's still from the initial infection and not like residue. Yeah, it's not like a new infection.
*  Boy, did we fuck that up. It says they're testing to see if they have been reactivated by being
*  worn down or something. No, being like reinvented. Infected. Yeah, I think it's funny too how you
*  know, like Texas, Ohio, Atlanta, Utah, Denver, these these cities opening up and people on see
*  look what happens when we open up more cases like no dumb dumbs. We're testing more. So of course,
*  there's gonna be more cases. Yeah, there's more. All I care about is the mortality rate. Look at
*  the mortality rate. You know, when we were in Denver yesterday, zero. Nobody died in Denver.
*  Nobody yesterday. Well, Utah, or was it Montana? Yeah, Montana is one death ever. One death from
*  from COVID. We moved it. We didn't take this operation to Utah or Montana. Montana gets real
*  cold, bro. Yeah, I don't want to do cold. So you got gets cold too. Yeah, you told Texas, dude.
*  Texas does not get cold, but it gets hot. I don't mind the hot, but they got good food. Great food,
*  good people like the accent, great clubs. Yes, great place to work out the best. Well, Salt Lake
*  City's wise guys are some of the best clubs. Don't they have three of them now? No, wise guys. Yeah,
*  they have at least two. I only know of the one the main one. I think they have at least two.
*  Really? Yeah. I love Keith. Yeah, that wise guy is a great club. My favorite people. Yeah, they're
*  at Salt Lake City club is fucking his brother. You're like this, Jim. His brother was an offensive
*  coordinator, Alabama. Yeah, roll tide. So I'll talk to him about football because he knows his
*  shit, man. That's such a good dude, man. Such a good dude. Yeah, that's an underrated place.
*  Salt Lake City. Real underrated. The Mormons got everybody so scared of Salt Lake City.
*  You can go there at five o'clock in the afternoon. There's no traffic. That's great out there. Then
*  go to the Red Iguana. Get that Mexican food. Red Iguana is good. That's my spot. Oh my god. You
*  can get fat there. Easy. It's so nice. Real easy. They got good shopping out there. It's clean.
*  It's very nice. Good hotels. Yeah, very nice. Yeah, I like it. I like Utah period. Nice people.
*  I have a show end of June, which is almost sold out in Spokane. I do meet and greets and the club's
*  like no meet and greets. Bren's not going to meet with anyone because they were about Corona. I
*  emailed my manager this morning. I went, dude, I'm good to meet and greet, man. I'm telling you I'm
*  good. I'm comfortable with that. He's all, really? I'm like, I'm telling you I'm good. Yeah,
*  the club's freaked out. I'm like, I'll sign a waiver, whatever you want, but I'm not going
*  to go there and not meet people, dude. Everyone's so scared. When do you think it's going to be back
*  to normal where people won't be scared anymore? Let the bitches suck on their thumb and hide and
*  the rest of us just go about our business, man. I asked my dad about what it was like in polio,
*  like in the 50s when they were growing up and like that summer when people were getting tested,
*  people were afraid to jump in pools because there's polio in that pool. Don't get in there.
*  So it might last through the summer until- Well, the worry is that it comes back in the fall.
*  I don't totally understand this, whether they're going to say it's going to die off in the heat
*  and then come back when it gets cold again. You mean like flu season? Yeah. You mean like
*  your standard flu season? Here's the other thing is we did the quarantine to really protect the
*  old and those at risk, but also to make sure the hospitals can tolerate the mass of people coming
*  in there with COVID. Well, I think we've done a pretty good job of that and that's why we're
*  opening up those hospitals. A lot of them are shutting down. They can't afford to stay open.
*  Isn't that crazy? I mean, the stories you see in the news-
*  Now, New York says hold my mask. New York says hold my mask. People are dying like crazy over here.
*  Some hospitals in New York, yeah. Some hospitals in New York.
*  But other than that, man, I have friends who are nurses, stuff like, especially in Texas and LA,
*  and they're like, people are scared to come in here now because they think they're going to get
*  COVID here. That's so weird. The whole thing's a fucking- It's like we're living in a real shitty
*  Black Mirror episode. It's like the most boringest episode of all time.
*  Well, the guy from Black Mirror says he's not even going to have a season this year
*  because he can't. The world is too bonkers for him to be able to do Black Mirror.
*  Jesus Christ. He's going to have to let it sit out and-
*  Have you been watching? What have you been watching?
*  Ozark. Did you watch Ozark? So good. Did I?
*  Did you watch the whole season? All three.
*  The end. Binge them all.
*  The end is like what in the fuck? I can't get enough of that shit.
*  As soon as the last episode of season three was over, I Googled, when does season four start?
*  What to say? They don't have an answer.
*  How are you going to leave me hanging like that? Everything's on hiatus.
*  I don't know. They can't act because then they have to get close to each other.
*  Someone might get the cooties. I watched Hunters with Al Pacino,
*  Hun Nazis. Oh, how's that?
*  Amazing. Really?
*  Oh, it's good. Really? Is that a series or is that a show?
*  It's a series on Amazon. Oh, Amazon's doing some good shit, man.
*  You've watched Marvelous Mrs. Maisel? No, I want to though, because you said it's good.
*  First two seasons are very good. Third season lost me in the beginning, but I might try it again.
*  Now that Ozark is over. Ozark has to be top five of all time.
*  It's a fucking amazing show. It's so fucking good.
*  And you know what's crazy? We were just talking about this. The scariest people
*  on the scariest show are women. That Darlene bitch is the scariest woman in all of television.
*  The lady with the poppies. Yeah, the lawyer.
*  Oh, that crazy bitch. Yeah, that one.
*  And then spoiler in three, two, one. And then she's hooking up like that 17 year old.
*  Hilarious. She kills her husband.
*  Yes. She's so fucking hardcore.
*  She's so crazy. When she shoots Homeboy.
*  Yeah, keep it deep. I'm so bad at spoilers.
*  Yeah, it's a spoiler alert. It's been out long enough.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't have the time.
*  You can't ruin it for them. Brenda, you have time to do.
*  What you don't have time. We have nothing to do.
*  There's other shows. There's movies. Maybe you just I binge watch
*  every Adam Sandler movie he's ever done. Good for you.
*  Except Little Nicky. I haven't seen Little Nicky is good.
*  People hate it. I love Little Nicky. Kevin Nealon has tits.
*  Maybe we'll watch gross tits on his head. It's hilarious.
*  Super under. We've been doing every night. We have a movie night.
*  He's a great with the kids. Dude, Adam Sandler movie, sir.
*  He's the best. Zohan is to this day, one of the funniest movies
*  I've ever seen in my life. You had Billy Mastin, Happy Gilmore.
*  Yep. Wedding Singer is amazing. Wedding Singer. Amazing.
*  Big Daddy. Yep. Yeah. Big Daddy was great. Great. Great fucking movies, man.
*  And they get hated on. Like the Rotten Tomatoes.
*  I wonder why. I don't know. I don't get it.
*  I guess so talented. People want really clever,
*  really great writing. Just be entertained.
*  Oh, you're telling me Billy Mastin and Happy Gilmore is not creative writing?
*  Especially at the time. It's the thing is the kind of jokes,
*  although they're hilarious, they're like all dick jokes.
*  It's all like, but it's funny. That's my brand.
*  All I care is what's funny. Me too.
*  That's all I care about. I just want to be entertained.
*  Dude, I howled at Happy Gilmore. Howl. It's so good.
*  Right, dude. You forget how good it is.
*  It's so good. There's so many of those movies.
*  Bob Barker? I haven't seen it forever. Yeah.
*  I haven't seen so many of those movies forever. Did you see Uncut Gems with him?
*  I haven't. I heard it's great. Oh, dude.
*  I heard it's great. He blows you away in that.
*  It blows you away. That's a drama, right?
*  Drama. Yeah. He plays a serious character where the whole you're just sweating the whole time.
*  It's so intense. It's so good.
*  Yeah. Great movie.
*  I saw Ready Player One. That's a fucking great movie.
*  I haven't seen that. Was that Michael Keaton? Who's the director?
*  Steven Spielberg. Spielberg.
*  If you care to, the book, which I didn't, I listened to.
*  Ready Player One? It's one of the only
*  fiction books I've ever even bothered to go through, but I listened to it. Will Wheaton,
*  the guy from Star Trek, reads it and he reads some character voices. Fucking awesome.
*  Nerdular. It's way different than the movie.
*  Way different than the movie. Really?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. The stuff they do, like the trials, if you will, I don't want to spoil it
*  much because it's so different. It's so much more detailed. It's way awesome. They just couldn't do
*  it in the movie because they would have had to pay for way more licenses for way more things.
*  Hey, did your boy Tom O'Neill, who wrote that Manson book, the CIA book,
*  did he say when they're going to come out with the documentary, the TV show of it?
*  No, because they still haven't decided whether or not they're going to do one single documentary
*  or they're going to do an Amazon series like Wild West or Wild Country.
*  They should do a series like... Yeah, like Wild, Wild Country.
*  Or Tiger King or something like that. Yes.
*  Yeah. That's what they should do.
*  Yeah, they should definitely do that. They should do a series. It's too intricate.
*  That it's too detailed. There's so much going on with that fucking book. That book's amazing.
*  But that book became a New York Times bestseller after it came on the podcast. It's
*  blown through the fucking roof. It's huge. It deserves it. It deserves it.
*  Yeah. It's so fucking good. Yeah. And the amount of time you put into it.
*  I don't even think the paperback's out. June 23rd, I think, unless they bump it up.
*  Right. So the hardcover sold out. Fascinating.
*  It's a really well researched and well done book.
*  His life's work, man. It's crazy to think that this guy
*  worked on it for 20 years. 20 years on this one book. And it started out as a magazine article
*  for Premier. Nuts. And he got super deep.
*  And as he started uncovering things, he's like, holy shit.
*  It'll make you question everything with the CIA, all that stuff.
*  Oh, 100%. And Manson.
*  You got into it way before he was on the podcast. How did you find out about it?
*  It's very strange. I'm not obsessed, but I like Manson stuff.
*  Really? Yeah.
*  Why? I don't know. That whole time period,
*  in the late 60s, the 70s, I liked that time period, especially in Hollywood.
*  I just got into the Manson stuff, man. It is a weird time period.
*  And then somebody recommended it to me like a fan. I was like, you might dig this one, man.
*  I picked up. I was like, holy shit. This is good.
*  Fitzsimmons knew that guy during the entire time he was writing that book.
*  They were next door neighbors for 20 years. What?
*  That's how I found out about the book. Fitzsimmons does my podcast.
*  We're hanging out and talking. He goes, hey, man.
*  He goes, there's something you'd really be interested in.
*  My friend, Tom O'Neill, wrote this book about Manson.
*  I mean, I was glossing. Oh, great.
*  And then he starts talking. And the more he starts talking, I'm like, what?
*  He's like, yeah, he goes, he was part of this C.I.A. LSD experiment where they were
*  they were helping Manson get LSD and they were teaching him these tactics for getting these
*  fucking hippies. And they probably did it while he was in jail and they probably dosed him.
*  And then it turns out that those doctors with the same names as the doctors that were in the C.I.A.
*  LSD program also visited Manson in prison. You're like, holy shit.
*  See how much how much leeway they gave him getting in trouble with the law.
*  You're like, what the fuck is going on here? Every time he got arrested,
*  they let him out even while he was on parole. Violated his parole.
*  They let him right out of jail. And every time they talked to the sheriffs,
*  the different different cops that arrested him, like it's above my pay grade.
*  They were told they were told to let him out. What's interesting about Manson, too, is he's
*  labeled as he's actually the most famous serial killer. Not a serial killer, though.
*  How can you label a serial killer? He's never killed anybody.
*  Well, he definitely killed somebody. He shot. He shot a guy.
*  He killed that one guy at the ranch that shot a guy. Yeah.
*  Yeah. And he directed those other people to kill people.
*  Maybe. Maybe.
*  Well, what's interesting is that wouldn't be a serial killer.
*  No, he's not a serial killer. No, he's he's a killer.
*  But he's also a part of a C.I.A. LSD, SIA program. All that fucking wasn't Kazinsky to the whole shit.
*  Yeah, he was a different one to Kazinsky was a part of the Harvard LSD experiments.
*  Yeah, they were doing they were doing a lot of wacky shit with LSD back in those days.
*  There's a lot of terrible things that happen to people because they dosed them up with LSD
*  and blew their brains out. It's weird Manson never came out
*  and said this like, oh, dude, I was fine until these fucks came on, gave me LSD.
*  I was trying I was trying to fucking play with the, you know, well, do you think they would?
*  The Beach Boys. I mean, back then, he's a legit musician, like pretty legit musician, too, man.
*  Is there any music? Yeah, you can listen to his music. He almost got he would hang with the Beach
*  Boys. Yes. Yeah. Brian Wilson was going to give him some sort of a contract and they then his
*  agent went down to his ranch was like, well, this is terrible. And that's when he's like,
*  oh, well, we're going to kill you now. We're going to kill everybody.
*  Oh, man. Can you imagine? No. Back then, no Internet. The whole hippie movement is a new
*  thing. Right before the 60s, the 50s, there was nothing like that. So all of a sudden, like
*  that's like from 2010, there's no hippies at all. And also, and here we are in 2020 and hippies are
*  everywhere. And the flower children, they're doing acid and freaking out, having sex and having sex
*  and having orgies. You mean having a great time, Joe. Some of us probably a good time, probably
*  the best of times. You know, Woodstock went on during a pandemic. Yeah, you sent me that.
*  That's not they closed down. It was before Woodstock. Right. And they shut everything down.
*  Woodstock still went on. Yeah. But like the economy, everything shut down. How long?
*  It was it was bad. It was more death than we than we have in during this thing so far. Really? Yeah.
*  And America's kind of powered through it. Like everyone's like, we've never seen something like
*  this before. It's like, you all get history, man. We have. Well, we definitely everybody goes to
*  1918 Hong Kong flu 1968 killed one million worldwide and 100,000 in the US. Wow. Woodstock
*  went on during that time. Think about all the dudes that got their dick sucked during that pandemic.
*  Dirty hippies. Yeah, in mud. Yeah. And Hell's Angels were there stabbing people. And that was
*  called the Hong Kong flu. And then that's right. Try to call this one the Kung flu. But is it
*  racist if it came from Hong Kong? Did it come from a wet market? They say that's fake, right?
*  It's created in the lab. They say. Well, there's two stories. One story is yes, it was created
*  in the market. The other story is it was something that was in a lab and it was leaked. What's Elon
*  must say? He's my Lord and Savior. I didn't ask him. Oh, really? Yeah. I didn't ask him about that.
*  We talked about the disease, but we basically talked about the infringements on civil liberties
*  by forcing people to stay home. And he doesn't agree with any of that. He said you should you
*  should have the right to quarantine if you so choose to. That's America. Yeah. Yeah, I think so,
*  too. I'm always over by his SpaceX. And it's it's so in a weird way motivating. Look at what he's
*  built over there. I take my son to the gym over there, the Jeff Foley's gym. And we park right by
*  it and just see the huge spaceship and the parking. And it's kind of it used to be a hoodie area.
*  It's booming over there now, man. Is it really? Where is it? Is that Burbank? No, it's like
*  Hawthorne. Yeah, Hawthorne. Right by the Hawthorne Airport. They just see this. You take a right and
*  see this huge spaceship SpaceX and this dope building. We were talking about Neuralink a lot
*  yesterday. You're talking about what? Neuralink. What's that? They're going to drill a fucking
*  one inch diameter hole in your head and insert some thing with these little wires. They're
*  going to go about two millimeters into your brain and they're going to juice up your fucking noggin.
*  So it's just everybody's smart as fuck. That's how it's going to work. So you just have a computer
*  in your brain. Oh, yeah. You're going to be smart as fuck. And he goes, Elon doesn't need that. This
*  is what Elon said. You're not going to have to talk anymore. Not going to have to talk anymore.
*  One day. No need to talk anymore. What are we going to communicate through our brains? Oh,
*  God, I don't want to tune into each other with the universal language. Oh, we're going to be robots.
*  Oh, you mean be robots, Elon. I don't want that. Elon, don't create this shit, dude. Aliens. We're
*  going to become aliens. That's it. Look, the one thing he said when we're talking about
*  artificial intelligence, it was like, if you can't beat them, join them. Look, that's what it's going
*  to look like. A hole in your fucking head, bro. That's what it sounds like. Who's signing up for that first?
*  Me. No. First in line. Fuck it. Let's see. You get the shitty version. I'm tired of talking to people. I'm
*  going to put out podcasts just laying there and just thinking, and then you're going to receive it.
*  What a nightmare. What's the point? Well, the point of this, first of all, initially is to heal
*  injuries. He said we're going to be able to take people with spinal cord injuries, even quadriplegic.
*  CT? Yes. All those things, everything, brain damage, Alzheimer's. But the thing is about people that
*  are injured that can't move, you're basically going to have new things that move your muscles
*  where your spinal cord doesn't work anymore. And ultimately it'll work even better. I go, better.
*  He goes, yes, better. So it'll work better than your own fucking spinal cord and your own nerves.
*  So your reactions, your movement, sports are going to be insane. I don't want that world, man.
*  Who's got a catastrophic neck injury. And they go, we got good news and bad news. Bad news is you have
*  a catastrophic neck injury, you're paralyzed from the neck down. The good news is we're going to
*  install Neuralink and your body's going to work way better than it ever worked. You're just going
*  to have to bypass the regular nerves with these synthetic nerves and we're going to install
*  everything. It's going to take about 16 hours on the operating table and you're going to get out
*  and you're going to be able to jump over buildings. Yeah. But you know that first version is going to
*  be like the cell phone. So it's going to be some blocky fucking, you know, like an asshole.
*  Nah, not for me, man. Not for you right now, but just like you don't want to carry that
*  brick that fucking homeboy had in Wall Street in your pocket. Remember the Michael Douglas brick?
*  Yes. I don't want that in your pocket. Hell no. I'm going to wait. That thing sucked. But look,
*  all those years later, look what we got. I know you're right. You're right, Doug. So nice. You're right.
*  That's what it's going to be. In the beginning, it's going to be some stupid thing. You got to
*  wear a football helmet everywhere, but you could see the moon. You can read people's minds,
*  but you have some fucking big bulky thing on your head, like a motorcycle helmet or something.
*  I'll probably be dead, but for my kids, it's going to be a weird one. No, no, I don't think you will
*  be. He's talking about five years. He's talking about the implementation of this stuff. Five years,
*  that thing's going to be like a jigillion dollars. I don't think it will be, man. Oh, wow. But I think
*  the thing that you have to worry about is the haves and the have-nots. There's never going to
*  be a bigger distinction between haves and have-nots to when you have this neural link that literally
*  turns you into a super cyborg and the people that are poor have no access to that. So he's like,
*  he was sort of saying, you're going to have access to so much more productivity. You're going to be
*  able to get so much more accomplished. You're never getting tired. It's going to be so different.
*  And he's creating this? He's making it. Why do you want to do this, Elon? I don't think he can help
*  himself. When you talk to the guy- Well, like you said, if you can't beat him, join him.
*  Well, I also think his brain is so different than our brains. When you're sitting there talking to
*  him, I think he's trying to talk to me the way I talk to a three-year-old. If a three-year-old's
*  trying to talk to me about a drawing they made, I'm like, oh, okay, cool. So is that a house?
*  That's the house right there? Oh, is that you? No, it's your daddy. Oh, okay. That's how I describe
*  on a daily basis. Just the worst, he's all- I'm always surprised that he talks to me. Whenever
*  I text him, I'm always surprised he texts me back. And then when I talk to- It's Elon Musk, dude.
*  When I'm sitting down with him, like- Whose idea was it for him to come on?
*  Well, he was tweeting a bunch of crazy shit about- Which I love.
*  Getting rid of his houses. Did he explain why he wants to get rid of his house?
*  Yeah, he said that it's an attack vector, the fact that he has so much possessions,
*  and he's so wealthy. People are, oh, you're a billionaire, you have so many things. He goes,
*  okay, I'll get rid of everything. I won't have anything. Then what? What do you say then?
*  We gotta have somewhere to live. He's gonna rent. He's gonna rent a house.
*  Quit listening to people, dude. You're a fucking billionaire. Become a supervillain.
*  Do your thing, dude. He was tweeting shit like Free America Now.
*  Yeah, I loved it. I loved it. I did too. Everybody's going nuts.
*  And people are mad at him. People were agreeing with him. And so I saw him, I guarantee you,
*  he probably wants- There's a lot to say.
*  Yeah, and he also wants an opportunity to express himself freely. There's not a lot of places where
*  he can just do that. And so I said- Oh, I love it.
*  I just send him a text. You ever want to come on and talk? I go, you have an open invitation.
*  What's he like? He goes, when would be good for you?
*  Does he write in code? No.
*  Really? Just normal? Normal text messages.
*  Wow. Wow.
*  He's a fun guy, man. I really enjoy his company.
*  Bet he didn't smoke weed this time. Nope. I told him we could leave the weed alone.
*  We drank. We had some whiskey. Oh, did he drink?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. He always drinks. Oh, wow.
*  Yeah. So we talked. It must be tough for him. Yeah, he's so smart.
*  The only reason why he didn't come in the day before yesterday is his kid was born.
*  Oh, that's right. Yeah, so he left the hospital,
*  went home, came right here. Gangster.
*  Always been a fan. Even when he didn't have hair, always a fan.
*  He's got those plugs, son. The come up. He's a guy beast now.
*  High level plugs. Elon Musk plugs, man.
*  He spent the good money. I don't get why Trump and LeBron don't
*  figure it out. Elon can. Yeah. Well, LeBron, first of all, just
*  shaved his head. Yes.
*  And Trump, first of all, just shaved your head.
*  You imagine Trump bald? He looked like Kingpin, dude.
*  I swear to God, if I could grow hair, I'd shave my head.
*  If you draw it like that, Jesse Stamos. Oh, come on.
*  I don't shave my head. Dude, I like the way I look. Bald.
*  You look cool. I do. I do like it.
*  I like the low maintenance of it. I used to have a hairdresser that I went to
*  for years and she's nice and I miss her. She's cut my hair.
*  We had good conversations. That's it. That's all I miss about having hair.
*  Yeah. Shampoo and also when it was-
*  You had a good set of hair on you, though, too, man.
*  Back in the early days. But that shit started going, son.
*  Yeah. And then the Propecia.
*  Propecia is not good for the pecker. Brian makes a difference.
*  He says he takes harder on it. I don't believe.
*  So hard. He said.
*  I believe. So hard.
*  Who knows with Brian? It's so hard.
*  It's so hard to figure out. You got to decipher it to the madness.
*  He's so funny. He's so crazy.
*  Brian is shaving his head too now. He's just taking it in steps.
*  That's what I told him. I go, do the full rogue. He's like, no, no, no.
*  I'm like, dude, it's a matter of time. Father time catch your hair.
*  He got it really short and now he's letting it grow a little longer.
*  It's going to grow out looking like shit. Father time is his barber.
*  Let it go. Buzz it down, baby.
*  Buzz it down, dude. Don't be scared.
*  People dig the short hair on Brian. It's so low maintenance.
*  That's what I like about being bald. Every four or five days, I take the clippers and I fucking-
*  I try to convince Jamie because Jamie can't get a haircut because there's no barber.
*  No, his shit looks nice right now. No, his shit looks flowing right now.
*  When you go outside, you got to put on sunscreen and shit.
*  Put a hat. You wear a hat everywhere you go, son.
*  That's a fair point. I didn't say it's maintenance.
*  I'm just saying it's the same maintenance. My hair was down to here.
*  My hair was down to here. And then I got on the trails.
*  I was like, I'm hot as fuck. You used to buzz down when you fought.
*  Oh yeah. You used to get crew cuts.
*  Because low maintenance. I was looking in the mirror,
*  fixing my- I'm like, what the fuck am I doing? And then shaved it.
*  Yeah. When you're fighting, you can't be thinking about-
*  I was thinking about shaving. I was trying to convince my son to shave it too.
*  Really?
*  And his mom's like, he's not shaving his head. He looks like a little Navy Seal and shaved.
*  It's cute as fuck. Dude, I got to convince him not to touch fucking rattlesnakes, man.
*  Oh yeah. He probably doesn't understand.
*  No, I kept showing him videos because I show him the videos- Before I show you guys,
*  I show him when I get home. I'm like, look, Papa saw another rattlesnake.
*  And he has this false confidence, right? He goes, I'm the fastest kid in the world.
*  I go, you're the fastest kid in the world. That confidence is going to help you when you get older.
*  But right now, he goes, I'm the fastest kid in the world. I go, you are fast,
*  but you're not faster than a snake. He goes, yes, I am, Papa. I go,
*  I'm telling you, you're not faster than a snake. I go, are you faster than me? He goes, yes. I go,
*  all right, well, let's say you're a little faster than me. We're not as fast as this.
*  And I'll play a video of a snake strike. I go, you're not that fast. He goes, then I fucking-
*  I chop it. I chop it. You don't chop it, dude. So I've been showing him just horrible-
*  Dynamite. Yeah. I show him horrible videos of snakes, horrible videos.
*  Oh, God. And it's just not getting through his head. So now I tell the lady who watches him
*  during the day, if I'm at work or his mom, if he goes outside, someone has to go first. If you're
*  a rattlesnake, you get him the fuck out of there. Because he thinks he's faster than it. Oh my God.
*  I'm the fastest boy in the world. All right, dude. All right, dude.
*  You got to admire the confidence. I know. It's going to pay off when he's older if he gets in
*  sports. But right now, it's a problem. As long as he doesn't get bit first.
*  Oh, dude. Nightmare. Oh my God. I guess there's rattlesnake socks you can buy. People have been
*  sending me like, there's these socks you can buy where the snake can't get through it.
*  Huh. It must be Kevlar. I have no idea, but I should probably get a pair.
*  It's got to be the same material they use for knife-proof vests and shit like that.
*  Dude, I'm going mountain biking with this guy, Joe. He's a specialized pro. And me and him go on
*  the trails. And that's why I've been training so hard. Cause I know I'm going to go with him. So
*  I want to try and see where I'm at up to this pro guy. She's pretty nuts. So you're training.
*  I'm training. Yeah. I go to sleep. But if I go to sleep at night, I'll go through the trail in my
*  head. Just like when I was fighting, I go through it in my head. I'm obsessed with it, man. Mountain
*  biking. Nuts, right? How did that happen? The quarantine.
*  That big a glacier downhill thing. Yes. Yes. Where's that? It's in like France. You go to the top of
*  a glacier and you go all the way down. That's the thing we've seen a few times where everybody
*  crashes. Oh, that looks terrifying. That's the one where you go over that ridge and to the left and
*  to the right is death. That's a different thing. That's just fun. That's just fun trails.
*  What's weird about me is I like to suffer a little. I like going up the hills, man. I like
*  when it's steep as fuck and I have to, and sometimes my quads will get so pumped of blood,
*  I have to get off and walk. And there's, I have this weird trigger mirror. I'm like, fuck yeah,
*  dude. And the sun's being down me. It might be a rattlesnake. I'm just like, oh fuck,
*  I'm going. I just love it. Well, it's no pounding too. That's the great thing is you're getting
*  cardio without beating the fuck out of your joints. I'm getting, I'm getting lean, dude. I'm losing
*  weight on it. Nice. Doing this every day. Every day. How many miles? Today I did 24 miles. Wow.
*  Yeah. Dude, that's real. Oh dude, it's the fuck. What do you do when you get a flat? You're 24
*  miles out. You fix it. You can fix it. Some of these are, some of these are tubeless, but I'm
*  not a fix it. Really? Yeah. Tubeless. Tubeless. Tubeless tires. So where, where if they get a
*  flat, there's a, there's a liquid in that fills the hole, but sometimes it's too bad. Where like
*  at my chains broke, I can fix it. You fixed a chain? Fix my chain. When you go in and do this,
*  I don't even know you anymore. I know it's weird. Chains. Like when you, when you first got into
*  hunting, weren't you obsessed with it? Yes. That's how I am right now with biking. It's,
*  it's weird, dude. That's interesting. It's very, and like the, the thick boy bike club,
*  is a joke at first, but then all these people just started bike, I'm getting, I mean, hundreds
*  and thousands of messages of people on their bikes. I was like, we had a real fucking club here.
*  You should do it like, you know, Kevin Hart does those things where he has like these races.
*  That's what I'm doing. Everybody gets together and have a five K run. That's what I'm doing, Joe.
*  Where's the thick boy bike club going to meet? Well, when I, once we go back to normal, every
*  city I go into that Saturday, we're meeting at their top trail. Come on. That's what I'm doing,
*  dude. So you're going to do a Kevin Hart. I'm doing a Kevin Hart, but with bikes.
*  I like it. I like it. Cause everyone can, everyone can relate to, you know, bikes.
*  People are going to fall and break their fucking necks right in front of them. Not my insurance.
*  That's why, that's why you can't charge them to be part of it. Oh, right. Then it's like,
*  Hey, we met here. It's thick boy bike club, but yeah, you're on your own. We're all riding together,
*  man. No liability. Wow. I like it. Hey man, it's a great activity for cardio.
*  And the biking community is so positive. I have so many people reaching out to me,
*  specialized, you know, all these people just reaching out. It's nuts, dude. Wow. It's insane.
*  It's one of the best things to happen out of this quarantine. I'm like, holy fuck. When I say I love
*  it, man, literally I close my eyes the night before I go through the entire trail. What does
*  Callan think about all this? He's like, well, I'll post bikes all the time. He'll be like,
*  get on the go, please quit posting your bike.
*  Why does he get upset by it? I think he's just fucking around, but he just, I don't know,
*  you know, Callan. Bro, we got to move him out of Venice. Who's telling me about the homeless
*  problem he's got near his place? His place is dope, man. You know, I grew up in Vest in the,
*  in the summer. So Venice is in my heart, man. I love Venice, but there's always been a bum problem.
*  We went to Felix, that fucking dope restaurant on Abbott Kinney. Love that place. And as we're
*  passing this, on the left is a beautiful house, probably a $5 million house. At least right in
*  front of it. There's 10 tents. I was like, this is crazy. This guy's literally across the street
*  from a homeless encampment. And he's got this gorgeous house. The tough thing is, again,
*  I love Venice when my favorite place on earth, if not my favorite. The problem is, do you want
*  to raise a family? Like, I don't want my son being around that, you know? It's just, there's so much
*  homelessness. It's weird. And Brian sent us that article about how there's, it's essentially just
*  devastating real estate prices. And then they don't know what to do. Like people have no idea
*  what to do or how to fix it. There's, I don't know what it's only growing. I know now that I'm so into
*  biking, I'm only going to live in either Palisades, Malibu or Woodland Hills where we're at. So,
*  because the mountain's there. So when I go over, I go to Palisades, Malibu or I'm in Woodland Hills,
*  Calabasas. I'm only living there. Those are great choices, especially Malibu. The air over there is
*  fantastic. You get in that ocean air, no smog. It just blows right from the ocean. Cigurro's my
*  neighbor. Cigurro moved over there. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, he loves it. He loves it. It's a great place to live in
*  terms of like air quality and, you know, it's nice, nice places. Great places, dude. You can surf,
*  bike ride. My kid goes to school over there, so I gotta figure it out. Might be the move. Yeah.
*  I love where we're at though, man. Yeah. Well, you know, I mean, California is good in terms of
*  weather. There's a lot of great people here. We have a lot of great friends here, but-
*  Best restaurants, best comedy club. Best comedy club. Two best comedy clubs. Yeah. La Jolla and
*  the store in Hollywood. Yeah. The best comedy club in the world. And the improv's great too.
*  I love the improv. And I love the ice house. Ice house ain't bound. Yeah, ice house is killing it.
*  The real question is what's everything gonna be like when everything reopens and what happens
*  if we get a second wave, if we get locked down again, if this governor thinks he can lock
*  everything down again, even after we've shown, look, if the statistics come out and what Elon
*  said was true, that the death rate when it appears to be is far lower than anybody anticipated,
*  if this guy still thinks they're gonna lock everything down again in a few months, if we
*  get a second wave, he can eat shit. People aren't gonna put up with it, man. People are gonna leave.
*  They're gonna leave the state. They're leaving already. People aren't gonna put up with it.
*  Yeah, they're gonna leave, but I also just think they're not gonna put up with it.
*  Well, it can be very bad for him politically if he continues to go down this route because it's
*  devastating to the economy. You gotta give people the ability to make their own decisions. Yeah.
*  And I like when people are revolting against it. I don't know what it is. I'm getting old. There's
*  something about that. I'm like, fuck yeah, dude. And where they're revolting is all the Republican
*  areas. And it makes sense. It's all Newport Beach. But it also makes sense. Yeah. Oh, you're talking
*  about the areas he wanted to shut down. Yeah, he did. Is that not weird? It is weird. San Diego,
*  you guys Ventura stay open, Democrat, Democrat, but Republican Beach is shut down. What the fuck
*  are you doing, dude? What is that? And then those people at the beach went, not happening. Why do
*  you think he did that? You think he did that politically because they are a Republican town?
*  Has to have. Why else would you do it? So gross if that's what he did. It's just discussed.
*  Politics are disgusting in general. It is really a foul, the most foul. It's so greasy. Yeah. When
*  we can read each other's minds, we won't need those cunts. Nope. We really won't. Just there
*  should be established rules that we all follow. What you need is that you need the military. You
*  need someone to watch over the military to see that they don't fucking go out of control and try
*  to take over like China. You've always said it best. You need a committee. Yeah. Put Elon Musk on
*  that fucking committee. I need a guy who can read stats. Put Elon on there. You need a large group
*  of people, not one person. And they need to be, they need to have exhibited the fact that they're
*  objective and reasonable and ethical and moral. You can't just have a popularity contest. No,
*  it's nuts. It's just too stupid. Yeah. But if we're, if there's going to be like an uprising and,
*  you know, cases and if they shut down again, I would probably have to leave.
*  Where would you go? Would you go to Texas? I think, I think all of us should talk. Yeah. I
*  think all of us should talk. Everybody has money. We should all talk, go to one place and go to that
*  comedy club and fucking rock that house. That would be every fucking night. That'd be crazy.
*  And we still all do podcasts and we're guests on each other's shows.
*  I'm down. I'm a hundred percent down. Yeah. Let me check with Callan. Yeah, he's down. If there's an
*  earthquake, that's when everyone's really going to understand that we're in a bad spot. Yeah. Well,
*  taxes should help you understand you in a bad spot.
*  Dude, the taxes are insane. They are crazy. It is crazy. But you get what you pay for. Right. Well,
*  that's what so many people move to Nevada. You know, Nevada gets 60,000 people a year from
*  California. Yeah. Denver got a shitload of them too. 60,000 is a large number. It's a lot. 60,000
*  people moving in Nevada every year. And that's what Dana and I were talking about. The political
*  atmosphere of Nevada and that their governor is a Democrat in a lot of the reasons why they used to
*  be really a red state and they're not anymore. And a lot of reasons why are all the people that
*  are pumping in from California. Interesting. Yeah. But they don't have state taxes. So it's a great
*  place to try to save some money. Would you live in Nevada? I don't think so. I'd rather go to Texas
*  or Florida without those state taxes. Yeah. I wouldn't mind Reno. I wouldn't mind like living
*  in Tahoe up in the mountains areas. Yeah, I need mountains dude. Mountain biker.
*  But Vegas. Vegas is tough. I hate Vegas. I don't want to live inside the devil's balls.
*  I just, I don't know what it, I mean, we could perform there. I don't know.
*  I love your idea of doing residency in LA. You do it, not me. You do it. Yes. It's a brilliant idea.
*  That's the solution to travel. I don't tell people where I am. You can do it though. Yeah.
*  Like the, like a decent sized theater, like the Lager or something like that.
*  Yeah. Something around 500 seats. Every Friday. Every Friday. Saturday night. Yeah.
*  It's possible. Just think of all the shows you do at the economy store and at the improv. Yeah.
*  Think of me, you go through the tickets. That's a lot of people. Yeah. Thousands. Yeah. Every
*  week, dude. Yep. Hey, who's, who's not going to fly to LA to see Rogan do the Lager every Friday?
*  Yeah. I'm kind of already doing it, right? I'm already doing it. You're doing it. Doing it at
*  the comedy store and the improv when everything was up and running. But yeah, I would do something
*  like that. And it's not a bad idea. And maybe like do that and then tour occasionally. Yeah.
*  And when I tour, like I'm touring once a month, you know, but I have a lot of dates coming up and
*  I don't look, I have dates coming up in October and I don't even know if I'm going to be able to do
*  them. You know, like I've got a Madison square gardens almost sold out. Boston garden almost
*  sold out. You're doing mass square garden. I don't know about that. I bet you are. October 3rd. I
*  bet you bro. It's 18,000 people. If you got 18,000 people, what are the rules? Do you have to have
*  only 9,000 people? You have to everybody is like the, you have to have the M what Ray Romano used
*  to have the I'm not a homo joke about going to the theater with your buddy. You have to have a seat
*  in between the two of you. The I'm not a homo seat, but think how fast, you know, we talked all the
*  shit about open up, but think how fast things are moving now. Yeah. Think about July. Yeah. But
*  the summer's real bad. New York city still, and you know what the other thing about the decline
*  though? Yeah, it is on the clown, but I'm worried about New York in terms of people moving out of
*  New York. I think people are going to realize how preposterous it is to be stacked on top of insane.
*  If you haven't figured out yet, I mean, this is going to be a big wake up call for them because
*  you said it's an October. Yes. New York in August, dude. Things will be booming. I hope
*  Trump's gonna be pumping fucking money. That's 10 months from now though.
*  This shit just started two months ago, but think how fast it's rolling, dude.
*  Is it? Things are kind of rolling. They're rolling now for the last month and a half,
*  but states are ahead of us. Remember New some's a goddamn cocksucker. So he's holding things back,
*  but other states are rolling. Start dropping like flies in two weeks in Atlanta. We're going to have
*  a real problem. You can't always shut up. If smoke getting gets one more death, your boy's probably
*  not coming up there. There's going to be places we're going to be allowed to go for sure. But
*  there's going to be, but I get messaged every day, dude, spoken ticket sales, but I'm like,
*  I haven't promoted it. I haven't started promoting it. Cause I'm like, I don't know, man. Yeah.
*  Let's meet our first stick boys bike club get together that Saturday morning. So you're going
*  to do that every time every city I go to, you don't think you're going to get bored with this
*  biking shit. No, I don't think so. I'm obsessed with it, but there's some gotta be some places
*  don't even have bike trails. Well, like Florida probably going to pass. You're going to get bit
*  by alligator. A hundred percent. New Orleans probably pass. Yeah. Dopey lady in was it
*  Louisiana? She got bit by an alligator. She was trying to take a picture with it. Just like,
*  Oh no. I'm going to get closer to him. And the alligator ate her. It just ate her. Is it on,
*  it's on camera. I can't get enough of that. It's on camera, but you know, it's pretty rare
*  than an alligator attacks and kills a person. People think I'm closer to those rattlesnakes
*  when I post a picture of them, but, or the video of them, but I zoom in, I'm actually a good,
*  my bike's always between me and the rattlesnake usually. It's just run over his head,
*  flatten it out, hold onto it. Yeah. But then I saw someone sent me a video of a guy running over
*  one and it, you know, even though I ran over it, it's so big it turned back and bit his fucking
*  calf. Really? Yeah. Even though it was like, Oh, bit his ass. Oh, I could see that happen. Yes.
*  Yeah. Some boys are thick. They, they flex, they flex all that muscle. And then he probably tried
*  to be a pussy and run over the back of it. No, you gotta go head first. You gotta go head first.
*  That fucking head crushes fucking heads. It's weird how dark they are, man.
*  Wow, man. They're a dangerous creature. Have you ever seen one dragon, a rabbit?
*  It's nuts. They're monsters. Mike, it's not good. It's a night. How old is he? Like four,
*  four. And I'm the fast boy in the world. Yeah, dude. You keep saying that man. And he is,
*  he's the fast four year old you've ever seen before. Four year olds aren't rattlesnakes, dude.
*  It's hilarious. He's these big old calves he got from his mama. He's all shredded. It's hilarious.
*  Fast boy in the world. All right, man. Some kids are just jacked when they're young and you realize
*  that life isn't fair. You look at some kids and they look like they're literally made out of
*  marshmallows, like marshmallows covered by a thin. It's a bummer. Thin skin. It's a bummer. Like,
*  did you see that, that five year old that stole the car to go buy a Lamborghini?
*  What? This five year old stole the car. And when you see him, you're like, well,
*  that's the biggest five year old in the world. He's probably, I don't know, a hundred. He's so fat.
*  Look at him. They put a weird thing over his face. Oh, so you can't see him, but there's video of
*  his family talking. They're all thick as fuck. And he stole this car because his mom told me he
*  can't have a Lamborghini. Five year old driving SUV on a Utah freeway. And then he goes, I'm going
*  to California to buy a Lamborghini. And they go, how much money do you have? He goes, I have $3
*  in my wallet. So look at this. They spotted the vehicle driving 35 miles an hour and swerving.
*  This five year old is just driving on the highway. That's an, what a confident kid. He pulled over
*  and not bad and not bad for a five year old. And he's got his foot on the brakes. Just how crazy,
*  how old are you? Five. You're five years old. Wow. His sister fell asleep while she's babysitting.
*  No. So he just stole a car. Yeah. Cause I guess before his mom left to work, he's like, can I have
*  a Lamborghini? She's like, what are you at your fucking mind? No. He's like, I had three dollars
*  with him and he was going to buy a Lamborghini. This is like a Will Ferrell movie. It's insane,
*  but not bad for a five year old. Did you see that big baby too, that meme that was going around
*  with this gigantic baby. It's about three years old, I think. What? Yeah. Look at that thing.
*  Yeah. He looks creepy as shit. That's a weird, that's like a adult pretending to be a weird kid.
*  God damn it. It is thick. Jesus Christ. Yeah. Giant, those giant babies never really ends well
*  for him. Does it? It doesn't end well for giants. Mom of big baby tells haters he's actually healthy.
*  It was started going around during the NFL draft. They're just like, this is the next NFL line.
*  It might be a giant. It might be. Did you see all that shit where Adele was getting crap for losing
*  weight? People are mad. She was giving her shit for losing weight. Fat girls. Of course. How dare
*  you girl? You used to be a representative of us fat fucks. That's what's going on. Plus size models.
*  Oh God. They're saying that this shouldn't be, that this shouldn't define beauty standards
*  and that losing weight and being thin shouldn't be what we look to for beauty standards. You know how
*  fucking crazy that is? You mean Adele got healthy and you fat fucks want to stuff your face with
*  pizza and get COVID and blame it on us? They also want to pretend they're so beautiful.
*  It's crazy. Even though they're some chubby chasers like that. They can sloppy. Ah, fuck dude.
*  That the hate on Adele for being disciplined, finally getting her shit together, quitting
*  fish and chips. I want that plus size model thing to carry over to men. I'm waiting for men to
*  decide that these abs and six packs and ripped muscles and this is just not cool. And beauty
*  standards. This is, this is how good I look. I look good with a gut. I don't think that's ever
*  going to happen. It's not going to happen. Not only that, there'd be no support. There'd be no,
*  you go boy. Start that club. There's a lot of fat girls that get you go girl. You are beautiful.
*  You're beautiful. You're so courageous. You're so brave. You're so amazing. Don't worry. Guys
*  aren't like that. They're wrong. They're wrong. Guys aren't like that. The way they're, they're
*  picking on you. Yeah. That's Thor from when that Marvel comics, when he drank a lot of beer. Yeah.
*  He lost that way real quick in that scene though. Remember a couple scenes later, he's thin again.
*  Did you see that new movie he was in on Netflix? No. Good. Andy stump said it fucking sucked. And
*  he said, uh, it is so unrealistic. Like, cause you know, Andy's a legitimate seal. He said it's a
*  a hundred percent horse shit. Although Andy likes fast and furious shot and lives through it.
*  Would you like fast and furious Andy? He's not a street race car driver. Yeah, but that's shit.
*  Yeah. They're jumping are all right from building to building Andy. And then you got the rock holding
*  the helicopter by a chain, but then this isn't real. That's why you don't enjoy it. What's his
*  business? Oh, come on, dude. I get it a little bit. I'll watch fight moves. Make out. Get the fuck.
*  Like if you saw a warrior, watch Rocky. How about warrior though? That stupid movie that Calum was
*  in. I fight two days in a row. I don't want to watch it. It makes you mad when they fight two days
*  in a row. I'm like, Hey, Hey, Hey, did you ever talk to a guy a day after he had a fucking gauge
*  fight? Your head looks like a watermelon. Everything's sore. You barely can walk. The
*  idea that you're going to fight two days in a row is so stupid. That's Hollywood shit. It's such
*  Hollywood shit. They think they're smarter than everybody. They're going to rewrite things and
*  for dramatic. With uncut gender talking about earlier, there's like three big plot points.
*  Shut the fuck up. Three big plot points that people say aren't real. Please don't ruin it for me.
*  I'm going to watch it. Please. It's still a great movie. Please stop. Please. It's a fantastic movie.
*  Don't ruin it. I know you hate other sports. You got to watch the last dance on the ESPN.
*  Jamie was talking about that too. I know you don't like sports. Just from the sheer,
*  because it doesn't really get into the X's and O's of basketball, just from a sheer
*  greatness of Michael Jordan. You're like, Holy fuck, dude. It's insane. It's insane.
*  Yeah. He was a madman. He was a madman. Straight up madman. Punched dudes at Steve Kerr in the face,
*  gambling addict. When they're in the Olympics, they're practicing and all the best guys were
*  on one team. He was on one team with the B side and they got up by six and someone talked shit to
*  him. He's like, excuse me. And then took over and they're like, Holy fuck. But they said he was
*  nasty about it. He's just the ultimate winner. You watch that, you're like, this is insane, dude.
*  And then just the pressure, he hated the negative because he came out, he was a gambling guy.
*  And so all the negativity got. And one of the reasons he retired from that negativity,
*  you're like, oh dude, if you thought that was negative, think about the players now
*  dealing with social media. Oh yeah. That's one of the reasons why people respect LeBron James so
*  much in comparison. He's dealing with the worst aspects of social media. Social media in its height,
*  still gets it done. Think about John Jones. Think about all the shit John gets, right? He brings it
*  on himself. Yeah. You don't give a fuck. He'll get arrested, right? Whatever shooting, whatever gun
*  he's shooting and he's like hanging out with bums at four in the morning. Next day, what's up everybody
*  shooting arrows. Don't give a fuck. See you may, whatever his fight is. It's like, all right, dude.
*  Well, he definitely bounces back easy. It's interesting. Like some people get devastated
*  by bad press. Some people just let it roll right off their back. John's a roll right off their
*  back guy. What else are you gonna do? Lay down? Because he's the creator of this madness, but he's
*  still just like, yeah dude, all right. Yeah. Well, he's a risk taker, but that's why he's such a great
*  fighter. And when you're a risk taker, you fuck up, make mistakes. Yeah, you're right. I mean,
*  that's part of what it is. I mean, I always point to the fact that the guy opened up that fight with
*  Shogun, youngest guy ever to win the title, opens up with a flying knee against a legend.
*  Not who does that? Well, I'll tell you what, not as nuts, but what is crazy is when you're fighting
*  Murko Krokop on the same card, I opened up with a head kick. That's right. And Murko went like this
*  and smiled at me. It was like, what the fuck are you doing? I was like, yeah, you're right. That's
*  disrespectful. Well, you won though. Yeah, I did win. That's after Murko. You knocked him out. Dude,
*  am I crazy? Yeah, my biggest win. Am I crazy to think Dominic Cruz can beat Henry Cejudo on decision?
*  Yeah. Dominic Cruz is a legitimate bantamweight. Henry Cejudo beat Marlon Marais, but Marlon Marais,
*  it seemed like kind of fell apart, got tired and fell apart. He broke him. Dominic Cruz,
*  we haven't seen in a long time. He doesn't get hit really. I mean, Cody Garbrandt fight, but...
*  Yeah, but he got real emotional with the Cody Garbrandt fight. We don't know where he's at
*  physically. He just got off another surgery. He's 36, 37 now, which is old for a 135 pound fighter.
*  Very old. But, you know, he's a guy who's a fucking... His movement, dude. He's a winner, man.
*  And Henry Cejudo starts slow. I see him getting down in rounds to Dominic. Dominic's impossible
*  to hit, man. And his movement is pretty substantial. The best. It's a big factor. It's so weird too.
*  It's awkward. His wrestling style is switching the feet. If it's Dom in kind of that fashion,
*  I don't know, man. It's a tough fight for Henry Cejudo. Well, Dominic Cruz is a tough fight for
*  everybody. He's not an easy fight for anybody. And also, you know, I mean, he's got to realize
*  there's not a whole lot more opportunities left. Now that he's aged... If he wins this one, there are.
*  But if he loses it, it's kind of like... Yeah, if he loses it, it's over. Just being an analyst for
*  a little bit. Well, he's great at that. The best. Yeah. One of the best. Yeah, he's for sure one of
*  my favorites. My favorites, you, Anik, and DC though. Well, me and DC have a fun time, man.
*  We get silly. Well, DC's one of the guys. Yeah. DC's like us. Yeah. Yeah. DC texted me the other day.
*  He's like one of the guys. Yeah. He gets silly. He's getting mad waiting around for Stipe, you know,
*  but I think... I think he's a disservice to DC. I love Stipe and he has the eye issue and he's
*  talking about, I can get in a cage. Well, guys are figuring out. It's like, dude, if you're not
*  going to fight, then we got to figure something out because the heavyweight division... I think the UFC gave him
*  some sort of an ultimatum. I would imagine. That's what he said. Oh, did he? Yeah. Yeah. There was an
*  article about it today where there's some sort of a discussion. Well, what I don't want is Stipe to
*  come back too soon when he's not ready and lose that fight and then, you know, ruin a little bit
*  of his legacy. Yeah. Dude, wait it out. Get that eye better. Let these guys do their thing. Then
*  he come back. Yeah. I don't know if Stipe's ever going to be able to fight again and maybe he
*  shouldn't, you know, the eye... It's not worth it. He's a great. Yeah. Whatever he does, he's still great.
*  He got poked quite a bit in that first fight. I rewatched that first fight. He got poked bad in the
*  eyes. The first fight with DC. I don't know if that's where the eye injury came from, but it could
*  have been. God, I don't see DC jumping onto bed to fight Francis. Fuck that. I think if Stipe backs
*  off and says, I'm done, you know, my eyes are too precious, I think DC retires. Agree. Unless they
*  come up with some sort of wild 205 pound fight for him that allows him to make that cut again. Dude,
*  and then how long is Francis going to reign as the champion? Who knows? And then John goes up there.
*  What if Rosenstrike wins? Yeah, you're talking malarkey right now. Am I? No, I'm just kidding.
*  What do you think the odds are? He could easily. What do you think the odds of that fight are?
*  I would say look at it. One three to one three to one because they're basing off the over in fight,
*  which is a bad idea to do in the first place. But remember, they set lines to get movement.
*  They want you to bet on them. Yeah, I would say three to one.
*  Because they're basing off the over in fight. We're talking about two different game plans,
*  which MMA math and MMA betting is insane. Insane. I have no idea what that guy's feeling that night.
*  Like, like, Soroni to, you know, to the point we all, I think in the media, especially MMA media,
*  we all went two to one, two to one, one underdog and a three to one favorite. Oh, there you go.
*  There you go. We all went pretty hard on Stephen A Smith. Remember, like you went hard on him. I
*  went hard on him. We were like, dude, shut the fuck up. What are you talking about with Don Soroni?
*  And then Donald comes out. I was like, just wasn't there that night. Yeah, but he always says that
*  when he loses, you know, I think Donald gets real nervous. And I think it's always been an issue for
*  him, though. It was a big event. And I think the overwhelming pressure of those big events was bad.
*  And the Pettis fight is bad. And the Hufflepuff, Sanjo's fight, right when he gets to that,
*  yeah, he gets a tippity tippity top where it's the chance of a lifetime. And so was Stephen A
*  Smith right? No, because he didn't quit. He got fucked up. I mean, it wasn't did he say Cowboy
*  was nervous as fuck? Yeah, I thought he said he didn't show up, which is a fair assessment,
*  even though he's not from the sport, which is insane to say, but he's a hot take guy.
*  So him saying he didn't show up is like, and then Cowboy goes, I didn't show up like, all right,
*  little. And he asked for an apology from everybody in the MMA community. It's the way Stephen A
*  Smith did. Please. It's the way he said it. It's the disrespect. Yeah. Because you're not from the sport.
*  Right. And he's talking about it the same way you would talk about someone who misses a free throw.
*  It's not the same thing. Yeah. His connotation is just, it didn't vibe well with the actual fight fans.
*  But they brought him in to do Stephen A Smith stuff. That's why he's famous. Yeah. I mean,
*  that's why he's, he's popular because he makes those bold statements. So he makes $9 million
*  a year for Miss PN or whatever the fuck it is. Yeah. That's why. Then he comes over to our sport.
*  It's the same thing. It was like, how dare you? This sport, it requires a different perspective.
*  It also is a sport that they know if you're a real fan, they don't want regular sports guys.
*  They don't want that. Jumping over here. You can be a regular sports guy, but you've got to be a
*  real fan of the actual sport. You've got to be pretty hardcore to get in the game. Yeah. That's
*  what they prefer because there's enough people out there that are talking about it on a regular
*  basis that are hardcore fans of it that are really good at it, like Luke Thomas. Guys that are hardcore
*  fans of it, but that have real objective takes where they're analyzing it from a perspective
*  of knowledge. Oh dude, I love Luke, right? He's part of the Showtime family. I love his YouTube
*  show. He's one of my favorites. Yeah. It's very good. I love Luke. Me and Luke do a show before
*  big fights. We didn't do it this time, but he's on such the other spectrum when it comes to COVID.
*  He's so terrified of things. The worst thing ever. We shut down everything and obviously I'm all the
*  way the fuck over here. So we did the show before I'm like, dude, let's not, let's not do the COVID
*  thing, but you can't help but pop up. So it was just one of those things. What does he think?
*  He just thinks it's like we shouldn't, like the UFC having a fight is insane. I don't know where
*  he's at now. I don't want to misquote him. I know before when they're going to put the one on
*  California, he was like, absolutely not. Any other sport would be shit on, but the MMI media doesn't
*  care. The media doesn't care about the UFC. They shouldn't be doing this. I think they should be
*  doing it. I think they should have had the fight in California if Newsom's bitch ass didn't come
*  in and stop it. But without, you know, with precautions, why is it such a big deal? I don't
*  know. I don't want to misquote Luke. They're testing everybody. Let me tell you what happened
*  to me. I had to get a nose swab, which is weird, weird, man. Doesn't feel terrible having one in
*  your nose. They dig around there and then they pull it out. I mean, like gets way up to the top of
*  your nose. It feels weird because it doesn't, it's irritating, but it stays irritating for a long
*  time. It stays irritating for like 15 minutes after it's over. Is that better than the prick?
*  Oh, the prick's nothing. You don't even feel a prick. No, I'm saying I did the prick, but it's
*  nothing. But is it the testing better? It's more. No, it's active. It's the active bacteria, the
*  active virus rather. Whereas the other one is just testing the antibodies. And the other one, they
*  can tell whether or not you have a current infection or you recovered from an infection. But this is
*  like, are you sick with it right now? So I did that and it was negative. My antibodies were
*  negative. Everything's negative. I don't have it, but you could do that with everybody. These aren't,
*  it's not these. And the USC is doing that though. Right. This is the thing. It's not like these tests
*  are hard to get anymore. Right. There was a point in time in the beginning of this outbreak, two
*  months ago, where it was very difficult to get these tests. Now it's not. You get these tests,
*  you get the results back fairly quickly, very quickly, 15 minutes for the antibody test.
*  It takes a day or so with the no swab. You can test everybody. So you test everybody. Why is that
*  hard? If everybody's negative, let them fight. It's not, if you're talking about healthy people,
*  that's irresponsible, it's foolishness. It's not even irresponsible to let them play basketball.
*  Because even if they had the COVID, these fucking guys aren't even showing any symptoms. Exactly.
*  Dude, how about baseball? Them motherfuckers are, you know how far apart baseball players are?
*  Far. Get back to work MLB. You know how far away they are from each other? Yes. Get back to work.
*  Damn it. Yeah. Listen, it's not what everybody thought it was going to be. Everybody thought
*  it was going to be like the Spanish flu or the fucking black plague. It's not. That's what we
*  thought. How about Dana said reporters called in and complained to the newsome, to the government.
*  And that's why it got shut down. Reporters. That's the word. And he has a list. Am I right on that,
*  Jamie? I heard that. I'll sort of do a check the quote. These fucking haters are like, how can you
*  do this? And called in and the newsome was like, how can we do this? And then that's why it got
*  stopped. So that's why he said pussy, the pussy media, you know, I'd love to hear that list.
*  I wonder, see, but the perspective of the, of the people back then a month ago was different.
*  The public's perspective, the information, the more the information comes in, the better things
*  look, you know, the, the worst it looks if you're a family, someone in your family died or your
*  grandma died or something. I understand that, but the more the data comes in, the more it looks like
*  it's not nearly as deadly. You can open your eyes. Not only willing to take the information in though,
*  as many as 70% of the people that get it are asymptomatic, which is just bonkers. Right. And
*  then the young healthy people, it's off the charts, but just people in general, there's something that's
*  like 98.7. Yeah. Like people that are just fine. Yeah. Yeah. It's weird. It's a weird disease.
*  Take my chances. Yeah. But I'm pretty sure Dana was saying he has the list of those fucks who called
*  in and what's he going to do about that? Probably set him on fire. I don't know. Every does with
*  people. It's making a lot of block them on Instagram. It's going to find out. I can't believe
*  he blocked me. I got the fuck dude. I'll try to talk to him this weekend. Come on. I'll block me,
*  baby. I got a request. Selling pay-per-views over here like a motherfucker for you, man.
*  I know you are right. That's what's crazy. Yeah. But the thing is, I go hard in the pain on it.
*  They can't control you. You're too independent. I know, but it's a good thing. Cause I know,
*  but, but the show, especially see when you and him started tangling, your show was not nearly
*  as successful as it was now, as it is now, which is really kind of funny because if he had just
*  like buried the hatchet with you back then, you would be an ally. It'd be helpful. He could come
*  on the show. You guys could all pump up the pay-per-view. It'd be great for everybody.
*  You guys are getting millions of views. It's a different world now. Like now the show is
*  bigger than anything that's on ESPN. By far. And they don't even. Bigger than anything UFC has.
*  Combine all their shows. I beat all of them and yet I still ride or die for them.
*  Give your boy a boat over here, man. It's from be friends again. And the show keeps growing.
*  That's a growing crazier. See when you don't have a connection to a network,
*  like it's basically a meritocracy. Like if the show's good, people tune in and more people tune
*  in the more fun, the more they like it, the more they enjoy it, the bigger it gets more realness.
*  Yeah. And where it's not overproduced and someone's in your air and you got to have an agenda.
*  Someone's censoring you. Someone's holding you back and slowing you down and take it easy.
*  Shob. You got to stop calling girls bitches. You got to, but I mean it in a good way.
*  Yeah, it's a good thing. I know it's a bad bitch. Dime piece. Can't say it.
*  Speaking of which is Rachel Ulstovich going to fight Paige Van Zandt?
*  How many people are going to be watching that fight with their pants off?
*  Jacking off this guy.
*  That's going to be the most pants off watched fight ever.
*  Yeah. And they're talking about it too. Like Paige had it on her that it's going to be the hottest
*  fight ever. Ever. Yeah. The two of them together and Rachel Ulstovich is wearing a fucking fur coat
*  in the stare down. Just two. Dime piece. Make that a pay-per-view main event.
*  I don't want Paige to lose any weight though. When she's all thick like that, she looks so much
*  better. She looks so much healthier. Did you see her husband? Dude, he tapped out boogie man. I was
*  super impressed. I sent him a message on Instagram. I'm like, dude, not only that, his fucking
*  explosive takedown defense or his submission defense was insane. The way he exploded out of
*  things. I was very impressed. That was Jail Soman's thing, right? Yes. Very impressed with his
*  submission though. The fact that he caught, look, boogie man is a real legit 10th planet jujitsu
*  black belt international competitor. It's all he does. Tapped out Sakuraba. Yeah, it's all he does
*  though. That's his profession. He's amazing. Austin Vanafford's an MMA fighter, former wrestler.
*  He's strong as fuck. He's posting Instagram pictures naked with his girl. I was like, all right,
*  let me go roll this dude up. What a stud. He's really strong. The nicest guy in the world. I bet
*  he is. The way he tapped him with that head and arm choke too, he was in half guard. He tapped quick
*  too. Must've been a lot of pressure. You know boogie man's not going to tap off bullshit. He's a gorilla
*  man. He's so strong. The way he threw him around too, I was so impressed at how he got out of that
*  arm bar. The way he explodes out of stuff, like really explosive. Stud. Really strong guy. Stud.
*  But the clamp down on that head and arm choke, and apparently according to Chael, Chael's the
*  one who's doing the commentary in the pay per view. He said that that's Austin's favorite.
*  It's go to. Is this submission underground? Yeah. The shit was super underground. Super. No one even
*  knew it was happening. We had no idea. Yeah. Seven people watched. Did you see Vinnie Magalhaes
*  refusing the tap though and Craig Jones snapped his ankle? Oh no, did he? Yeah, he broke his tibia.
*  Jesus Christ. His tibia or his fibula. One of his shin bones. Popped his shit? Broke. Snapped it.
*  Too much pride. But you could see the angle when he's got him in the heel hook and you could see
*  the angle that his leg is in where all the pressure's on it and then you see it go kind of
*  sideways and you're like that can't be good. And apparently they were talking. Well they were
*  talking. I watched the match and Chael's like what are they saying to each other? But Vinnie was
*  saying he broke my leg while they were still going. Holy fuck. Yeah. Yeah. He got it more than once
*  too. What a fucking stud. He grabbed that same leg more than once so he's grinding on it. He's
*  got this broken shin bone and then he's digging on it with another heel hook. I wonder how many
*  people watch that? Four. It was me and three other drunks. Three degenerates. I mean it's on UFC
*  Fight Pass. There it is. So he gets it and Craig Jones by the way, one of the very best grapplers
*  on the planet earth. Yes. So look and Vinnie was like I don't tap to heel hooks. I don't tap to
*  heel hooks. That's what he said. I don't tap to leg locks. So right there he got up. He got up weird too. Like his left leg is
*  shot right there. Watch again on Instagram. So he snapped that shit. So he's got it. It's a terrible
*  angle too. Like look at it right there. Oh fuck. So it's broken. So he broke the bottom of his shin
*  and that's really dangerous too because when you get a break like that you get infections.
*  You could lose the leg. It's really bad. Vinnie's such a stud. Oh he's an animal.
*  Vinnie's an animal. I mean he's basically all weight on his right leg. Think how much that dude's grown
*  since Ultimate Fighter? A lot. He got to the finals of that PFL million dollar thing. By the way Rory
*  went over to the PFL now. Kind of weird right? Yeah. It must have made him a big offer. Yeah.
*  Did Vinnie make it to the finals of Ultimate Fighter? Was it the finals? Maybe the finals. He got knocked out by Ryan Bader.
*  Good call dude. And then he went over to that PFL thing and he got knocked out by that dude that's a
*  sports broadcaster. He's a radio broadcaster. Yeah now he's doing that. Sean. He does the commercials for him too.
*  God damn it. He fought in the UFC. Really tough guy. Not Evans. Find out PFL. He knocked him out.
*  He was like you know what? He TKO'd him. He TKO'd him in the finals. Yeah. But Vinnie had success in PFL.
*  He just he had a research. He needed time. He needed time. The UFC there's no time dude. He needed to learn
*  how to really strike. You know he needed to really understand. UFC's impossible if he can't strike.
*  It's impossible. Especially these days it's fucking impossible. Sean O'Connell. Yeah there you go. He did
*  fight in the UFC. Didn't go well for him either. No. Shout out for him. Shout out for him. Well tough guy.
*  Really fucking tough guy. Didn't go bad for him in the UFC but you know he's you know he's another guy
*  that's sort of developing on the job. Dude the UFC posted a clip. They didn't tag me. Whatever. They posted
*  a clip from the Ultimate Fighter 10 when Kidbuk came in. Dude. He looks like a baby. I have so many good memories
*  from that. I've never watched it. I've never seen it since. God what a time. What a fucking
*  huge time for me man. Justin Ren with short hair. Yeah weird. Justin Ren. He had Roy in there. Yeah.
*  It was nuts. Such a good time. I hope they still do the Ultimate Fighter man. They are gonna do it again.
*  Yeah they've signed on. Not with Sal Beggar though. No. No. Just no. He's so funny on Instagram. It's hilarious.
*  I think it was Twitter where he said that. In an interview I saw he said Dana said that the
*  Ultimate Fighter is going to be at the Apex Center along with the fourth fight in two weeks on the
*  23rd which I don't think has been announced yet. Dude are we doing a fight comparing next week?
*  Oh yeah we should. Fuck yeah. What night? Is it Saturday night? Thursday and Saturday. Thursday and Saturday?
*  Pick your poison bros. Wow. 13th and 16th. What is that? Let's see the cards. Glover Teixeira
*  and your boy Anthony Smith. Ooh I like that. I love that fight. And then. That's interesting
*  Chael said that that's the guy who has the hardest time finding submission matches for
*  is Anthony Smith. I'm like that's weird. No. Yeah that's what he said. Yeah apparently Anthony Smith's
*  very very good on the ground. Glover Teixeira is fucking good on the ground. Go back to that please.
*  I've had to grapple. Yeah but just go back to what you got there. Okay so Walt Harris and
*  Alistair Overeem. That's Saturday. Smith Teixeira and then. Okay hey why does it say Smith Teixeira
*  Wednesday though? The 13th. I thought it was Thursday. 13th and 16th. I don't know. I mean
*  which one you want to do Joe? I don't know man. Let's look at the card. So look at Smith Teixeira.
*  They're all in Jacksonville. Dan Rothwell and Owen St. Prue. Owen St. Prue is going up to heavyweight
*  huh? He's asking me so fat. Interesting. Ph fat. Drew Dober Alexander Hernandez. I like that fight
*  a lot. Dude Drew Dober is a guy that people. He's a dog. He's a fucking dog. Denver Kid. Underlook
*  guy. He's a Denver Kid now. I was super impressed with him in his last fight. Alex Hernandez is no
*  joke man. That's a tough fight for Drew. Ray Borg and Ricky Simone. Shout out to Ray Borg. Ray Borg's
*  going up to 35 huh? Because Ricky Simone's a 35er right? Band weight. Unless Ricky Simone is going
*  down. Is Ricky going down? Is that band weight? It is a band weight. That's right. Carl Roberson's
*  another bad motherfucker. Ooh against Marvin Vittori. That's a good fight. That's the Italian
*  kid right? Yes and Roberson's super talented man. Arlovski. How dare you put him on the pre-lens.
*  Who's Felipe Linz? Who's that guy? They came to give him a picture. Probably some fucking monster
*  from Norway or some shit. Who's Michael Johnson fighting? Do you know that guy? I don't.
*  Sarai Eubanks. Remember poor Sarai Eubanks? She got the title shot everyone's shit on her and then
*  they took her off of it. Yeah. Brian Keller. Yeah they gave her a title shot and everybody went
*  alright. UFC said alright my bad. My bad. My bad. Take it off. Take it off. Interesting.
*  So that's a decent card. Is that the Wednesday card? Yeah that one's a card. We can learn about
*  QAnon. Yeah you're right. I can't let Eddie get drunk though. And spew some COVID shit. So this
*  is a better card. This is a Saturday night card. Okay you got Chito Vera. Marlon Vera versus
*  Sami Yadong. That's a good fight. Scroll up though. Eric Yaboy. Anderson versus Christoph Jokto. That's
*  a very good fight too. Claudia Gugdielga. Barboza versus Dan Ege. I love that. I want to see what
*  Barboza looks like at 45 and I do love that Claudia Gugdielga. I love that fight. Angela Hill fight.
*  That's a great fight. Overeem and Walt Harris. That should be fun. It's a better card. Alright
*  that's what we're going. We'll see what else they got there and this is the rest. Hold on.
*  Go to the top. Anthony Hernandez versus Kevin Holland. That's a very good fight.
*  Damn Courtney Kasey with the long face. Yes. Yes. Okay. Saturday nights it is. Saturday night.
*  Beautiful. Okay. Fight companion. Get the cigars. Bring in the fucking QAnon robes. What do they
*  wear? Colgino. What should we get for Eddie? You won't let him have any drinks. I'm not opposed to
*  him having a drink. There's something that happens when he clicks over and he gets those shark eyes.
*  It's like three drinks in. He's gone. It's insane. He takes over the show. It's hilarious. He doesn't
*  listen. No he just powers through it. Yeah. Well it's just drunk Eddie. There's two Eddies. Maybe
*  maybe just maybe just he doesn't get drunk. Maybe weed and wine. I think wine's a good one with him.
*  No that's. Whiskey brings out the fucking devil in him. Brings out the Indian that Joey Diaz has.
*  They ain't lying. Well yeah. I don't think Joey Diaz would leave the house but we should get him
*  on one. He's been here twice. Oh he will leave the house. Oh yeah he doesn't give a fuck. He's not
*  scared of coronavirus. Oh fuck. Yeah he's not scared of it. Love to see him. Yeah he's upset
*  by all this too though. He's ready to move. Joey will move with us. Yeah. Joey's in. I think Theo's
*  in. Where's Theo going? Wherever we go. He's in. Brian's in. Who else? Callum's ready to go. Callum
*  go for sure. Callum won't even leave Venice. It's a homeless invasion. If we all leave. There's zombies
*  on the street. If we all leave he has no one. He'll go with us. Really? Especially if I go find the
*  kids coming over here. Where what do you think about Utah? I like Utah. I'll just come here in
*  the summers. It's not a bad move. Or in the winter sorry. Not a bad move. I know not a bad move at all.
*  Utah's dope. Good trails up there. Mountain biking. I bet the laws are better.
*  I bet they're a little looser with things. Everyone's pretty cool over there.
*  Who else can we get to move with us? It also has the stigma. They've already had one cult go there.
*  I think Bert will roll with us. Bert? Bert will go. Maybe. I think Bert likes California.
*  Bert likes to stay Hollywood but he likes to lie about it. Agree. He's pretty Hollywood. But if we
*  lock down again you'd be not so Hollywood. I'm on some fucking text messages where they are shitting
*  on Jerry Seinfeld's special. The first clip they posted was no bueno. Some text message chains
*  that I'm involved in with comics. I saw one said your special's been on Jerry Seinfeld.
*  I went this thing must be terrible. He looks uncomfortable. It looks like he's uncomfortable.
*  It doesn't it's not bad in the sense that but he's been doing old material for so long. Like part of
*  his whole thing was he would do specials but he would do specials with old material. He doesn't
*  believe in switching an hour all the time. This is a new hour though. This is a whole new hour.
*  Yeah but he's probably been running it for 19 years. Because his old specials were of his old
*  material. He's like new special of my old material that special I've done before. I was like hey dude
*  isn't that weird. I love Jerry. He's the biggest Porsche guy. Oh yeah. The biggest Porsche guy.
*  Oh yeah. He owns like hundreds of Porsche's. He's the Porsche guy. If you go to Malibu the market
*  there him and his boy Spike are out there all the time. Oh really? All the time. They do a podcast
*  of just Porsche's out there. Do they really? Yeah. Just Porsche podcast? Just Porsche's.
*  Sounds like a bad idea. Comics love when other comics have questionable specials. They really do.
*  I don't think I've ever heard a comic go dude have you seen this special besides like Chapelle.
*  Every comic wants to go dude oh that's terrible. I'm like oh come on dude. They there's there's a
*  lot of comics that enjoy when someone especially someone that's not in their circle has a bad
*  special. Yeah. I know. It's unfortunate. I know. I had this talk with Deleah. I think one of the
*  reasons his special was like the number three most watched thing in America. It's huge. If you get
*  tour right now you're talking about a different level and I think one of the reasons he gets
*  hate is his demos it's similar to mine it's 18 to 36 males and that's where you're gonna get a lot
*  of hate man. Those are the guys on the on the internet. So for him I was like dude I know you
*  come out with specials it's gonna be great whatever happens but just know your demo is young dude.
*  So the haters gonna come out man brace yourself but that thing was a huge success. Did the haters
*  come out for him? I haven't looked I'm sure but I don't think he gives a flying fuck in his mansion
*  in Bel Air you know. I think everybody cares. You can't you told me this from the get-go. You can't
*  you cannot read that stuff. Yeah. You can't. It's damn near impossible but you have to I had someone
*  run my account when my switch came in. I don't want to deal with any of this. Just keep moving.
*  You keep moving dude. Yeah you know when things are good and then you go on the road. You know when
*  things are not good just when things are bad use that as fuel to make the next things better and
*  keep moving. You know in here dude. Yeah. You know in here. Like you know that I don't need people
*  tell me I know and then you go on the road and then you get better and you get better and you
*  get better and that's what you do. I want to see what people do when this is over what it's going
*  to be like watching someone's first set in three months to be like running in mud. It's going to
*  be everybody's been clunky as fuck. Well there's it's the thing is separate Tim Dillon. It's not
*  going to be like yeah Tim's like he's he's basically doing stand up with his rants. Yes. He's so funny.
*  I love Tim. I love Tim too. I think that it's going to be interesting because everyone is going to be
*  stale. It's not or flat. It's not going to be like most like if you go to the store and you're on the
*  lineup and you haven't done stand up in three months everybody else is doing it every night
*  and it's going to show. Yeah it'll show. But for the audience there'll be a contrast this way.
*  There's not going to really be a contrast. It's going to be everyone seems slow and clunky. I
*  bet people are going to be gung ho to see the first day back. Okay. Can you imagine walking down the
*  hallway where I'm hugging each other. I can't wait. I can't wait. I can't wait for the first day back.
*  I'm going to you know I mean when the first day opens when the comic store opens if I'm home
*  that day I'm on stage 100 percent and also I want to give all the money to the waiters and the
*  waitresses 100 percent 100 percent of money to the wait staff. I always give my money anyways.
*  Yeah but I mean you mean the whole door. I think they I'll give it to them. I'll sell out shows
*  and give it to them. Those fucking people didn't do anything wrong. They always work real hard.
*  Oh they're the best. The best. They got fucked over by this thing because there's there are the
*  people that are really paycheck to paycheck and then this thing just dries up on them. It's a
*  it's brutal. I just I just I think every comic I think people at the comic store and comics on the
*  road and everything it's just gonna make us appreciate it so much more and you have such
*  a more respect for it and I take it for granted. I think there's light at the end of the tunnel
*  for everybody man. I hope so. This fucking governor needs to open this shit up. Let people take their
*  own chances. Let people decide. They know what it is now. Dude when they gave me a ticket on my
*  fucking bike in the middle of nowhere I was listening to Rage Against the Machine. I wanted
*  to fucking start a protest at Governor Newsom's house. I was this close to fucking organizing one
*  for a 60 dollar ticket. They're going crazy now and like Huntington Beach and Newport and all
*  those places where they're protesting. I love it. There's a hilarious video on the video the guy
*  goes Bill Gates is the devil. He's saying all this thing these things that seem like they kind of
*  make sense and then he goes Bill Gates is the devil. That okay you lost everybody at Bill Gates
*  the devil. Well kind of is he though. But I don't know if he's a devil but he's a little too much
*  of an interest in vaccines. Yeah financial interest. How much money you need dude. How much money do you
*  need. Get the fuck out man. Because you and I had obviously a friendly bet and you were like I hope
*  you're right. Yeah. Because when Governor Newsom went beaches are closed and then we have this text
*  chain with you me and Cal and Eddie and I go dude I'm telling you people aren't going to put up with
*  it. I said I guarantee 10,000 plus show up. You went all right let's bet. Let's bet. Friendly bet.
*  I think you won. I won. Oh yeah I won. Yeah it's over right. Oh yeah. Yeah okay I owe you 100 bucks.
*  But I think that you know I think that we need more of those protests for things to really change
*  you know for him because it's all right. They keep saying like apparently they're suing the
*  governor of Michigan and Illinois. Illinois as well. Michigan that lady she's trying to extend
*  everything. And then did you see in tech I think it was Texas they go we're going to start finding
*  people for this this and this or maybe it was maybe it's California but the sheriff who goes
*  we're not going to do that. Yeah. You guys got to do thing we're not going to give people fines.
*  And then Governor's like all right fuck. It shows you really if people really don't give a fuck the
*  government can't do shit. It's real close to people turning on him because so many people are losing
*  their jobs. So many people are losing their businesses and they want to look there's methods
*  to stay safe. They know that you can be tested. They know that you can everybody can get tested.
*  You can have a certificate that shows you've been tested and then you can go to a restaurant. And
*  not wear a mask and not wear a mask. I'll walk around with a fucking t-shirt that says I'm good.
*  Yeah. Let me do that dude. Yeah I'm good t-shirt. I'm good. Yeah. Back off. Back off. Fat guy
*  security guard at the coffee place. Back off bro. Put the mask on. Oh dude. And then he went to the
*  manager. It was like this he pointed me out. I'm like ah dude you like I'm nice. You know I don't
*  know if it just didn't happen here. I'm trying to remember the state because I just saw it last
*  night. But the people that were like they encouraged snitching or whatever. Yeah. There
*  was a database that got leaked and people who snitched their names got put out. Yeah. So now
*  they're afraid that people are going to find out that they snitched. Good. That's what you get dude.
*  That's what you get. Snitches get stitches. That's what you get bitch. People don't like that. You
*  know how insane that is that our fucking governor came out and said snitch on these people. It's on
*  our governor. It's the mayor Eric Garcetti. That's right. Mayor of LA. But the thing is it's not
*  what we thought it was. If it was killing people left and right like some horrible plague. Yeah then snitch.
*  And you know we really do have to stay in home and lock down because there's a demon out there,
*  an invisible demon. That's what we thought it was. It's not that. It's not good but it's not that.
*  Speaking of snitches get stitches. Did snitches get stitches? Snitches don't get stitches. Did Kim
*  Jong-un fake his death? Did we find out? Yeah he did. He's healthy. He's thriving. As a matter of
*  fact he lost like six pounds. To find out if people would tell and try to take his power I think is what
*  I was reading. Speaking of which. He's done it before. Do you remember stitches the rapper that had the big
*  stupid tattoo on his face? He's still out there. Come on. He's still selling cocaine and shit. Really? Yeah.
*  I mean he's not as popular as he probably was three years ago. He can't do any shows right now but. I'm sure he's still in the
*  drug game. Yeah I could look him up right now. I'm sure he's in Instagram. It was more than three years ago right?
*  Takeshi's out too right now. Takeshi's out talking shit. He's going live tomorrow or today. On Instagram? Talking about his new music. He's got to record a video in his backyard. You know he turned down
*  uh government like security. Because he's gonna pay. He said he would pay for it. You know how expensive that is. Well he doesn't have anywhere to go right now so.
*  It's not that expensive. What do you think happens to him? He's gonna die. Every blood in the world wants to kill him.
*  Now who how many people did he rat out? So many. Now did they let him out because they let him out or did they let him out because of COVID?
*  Both. Yeah he was let out early. Because he snitched on everybody. He was gonna have like maybe eight more months so they just like let him out and finish the rest of his time at home.
*  Dude they're letting out so many people from jail that should be in jail for the rest of their life.
*  Yeah like child molesters. Yeah it's like I don't I'm baffled. And for what for this COVID?
*  Are you out your goddamn mind? Everybody is out of their goddamn mind. You're right. Like I'm saying. It's so disappointing. I think people prepared and were anticipating something that was way more horrible.
*  And they can't go back. They didn't make an adjustment. They can't go back because they don't want to look stupid like Governor Newsom. Like oh fuck now I look like an asshole.
*  I think Governor Newsom wants to be president. I think that's the same thing with that woman who's the governor of uh of Michigan.
*  It's the same thing who's getting sued by the house. She's getting sued by people in her own state because they're like hey you're you don't have the authority to do this.
*  And she's saying I'm going with science and statistics. But you're not though. But you're not though. But she's not. Talk to my boy Elon. Yeah. What he says goes dude.
*  But the thing is she's on a short list of people that for the vice presidency with Biden. That's what it is. You ain't gonna win bitch. He's not gonna win.
*  You're not gonna win. Are you kidding me? He's not gonna win. You got this rape allegation now and then you also can't speak. I mean I speak better than you. What are we talking about?
*  I have problems. I have a speech impediment. I talk for a living. I speak better than you. He's so doomed. He's so fu- he's gonna die in four years. He can't be his president.
*  He's just doomed period. Like everything about him is doomed. He can't talk and it's like the allegations and the fact that people are showing such a fucking unbridled hypocrisy by supporting him while they were against all these other guys that were accused of sexual-
*  Just because they want Trump out. They'll ignore everything just to get Trump out. They want their team to win and that's what they're showing. They're showing it's not- Teams. It's not believe all women. It's believe all women if they're accusing a man that you don't like.
*  It's insane. I can't believe Trump and Biden are the best we got. It's not the best. It's because the smart people don't run for president. Yeah. That's what it is. A lot of the smart ones don't. There's some smart ones out there. Yeah but they don't seem to want that job. I think Mark Cuban could do a good job. I think he'd like to be president. Agree. I'd probably vote for him. He's more of a libertarian. You know what? He's being real- Mark you know I love it. He's being a real bitch about this COVID stuff. He's like I don't think the NBA should be back. What did he say? Recently? Yeah I think his mom's like 900
*  years old so he's worried she's gonna get it. Well take care of your mom bro. It's like that same Hollywood. Yeah dude put her in a bubble. Dude it's like the same- it's like that Hollywood actor that that Indian guy who's in the Marvel movie who's just preaching from the mountains. Who's that? Like we're gonna open up and this thing get worse we should shut down. Kumail Nanjiani that guy? Shut the fuck up dude. Make another Marvel movie. He's just saying because his wife has an underlying condition so he's worried about that which I get dude from a personal standpoint I get that.
*  But also read the stats. You're smart. He's super smart. You're a smart dude man. I'm sure a little bit of that but there's also a little bit of virtue signaling where people are saying things and they know that the enlightened thoughtful people are supposed to say and then they get support online to check the tweets. Oh look at all these people who agree with me. Yay. Look what I did. I got them to like me more. Hope I'm in fucking Spider-Man 9. Thank you for saying this. You're amazing by the way. Oh god. Every life matters. Every life matters.
*  Everyone has to say that. Every life matters. Yeah well where were you before this COVID thing because people are dying all the time. It's interesting to see that obesity is the number one factor in people in New York City because all these people that want to think that it's okay to be obese it's fine. Yeah fat's not cute man. Not only not cute it's like really bad for you. Yeah dude. Yeah we've known this. Yeah forever. And then COVID comes goes oh this is too easy. Yeah. And then if this doesn't scare your fat ass into shape. Do you think that people like with all this fat shit
*  shaming mentality out there the people will that the government or someone the public health will step up and have some sort of a public health campaign saying look folks you've got to lose weight. You've got to stop eating sugar. It's terrible for your immune system. Get yourself down to a reasonable size. So I would love to see that and see what the people freak out about it and all the people that try to counter it with emotions and bullshit. It's all right to have tits. Stop trying to define beauty standards. Muffin tops are cool.
*  Yeah I don't know what you're gonna do man. I saw a video I don't know what I saw. I saw a video I think maybe Josh Wuff showed is a video of kids in the 70s in a gym class just a random gym class. These kids were all in fucking phenomenal shape. There's like 100 kids. Everyone's slim. Everyone's slim. That's how it should be man. I know I'm a little thick but I'm in shape dude. My heart's great. My rest heart rate's insane. But these kids were all in shape man. All these kids. You go to high school now.
*  Every kid gets a letter from his mom. Oh he can't work out because of you know. Billy has sore ankles. Billy gets anxiety when you make him run a mile. What the fuck I have to run a mile. Yes Billy is anxious. Billy gets anxious. Billy doesn't respond well to pressure. Leave him alone. Leave him alone. God damn it. One thing that we saw from this is that there's so many people that don't know how to deal with any sort of adversity. I can't be the first person to
*  be friends. I have people who I used to talk to and when this thing came out we're just going to bunker down and I think the commie stores are going to be closed in 2022 and we're not going to be on the road anymore. Who? I'm not going to tell you. Say the names. Nope. I can't. What do they rhyme with? What do the names rhyme with? I'm not going to do it. I'll tell you afterwards. Okay. I literally went we can't be friends anymore. Oh wow. You can't be my foxhole dude. This scared you? Oh this ain't shit bubba. Well we can't be friends anymore. I literally don't talk to them.
*  I'm anxious to talk to Michael Yeo on Monday. The way he was describing it like. Be cool Michael. Be cool man. You got through it bro. He's going to scare the fuck out of everybody. He thought he was going to die. But he got pneumonia. But here's the thing pneumonia is still real. People still get pneumonia. People die from pneumonia all the time. And if you get pneumonia and that. I got pneumonia when I was 19. Yeah. If you get pneumonia. My son got pneumonia too. And that. You're fucked. And that's what happened with him. But you still survive. Don't come on.
*  Here and fucking scare Michael Yeo. I will fuck you up. Don't come on here and scare everybody dude. We have we we get it enough man. You ever watch CNN. You would think the world's on fire. What's that guy's name Brian Stelter. He's my favorite. He's a chubby guy. He's like the Balder chubby guy. He's rarely on the very feminine. It's more lemon. Yeah. But I love when he gets when he's all doom and gloom. Oh God. It's just Tim Dillon tweeted this last night. This is interesting. I'd certainly
*  know where I saw it from. It's on Newsweek. What is this. Coronavirus survivors permanently disqualified from joining U.S. military recruitment memo suggests. What would that be for. Why. Tim said what is it depending on no that we don't know. But that says U.S. recruitment memo suggests that that's permanently disqualified. See this is these standards change all the time. That this is based on what. I mean if they've shown that you can completely 100 percent recover from coronavirus that doesn't make any sense. That's I doubt that's true.
*  I think that memo is probably in response to this idea that you that it could be a reoccurring infection. That was something that people thought those who have tested. What happened there. Those who tested positive for covid 19 are no longer eligible for military service.
*  What the fuck out of here. What the no way. We don't know if that's true. During the screening process a reported history of confirmed covid 19 will be an annotated considered disqualifying reported history of confirmed. I'm not buying that. I'm not buying it. I'm not buying that.
*  Fake news. That could that could shift back and forth and that's probably just fear monitoring. Some bullshit. Some bullshit. Come on came up on the come up right during this. Andrew Cuomo. Yeah he did. But again if you look back what he did initially if you initially where New York had their problem was that the old folks home and what he did anybody at the old old folks home who got covid he went in the showing symptoms get back in there. So then they all got it. And they
*  all fucking died. Did you fucked up man. Yeah you kind of fucked them. Well I think in the beginning no one knew exactly what the fuck was going on. I mean in January the World Health Organization tweeted out in the World Health Organization one that everybody is telling everybody that you have to listen to them in January. They tweeted out that there's no evidence according to China that it's true. It's the catch it person to person which is insane. But that's in January. It's just insane. No one listened to him in the first place. The other thing is how about the
*  estimates. Two million people are going to die. I know America alone. Get ready. I know. But they're saying that well if we didn't have this lockdown maybe that would have happened. And then there and then even Cuomo came out said what I've realized we're doing the lockdown. It's spreading inside the families. Yeah. He's like we kind of fucked up there so we don't know what to do. Not just that. There's also the concept of immunity that your immune system really needs interaction with other people. Look at Sweden dude. Sweden did nothing. Numbers are similar to ours. They did nothing.
*  I don't know. Are there numbers similar to ours. I thought their numbers were a little higher than the neighboring countries that did do social distancing and lockdown. Bring that shit up Jamie. I don't know. I know it's murder wasps are coming right now. The murder wasps. Jesus. If I have to avoid murder wasps and rattlesnakes I'd have to stop by. We don't have a chance. We don't have a chance to relax. When did they become murder hornets. Why you call them murder hornets. Murder bees. I don't know about murdering anything else.
*  I know. But when did they change their name. They used to be Asian hornets. Murder bees now bro. Murder hornets. Wasps or hornets. Killer bees that disappeared. Yeah that was Africanized. But the idea of killer bees is they would swarm you. This is a different thing. But this thing. Similar to this though. It's a similar size. I think it's bigger. I think they're bigger. But here's the thing. Are they murder wasps or murder hornets. Murder wasps. Wasps. These wasps.
*  Like they never called a murder wasps until like two weeks ago. CNN. Someone had a great name with it. It's a great name. Murder hornet. Murder hornet. OK. So murder hornets. I'm gonna call this a murder hornet by the way. On my picture I'm gonna say I got a murder hornet. Until two weeks ago. I never heard that term. Did you hear that term. No but it's terrifying. I know. When they go murder hornets hit Washington I'm like well they're coming to Cali dude. That Coyote Peterson guy though that guy got stung by one like two years ago. It's a real pain. They didn't call it a murder hornet.
*  It's because they're not in America. I don't give a fuck what's out in other parts of the world. No are they in Seattle. Is that what happened. They snuck in on some. No no they're cargo ship. No no no. I thought they're in D.C. Oh good. I hope they only go to politicians. Are they on the west coast. Right in the dick. I thought it was Washington state. Dude. That's where everything seems to be hitting. That's where the corona hit first. Is that where it is. Where's the murder hornets Jamie. Spoke it. Yes. They were discovered late.
*  Last year Washington. Oh God. Oh so it's not even relevant. They've been chilling. Two of them were discovered. Some asshole probably had them as a pet. They're not even breeding. We're just looking for something to be scared of now that the media's got to sell clicks. I mean that got me. They got you. Corona did it. But these hornets these murder wasps did it. I tell you that right now. When I saw them I'm like oh fuck let's quarantine. If that becomes an issue like they start flying into people's houses and stinging one of them. One of the two was found dead and the other one flew off. So.
*  That's really the fucking story. The story says in CBS which may be damn it. Oh well now this isn't too bad. God damn it. Everyone sucks. The media get you man. They got me business. Their business is to scare you. The only way they make clicks. How do you get clicks. Someone's got to be scared of something or angry. How do we get clicks. We're funny. Yeah. But it's like being real. They hunt them where insects are hunted and eaten. 30 to 50 people die per year. That's a problem.
*  But they're hunting them. So there's a shitload of people die by rattlesnake. You ever looked up rattlesnake death. I didn't know this. They fuck you up man. Yeah. Rattlesnake is not good. I send you guys a picture every day. I know every day you do. You send me a new rattlesnake video every day. Do that. Kind of crazy. The very first one I found as an anaconda with a rattler on it dude. If you look back on it that snake was so fucking big. It was a big one. Oh I ran over one once. A junk running with my dogs. It was a big one.
*  It was across the street or across the trail. I thought it was a stick. As I'm running over it I realize oh my god that's a fucking rattler. And he just let you jump on him. No I just I cleared him. Fuck. But I literally ran over his body and then I realized in the air that it was a rattlesnake. I mean thick like my wrist. You know what bothers me is I'll see the snake and I'll wait. If I know if I pass people I know they're coming. I'll wait out front like rattlesnake rattlesnake. This lady with a
*  dog. She's out there. I go rattlesnake and she's letting her dog just walk. I'm like dude you fucking idiot. Put him on a leash dude. I would never like I used to take my son on these hikes. I don't take him anymore too many rattlesnakes. But when people have their dogs out and they just let them go on the side that's where the snakes are. So I ride in the middle because the snakes are always on the side. If I come out of the way I can see them. But these people let their dogs go up and down those side. I'm like that's so dangerous. You have no idea. There's so many dingbats out there dude. There's so many people that think they just have
*  shit for brains. There's so many. Dude one old lady. I see her. She's the same time I do. She's in shaped hand as fuck. Skin like leather. Looks like a purse right. She's fucking. She's going. I go ma'am there's a rattlesnake about 10 feet up. She goes she takes her old school hat. She was a what. I go a rattlesnake. She goes OK. Doesn't move. It's on the path. Doesn't move. Just goes right out just right along the side of it. Didn't give a fuck. Probably ready to die. Probably survive World War 2. Rattlesnake. Bitch I'm
*  in Pearl Harbor. Yeah she's got a softball face. She didn't give a fuck. She's like why am I alive. Face like Sacco Gioia. When certain people get to a certain age I wonder if they do look more dangerous shit like hoping hoping something goes wrong. I send those videos to my dad and he gets mad. I don't think cares about me because if my grandsons grow up without a fucking father because you got bit riding that gay bike. Hey man.
*  If my grandsons grow up without a father you fucking piece of shit for riding a gay bike. It's not gay dude it's a mountain bike. There's nothing gay about it. That is fucking hilarious. What a take. Right. What a hot take by your dad.
*  Dead serious. Dead serious. Worried about your grandson. Not even worried about your son. Don't give a fuck. That's hilarious. All right. It's three o'clock already. Is it. Dude this goes by so fast. It always does. We covered three minutes of the fight. I think we covered quite a bit. Yeah. We covered quite a bit man. It was hours ago though we forgot. I don't know. So we have a fight companion. We solved COVID. Yes we solved everything. We're good. As long as
*  Jacksonville works out. You're gonna be great man. I can't fucking wait. You'll see 249 Saturday. I'm weirded out doing commentary with no audience. It's gonna be strange. You're gonna kill it. I wish you guys were together. I'm excited. Thick boy bike club merch drops tomorrow 10 a.m. T fat K dot com. When is your first scheduled comedy date? Spoken last weekend spoken. June. June. Wow.
