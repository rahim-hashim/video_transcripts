# Joe Rogan Experience #1969 - Sam Tallent
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6.0s)]
*  I've been running Sand Town with them headphones and joined the fucking party. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10.0s)]
*  Get the microphone up about like a fist from your face. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=17.0s)]
*  Jamie, how's this? Do I sound powerful and elegant? Thank you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=21.0s)]
*  Bro, you are powerful and elegant. Thanks, man. You are enough. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=26.0s)]
*  I appreciate that. I'm good enough. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=30.0s)]
*  I had a friend of mine and she was asking me something just about comedy. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=32.0s)]
*  And I go, I just, you know, no one, I don't like my stuff. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=38.0s)]
*  No one likes their stuff. Like you see it too much. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=41.0s)]
*  It just like it gets in your head and you're like, you like got it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=43.0s)]
*  I look at it like a hater and she goes, I just want you to know no matter what that you are enough. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=47.0s)]
*  I go, what? I go, no, no, no, that's not what I'm saying. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=52.0s)]
*  I'm not saying like, like I don't like my stuff. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=56.0s)]
*  Like I have a problem. Like I'm a crazy person. No, I'm just like, that's just the process. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=58.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like I feel good. Right. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=62.0s)]
*  Like, but that thing that people say to people, you are enough. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=64.0s)]
*  I just want you to know that you are enough. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=67.0s)]
*  Look, I don't need validation from you, lady. She's a nice lady. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=70.0s)]
*  I'm sure she's a nice lady. She's a very nice lady. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=73.0s)]
*  But I don't think you're going to her to be like, can you hold my hand through this difficult period? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=75.0s)]
*  I think some people do do that to people and they go fishing for that kind of response. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=78.0s)]
*  Yeah. That you are enough. I'm like, no, no, I'm okay. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=82.0s)]
*  It's like, look, I know. Look around lady. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=84.0s)]
*  I kind of made Austin a thing. Yeah. I know I'm okay. I mean, it's sweet of her, but. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=87.0s)]
*  She's awesome. I also hate watching my shit, dude. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=92.0s)]
*  I hate it. That'd be my Guantanamo. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=95.0s)]
*  That making me watch all my old specials. Yuck. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=97.0s)]
*  God damn it. Or like a YouTube clip from like 2007. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=100.0s)]
*  That's the thing that you have to do, too. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=104.0s)]
*  Like when working on new material, I either watch or listen to it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=106.0s)]
*  Yeah. Have to listen to it. Just have to. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=109.0s)]
*  I got to know like what makes me groan. What makes me go yuck. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=112.0s)]
*  What's the cringe in there? What's the yuck? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=115.0s)]
*  How do I cut the yuck out of that? Yeah. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=117.0s)]
*  It's just like you're going to have that. You're you got to look at your act like you're a hater. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=119.0s)]
*  Oh, for sure. I do. Luckily, I never have any moments where I'm like, oh, this is working out. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=122.0s)]
*  I watch it. I'm like, why is your leg like that? I can barely hear the joke. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=128.0s)]
*  I'm like, Jesus Christ, look at your hair. When did that leave? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=132.0s)]
*  Look how far that's receding. Jesus. Yeah. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=136.0s)]
*  Have you always how long have you been shaving your head? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=138.0s)]
*  Twelve years. Yeah. Something like that. I'm going there, man. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=143.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's way better. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You don't think about it anymore. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=146.0s)]
*  It's like, oh, it's like one less thing to think about if you have a good shaped head. I don't. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=149.0s)]
*  Like some people have flat heads. Yeah. Their heads flat. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=153.0s)]
*  But now you got a new joke about having a flat head. Yeah. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=156.0s)]
*  Then I have to turn around or have a mirror behind me. That's fine. Yeah, it's all right. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=158.0s)]
*  Give him a little fucking. I'm going to get into props. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=161.0s)]
*  Give him a little look at the flat. Yeah. No, I don't have a good head. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=163.0s)]
*  It's bumpy. I think if I shaved my head, I would go mutton chops. I would leave the chops. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=165.0s)]
*  Why don't you go fucking full Sufi beard? Yeah, just lower. Just the lower beard like Dagestan. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=170.0s)]
*  Amish? Yeah, right here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Amish go underneath the chin. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=177.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, the apple butter. They go underneath, right? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=180.0s)]
*  I think there's some kind of like recessive allele where they're not like God keeps them from having any hair on their cheeks. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=182.0s)]
*  There's so many Muslims who fight in the UFC who have shaved heads and they grow a full ass beard. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=188.0s)]
*  There's the Amish one. That's ridiculous. So he is shaving it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=193.0s)]
*  That shit is not catching on. No. Anybody. No. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=196.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a weird middle ground, right? Because he could eat food with no problem at all, which is like kind of a cop out. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=198.0s)]
*  You know what he's not eating? Pussy. Those guys don't. I don't think so. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=205.0s)]
*  They're not allowed to eat pussy. Those guys' forearms. Have you seen an Amish guy with his shirt off? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=209.0s)]
*  They jerk off a lot, I'm sure. But they have to do it to memory, right? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=213.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. Like they can't be watching porn. No. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=217.0s)]
*  The Amish beards typically have... They just have wood carvings. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=220.0s)]
*  What did you say? Because Amish men shave their mustaches off, you may be wondering how now if an Amish are allowed to shave. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=223.0s)]
*  While married men may shave their mustaches only, unmarried men may shave their beards too. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=230.0s)]
*  The only prohibition on shaving applies to the beards of married men. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=235.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. So it's like a wedding ring. So once you have a full beard, all the hoes need to leave you the fuck alone. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=239.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, hey, I'm taking ladies. Yeah, he's taking bitches. That's why he's growing this gross ass beard. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=245.0s)]
*  Yeah, God forbid they see your chin. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=250.0s)]
*  Isn't it funny that you're on the marketplace if you don't have a beard? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=252.0s)]
*  You're this guy out there with no beard. Yeah, you're swinging your peacock. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=255.0s)]
*  Yeah, imagine the fucking Mrs. Amish and Mr. Amish have a fight and he just, watch this bitch. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=258.0s)]
*  Just half of it? She shaves his beard off halfway out the door. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=263.0s)]
*  She starts crying, runs outside, makes some butter real quick. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=267.0s)]
*  Makes some butter. They don't have any electricity. They make their own houses. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=272.0s)]
*  Dude, those Amish, the way they raise houses so quick. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=277.0s)]
*  Oh, they're really good at it. Yeah. And then Mennonites, they're like rough around the edges. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=281.0s)]
*  I don't know any Mennonites, but I did meet one with Ari Shafir at the airport and I found out because he asked her. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=286.0s)]
*  What are you? Yeah, classic Ari. Oh no, it wasn't at the airport. I'm sorry. It was at a rest stop. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=291.0s)]
*  It was at a rest stop in Massachusetts, I think. They were in between gigs, just driving to a gig. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=296.0s)]
*  What are you? What did you ask her? What are you? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=301.0s)]
*  Yeah, what is that? Yeah. She's wearing an outfit. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=306.0s)]
*  What's up with the bonnet? Which one are you? It is fucking weird though, man. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=309.0s)]
*  You know what's weird is that when people do a really shitty job, it's a cult. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=315.0s)]
*  When they do a really good job, it's a religion. But it's basically the same system that it works on in the human brain. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=321.0s)]
*  It works on the same mechanisms. Someone has all the answers and they have a connection to a higher power. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=327.0s)]
*  That's why. One thing that creeps me out about atheism, it's not atheism itself. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=334.0s)]
*  It's that I think that tendency to just find a group of ideas that you will wholesale subscribe to is built into us. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=342.0s)]
*  I think it's a cultural thing like war. I think when people don't have that, if it's not like if they don't have Christianity or Islam or Buddhism or Judaism, whatever they don't have, they'll put it into something else. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=352.0s)]
*  I think it's a normal part of being a person for some strange reason. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=367.0s)]
*  We were trying to find community all the time. We're seeking ways to make whatever our small group is be safe and maybe work with other like-minded groups. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=372.0s)]
*  When it comes to atheism, it's wild when people become fundamental about that. When you're devout to the idea of atheism, it's like, I don't think there's anything after this, but I'm also not going to become an apostate from any other ideas. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=382.0s)]
*  I don't know why anybody would be sure one way or the other. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=397.0s)]
*  Oh, I don't know, because you have to be, I think. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=400.0s)]
*  Unless some, well, it would help you if you were. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=402.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=405.0s)]
*  So the thing about it, like Jordan Peterson says this, that you should live your life as if God is real. If you live your life as if God is real, you will definitely live a better life. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=406.0s)]
*  I was like, that's a very interesting way of thinking about it, because if you're wrong, there's no consequences because you just die. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=414.0s)]
*  But if you're living that way, at the very least, you'll have less anxiety. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=421.0s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=426.0s)]
*  You'll have more of a sense of purpose. You'll probably do the right thing more often because you'll be sort of like aiming to that, like looking to do, like as a good Christian, like I know a lot of people that are Christians that are really good people. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=427.0s)]
*  And it's because they aim towards that. They think about that all the time. They think about what would God want me to do. They think about what does God teach. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=440.0s)]
*  And they like they're aiming in that. They're still human. They're still, we're all fucked. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=448.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=452.0s)]
*  But they're aiming in that direction. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=453.0s)]
*  Let's underline that. We are all fucked. Let's not forget that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=454.0s)]
*  The whole population. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=457.0s)]
*  I don't like when people do things because they are trying to cash checks in heaven. I do like it when you're just doing it because it's the right thing to do. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=458.0s)]
*  Like when you give a homeless guy five bucks and he's like, God bless you, I'm the kind of dickhead who's like, there's no God involved in this. This is one man trying to help one man. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=465.0s)]
*  I'm doing this because I think it's going to benefit you, not because I'm trying to get up to the big man. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=474.0s)]
*  That's true. But maybe he's saying God bless you. Like he's so happy that you did that for him. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=479.0s)]
*  It's the nicest thing he knows how to say. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=485.0s)]
*  He really hopes good things happen to you as well. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=487.0s)]
*  Sure. I know. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=489.0s)]
*  It's a weird thing, right? Because like you feel like if you buy into it, you're being a dupe. You're getting duped. You know, oh, they got you. They got you with that nonsense. What'd they get you with that? Mormonism shit? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=490.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=500.0s)]
*  You think you're going to get your own planet when you die, stupid. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=501.0s)]
*  Which is pretty cool. Let's be honest. If you're going to pick one. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=502.0s)]
*  I have a friend in California and she was a Mormon for a long time and she decided to stop being a Mormon. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=506.0s)]
*  And when she decided to stop being a Mormon, one of the craziest things she said was she goes, I realized that I was way more vulnerable to like weird culty stuff like spirituality and yoga and that kind of. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=513.0s)]
*  She was I felt like because I had accepted devout Mormonism my whole life, I hadn't questioned anything that as an adult question like she left. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=526.0s)]
*  I think she left in her late 30s or 40s. So as an adult, like she just became vulnerable to like kind of hucksters. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=535.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=543.0s)]
*  Energy healers and you know, that kind of shit. Like it seemed like, oh, that makes sense. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=544.0s)]
*  That's that's what I'm looking like. There's a fucking program in our head where we want to believe nonsense and whether that program is attached to the Republican Party, whether it's attached to being a fucking Buddhist or being a. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=549.0s)]
*  Did you see the Dalai Lama sucking on that kid's time? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=563.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=565.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=566.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=567.0s)]
*  Could you. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=568.0s)]
*  Slurp in a boy tongue? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=569.0s)]
*  In front of a bunch of people. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=570.0s)]
*  A whole bunch of people. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=572.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=574.0s)]
*  You thought you were going to get away with this? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=575.0s)]
*  What the fuck? What the fuck is that? I watched it. I was like, this is wild. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=577.0s)]
*  Oh, I remember they tried to cancel him a few years back because he was talking about marriage and they said you have you took a val salve. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=583.0s)]
*  Is he like, how do you feel about this? And he's like, I have so many friends and they're married and and then they get divorced and they're not happy. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=592.0s)]
*  And then the woman takes all their money. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=602.0s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=604.0s)]
*  Yeah. And this woman said something to the tune of well, you know, some women, they make money, too. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=605.0s)]
*  He's like, oh, good one. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=612.0s)]
*  High five. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=614.0s)]
*  It was something. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=615.0s)]
*  Something. Oh, sure. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=616.0s)]
*  Now I've heard everything. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=618.0s)]
*  It was one of those fucking. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=619.0s)]
*  It was a weird interview, man. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=621.0s)]
*  But it was weird. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=623.0s)]
*  Like he's like parroting out these tropes. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=624.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=627.0s)]
*  You know, about marriage and divorce. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=628.0s)]
*  And it's really funny. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=630.0s)]
*  It's like because some of them fail. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=631.0s)]
*  But this is supposed to be a spiritual leader. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=632.0s)]
*  Right. He's supposed to be like completely ascended and bigger than any thought. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=634.0s)]
*  He's supposed to be saying that some marriages are wonderful and beautiful because they are. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=638.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=644.0s)]
*  Like for him to say, oh, what I heard is they take your money. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=645.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=647.0s)]
*  Well, it's like your dad's friend who doesn't get laid anymore. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=648.0s)]
*  You ever hang out with him at the bar? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=650.0s)]
*  Yeah. Your dad's friend who doesn't get laid anymore doesn't have a video of him sucking on a kid's tongue. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=651.0s)]
*  He might. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=655.0s)]
*  Like what the fuck, man. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=656.0s)]
*  It's probably a VHS tape. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=658.0s)]
*  He's got on Laserdisc. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=659.0s)]
*  Did they record? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=663.0s)]
*  I don't think Laserdisc record. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=665.0s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=667.0s)]
*  I don't think they did. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=668.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=669.0s)]
*  Dalai Lama also said at one point, he was like, we got to keep Europe for Europeans. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=670.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=674.0s)]
*  He was like too many refugees are coming in. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=675.0s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=677.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=678.0s)]
*  Like what the fuck are you saying, man? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=679.0s)]
*  He's like, hey, Dalai Lama, just let the kids sit on your lap. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=680.0s)]
*  That's enough. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=683.0s)]
*  Yeah. Hey, dude, how about don't do that? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=684.0s)]
*  Quit smooching the kids in general. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=686.0s)]
*  Yeah. Don't tell a kid to suck your tongue. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=688.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=690.0s)]
*  Especially not on camera. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=691.0s)]
*  That seems like there should be jail time for something like that. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=692.0s)]
*  What is that? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=694.0s)]
*  I don't think he can get in trouble. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=695.0s)]
*  In Tibet, sticking out one's tongue is known as a traditional greeting, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=696.0s)]
*  stemming from a ninth century myth about an unpopular king with a black tongue. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=700.0s)]
*  His tongue was doing black face. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=705.0s)]
*  When the king died, the Tibetans revealed revealing their tongues to show they had become his incarnate. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=706.0s)]
*  Whoa. Tongue sucking does not appear to be part of the tradition. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=711.0s)]
*  That's where he crossed the line. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=714.0s)]
*  If they just stuck tongues at each other, bro, you would have skated Scott Free. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=717.0s)]
*  The PR team is working hard spin on that one. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=721.0s)]
*  Hard spin. Wait till Rachel Maddow gets a hold of it. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=723.0s)]
*  She'll kind of win. She'll find a way. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=726.0s)]
*  It happened in February. It came out like a week, couple days ago. It's kind of weird. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=728.0s)]
*  So it's a hit campaign against the llama? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=732.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's like a few weeks old. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=734.0s)]
*  I saw him talk once. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=736.0s)]
*  Sometimes it just takes a while for something like that to catch. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=737.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=740.0s)]
*  But today... [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=741.0s)]
*  I mean, if it was Don Lemon, I would say, yeah, they're trying to get rid of him. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=742.0s)]
*  But it was the Dalai Lama. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=746.0s)]
*  I don't think they can get him out. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=748.0s)]
*  I have no idea why it would have came out. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=749.0s)]
*  How do you get out the Dalai Lama? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=750.0s)]
*  Dalai Lama was born... [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=752.0s)]
*  I don't even mean to pick on Don Lemon. I'm saying someone who's on television. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=753.0s)]
*  But even then, if that information is available... [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=758.0s)]
*  Look how many people were there. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=763.0s)]
*  That's obviously like a cell phone footage, right? Is that what it is? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=765.0s)]
*  Well, it was a fundraiser for some kind of Indian tech company. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=767.0s)]
*  How wild. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=770.0s)]
*  How wild. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=772.0s)]
*  Just be kissing a kid in front of everybody. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=773.0s)]
*  Which is already too much. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=775.0s)]
*  Tongue kissing. Suck on my tongue. What are you talking about? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=776.0s)]
*  I've never had a kid that close to my own face where I could say, suck on my tongue. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=780.0s)]
*  Isn't it interesting? It's interesting what we choose to consider intimate contact. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=784.0s)]
*  Because hands... [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=790.0s)]
*  If he had that boy's hand in his hand, and he put his hand over it and said, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=792.0s)]
*  I wish you a wonderful, happy life. You're a beautiful human being. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=797.0s)]
*  And just go out there and be kind to everybody. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=801.0s)]
*  Everybody be like, that's cool. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=803.0s)]
*  Sweet gesture. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=805.0s)]
*  Sweet gesture. When you fully hug someone, you can hug them for a couple seconds. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=806.0s)]
*  You gotta let go. You can't stand there for ten minutes just rubbing their back. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=811.0s)]
*  People go, hey, hey, hey, Dolly Llama, let the kid go. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=817.0s)]
*  Hey, your robe is getting tainted, Dolly. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=820.0s)]
*  You violated the time. You broke the time clock. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=822.0s)]
*  There's a time clock that goes when someone hugs. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=824.0s)]
*  If you have a real good friend, you gotta let it linger. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=827.0s)]
*  Ten second countdown. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=831.0s)]
*  Ten seconds is a long time to be hugging someone. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=832.0s)]
*  Oh, it's a lot. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=834.0s)]
*  Ready? Here's ten seconds. And go. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=835.0s)]
*  So here we are. We're touching chest to chest. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=837.0s)]
*  Our genitals are near each other. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=840.0s)]
*  I can smell your neck right now. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=842.0s)]
*  We're still hugging. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=844.0s)]
*  All right, now we're done hugging. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=845.0s)]
*  That's kind of a hug. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=846.0s)]
*  But I've done that. I've done a ten second hug with a good friend. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=847.0s)]
*  Sure, it feels good. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=850.0s)]
*  But now with a little boy that I don't know in the middle of nowhere. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=851.0s)]
*  Also, how did that boy get in there? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=854.0s)]
*  Don't show me this. I don't want to see this again. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=856.0s)]
*  I don't want to see this. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=858.0s)]
*  That boy snapped back like a cobra ready to fucking strike. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=859.0s)]
*  He's like, why are you making me suck your tongue, you old fucking weirdo? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=863.0s)]
*  It's like when the noodle hits your lips finally. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=867.0s)]
*  It snaps like the sound. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=869.0s)]
*  But what I'm getting at is it's interesting that kissing is such an intimate act. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=871.0s)]
*  It clearly is. But I wonder how that guy even got started. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=876.0s)]
*  People's breath must have been horrible back in the day. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=878.0s)]
*  Oh, terrible rotting meat in there. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=880.0s)]
*  Oh, God. No dentists. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=882.0s)]
*  Your teeth all fell out. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=884.0s)]
*  And they got knocked out. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=886.0s)]
*  You probably got infections from cracked teeth, from getting hit with a rock. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=888.0s)]
*  I bet a lot of people died from mouth infections and shit. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=892.0s)]
*  You're trying to eat everything you find. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=895.0s)]
*  You don't even know what's edible. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=897.0s)]
*  And when did they start kissing? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=899.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=901.0s)]
*  Let's find that out. Let's take a guess. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=902.0s)]
*  When do you think kissing was invented? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=903.0s)]
*  What if it was like 1900? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=905.0s)]
*  Whenever France became a country. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=907.0s)]
*  What if nobody kissed until like the 1900s? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=909.0s)]
*  It was a revolution. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=911.0s)]
*  I'm going to guess. I'm going to guess it's like some Mesopotamia shit. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=912.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=916.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to guess that it started like thousands of years ago. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=917.0s)]
*  Cradle of civilization. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=919.0s)]
*  I'd say pre-pyramids. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=920.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=922.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=923.0s)]
*  Strong guess. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=924.0s)]
*  What else did you have to do back then? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=925.0s)]
*  Make a toothbrush? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=927.0s)]
*  Why would you kiss somebody? That seems crazy. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=929.0s)]
*  We're figuring out what holes are safe. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=932.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=934.0s)]
*  But you could wash the body off, like eating pussy and blow jobs and stuff. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=935.0s)]
*  That kind of makes sense. You just want to get crazy. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=938.0s)]
*  I think blow jobs happened before sex did. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=941.0s)]
*  I bet you went mouth first. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=943.0s)]
*  There was a fur covered hole down there. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=945.0s)]
*  You're trying to jam up in that thing? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=947.0s)]
*  Watch chimps. Chimps fuck each other. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=949.0s)]
*  I've watched chimps fuck each other. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=951.0s)]
*  I bet you have. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=953.0s)]
*  I've been down that road. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=954.0s)]
*  So your guess is pre-dynastic Egypt. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=955.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=958.0s)]
*  Five thousand, six thousand years ago. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=959.0s)]
*  I just said pyramids. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=961.0s)]
*  Well, that's like five thousand years ago. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=962.0s)]
*  Supposedly. They don't even really know. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=964.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=966.0s)]
*  Jamie? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=967.0s)]
*  I've got two answers. I was trying to figure out which ones were right. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=968.0s)]
*  You didn't have one? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=970.0s)]
*  No. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=971.0s)]
*  The first answer Google gives back is the first recorded kiss is 1500 BC, which sounds recent. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=972.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=980.0s)]
*  That's very recent. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=981.0s)]
*  Right below that is a link to a longer piece that says some researchers believe that kissing began millions of years ago as a result of mouth-to-mouth feeding. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=982.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=989.0s)]
*  And that's going into like, well, why didn't everybody do it then? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=990.0s)]
*  Because you had to chew the food for the child? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=994.0s)]
*  Do you know that you can get syphilis from kissing people? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=997.0s)]
*  No. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=999.0s)]
*  I didn't either. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1000.0s)]
*  I saw it on a TikTok video. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1002.0s)]
*  Must be true. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1004.0s)]
*  How dirty is that mouth? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1005.0s)]
*  It was an Instagram Reels. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1006.0s)]
*  That's what it was. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1008.0s)]
*  He was like having this guy standing there and all these different girls were coming by and kissing him. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1009.0s)]
*  And he was pointing out all the different types of diseases that you can get from mouth kissing someone. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1015.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1019.0s)]
*  Herpes and syphilis and gonorrhea, all these different things you can get from mouth kissing people. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1020.0s)]
*  I thought it was just herpes. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1025.0s)]
*  That was my biggest fear. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1026.0s)]
*  I thought so too. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1027.0s)]
*  Somehow I dodged that bullet. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1028.0s)]
*  This guy figured out a way to scare the fuck out of everybody and they're never going to kiss again. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1030.0s)]
*  I'm going to keep kissing. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1035.0s)]
*  I'm still smooching my old lady when I get home. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1037.0s)]
*  Well, you're married. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1039.0s)]
*  But if you're some wild dude at the bar, you might die. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1040.0s)]
*  Secondly, kissing can also transmit syphilis, which may present as an oral canker. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1042.0s)]
*  What is that? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1048.0s)]
*  Canker? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1049.0s)]
*  Canker sore? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1050.0s)]
*  T. palladium can invade mucous membranes through abrasion. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1051.0s)]
*  Therefore, oral canker can result from kissing with a syphilis patient. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1054.0s)]
*  Therefore, kissing with a syphilis patient. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1061.0s)]
*  If you have that horny and you're in the fucking hospital with them, come on, just one kiss. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1064.0s)]
*  That deleted scene from Patch Adams. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1068.0s)]
*  He's smooching all the sailors when they get back from... [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1070.0s)]
*  He's like, they don't have much time to live. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1073.0s)]
*  Trying to make them feel better. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1075.0s)]
*  Yeah, they need this. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1076.0s)]
*  To give them some love. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1077.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, what the fuck? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1078.0s)]
*  You're on a deathbed. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1079.0s)]
*  I would smooch someone on the deathbed. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1080.0s)]
*  Easy. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1082.0s)]
*  Yeah, especially if you love them. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1083.0s)]
*  Yeah, you have to. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1084.0s)]
*  When you're worried about a little syphilis. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1085.0s)]
*  They cure that now. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1087.0s)]
*  Also, there's no way that I'm not dying before my wife. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1088.0s)]
*  Is your wife healthy? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1091.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1093.0s)]
*  What's that supposed to mean, Joe? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1094.0s)]
*  Not that healthy, Sam. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1095.0s)]
*  I'm okay. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1096.0s)]
*  I think you're a comedian. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1097.0s)]
*  I am a comedian. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1098.0s)]
*  You're a very funny guy. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1099.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1100.0s)]
*  Most funny guys are out of their fucking minds. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1101.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1103.0s)]
*  And it presents itself in a bunch of different ways. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1104.0s)]
*  So when you say something like that, it kind of opens the door for me to say, well, why [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1105.0s)]
*  would that be, Sam? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1109.0s)]
*  You think I'm in here wearing this 4XL sweatshirt in the Austin heat because I'm confident about [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1110.0s)]
*  my body? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1115.32s)]
*  Well, I think it's just because you don't have a sweet brody t-shirt. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1116.32s)]
*  I don't, dude. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1118.12s)]
*  Positive push. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1119.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1120.12s)]
*  I think if you saw me nude, you'd go, huh. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1121.12s)]
*  No. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1123.12s)]
*  I think I've seen that before. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1124.12s)]
*  You think so? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1125.88s)]
*  Sure. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1126.88s)]
*  I like to think I have a unique situation under here. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1127.88s)]
*  You don't. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1129.12s)]
*  No? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1130.12s)]
*  What? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1131.12s)]
*  I'm like butterbeer. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1132.12s)]
*  It's the average American at the beach. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1133.12s)]
*  It's normal. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1134.12s)]
*  I'm very good at the beach. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1135.12s)]
*  Water is not a problem for me, dude. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1136.12s)]
*  It's those damn sailing vessels that keep trying to harpoon me. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1138.6000000000001s)]
*  When I was a kid, my buddy Jimmy, his dad used to be able to go to the ocean and he [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1140.8400000000001s)]
*  drank a lot of beer and he would float. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1144.4s)]
*  He would literally float. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1146.6000000000001s)]

*  I'm so buoyant. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1151.88s)]

*  rock. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1157.8s)]

*  Well, I'm glad to hear you're jealous of me, Joe. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1160.88s)]
*  Kind of jealous that you could just float. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1164.0800000000002s)]
*  You know what's a fun move for me? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1165.48s)]
*  Laying on the sand and the waves crashing me and spinning me like a nude egg. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1166.92s)]
*  That's my favorite thing to do in the world, man. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1171.0s)]

*  because I had gone through this period where I wasn't coming up with any new material. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1675.8s)]

*  And I still remember the first time I really went on stage and I actually got in the zone [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1724.32s)]
*  for what was considered a zone at the level comic I was and I only was in the zone for [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1732.28s)]
*  about eight seconds. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1737.04s)]

*  What's my next joke? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=1759.16s)]

*  Good for him. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2009.48s)]
*  Because that's what's fucked up about that is that like if you want to get accepted in [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2010.48s)]
*  that religion, they have a thing about gay people. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2013.48s)]
*  Like in a lot of religions, not just that one, not just Christianity. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2016.48s)]
*  But so Andrew Caldwell, Mr. Delivered. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2019.48s)]
*  It's spelled wrong. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2024.48s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2025.48s)]
*  Delivered. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2026.48s)]
*  But that's the best way to say it. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2027.48s)]
*  I am delivered. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2029.48s)]
*  That's good branding. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2030.48s)]
*  That's not bad. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2031.48s)]
*  Now we helped him give him a little boost. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2032.48s)]
*  It's just fucked that you can't be both religious and gay. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2035.48s)]
*  Like what? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2038.48s)]
*  Come on. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2039.48s)]
*  Gay guys are super fun. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2040.48s)]
*  Black guys are super fun. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2041.48s)]
*  Gay black guys? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2042.48s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2043.48s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2044.48s)]
*  There's no much fun. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2045.48s)]
*  They don't need the greatest church of all time. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2046.48s)]
*  It's the great, well I don't know, the church. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2047.48s)]
*  Gay black church? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2048.48s)]
*  I think they call that the club. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2049.48s)]
*  That's true too. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2050.48s)]
*  It's just a foam party. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2051.48s)]
*  Yeah dude, when we lived in Hollywood, right down the street from the comic store was Boys [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2052.48s)]
*  Town. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2056.96s)]
*  If you drove there on the way to the 405, it's five blocks apart. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2057.96s)]
*  It's going off. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2061.48s)]
*  They're going off. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2062.48s)]
*  Yeah dude. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2063.48s)]
*  You just randomly see dudes with like chaps on and cowboy hats with no shirt. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2064.48s)]
*  Just kissing on the street. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2069.48s)]
*  Wearing sunglasses at 3 a.m. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2070.48s)]
*  Yeah, they always joke around about it, but it's like five blocks of no one saying no. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2072.48s)]
*  Because it's all yang, no yin, and no one can get pregnant. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2076.48s)]
*  Suck my tongue. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2079.48s)]
*  It's a lot of that. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2080.48s)]
*  Okay, here's the suck my tongue thing. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2082.48s)]
*  Here's the problem with that video. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2084.48s)]
*  Here's the problem with that. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2085.48s)]
*  The whole, the Dalai Lama thing. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2086.48s)]
*  Because the tin foil hat, 4chan style conspiracy theory is that there's elite pedophiles that [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2088.48s)]
*  run the world. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2096.48s)]
*  And I was, I'm always reluctant to buy into that. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2098.48s)]
*  But then I watch a few documentaries, I read a few cases, and then I, you hear about the [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2102.48s)]
*  Epstein Island thing, and then he gets out of it the first time. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2108.48s)]
*  Boys Town, the Franklin scandal. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2111.48s)]
*  There's a bunch of those. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2113.48s)]
*  And you go, how, like, does that still exist? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2114.48s)]
*  Like is it happening right now? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2119.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2120.48s)]
*  And someone's going to uncover it. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2121.48s)]
*  The Catholic Church. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2123.48s)]
*  How crazy is that? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2125.48s)]
*  The Dalai Lama. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2126.48s)]
*  The Dalai Lama. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2127.48s)]
*  I mean, who knows? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2128.48s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2129.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2130.48s)]
*  I don't want to smirk to the Dalai Lama. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2131.48s)]
*  Maybe he just thinks it's fun. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2132.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2133.48s)]
*  It's funny and silly. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2134.48s)]
*  It was a bit he was doing. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2135.48s)]
*  Yeah, a little funny thing. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2136.48s)]
*  We've all bombed. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2137.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2138.48s)]
*  We've all had a boy suck our tongue. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2139.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2140.48s)]
*  If you thought it was going to get a laugh. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2141.48s)]
*  Yeah, if he thought it would kill you, it's a good closer. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2142.48s)]
*  Yeah, just a freak, it's shock jock stuff. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2145.48s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2148.48s)]
*  He's like Bubba the love sponge. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2149.48s)]
*  I don't like Bubba. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2150.48s)]
*  I got nothing against Bubba. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2151.48s)]
*  It's an hilarious name. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2153.48s)]
*  Bubba's a good guy. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2154.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2155.48s)]
*  Maybe it's ... [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2156.48s)]
*  I think that it's legit, man. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2160.48s)]
*  Maybe it's just ... [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2161.48s)]
*  But is it chicken or the egg? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2162.48s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2163.48s)]
*  That's the thing that people always say about whatever it's child molesters in particular, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2164.48s)]
*  that someone did it to them. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2170.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2172.48s)]
*  And that they're somehow ... [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2173.48s)]
*  Heard people, heard people. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2174.48s)]
*  Yeah, and that they're somehow or another paused in that stage of their emotional development [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2175.48s)]
*  where they got raped. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2180.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2181.48s)]
*  It's like when you hear an adult woman who still talks like a nine-year-old girl. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2182.48s)]
*  You're like, oh no. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2185.48s)]
*  What happened here? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2186.48s)]
*  Some girls do that just to play dumb with you. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2188.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2190.48s)]
*  It's like a real piano. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2191.48s)]
*  Boy, do I fall for that. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2192.48s)]
*  And then you hear them on the phone with their accountant. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2193.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2194.48s)]

*  You have an accountant? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2196.48s)]
*  This bitch can talk. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2197.48s)]
*  Why are you fucking me? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2198.48s)]
*  How come she can talk so well? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2199.48s)]
*  When she's around me, she plays dumb. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2200.48s)]
*  That'd be a great move for a girl. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2203.48s)]
*  Go after some old billionaire. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2205.48s)]
*  Anna Nicole Smith. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2208.48s)]
*  Well, I don't think she played. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2209.48s)]
*  I think that was a real clear transactional agreement. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2211.48s)]
*  Dude, she got me going as a young buck. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2214.48s)]

*  Yes. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2222.48s)]
*  Big hair. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2223.48s)]
*  That was like a 160-pounder. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2224.48s)]
*  I'd bet 220 by the end. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2225.48s)]
*  Yeah, the end is not what I'm going on. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2227.48s)]
*  Oh, I'm going on the end. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2229.48s)]

*  Yeah, when I could actually get her. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2231.48s)]
*  When I had a shot. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2233.48s)]
*  The end, if you just had a bag of pills, she'd be nervous. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2235.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you'd just shake her. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2238.48s)]
*  That's her in the early, early days. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2239.48s)]

*  I think top to bottom. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2257.48s)]
*  I see no faults in her. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2259.48s)]
*  Yeah, well, she's a fucking genetic specimen. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2260.48s)]
*  And then there's a lot of, you know, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2263.48s)]
*  surgical intervention. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2265.48s)]
*  Thank you, Jamie. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2266.48s)]
*  Thank you for bringing me back. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2267.48s)]
*  Isn't it fascinating that, like, big, giant fake tits [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2269.48s)]
*  are so attractive to men and so obvious? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2272.48s)]
*  It's like the most obvious trick of all time. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2275.48s)]
*  The most obvious trick. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2278.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2279.48s)]
*  Like, we know 100% of the time when they're fake, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2280.48s)]
*  and no one cares. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2282.48s)]
*  Well, we also love up-close magic, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2284.48s)]
*  and we know that's a ruse. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2285.48s)]
*  Yeah, but up-close magic is, like, way more deceptive. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2287.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2291.48s)]
*  You know, they're really good. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2292.48s)]
*  I had David, you know what I'm saying? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2293.48s)]
*  Like, what is he doing? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2295.48s)]
*  What is he doing? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2297.48s)]
*  David Blaine freaked me the fuck out, man, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2298.48s)]
*  because he did... [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2300.48s)]
*  Jamie's good at spotting this shit, too. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2301.48s)]
*  And Jamie sat there. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2303.48s)]
*  He goes, I'm just going to watch everything he does. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2304.48s)]
*  I'm going to keep my eyes on him, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2306.48s)]
*  and I'm going to try to figure out what he's doing. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2307.48s)]
*  And he could not figure it out. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2309.48s)]
*  And the dude rolled his sleeves up, too, to show it. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2310.48s)]
*  It was wild shit. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2312.48s)]
*  He was doing some wild shit. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2313.48s)]
*  He was doing some sleight of hand that was like... [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2314.48s)]
*  He might know real witchcraft. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2317.48s)]
*  This might be, like, one of them comic book things [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2319.48s)]
*  where God makes a living, like, being a magician, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2321.48s)]
*  but he's actually a wizard. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2324.48s)]
*  Indefinitely. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2326.48s)]
*  Game [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2327.48s)]
*  Delft still had to pay the bills. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2328.96s)]
*  Didn't you feel like that? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2329.96s)]
*  He's a wizard. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2330.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2331.96s)]
*  It's not real. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2332.96s)]
*  He's not a real person. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2333.96s)]
*  I also didn't want to know, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2334.96s)]
*  because then it ruins it. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2335.96s)]
*  That does, dude. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2336.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2337.96s)]
*  But then he made me do things that was, like, totally real. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2338.96s)]
*  Like, when I stuck that metal rod through his skin, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2339.96s)]
*  I'm like, I know what you're doing. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2341.96s)]
*  You just can deal with pain. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2342.96s)]
*  Did you see what happened to him recently [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2343.96s)]
*  at his show in Vegas? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2344.96s)]
*  No. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2345.96s)]
*  Two accidents happened. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2346.96s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2347.96s)]
*  With Blaine? [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2348.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2349.96s)]
*  One, the first one was crazy, but then another one happened. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2350.96s)]
*  First one, you know the... [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2351.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2352.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2353.96s)]
*  It's an illusion if you go over there, there's like a spike, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2355.44s)]
*  and then there's bags or cups over one of the spikes, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2359.7200000000003s)]
*  and you've got to figure out... [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2361.92s)]
*  Oh, and he hit a spike? [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2362.92s)]
*  He pulled someone from the crowd, and they picked the wrong one, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2363.92s)]
*  and his hand went right through it. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2365.92s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2366.92s)]
*  A guy in the audience did? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2367.92s)]
*  It was a woman, but yeah. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2368.92s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2369.92s)]
*  A woman's hand... [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2370.92s)]
*  No, no. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2371.92s)]
*  Put his hand through it. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2372.92s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2373.92s)]
*  Not someone from the audience, sorry. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2374.92s)]
*  Oh. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2375.92s)]
*  And then another one, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2376.92s)]
*  he jumped off of a very high thing into boxes [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2377.92s)]
*  and hit the ground and separated his shoulder. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2380.96s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2383.12s)]
*  And then he had to have doctors from the crowd come in [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2384.2799999999997s)]
*  and try to put it back in place. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2385.88s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2387.44s)]
*  In the middle of the show, it took like an hour. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2388.44s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2390.88s)]
*  This sounds like a work, man. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2391.88s)]
*  And he finished with a separated shoulder. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2392.88s)]
*  It sort of seems that way, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2393.88s)]
*  because you've seen enough of his show. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2394.88s)]
*  I don't think so, man. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2395.88s)]
*  I think he's a fascinating guy. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2396.88s)]
*  Really fucking smart dude, and really nice guy too. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2399.96s)]
*  And he is obsessed with... [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2402.92s)]
*  First of all, the sleight of hand shit, it's insane, right, Jamie? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2406.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2410.24s)]
*  Yeah, no, for sure. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2411.24s)]
*  When you were watching it, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2412.3599999999997s)]
*  tell me you weren't absolutely blown away. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2413.3599999999997s)]
*  There's extra stuff going on that you can't even... [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2415.64s)]
*  You'd have to break it down for about an hour or two [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2417.68s)]
*  with someone that's really smart. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2419.52s)]
*  You'd have to watch him on high speed video [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2420.52s)]
*  and then slow it down to a couple frames a second. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2423.2s)]
*  Here's the jumping accident. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2427.64s)]
*  I don't want to watch this. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2430.52s)]
*  You can barely tell what happens. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2431.9599999999996s)]
*  Oh, dude, I can tell what happens. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2434.08s)]
*  That's fear factor. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2437.3999999999996s)]
*  Bro, that shit's ridiculous. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2438.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm glad he wore a lav mic for that. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2439.56s)]
*  They edited together this video. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2449.2000000000003s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2451.2000000000003s)]
*  He was in pain there. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2452.2000000000003s)]
*  So he's a skilled magician and he's also willing to get hurt. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2453.7000000000003s)]
*  And he also is willing to stand on ice for three days. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2457.88s)]
*  What the fuck did he do? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2460.6s)]
*  That's not magic though. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2462.08s)]
*  No, well neither was the standing on ice thing. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2463.08s)]
*  He did a lot of those weird things. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2465.88s)]
*  There's a magic to that though. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2466.88s)]
*  It's like mind over matter. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2468.16s)]
*  It's like an ancient kind of magic from a time before language. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2470.04s)]
*  If it was real mind over matter, you could do it forever. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2473.7599999999998s)]
*  It's not mind over matter. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2477.44s)]
*  It's just will. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2478.8399999999997s)]
*  You just have to be able to tolerate extreme cold and just deal with it. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2480.08s)]
*  And you do breathing exercises to force your body heat to stay warmer. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2484.08s)]
*  But then there's also the contact of your skin versus the cold that will eventually. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2488.08s)]
*  You get a thermal layer. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2492.68s)]
*  One of the things that happens when you put ice on something is it develops a thermal [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2493.68s)]
*  layer. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2497.64s)]
*  Your skin gets really red underneath it. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2498.64s)]
*  If you ever look at your arm when you pull the ice off, it gets all red. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2500.44s)]
*  When you get out of an ice bath, your skin is super red. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2506.28s)]
*  And that's what's going on. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2509.12s)]
*  You develop a thermal layer. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2510.12s)]
*  I look like a newborn baby after an ice bath. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2511.12s)]
*  I'm so pink. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2513.6800000000003s)]
*  I think the same thing probably applies to that. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2514.84s)]
*  I think after a while, the parts that are touching the ice, it doesn't bother you as [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2519.6800000000003s)]
*  much anymore. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2523.84s)]
*  Whether it's the bottom of your feet, you could get frostbite. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2525.36s)]
*  Did he have anything under his feet? [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2527.8399999999997s)]
*  When he did the ice, he was clothed. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2529.88s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2531.68s)]
*  Well, that makes more sense. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2532.68s)]
*  Probably have to be so your body doesn't touch the ice. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2534.8399999999997s)]
*  Just encased. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2538.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2539.24s)]
*  So basically. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2540.24s)]
*  He went full in C-O-Man. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2541.92s)]
*  If you have, I don't know what he was wearing, but you can wear some stuff that's remarkably [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2543.04s)]
*  warm even if it gets wet like merino wool. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2548.4s)]
*  You can wear a merino wool layer. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2554.24s)]
*  He could have a thick layer. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2556.52s)]
*  What is he wearing when he was in the ice? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2557.52s)]
*  He's shirtless right there. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2559.4s)]
*  Does he go out to take a leak? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2560.4s)]
*  Three days. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2562.76s)]
*  No. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2563.76s)]
*  That's the only way he warms up. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2564.76s)]
*  Buried alive. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2565.76s)]
*  Block of ice for two days. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2566.76s)]
*  So he's in a block of ice shirtless for two days? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2567.96s)]
*  Seems like he took it off because he has... [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2570.6000000000004s)]
*  So he's like, man, it's hot as fuck in here. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2572.48s)]
*  We sure that's not Drake? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2575.2400000000002s)]
*  He's a handsome fellow, isn't he? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2576.2400000000002s)]

*  Yep. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2585.2400000000002s)]
*  Like I said, super nice guy, too. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2587.16s)]
*  That's how I see myself in my head. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2589.08s)]
*  That's how I think I look up top. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2591.6s)]
*  By the way, he was doing magic tricks for everybody. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2593.04s)]

*  I felt bad. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2607.72s)]
*  He didn't say anything. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2609.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't think he did. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2610.7599999999998s)]

*  You can't, but if you can get him from the front and see the hands moving. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2622.1600000000003s)]
*  He was showing someone else the thing and I walked up behind him with my camera and [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2626.2000000000003s)]
*  I was like, this feels. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2628.96s)]
*  Couldn't he make the footage disappear? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2630.5600000000004s)]
*  He can make Jamie disappear. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2632.6000000000004s)]
*  He could with that body. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2634.1600000000003s)]
*  Send Jamie to Epstein's Island. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2635.1600000000003s)]

*  There's a video recently about this Epstein Island thing. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2641.1600000000003s)]
*  I was trying to figure this out to show without showing what they showed. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2644.56s)]
*  I was trying to prove it. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2647.56s)]
*  If you go back on Google Maps, this pot right here, which used to be a tennis court. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2648.56s)]
*  Let me put it on the screen. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2653.56s)]
*  It looks like there were. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2654.56s)]
*  Dungeons? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2658.56s)]
*  The digging of some kind of multiple small holes. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2659.56s)]
*  Little graves? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2662.56s)]
*  Tiny graves? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2663.56s)]
*  Let me show you the picture. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2664.56s)]

*  Wait a minute. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2669.56s)]
*  First of all, why would you do that when you have the ocean right there? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2670.56s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2672.56s)]
*  Also, one of those creeps doesn't want to eat the kid after he fucks it. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2673.96s)]
*  But if you drop someone a dead body in the ocean, I would think that would be a way better [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2675.96s)]
*  way of disposing a dead body. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2680.16s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2681.16s)]
*  And then you have chum. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2682.16s)]
*  And no one's going to notice it. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2683.16s)]
*  No. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2686.16s)]
*  It's a tennis court. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2687.16s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2688.16s)]

*  They put up this weird wall. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2695.16s)]

*  Nice lady. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2770.96s)]
*  Very nice lady. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2771.96s)]
*  Sounds great. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2772.96s)]
*  Sweet art of a lady. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2773.96s)]
*  That was the thought she had to communicate to you. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2774.96s)]
*  She just wanted to let me know, I'm a patriot as well. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2775.96s)]
*  Like, oh no, what if I, I got to look at some of them TikTok clips. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2778.96s)]
*  People are getting the wrong impression of me. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2781.96s)]
*  I fucking was a Bernie Sanders supporter. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2784.96s)]
*  These people are so silly. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2787.96s)]
*  People love to fucking try and make people into what they aren't. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2789.96s)]
*  Oh my god, they try to force them into a narrative. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2792.96s)]
*  Well, for me, it's just because, first of all, it looks like I should be. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2794.96s)]
*  I'm a meathead. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2798.96s)]
*  I'm covered in tattoos. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2800.96s)]
*  And I do cage fighting commentary. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2801.96s)]
*  And I'm a dirty comedian. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2803.96s)]
*  There's no way you're progressive. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2805.96s)]
*  And I have offensive comedy. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2806.96s)]
*  So you get just lumped in. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2810.96s)]
*  But it's fun to be lumped in. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2812.96s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2814.96s)]
*  One thing that happens is people severely underestimate your ability to have a conversation with them about things. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2815.96s)]
*  If they're cocky and shitty, some people just say things. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2822.96s)]
*  They don't even know what they're talking about. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2826.96s)]
*  They're repeating a narrative. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2828.96s)]
*  And you say, actually, that's not true. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2829.96s)]
*  Here's why it's not true. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2831.96s)]
*  And then you see this look of panic when they realize that they're going on assumptions. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2832.96s)]
*  So they went back on the land here. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2838.96s)]
*  And this was in 2006. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2840.96s)]
*  That's what it looked like. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2841.96s)]
*  What the fuck. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2842.96s)]
*  Which is when, obviously, they were there and that stuff was going on still. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2844.96s)]
*  And those aren't just like where baby turtle eggs were laid? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2847.96s)]
*  Or it doesn't appear that way. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2851.96s)]
*  No, no, it seems like it's pretty high up. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2853.96s)]
*  I think that's where the tapes are, buddy. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2855.96s)]
*  I wouldn't say bodies. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2857.96s)]
*  I would say if you're going to bury bodies, you'd bury them in the ocean. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2859.96s)]
*  Or you burn them. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2863.96s)]
*  Yeah, you could do that. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2864.96s)]
*  You could burn them and take them out to the ocean. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2865.96s)]
*  Like, why would you, when you have the best place to get rid of a body ever, why would you put the shittiest place to get rid of a body? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2867.96s)]
*  Sand. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2873.96s)]
*  Shallow grave. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2874.96s)]
*  Shallow grave in a very obvious place where people could photograph it with satellites when you're already some sort of intelligence operation. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2875.96s)]
*  Like, get the fuck out of here. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2883.96s)]
*  When you have Masad behind you, you're going to dig poppers' graves? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2884.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2887.96s)]
*  And last, you're so cocky. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2888.96s)]
*  Like, fucking put them anywhere. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2889.96s)]
*  Who gives a fuck? [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2890.96s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2891.96s)]
*  We're untouchable. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2892.96s)]
*  This is one of the last things I remember hearing when he died was that he had a big giant cement truck shipped out to the island. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2893.96s)]
*  Before damning, expose was released, paying for machine up front so it would arrive quicker. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2898.96s)]
*  As experts say, he could have literally covered up evidence. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2904.96s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2907.96s)]
*  That is bad branding. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2908.96s)]
*  Pedophile Island? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2909.96s)]
*  They should have fought for something different. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2910.96s)]
*  You know that island's still for sale. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2912.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2913.96s)]
*  You thinking about it? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2914.96s)]
*  We had discussions about purchasing it for a podcast island. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2915.96s)]
*  Doing the podcast in that big mosque. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2920.96s)]
*  What does he have? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2924.96s)]
*  That temple. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2925.96s)]
*  Temple. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2926.96s)]
*  Yeah, that temple. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2927.96s)]
*  This is the thought. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2928.96s)]
*  The temple's beautiful on the outside. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2929.96s)]
*  It's like the colors of the Israeli flag. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2931.96s)]
*  Soundproof in there already. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2933.96s)]
*  There's no way he's Masad. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2934.96s)]
*  It's not like he has a fucking building the color of the Israeli flag. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2936.96s)]
*  I mean, that's like if you went to Kid Rock's house and it had a fucking giant billiard hall that's covered in an American flag from the roof. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2941.96s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2949.96s)]
*  This guy literally, this is how much he supports Israel. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2950.96s)]
*  He turned his fucking temple into an Israeli flag. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2953.96s)]
*  It's on the nose. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2956.96s)]
*  It's so on the nose. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2957.96s)]
*  If you put that in a script, they'd be like, yeah. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2958.96s)]
*  So on the nose. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2960.96s)]
*  We would have to hire a couple Jews for representation because we want to make sure that this is appropriate. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2961.96s)]
*  Just have Ari live there. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2967.96s)]
*  Yes, Ari will run the island. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2968.96s)]
*  Ari needs a podcast studio and he likes to be away from people. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2970.96s)]
*  So maybe that's actually a good spot for him. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2973.96s)]
*  You're doing him a favor. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2975.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2976.96s)]
*  It's probably a good idea. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2977.96s)]
*  And it's a write-off. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2978.96s)]
*  But if you if you bought Pedophile Island, you would have to destroy all the buildings. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2979.96s)]
*  I'm sure they're all bugged to hell. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2985.96s)]
*  With some high tech shit that you're never going to be able to spot. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2987.96s)]
*  There's a camera in every toilet in there. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2990.96s)]
*  Which would be terrible for comedians. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2992.96s)]
*  They talk so much shit. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2993.96s)]
*  I know. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2994.96s)]
*  They try to be silly. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2995.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2996.96s)]
*  And if you got audio of that. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2997.96s)]
*  But then again, it's one thing if you're on the Pedophile Island. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=2998.96s)]
*  But if you riff and use the N word, it's all over for you. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3001.96s)]
*  And here's the other thing with AI today. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3005.96s)]
*  How would you even know what's real? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3008.96s)]
*  How the fuck would you even know? [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3010.96s)]
*  Is this it? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3011.96s)]
*  This guy snuck up there. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3012.96s)]
*  I don't know when. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3013.96s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3014.96s)]
*  Look at that place. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3015.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3016.96s)]
*  Bro, that place is dope. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3017.96s)]
*  That looks almost Alex Gray style. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3018.96s)]
*  Look how beautiful it is. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3019.96s)]
*  It is. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3020.96s)]
*  It's really just a facade. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3021.96s)]
*  But we don't know what's underneath it. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3022.96s)]
*  Because that door is not real, right? [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3023.96s)]
*  J.E. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3025.96s)]
*  The door is painted. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3026.96s)]
*  It could be J.R. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3027.96s)]
*  There's a window. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3028.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3029.96s)]
*  J.R.E. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3030.96s)]
*  J.R.E. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3031.96s)]
*  You can see there's a window there. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3032.96s)]
*  OK. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3033.96s)]
*  What a shitty window. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3034.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3035.96s)]
*  And so inside is that area where we'll set up the tables. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3036.96s)]
*  Nice window. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3039.96s)]
*  And we're going to need Elon's help to get solid satellite Wi-Fi out there. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3040.96s)]
*  Nice view. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3044.96s)]
*  You could just project Tim Dillon's face on the side of it. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3045.96s)]
*  That's kind of small for a studio. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3047.96s)]
*  We might have to expand. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3049.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3050.96s)]
*  Make some more windows. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3051.96s)]
*  It was built for kids. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3052.96s)]
*  This is... [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3053.96s)]
*  They didn't have adults. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3054.96s)]
*  They didn't have adults in mind when they built that thing. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3057.96s)]
*  If you think that's small, you should see the cages. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3060.96s)]
*  Imagine if you go in there. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3062.96s)]
*  It's a bouncy house. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3063.96s)]
*  It's a ball pit. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3064.96s)]
*  I feel like, you son of a bitch. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3065.96s)]
*  I have to take my shoes off still? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3066.96s)]
*  Kids, you guys want to go to the ultimate bouncy house? [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3068.96s)]
*  I'm talking on an island. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3071.96s)]
*  On a private island. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3072.96s)]
*  Just a bouncy house. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3073.96s)]
*  You want to go where Mr. Chuck E. Cheese lives? [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3074.96s)]
*  You know, Alex Jones told me about that place a long time ago. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3077.96s)]
*  It was one of the things that... [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3081.96s)]
*  Alex tells you stuff and he'll say, like, all these things that make sense. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3082.96s)]
*  And then he'll tell you one where you go, wait a minute. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3085.96s)]
*  This was one of the wait a minutes. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3088.96s)]
*  There's an island. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3090.96s)]
*  They take them. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3091.96s)]
*  They have underage girls and they compromise them sexually. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3092.96s)]
*  He's like, what? [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3095.96s)]
*  It's like he's here. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3096.96s)]
*  These guys hung out there apparently. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3097.96s)]
*  These guys hung out on the island? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3099.96s)]
*  I mean, this is close to two years ago. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3100.96s)]
*  Same video. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3102.96s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3103.96s)]
*  They just kept going back. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3104.96s)]
*  Snooping around, yeah. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3105.96s)]
*  Well, I bet there's no one there. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3106.96s)]
*  Like, who the fuck wants to be the guy guarding Pedophile Island? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3108.96s)]
*  Who's the groundskeeper? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3110.96s)]
*  Probably nobody wants to go there. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3111.96s)]
*  I bet you can go there. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3113.96s)]
*  How come taggers haven't showed up yet? [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3114.96s)]
*  You guys are really depressing me. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3116.96s)]
*  Your lack of ambition. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3118.96s)]
*  Let's get some graffiti. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3119.96s)]
*  It's so easy to just tag downtown LA. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3120.96s)]
*  Get out to Pedophile Island and leave your fucking mark. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3122.96s)]
*  You think a moving subway car is cool? [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3125.96s)]
*  Get out there. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3127.96s)]
*  Tag up the temple. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3128.96s)]
*  Imagine if we put that out there in the world. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3129.96s)]
*  We just did. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3131.96s)]
*  And then cut to taggers in fucking speed boats with giant sacks of spray paint [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3132.96s)]
*  or headed towards Pedophile Island. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3139.96s)]
*  It just says Burt Kreischer is fat. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3141.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3143.96s)]
*  I know a guy who's a tagger in LA. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3145.96s)]
*  He's an interesting guy, and he's really good at it. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3148.96s)]
*  He makes cool shit. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3151.96s)]
*  It's an art form. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3152.96s)]
*  It's illegal. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3154.96s)]
*  You shouldn't do it. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3155.96s)]
*  You're doing it to people's houses and shit and property. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3156.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3158.96s)]
*  But most of them don't do it to houses and property. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3159.96s)]
*  No. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3160.96s)]
*  They do it to abandoned buildings, which is fine. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3161.96s)]
*  And they do it to structures under the LA River, which, like, who the fuck is going down there? [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3163.96s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of bridge pillars and shit. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3168.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3169.96s)]
*  The LA River's a weird thing, man. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3170.96s)]
*  It's barely a river. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3171.96s)]
*  You know what it really is? [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3172.96s)]
*  It's an excuse to pollute the ocean. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3173.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3175.96s)]
*  That's really what it is. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3176.96s)]
*  How so? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3177.96s)]
*  Because it runs. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3178.96s)]
*  It's covered in cement. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3179.96s)]
*  It's just a big cement thing. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3180.96s)]
*  And it runs straight into the ocean. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3182.96s)]
*  So any time it rains, all the shit from all the streets gets in that water. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3184.96s)]
*  All the shit. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3190.96s)]
*  And then that shit goes out into the ocean. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3192.96s)]
*  There was a guy that I used to take yoga with. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3195.96s)]
*  He was a yoga instructor from Australia. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3197.96s)]
*  In Australia, he surfed all the time. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3199.96s)]
*  And so when he came to America, that's one of the reasons why he wanted to teach out here on the coast [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3201.96s)]
*  or out there on the coast, is that he could surf all the time. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3205.96s)]
*  And no one told him to not surf after the rain. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3208.96s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3211.96s)]
*  Because apparently, when you surf after heavy rain, like it's been raining right now, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3212.96s)]
*  all the pollution from all the oil and all the cars and all the fucking bottles and cans and everything. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3215.96s)]
*  Use needles. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3222.96s)]
*  It all just goes out that big, giant cement trough into the ocean. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3223.96s)]
*  Just a bunch of spec scripts in there. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3228.96s)]
*  See if you can find what it looks like, what the LA River looks like. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3229.96s)]
*  This is where the big concrete enclosure where they have car races and all the Fast and the Furious movies. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3233.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3238.96s)]
*  A lot of times it's dry. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3239.96s)]
*  And people fish in it. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3240.96s)]
*  There's videos of guys fishing in it and catching the fish and eating them. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3242.96s)]
*  No, what's in there? [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3245.96s)]
*  Carp? Gar? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3246.96s)]
*  I don't know what's in there. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3248.96s)]
*  Probably carp. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3250.96s)]
*  And maybe some other bluegills or something like that. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3252.96s)]
*  Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what's in there. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3256.96s)]
*  But this guy catches them and cooks them and eats them. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3258.96s)]
*  And it's really disturbing because I know you're doing this for the grand buddy. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3260.96s)]
*  You might die from this. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3264.96s)]
*  Who the fuck knows what's in that water? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3266.96s)]
*  Not me. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3268.96s)]
*  So this is the LA River. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3269.96s)]
*  It's really bad. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3271.96s)]
*  Oh, God, dude. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3272.96s)]
*  Look at this. They're just pulling giant chunks of shit. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3273.96s)]
*  There's so much trash. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3276.96s)]
*  And so the LA River, when it runs into the ocean, this fucking dude was out there surfing. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3277.96s)]
*  And he said, dude, he goes, man, I got really, really sick. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3283.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3286.96s)]
*  Like he goes, I just was really bedridden. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3287.96s)]
*  I felt terrible. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3290.96s)]
*  And then people told him, yeah, man, you can't. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3291.96s)]
*  He's like, oh, great. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3293.96s)]
*  It's after the rain. Perfect. No one's out here. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3294.96s)]
*  Great waves. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3296.96s)]
*  You know, kind of stormy. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3297.96s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3298.96s)]
*  But no, buddy, you got to stay the fuck out of there. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3299.96s)]
*  Oh, my God, dude. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3301.96s)]
*  It's really weird, man. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3303.96s)]
*  Crews rescue a man from the rain-swollen LA River. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3304.96s)]
*  Oh, the guy got trapped. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3307.96s)]
*  He was down there fishing. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3308.96s)]
*  I wonder what happened. He probably fell in, man. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3310.96s)]
*  Probably drunk. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3312.96s)]
*  Every time I fall in a river, I've been drunk. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3313.96s)]
*  This is wild. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3315.96s)]
*  So is that the rescue guy? [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3316.96s)]
*  Where's the dude? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3317.96s)]
*  Right here. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3318.96s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3319.96s)]
*  So they got to swing him over? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3320.96s)]
*  That is crazy. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3321.96s)]
*  Imagine rescuing this dipshit going, hey, bro, what the fuck are you doing? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3322.96s)]
*  You're going to get me killed. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3326.96s)]
*  I was waiting for my Uber. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3327.96s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3328.96s)]
*  Oh, he hit the wall. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3329.96s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3330.96s)]
*  Hang on, bitch. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3331.96s)]
*  That guy's not even holding onto that guy. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3332.96s)]
*  Do they have him on a harness? [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3334.96s)]
*  Oh, they do. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3335.96s)]
*  OK, they have him on a harness. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3336.96s)]
*  Look, he's got him in full guard. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3339.96s)]
*  He's got his back mount. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3340.96s)]
*  That guy better watch his neck. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3341.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3344.96s)]
*  So the LA River is kind of fucked. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3345.96s)]
*  Kind of? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3347.96s)]
*  It's kind of not really a river. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3348.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3349.96s)]
*  I mean, it is a river, I guess. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3350.96s)]
*  I don't know what it was before they cemented it up, but that's what it looks like. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3351.96s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3354.96s)]
*  That's a car floating down the LA River. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3355.96s)]
*  And that goes straight into the ocean. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3357.96s)]
*  So all that runoff from all those streets and all those cities and all that pollution, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3359.96s)]
*  I don't think there's a filter that stops it when it gets to the ocean. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3364.96s)]
*  There's not a filter big enough. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3368.96s)]
*  Yeah, there's not a filter big enough. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3369.96s)]
*  Ugh. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3371.96s)]
*  It's kind of crazy. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3372.96s)]
*  It's not kind of crazy. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3373.96s)]
*  There's a great song, LA River, by Honey Honey. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3374.96s)]
*  OK. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3377.96s)]
*  It's a friend's of mine from LA. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3378.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3380.96s)]
*  It's a great song, but it's about how fucked up one of the lines is, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3381.96s)]
*  I thought I saw a body by the weeds. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3385.96s)]
*  That's where River Phoenix died. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3389.96s)]
*  He died in front of the Viper Room, right? [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3391.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3394.96s)]
*  So that's what it looks like with water and without water. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3395.96s)]
*  Show it again without water. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3397.96s)]
*  So when you go down there without water, people are hanging out down there. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3398.96s)]
*  You can skateboard, ride your bike. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3401.96s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3402.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3403.96s)]
*  But there's a lot of fucking sketchy people hanging out. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3404.96s)]
*  And if you're deciding, like, what do you want to do today, man? [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3407.96s)]
*  Let's go down the fucking LA River and start some shit. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3410.96s)]
*  I mean, you're dealing with the dregs of society. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3416.96s)]
*  Let's go beat up some water hobos. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3418.96s)]
*  This is not an iPhone to be found. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3419.96s)]
*  No, dude. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3421.96s)]
*  It's a lot of flip phones. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3422.96s)]
*  A lot of Androids. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3423.96s)]
*  Those old car phones. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3425.96s)]
*  A lot of burner 7-Eleven phones. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3426.96s)]
*  A lot of people just living out of their shopping cart. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3429.96s)]
*  A lot of, like, crazy people, homeless people, wild people. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3432.96s)]
*  Have you seen the shopping carts that are turned into grills? [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3434.96s)]
*  No, but that's a good move. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3437.96s)]
*  That's a really good move. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3438.96s)]
*  Solid move. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3439.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3440.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, shopping carts, you can steal them. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3441.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3442.96s)]
*  And if you just, it's the right metal. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3443.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3444.96s)]
*  Makes sense. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3445.96s)]
*  You just turn it on its side, catch a fish, put it on there. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3446.96s)]
*  The fucked up place in San Francisco, because they pay them. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3448.96s)]
*  They pay them to be homeless. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3450.96s)]
*  They give them money every month. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3451.96s)]
*  And guys move there to be homeless. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3452.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good come-up for the outside people. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3454.96s)]
*  Do you see about that dude, the cash app guy who got stabbed there? [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3457.96s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3460.96s)]
*  There's a video, apparently, of him, like, trying to get help. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3461.96s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3464.96s)]
*  Collapsing, getting back up. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3465.96s)]
*  Begging for help? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3466.96s)]
*  Trying to get help. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3467.96s)]
*  I don't know exactly what it was. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3468.96s)]
*  I didn't want to watch it. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3469.96s)]
*  I don't want to watch a guy die. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3470.96s)]
*  No, it's not my thing. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3472.96s)]
*  Remember Faces of Death? [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3473.96s)]
*  I do. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3475.96s)]
*  You know, I was just talking to the Protector Parks guys today. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3476.96s)]
*  We were talking about this, because I had watched one too many accident videos for the day. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3481.96s)]
*  I was like, how many accidents are you guys seeing? [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3485.96s)]
*  Because on Instagram in particular, I see so many car accidents. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3487.96s)]
*  So many people getting hit when they're on a motorcycle. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3490.96s)]
*  So many people on motorcycles hitting cars and going flying into the air. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3493.96s)]
*  Like, I'm seeing so much of that. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3497.96s)]
*  So much more than I ever saw before. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3499.96s)]
*  You've got to get out of that algorithm, man. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3500.96s)]
*  Oh, it's too late for that. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3502.96s)]
*  Is it? [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3504.96s)]
*  Yeah, my algorithm's chaos. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3505.96s)]
*  Mine's clean. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3506.96s)]
*  What is yours? [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3507.96s)]
*  Mine's pretty good, man. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3508.96s)]
*  What do you got in there? [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3509.96s)]
*  It's large saggy breasts and then cooking videos. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3510.96s)]
*  I have a lot of cooking videos, man. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3512.96s)]
*  But I also have a lot of car accidents. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3514.96s)]
*  Yeah, I don't have any car accidents. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3516.96s)]
*  I have a lot of people getting shot. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3517.96s)]
*  There's a lot of people getting attacked by animals. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3519.96s)]
*  There's a lot of animals attacking other animals. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3522.96s)]
*  What's going on over there, Joe? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3524.96s)]
*  That's what's catching your eye? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3526.96s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3528.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3529.96s)]
*  Well, mine's all like tours of the Amsterdam River and shit. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3530.96s)]
*  Today I spent quite a bit of time watching an eagle paralyze a hyena. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3534.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3539.96s)]
*  He had landed on the hyena's back and he's pulling the hyena's spine apart. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3540.96s)]
*  No, I like that. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3543.96s)]
*  And the hyena has his back legs aren't working. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3544.96s)]
*  So he's trying to drag himself away from this eagle. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3547.96s)]
*  Like Lieutenant Dan. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3549.96s)]
*  He's bouncing around. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3550.96s)]
*  He's actually incredibly strong. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3551.96s)]
*  He can actually suspend his back legs and move with his front arms [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3553.96s)]
*  because hyenas are that strong. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3556.96s)]
*  But this eagle's eating his back. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3557.96s)]
*  It's wild to watch. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3559.96s)]
*  I couldn't escape an eagle. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3561.96s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3562.96s)]
*  Nature's so brutal. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3563.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3564.96s)]
*  You ever see the Mongolians when they have eagles on their arms [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3565.96s)]
*  and they chase them after wolves? [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3568.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3569.96s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3571.96s)]
*  And they have those hoods for the eagles and the hawks. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3572.96s)]
*  That's a beautiful life. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3574.96s)]
*  Living on the Mongolian steppe. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3575.96s)]
*  Just eating horse milk all the time. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3576.96s)]
*  Hunting with a bird. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3578.96s)]

*  I mean currently. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3580.96s)]
*  I don't think those guys do it all the time. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3581.96s)]
*  I think they have competitions out there. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3583.96s)]
*  What's that right there? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3585.96s)]
*  There's another video I saw. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3586.96s)]
*  I was trying to find what this popped up to. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3587.96s)]
*  There's people that do like drive by falconing. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3588.96s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3590.96s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3591.96s)]

*  What the fuck? [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3593.96s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3594.96s)]
*  Because they're not that much bigger than the birds they're jacking. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3595.96s)]
*  It's like if defensive linemen were running around there jacking and eating people. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3598.96s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3603.96s)]
*  If Warren Sapp got loose. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3605.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3607.96s)]
*  They just shove Warren Sapp out of a window. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3608.96s)]
*  Andama Kinsu for sure has eaten someone. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3610.96s)]
*  Derek Wolf was in here the other day. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3612.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3613.96s)]
*  Former Bronco. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3614.96s)]
*  Former Viking. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3615.96s)]
*  Former Bronco. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3616.96s)]
*  Fucking go back in the lineage. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3617.96s)]
*  There's not a doubt in my mind that somewhere in his ancestry there was a bunch of people [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3618.96s)]
*  on a fucking boat waiting to cut people's heads off. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3623.96s)]
*  100%. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3626.96s)]
*  He's a berserker. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3627.96s)]
*  100%. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3628.96s)]
*  Now imagine if guys like him were like that falcon just running around jacking smaller [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3629.96s)]
*  things. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3636.96s)]
*  Like how could... [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3637.96s)]
*  Not that much different. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3638.96s)]
*  A guy like him eating a guy like me is not that much different than a falcon taking out [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3640.96s)]
*  a crow. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3646.96s)]
*  Not that much different. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3647.96s)]
*  Not that different. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3648.96s)]
*  I think he would eat me first. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3649.96s)]
*  He'd eat whoever the fuck he wants to eat. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3651.96s)]
*  We wouldn't stop him from eating you. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3653.96s)]
*  He'd be lucky if he ate you. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3655.96s)]
*  That'd be better than what he also could do to you. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3656.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3658.96s)]
*  I used to have a joke about Brock Lesnar that I'm not worried Brock would rape me. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3659.96s)]
*  I'm worried he would use me as a condom to rape something way bigger. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3662.96s)]
*  I'm like, Brock, why are we going to the zoo? [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3670.96s)]
*  Shut the fuck up! [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3672.96s)]
*  He's just rolling up to the panda cage with you in a bag. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3674.96s)]
*  He shoots the locks off. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3677.96s)]
*  There's a video of Brock Lesnar shooting prairie dogs with a .50 caliber rifle. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3680.96s)]
*  How much prairie dog existed after that? [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3685.96s)]
*  Very little. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3687.96s)]
*  Very little. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3688.96s)]
*  I was like, why would someone do that? [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3689.96s)]
*  But then someone informed me of what prairie dogs do. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3691.96s)]
*  A lot of horses, they fall into their holes and snap their legs. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3694.96s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3697.96s)]
*  Nature sucks, man. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3698.96s)]
*  Nature sucks fat dicks. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3700.96s)]
*  It's no good. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3702.96s)]
*  It's so mean. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3703.96s)]
*  The more I find out about it, the more I want to know less. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3704.96s)]
*  Bro, it's so mean. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3706.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3707.96s)]
*  Dolphins? [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3708.96s)]
*  Dolphins just fucking puffer fish and passing them around, getting high off of them? [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3709.96s)]
*  What I watched today is probably the most ruthless shit. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3713.96s)]
*  I was talking to a friend of mine today, the lady who gives me the IVs. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3716.96s)]
*  I get an IV twice a week, like a vitamin IV, NAD IV. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3720.96s)]
*  And so we're watching, we're talking about nature. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3725.96s)]
*  Did you ever see the hornets killing the bees? [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3729.96s)]
*  Killing the honey bees. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3733.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3734.96s)]
*  Don't they vibrate around them? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3735.96s)]
*  No, no. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3736.96s)]
*  That's how the honey bees kill the hornets. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3737.96s)]
*  But most of the time they don't do that. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3738.96s)]
*  See, the thing is, if the hornets can get into the hive, if there's a crack where they [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3740.96s)]
*  can get into the hive, it's pretty much over. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3744.96s)]
*  They get in there and they kill everything. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3747.96s)]
*  And then they eat the babies. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3749.96s)]
*  So we're watching this today. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3751.96s)]
*  I was like, what kind of fucking bizarre life form are insects? [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3752.96s)]
*  What kind of ruthless shit that's going on right outside of our eyes? [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3757.96s)]
*  See, they got into this crack and they just, they killed the fuck out of everyone. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3762.96s)]
*  They killed 30 honey bees or 30 wasps, killed 30,000 honey bees. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3768.96s)]
*  So they went in there and they just cut all the heads off of 30,000 honey bees. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3775.96s)]
*  And then they got to the main hive and they ate all their babies. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3781.96s)]
*  And that's what they were there for. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3784.96s)]
*  They were there to eat the babies. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3785.96s)]
*  That was the job at hand. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3787.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3788.96s)]
*  So you watch them do it. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3789.96s)]
*  I didn't know how much they could swallow. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3790.96s)]
*  Because I always felt like bees have a weird, like wasps even, have a weird mouth. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3792.96s)]
*  They have like this, like these big pinchers, but I'm like, they don't have like a big opening. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3797.96s)]
*  But watch what they do when they get inside. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3801.96s)]
*  When they get inside and they start pulling the larva out of the honeycombs, dude, they just swallow those fucking things. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3804.96s)]
*  They just pull them out like this here. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3811.96s)]
*  They pull them out and they just start slurping them. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3813.96s)]
*  Like watch how easy he eats this whole thing. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3816.96s)]
*  Like I never would have thought they could swallow that much. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3818.96s)]
*  Look how quick it sucks down. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3821.96s)]
*  Just crushing a booger. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3822.96s)]
*  Just smashing it into little pieces and engulfing it. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3824.96s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3828.96s)]
*  One of those larvae is like the size of its carapace. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3829.96s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3832.96s)]
*  And it's eating the whole thing pretty fucking quickly. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3833.96s)]
*  And that is how they get nutrients for their babies. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3836.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3839.96s)]
*  So they go back and it helps their hive. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3840.96s)]
*  The whole thing is beyond fucked. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3843.96s)]
*  And that's just happening all the time. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3845.96s)]
*  All the time. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3846.96s)]
*  What other atrocities are going on out there? [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3847.96s)]
*  Well, I think those wasps might be invasive. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3849.96s)]
*  I think there's a part of that that's going on where there's invasive wasps that are killing honeybees. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3852.96s)]
*  Let me see if that's true. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3858.96s)]
*  Because I know that's one of the things that they were really worried about when those murder hornets showed up. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3859.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3863.96s)]
*  The murder hornets. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3864.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3865.96s)]
*  Yeah, that was a fun time. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3866.96s)]
*  What a great name. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3867.96s)]
*  Yeah. It's a great band. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3868.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3869.96s)]
*  Really good band. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3870.96s)]
*  Especially fucking rockin'. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3871.96s)]
*  Really rockin'. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3872.96s)]
*  Murder hornets. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3873.96s)]
*  Just a thrash band. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3874.96s)]
*  I'd wear their T-shirt. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3875.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3876.96s)]
*  I'd wear a bandana that had their shit on it. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3877.96s)]
*  That's how you know you're into the band. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3878.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3879.96s)]
*  When you show up like Dog the Bounty Hunter. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3880.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3881.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3882.96s)]
*  I think some of them were invasive. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3883.96s)]
*  But obviously they know what the fuck they're doing. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3885.96s)]
*  They go in there and they murder everybody. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3887.96s)]
*  I mean that's the definition of invasive is eating someone's young after you crush them. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3888.96s)]
*  And eating 30, killing, just chopping the heads off 30,000 of them. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3892.96s)]
*  Invasive murder hornets are officially back in the U.S. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3895.96s)]
*  Finally. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3898.96s)]
*  They've entered the slaughter phase. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3899.96s)]
*  What is this, the purge? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3900.96s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3901.96s)]
*  So those are the ones, man. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3902.96s)]
*  Did you know that hornets pollinate too? [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3905.96s)]
*  They have to do something. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3907.96s)]
*  They all pollinate. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3908.96s)]
*  I figure they serve some purpose out there. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3909.96s)]
*  They just don't make honey, I don't think. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3911.96s)]
*  I know my grandmother lived in fear of that. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3913.96s)]
*  I take murder honey all day. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3914.96s)]

*  Right now? [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3923.96s)]
*  Yeah, we could do it. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3924.96s)]
*  What's it going to do to us? [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3925.96s)]
*  You're going to freak out a little bit. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3926.96s)]
*  We have those shows this evening. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3927.96s)]
*  What are you worried about? [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3928.96s)]
*  I know that guy who owns the club. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3929.96s)]
*  We're fine. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3930.96s)]

*  Where's the murder honey? [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3932.96s)]
*  Honey? [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3933.96s)]
*  I don't know where it is. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3934.96s)]
*  Where did you get your hands on murder honey? [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3936.96s)]
*  Mad honey. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3937.96s)]
*  It's from Nepal. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3938.96s)]
*  It's those guys that do psychedelic honey. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3939.96s)]
*  I've seen those videos. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3940.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3941.96s)]
*  Psychedelic is a strong word for what I experienced. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3942.96s)]
*  What did you experience? [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3943.96s)]
*  I didn't take much. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3944.96s)]
*  I just experienced a light euphoria. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3945.96s)]
*  It was kind of interesting. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3946.96s)]
*  Apparently, if you go too much, it's really rough. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3947.96s)]
*  I love euphoria. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3948.96s)]
*  Great show, great feeling. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3949.96s)]

*  You should watch some snippets of it. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3966.96s)]
*  I'll send you some clips. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3967.96s)]
*  Isn't it like a bunch of kids banging each other? [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3968.96s)]
*  Yeah, but they're of age legally. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3969.96s)]
*  Oh, good. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3970.96s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3972.96s)]
*  It's not just fucking deleted scenes from Epstein's discs. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3973.96s)]
*  Is that it? [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3976.96s)]
*  Let me see. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3977.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3978.96s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3979.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's made from like... [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3980.96s)]
*  It seems like it's broken up. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3981.96s)]
*  Dutura. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3982.96s)]
*  So do you think we shake it? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3983.96s)]
*  Dutura is scary, apparently. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3984.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3985.96s)]
*  I never fucked with that. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3986.96s)]

*  No, dude. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3988.96s)]
*  Dutura is supposed to... [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3989.96s)]
*  It melts people's brains. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3990.96s)]
*  Dutura is... [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3991.96s)]
*  Terrence McKenna swore off of it... [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3992.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3994.96s)]
*  ...when he was talking to a guy in an open-air market. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3995.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3998.96s)]
*  And the guy thought that they were back at his house. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=3999.96s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4000.96s)]
*  In the living room. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4001.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4002.96s)]
*  And he realized somewhere along the line of the conversation, the guy didn't know where [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4003.96s)]
*  he was. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4005.96s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4006.96s)]
*  Like right now, in the moment, in an open-air market, he thought that he was in his apartment. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4007.96s)]
*  That sounds like a fun thing to do here on the podcast. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4011.96s)]
*  Come on, buddy. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4013.96s)]
*  Hey, man. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4014.96s)]
*  You're here. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4015.96s)]
*  Let's freak it out. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4016.96s)]
*  You're in Texas. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4017.96s)]
*  I know. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4018.96s)]
*  They love mad honey here. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4019.96s)]
*  He got stopped at the TSA. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4021.96s)]
*  Just a jar of that shit? [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4024.96s)]
*  No, because they were making sure he wasn't traveling with the stuff after he did the [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4026.96s)]
*  podcast. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4031.96s)]
*  That's good. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4032.96s)]
*  Do we know the dosage on this, Jamie? [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4033.96s)]
*  This is totally legal, by the way. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4034.96s)]
*  Good. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4035.96s)]
*  That was my biggest fear, was breaking the law. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4036.96s)]
*  Is mad honey legal? [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4038.96s)]
*  Just take a little teaspoon. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4039.96s)]
*  Just get in there. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4040.96s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4044.96s)]
*  What, are you scared? [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4045.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4046.96s)]
*  That's more than I took the last time. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4047.96s)]
*  Oh, good. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4049.96s)]
*  All right. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4050.96s)]
*  Does it taste like honey? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4051.96s)]
*  It is honey. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4054.96s)]
*  Yeah, it definitely tastes delicious. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4055.96s)]
*  It tastes like ... [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4057.96s)]
*  It smells bizarre. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4058.96s)]
*  Don't take too much. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4059.96s)]
*  I won't. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4060.96s)]

*  Just really get the spoon wet and then suck the spoon. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4064.96s)]
*  I'm like the Dalai Lama. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4066.96s)]
*  Then think about all the diseases you could be getting from me. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4067.96s)]
*  I don't fear those. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4072.96s)]

*  I'm not going for seconds. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4082.96s)]
*  Don't fucking do it, Sam. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4083.96s)]
*  No. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4084.96s)]

*  If the Cheesecake Factory sent Antifa a cheesecake for 10 more years of chaos, a celebratory. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4394.5199999999995s)]
*  If only ISIS had bear claw donuts, I'm still eating those fucking donuts. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4404.48s)]
*  On the other hand, I love Kid Rock's video because I love that. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4407.92s)]
*  Cheers. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4411.32s)]
*  I love that kind of thinking. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4412.48s)]
*  Not even that I agree with it. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4417.08s)]
*  I like wild people. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4419.08s)]
*  I like a dude who takes a machine gun to a stack of Bud Lights and is like, fuck Anheuser [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4420.08s)]
*  Bush. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4426.88s)]
*  This will show up. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4427.88s)]
*  Where is he going to go now? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4428.88s)]
*  You going to go to Coors? [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4430.88s)]
*  Don't they all support LBGTQ plus AI, whatever the hell else they're attaching to issues? [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4432.96s)]
*  They all do. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4439.36s)]
*  From Colorado, Coors has had those rainbow cans forever. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4440.4s)]
*  Fucking Shane Gillis is heartbroken. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4443.799999999999s)]
*  I was with him. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4445.36s)]
*  This is his favorite beer. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4446.36s)]
*  I was opening for him last weekend. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4447.36s)]
*  This is what sucks. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4448.36s)]
*  He drinks Bud Light every time he does Protect Our Parks. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4449.48s)]
*  Those things have fucking millions of views. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4453.04s)]
*  I know. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4455.2s)]
*  Where's his can of beer? [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4456.2s)]
*  He did not, he said the exact same thing. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4457.5599999999995s)]
*  He's problematic. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4460.2s)]
*  Oh yeah, he's an issue, man. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4461.2s)]
*  He's an issue being one of the funniest fucking human beings alive on planet earth. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4462.2s)]
*  And also generous and community minded. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4466.16s)]
*  But for whatever reason, they won't give him a Bud Light. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4469.2s)]
*  They should give him some lips. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4472.44s)]
*  If they were smart, they would send Shane a Bud Light with his face on it too. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4473.44s)]
*  Say, we love everybody. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4477.92s)]
*  Well, the can's not big enough to fit his face. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4478.92s)]
*  That's true. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4481.92s)]
*  It's a big round head. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4482.92s)]
*  You could put like half of his face. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4483.92s)]
*  Like an artsy thing. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4486.92s)]
*  Right, yeah. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4487.92s)]
*  Then you have to put them all together. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4488.92s)]
*  Yeah, there you go. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4489.92s)]
*  Did you get a left side of the face or the right side? [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4490.92s)]
*  Bud Light sponsors the moon? [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4492.92s)]
*  So if you're two fisted, you know. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4494.44s)]
*  No man, I think that it's crazy when people get upset about that stuff because the people [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4497.44s)]
*  who get upset about that stuff value liberty and freedom so much and they want to live [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4503.12s)]
*  their lives undeterred by anyone's rules. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4506.32s)]
*  But they think that the company that they like is giving into the woke agenda. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4508.78s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4513.28s)]
*  There's no woke agenda. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4514.28s)]
*  Well, they think there is in like movies and television and media and commercials. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4515.28s)]
*  They're worried about it in universities. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4523.24s)]
*  They're worried about it in schools and high schools and grammar schools. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4525.12s)]
*  They're worried about it because there is some evidence that some people do try to indoctrinate [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4529.4400000000005s)]
*  children into views that maybe don't align with the parents views. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4533.2s)]
*  Who's right and who's wrong? [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4537.4400000000005s)]
*  That's up to interpretation. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4538.68s)]
*  But the question is like, is it appropriate for someone to be giving their politics or [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4539.68s)]
*  their cultural values that may be opposite of the cultural values of the parents? [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4544.68s)]
*  Is it appropriate for this person who spends probably more time during the day with your [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4550.34s)]
*  kid than you do to do that to your kids all day long? [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4553.84s)]
*  What about religion though? [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4557.2s)]
*  Because you're indoctrinating your kids before they have any say in that? [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4558.2s)]
*  Maybe your kids are atheists and they go to school. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4561.12s)]
*  Still, you're talking about public school. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4562.92s)]
*  You're going to have kids that are all sorts of religions in those public schools and all [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4564.679999999999s)]
*  sorts of non-religions. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4569.24s)]
*  There's going to be a bunch of different flavors of atheism or agnostics or people who just [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4570.24s)]
*  aren't religious at all. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4575.84s)]
*  Those kids are going to school too. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4577.259999999999s)]
*  And if they're getting indoctrinated and they don't want to be, that's the question. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4578.5599999999995s)]
*  It's not saying that it happens all the time. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4583.2s)]
*  There's just enough evidence of it where there's plenty of videos of people actually doing [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4585.599999999999s)]
*  it. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4589.839999999999s)]
*  Like Project Veritas got a bunch of them and the Libs of TikTok got a bunch of them. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4590.839999999999s)]
*  It's really a thing with some people that teach school, but not most of them. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4594.98s)]
*  Most of them are great people who are educators and what they're trying to do and what they [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4599.5199999999995s)]
*  get satisfaction out of if they're good is they try to educate kids and they want them [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4603.759999999999s)]
*  to have a good experience. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4608.0s)]
*  So they look back and they remember, I remember Mrs. Wilson's class. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4609.0s)]
*  She was fucking awesome. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4611.56s)]
*  Like this is one teacher that I had in high school. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4612.56s)]
*  I wish I could remember her name, but everybody went to her because she would talk to you [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4615.08s)]
*  friendly and she was a sweetheart. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4620.08s)]
*  She was a sweet lady. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4621.8s)]
*  She was a really nice lady and she was really good at her job, but like if she fucked up [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4622.8s)]
*  and she was like, you're supposed to have it in. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4627.8s)]
*  Like what happened? [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4629.2s)]
*  Like you felt bad. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4630.2s)]
*  You're like, I'll get, I'll finish it. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4631.2s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4633.08s)]
*  Like you felt bad. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4634.08s)]
*  Sure. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4635.08s)]
*  You wanted to do well in that lady's class. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4636.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4637.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4638.16s)]
*  She was so sweet. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4639.16s)]
*  That's the best example. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4640.16s)]
*  The worst example is some shitty dumb person who gets a job teaching because a lot of people [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4641.16s)]
*  don't want to teach and then they find, because it's very low paying and it doesn't get a [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4645.28s)]
*  lot of reward and praise from people. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4648.8s)]
*  Also parents are a nightmare. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4650.64s)]
*  Parents are a nightmare. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4652.26s)]
*  And then, and then the shitty person is in front of your kids with their really dumb [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4653.26s)]
*  ideas and there's a lot of those people. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4656.44s)]
*  There's a lot of those people and they think what we're going to do is we're going to indoctrinate [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4658.44s)]
*  their children. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4661.92s)]
*  We're going to turn our children against them. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4662.92s)]
*  And there's, there are people like that out there in the world. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4664.28s)]
*  I mean, that's all of them. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4666.4s)]
*  It's like there are bad cops out there in the world, but the most cops are great. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4667.599999999999s)]
*  It's not, it's not like all cops are evil. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4670.639999999999s)]
*  It's like the job is really fucking hard and most people do their best, but some people [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4673.04s)]
*  fucking suck at it. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4678.4s)]
*  Like everything, like plumbers, like everything. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4679.4s)]
*  It's just that with cops, the consequences are so grave. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4682.48s)]
*  And with kids, it's kind of a fucked up situation because if you're a parent and you're working [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4685.12s)]
*  all day and your kids at school all day and they're getting indoctrinated into a set of [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4689.679999999999s)]
*  ideas that don't align with your values or don't align with your sense of the world or [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4693.92s)]
*  you, what you believe reality to be. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4698.72s)]
*  What you want to teach in your home as well. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4700.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, what do you want to teach in your home? [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4701.6s)]
*  So it's like, it's very tricky. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4702.6s)]
*  It's like, what is, what is school supposed to do? [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4704.32s)]
*  Generally it's supposed to educate children, but it's not necessarily supposed to indoctrinate [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4707.72s)]
*  as well though. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4710.88s)]
*  I mean, it's supposed to put them in a situation where they understand like regimented schedules. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4711.88s)]
*  Well that's what it was originally invented for. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4716.08s)]
*  But if you ask someone what's the primary reason for education, it's to, you send these [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4718.24s)]
*  kids to school to teach them about life. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4724.04s)]
*  Teach them history. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4727.36s)]
*  Teach them how to do mathematics. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4728.36s)]
*  Teach them language. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4730.0s)]
*  Teach them fractions. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4731.44s)]
*  Fractions. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=4732.44s)]

*  drinkers. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5112.2s)]

*  So I saw that and I said, well, let me see if this guy's funny. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5158.400000000001s)]

*  I started following you and then finally met you and you got a chance to see the club before [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5165.88s)]
*  it ever got. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5169.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, what stage was it in when you visited? [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5170.320000000001s)]
*  That was probably June of last year. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5172.8s)]
*  So there was no seats. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5176.320000000001s)]
*  Was the cement even poor then? [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5177.4800000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5178.92s)]
*  I love that fucking, do you remember? [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5180.12s)]
*  The swastika? [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5181.6s)]
*  The swastika. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5182.6s)]
*  Listen to this, folks. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5183.6s)]
*  You want to hear a fucking story? [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5184.6s)]
*  So the club that I bought at one point in time, it's called the Ritz Theater. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5185.6s)]
*  The Ritz Theater was a theater from 1927. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5190.52s)]
*  It's been a lot of things. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5192.76s)]
*  And at one point in time, it was a punk rock club. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5194.52s)]
*  It was a pool hall at one point in time. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5196.4s)]
*  It was a nudie movie theater back in the day. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5198.4800000000005s)]
*  Stevie Ray Vaughan played there. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5202.28s)]
*  Like, you know that walkway when you get to the stage, there's a big frame photo of Stevie [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5203.56s)]
*  Ray Vaughan. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5207.88s)]
*  And that photo is Stevie Ray Vaughan on stage at the Ritz in 1983. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5208.88s)]
*  And so a lot of punk rock bands played there. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5213.4800000000005s)]
*  The Butthole Surfers played there. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5216.6s)]
*  Misfits played there. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5218.36s)]
*  A lot of people played there. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5219.36s)]
*  The Dicks, Black Flag. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5220.36s)]
*  And Sombra painted a swastika on the wall. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5221.36s)]
*  Here's where it gets stupid. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5224.04s)]
*  I saw it when we, because we had to take down a lot of stuff and we knocked down the wall [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5225.28s)]
*  board and shit that was covering things. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5232.72s)]
*  And then underneath all that on the brick, you see a swastika. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5235.0s)]
*  And I was like, hey, we should probably take that fucking swastika down. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5238.2s)]
*  And everybody was laughing. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5240.2s)]
*  And so then no one took it down. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5241.8s)]
*  And I came back like two months later, I'm like, hey, why is the fucking swastika still [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5243.8s)]
*  here? [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5248.0s)]
*  So then it gets to, it gets to like, we're almost open. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5249.0s)]
*  It gets to like a month before we're open. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5253.2s)]
*  I'm like, take the fucking swastika. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5255.0s)]
*  Every time I come here, I'm like, how hard is it to just brush that down and knock that [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5257.0s)]
*  off the wall? [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5261.44s)]
*  So you know what someone does? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5262.44s)]
*  They clean it. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5263.68s)]
*  So they clean it and they made it white. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5265.679999999999s)]
*  This is what they did because they clean it with this solvent to take out the black ink. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5268.2s)]
*  And instead they left a white swastika. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5273.719999999999s)]
*  It's more pronounced. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5276.16s)]
*  And I was like, Jesus fucking Christ, do I have to spell this out? [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5277.16s)]
*  That's still a swastika. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5280.88s)]
*  Get rid of it. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5283.719999999999s)]
*  I didn't say enhance the swastika. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5284.719999999999s)]
*  It's way easy to see now. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5286.16s)]
*  Well, you were saying like, I think I'm going to call the club, the room's Fat Man and Little [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5287.839999999999s)]
*  Boy, but I'm a little worried people are going to be upset if they lost someone in World [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5291.639999999999s)]
*  War II. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5294.76s)]
*  And I was like, well, you know what else might piss some people off, Joe? [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5295.76s)]
*  That fucking huge swastika up there. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5297.52s)]
*  That should have already been gone. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5299.360000000001s)]
*  The Fat Man and Little Boy thing is in reference. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5301.56s)]
*  The whole reason for it, the thing is UFO themed. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5303.76s)]
*  And in the UFO lore, the UFOs come right after the detonation of Fat Man and Little Boy. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5306.360000000001s)]
*  That's why it's named Fat Man and Little Boy because I thought it would be, plus one's [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5312.68s)]
*  big and one's small. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5315.96s)]
*  It worked with the theme. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5317.68s)]
*  In UFO folklore, that's like what happened. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5319.08s)]
*  It makes sense. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5322.12s)]
*  If you look at the recorded sightings, it's obviously the news before 1947 is kind of [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5323.12s)]
*  sketchy anyway. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5328.6s)]
*  It's like, who knows what was reported. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5329.6s)]
*  But after 1947, there's a shitload of sightings. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5331.76s)]
*  A lot of, there's UFOs that flew over the White House and they were filmed. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5335.44s)]
*  There's photographs of them. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5340.04s)]
*  There's the Roswell crash, which was in 1947. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5341.84s)]
*  Been down there a couple of times. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5345.2s)]
*  Have you been there? [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5346.84s)]
*  My old man loves UFOs. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5347.84s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5348.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5349.84s)]
*  We've been to Mexico, so we've driven down to Roswell two or three times. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5350.88s)]
*  It's just a tourist trap now. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5353.400000000001s)]
*  I have two brilliant friends that have two completely opposite views. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5355.08s)]
*  What do they think? [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5358.6s)]
*  One brilliant friend is convinced they're from another planet or another dimension. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5360.24s)]
*  This person is from another planet? [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5365.0s)]
*  No. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5366.360000000001s)]
*  Or the aliens? [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5367.360000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5368.360000000001s)]
*  The UFOs. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5369.360000000001s)]
*  That these things people are seeing. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5370.360000000001s)]
*  He said, if you just look at the size of the universe and if you look at all of the possibilities [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5371.360000000001s)]
*  and how life could be advanced a thousand, a hundred thousand, a million years more than [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5378.280000000001s)]
*  us, especially if they're in some sort of a stable environment where they're not in [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5383.68s)]
*  an asteroid belt or anything like that and they don't have super volcanoes on their [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5386.8s)]
*  planet, whatever it is. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5390.4800000000005s)]
*  If they got to a certain level, for sure they'd be able to visit. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5392.080000000001s)]
*  And if they did get to that level, they would be able to do things that we would think is [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5395.92s)]
*  magic and that they would be able to go into the ocean. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5400.6s)]
*  They'd be able to fly off at insane rates of speed and use methods of propulsion that [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5404.08s)]
*  we can't even understand. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5408.4s)]
*  He thinks that's what it is. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5410.88s)]
*  He thinks that they are just observing and probably making sure that we don't knock ourselves [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5411.96s)]
*  back in the Stone Age. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5418.12s)]
*  So they're protectors? [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5419.94s)]
*  No. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5420.94s)]
*  They're shepherds? [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5421.94s)]
*  I think it's probably like an eco-biologist that goes into the jungle and examines species. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5422.94s)]
*  It's like a Darwinian thing. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5429.84s)]
*  Imagine if there was a type of sloth or something in the Amazon that was in danger of dying [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5431.5199999999995s)]
*  and there was a lot of funding behind it and they went there and they wanted to try to [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5437.12s)]
*  rescue the sloth and figure it out. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5439.719999999999s)]
*  They do stuff like that, right? [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5441.759999999999s)]
*  So if we do stuff like that with limited resources and people have to donate money to these things, [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5442.96s)]
*  it's hard for them to get funded. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5447.12s)]
*  Imagine if you're some super advanced civilization from another galaxy and you recognize that [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5449.08s)]
*  one planet has come into nuclear power. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5453.4s)]
*  They have now nuclear capabilities. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5456.44s)]
*  The signal goes out through the universe. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5457.92s)]
*  Okay, these fucks are blowing themselves up. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5459.64s)]
*  These apes figured out. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5461.6s)]
*  Let's go visit. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5462.6s)]
*  Yeah, let's go visit. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5463.6s)]
*  And that's the UFO folklore. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5464.6s)]
*  That's when they all start showing up and that's when you get all the different crazy [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5466.4s)]
*  like Betty and Barney Hill, the abduction stories, all that stuff. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5472.12s)]
*  All that stuff comes after 1947. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5476.84s)]
*  Craziest story about them is they were interracial in the 50s. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5479.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was in Maine or something like that. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5482.04s)]
*  I know one of their granddaughters, Angela Hill. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5486.0s)]
*  She's a fighter. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5490.16s)]
*  She fights in the UFC. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5491.16s)]
*  No way. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5492.16s)]
*  Yeah, she's a top ranked fighter in the UFC. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5493.16s)]
*  Yeah, what's the name of that fighter from Denver? [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5494.72s)]
*  Like the small lady fighter from Colorado? [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5497.32s)]
*  Which one? [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5500.66s)]
*  I don't know, dude. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5501.66s)]
*  She has like short hair and she whips ass. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5502.66s)]
*  There's quite a bit. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5504.16s)]
*  Denver's got a good crop of fighters. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5505.72s)]
*  Yeah, anyway, she's very pretty as well. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5507.6s)]

*  Yeah, I had to. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5527.76s)]
*  My coaches made me wrestle. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5528.76s)]
*  Football coaches did? [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5530.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5531.04s)]
*  Yeah, my wrestling coach tried to get me to play football, but luckily we did when we [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5532.04s)]
*  wrestled. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5535.68s)]
*  There was a kid named Bobby Baker who was 300 pounds. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5536.68s)]
*  And I was like, look at him and look at me. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5538.24s)]
*  I go, I'm not letting that guy chase me and run me over. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5540.6s)]
*  He's not chasing anybody. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5543.639999999999s)]
*  But if I fucked up and I got too close. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5544.639999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5547.44s)]
*  It's those big paws on you. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5548.44s)]
*  He's a bear. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5550.879999999999s)]
*  He was so big. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5551.879999999999s)]

*  I'm like, that's just not happening, man. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5554.16s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5556.24s)]
*  Wrestling is brutal. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5557.24s)]
*  I would play football at 320 and then I'd have to cut to 275. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5558.24s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5561.839999999999s)]
*  Like real quick, you know, because that's like the cutoff for heavyweights in Colorado. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5562.839999999999s)]
*  How much time did you have to cut? [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5566.08s)]
*  Fuck, like six weeks, two months. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5567.839999999999s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5570.0s)]
*  That's a lot of weight. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5571.0s)]
*  I was chasing clementine oranges and chewing tobacco. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5572.04s)]
*  It was terrible. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5574.32s)]
*  You had to chew tobacco? [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5575.32s)]
*  I pissed eight pounds one time. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5576.6s)]
*  I retained so much water that I urinated out eight pounds. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5578.24s)]
*  Wow. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5580.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5581.84s)]
*  Because after you make weight, then you just eat like a whole baguette and a bunch of Pop [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5582.84s)]
*  Tarts, you know? [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5585.08s)]
*  Oh, smart. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5586.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5587.08s)]
*  Well, that's what you do after you finally make weight. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5588.08s)]
*  The fucked up thing about wrestling too is you have to make weight the day of the tournament. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5589.08s)]
*  I know, dude. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5592.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5593.12s)]
*  Wrestling sucks. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5594.12s)]
*  And also, heavyweight wrestling is bad because it's just whoever falls down first wins. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5595.12s)]
*  That's not always true. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5598.72s)]
*  That's the whole thing. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5599.72s)]
*  In my experience, if you went down, the guy laid on you and you're just waiting for the [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5600.76s)]
*  bell. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5604.6s)]
*  It was brutal. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5605.6s)]
*  I was so bad on my feet. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5607.76s)]
*  But then if you're on the bottom, luckily, you can just grab their arm and try and roll [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5609.64s)]
*  with them. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5612.88s)]
*  That's all of heavyweight wrestling. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5613.88s)]
*  How long did you wrestle for? [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5615.52s)]
*  Three years. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5616.52s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5617.52s)]
*  Did you ever think about doing jujitsu or something like that afterwards? [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5618.52s)]
*  No, I don't have it in me. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5620.72s)]
*  I mean, I don't have the bloodlust, you know? [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5622.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, it's not the bloodlust thing. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5625.64s)]
*  Most of the people I know that do jujitsu are nerds. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5627.240000000001s)]
*  That's true. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5629.92s)]
*  Joe List. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5630.92s)]
*  Really smart guys. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5631.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5632.92s)]
*  Bourdain wasn't really into it. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5633.92s)]
*  It's like a lot of people that are very intelligent get into it. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5634.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5638.2s)]
*  I don't know if I have. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5639.2s)]
*  I love competition and I have that jock in me still. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5640.2s)]
*  But the whole one-on-one, man-on-man thing, I don't know if I would really, not even excel, [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5642.04s)]
*  but really enjoy it. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5646.4s)]
*  It's not as aggressive as you think it is, especially with a good school. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5647.92s)]
*  With a good school, it's really like you kind of flow and you do it in a sense where you're [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5651.92s)]
*  not exploding on each other. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5657.08s)]
*  So you're trying to learn the moves and execute the moves and the other person trying to defend, [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5658.52s)]
*  execute their own moves. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5661.8s)]
*  It's like playing chess. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5662.8s)]
*  And the guy who's better doesn't want to break you in half because there's nothing in it [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5663.8s)]
*  for him. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5666.84s)]
*  When you're beginning, you're always, I shouldn't say always. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5667.84s)]
*  Most of the time, you're better off going with someone who is much better because the [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5670.360000000001s)]
*  people that are much better can take care of you. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5674.160000000001s)]
*  They're not going to hurry you. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5676.240000000001s)]
*  But there's a lawsuit that really recently got this guy was a jujitsu coach. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5677.56s)]
*  I think it's in California. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5686.96s)]
*  And he did like a forward roll with a guy to take his back and the guy's neck got caught [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5688.400000000001s)]
*  in a bad situation and snapped his neck. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5693.84s)]
*  And he got nerve damage and paralysis and he just got awarded $46 million. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5697.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5702.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's not good. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5703.320000000001s)]
*  It's one of those things that- [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5705.400000000001s)]
*  That's such a bad precedent. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5706.400000000001s)]
*  It does, but it's also, it's a very unfortunate aspect of jujitsu that you occasionally are [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5707.400000000001s)]
*  going to get a bad injury. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5714.12s)]
*  I know of people in MMA class that got paralyzed, particularly when someone goes for a guillotine. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5715.96s)]
*  Someone shoots in for a double. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5723.76s)]
*  Sometimes guys will go for a guillotine and if they catch the neck and the guy who's shooting [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5725.76s)]
*  the double lands on his head- [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5728.96s)]
*  Yeah, as they're falling. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5730.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5731.24s)]
*  It has happened before and guys have been paralyzed doing that. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5732.24s)]
*  I was reading this thing about judo dojos in Japan and that deaths do happen where guys [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5736.24s)]
*  get spiked on their head, they get thrown and slammed on their head. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5744.4s)]
*  Every year someone dies doing judo in Japan. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5747.5599999999995s)]
*  That's probably a revered way to go out in Japan. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5751.48s)]
*  Probably. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5753.759999999999s)]
*  I don't want to say honorable because that's hacky, but there is a commitment to craft [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5754.759999999999s)]
*  over there that is unlike anything we have here. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5758.44s)]
*  Yeah, especially in regards to martial arts. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5761.0s)]
*  That culture really rewards that commitment to craft. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5763.719999999999s)]
*  Dude, sumo? [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5767.12s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5768.12s)]
*  I was in Japan at the beginning of the year and I didn't get to see sumo. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5770.04s)]
*  The point is though, it's dangerous. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5773.28s)]
*  Just like playing football is dangerous. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5776.719999999999s)]
*  People die playing football. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5778.16s)]
*  That's what you signed up for. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5779.16s)]
*  Yeah, there's a risk. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5780.16s)]
*  The thing is about that guy, they were trying to paint him that he was a total beginner, [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5781.16s)]
*  but the reality was he had years of wrestling and he had at least, I believe it was at least [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5785.28s)]
*  two years of jiu-jitsu. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5789.08s)]
*  Two years of jiu-jitsu is not, I mean it's a beginner in a sense, but it's not someone [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5790.76s)]
*  that doesn't know what they're doing, especially someone who's already done a couple of years [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5795.92s)]
*  of grappling. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5799.36s)]
*  I think it was just a freak accident. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5800.36s)]
*  When I saw it, it looked like a freak accident. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5801.48s)]
*  And the majority of the people that I talked to that were jiu-jitsu guys, they also thought [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5803.48s)]
*  it was a freak accident. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5806.32s)]
*  But 46 million? [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5807.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, who knows if that's going to stick in appeals. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5808.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, obviously the guy needs to be compensated somehow or another, insurance or something. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5812.08s)]
*  Yeah, but he signed up for it though. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5816.32s)]
*  I know, but I think most of those places have. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5818.32s)]
*  Isn't there a waiver? [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5820.32s)]
*  Yeah, but there's probably like catastrophic injury insurance or something like that. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5821.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5825.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5826.28s)]
*  I don't know what I'm talking about when it comes to that. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5827.28s)]
*  But yeah, you do sign up for it. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5828.28s)]
*  I've definitely been hurt. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5830.44s)]
*  It happens. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5831.44s)]
*  I've had multiple surgeries from jiu-jitsu. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5832.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5835.44s)]
*  Both my knees. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5836.44s)]
*  I had surgeries on because of jiu-jitsu. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5837.44s)]
*  My nose. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5839.44s)]
*  Well, my nose was fucked up for a long time. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5840.44s)]
*  But like, I had some real problems with my back and my neck, bulging discs and shit that [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5842.44s)]
*  I had to get treated with stem cells and PRP and stuff like that. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5847.08s)]
*  It's just, it's one of those things. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5852.5599999999995s)]
*  It's like you're signing up for a dangerous game. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5853.5599999999995s)]
*  I think sports are very important for youth. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5856.5599999999995s)]
*  And I loved being on a team. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5858.36s)]
*  I think being an offensive lineman made me a better host as a comedian because I was [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5860.12s)]
*  used to never touching the ball and never getting the accolades. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5863.68s)]
*  I literally think those translated, like those two skills. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5866.56s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5869.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5870.360000000001s)]
*  So you could be the guy who brings up the really good people that everybody's there [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5871.360000000001s)]
*  to see. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5874.76s)]
*  Yeah, and also do a good job setting the table for the show. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5875.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5878.360000000001s)]
*  It made you selfless in a way. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5879.360000000001s)]
*  It's also like, hosting is a very interesting job too because one of the things that it [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5880.8s)]
*  does is it allows you to get comfortable on stage and comfortable with transitions and [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5884.360000000001s)]
*  it gives you like reps. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5890.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5891.68s)]
*  Like another, it's just different kind of reps, almost like cross training a little [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5892.68s)]
*  bit. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5895.320000000001s)]
*  It's the easiest way to get a lot of stage time early because you're physically on stage, [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5896.320000000001s)]
*  even if you are doing seven minutes up front. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5899.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5901.16s)]
*  You have to do the gaps in between. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5902.16s)]
*  If you become a good host, that's your way to getting in at any club. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5903.16s)]
*  Where was, is you, are you, were you at the Comedy Works in Denver? [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5906.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5909.96s)]
*  That's my home club. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5910.96s)]
*  That's the shit. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5911.96s)]
*  I'm a company man, dude. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5912.96s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's right. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5913.96s)]
*  You can see it. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5914.96s)]
*  Is it 40 years ago? [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5915.96s)]
*  Yeah, 40 years. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5916.96s)]
*  Wow. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5917.96s)]
*  I don't even know when I first went there. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5919.2s)]
*  Dude, I got a story for you there. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5921.4s)]
*  Remember when you tried to move to Boulder for a while? [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5923.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5925.76s)]
*  So you came down and like did, I think, new talent night on Tuesday. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5926.76s)]
*  You just closed their new talent night. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5929.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5932.08s)]
*  And a lot of us were on that show, just like randomly. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5933.08s)]
*  So then Open for Joe Rogan went in like 13 people's bios the day after that show because [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5936.36s)]
*  we happened to be on a show that you closed. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5941.76s)]
*  That's funny. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5944.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5945.24s)]
*  Happy to help. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5946.24s)]
*  Yeah, no, it was good, man. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5947.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5948.5199999999995s)]
*  That would have been wild if you set up what you did here in Boulder. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5949.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, I wouldn't have been able to do it back then because I didn't even have a podcast. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5952.12s)]
*  That was pre podcast. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5956.36s)]
*  Pre podcast? [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5957.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5958.36s)]
*  One of the reasons why I started the podcast is I was bummed out that I had to leave Colorado [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5959.36s)]
*  and I had to come back to LA. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5963.0s)]
*  My wife got pregnant. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5964.599999999999s)]
*  And back then, if you are pregnant at high altitude, it's very rough. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5966.08s)]
*  It's like having the flu. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5974.84s)]
*  Yeah, altitude sickness. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5975.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5976.84s)]
*  Also, she couldn't drive in snow, but that's another story. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5978.4400000000005s)]
*  But when we came back, it was like immediate difference in being at altitude versus like [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5980.8s)]
*  where we were at was like 8,000 feet above sea level. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5985.52s)]
*  It was very high. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5987.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5988.96s)]
*  It was awesome, though. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5989.96s)]
*  But it's, you know, like I got a dog eaten by a mountain lion up there. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5990.96s)]
*  Right away? [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5994.4400000000005s)]
*  It was rough. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5995.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, a little dog left him in the yard. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5996.4400000000005s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5997.4400000000005s)]
*  It's sketchy. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5998.4400000000005s)]
*  You're dealing with like real wild shit up there. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=5999.4400000000005s)]
*  You see porcupines and foxes and occasionally you'll see something crazy like a mountain [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6003.4400000000005s)]
*  lion. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6010.280000000001s)]
*  I saw one mountain lion in between the trees once and I was like, whoa. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6011.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6014.12s)]
*  I could only see it like briefly like bigfoot like just moving through the trees. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6015.12s)]
*  But I saw this four-legged thing just moving through the trees and I was like, oh shit, [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6018.08s)]
*  I think that's a mountain lion. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6022.64s)]
*  Damn, dude. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6023.92s)]
*  And the neighbors all saw them. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6024.92s)]
*  They saw them all over the place. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6025.92s)]
*  They used to be around my middle school all the time. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6026.92s)]
*  We'd have to have indoor recess because there was mountain lions outside. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6030.08s)]
*  In one of the places near where I was staying, this guy left his door like either partially [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6032.96s)]
*  ajar or the bear figured out how to get into his car. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6040.48s)]
*  Maybe the bear opened the door. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6043.4s)]
*  The door was unlocked. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6044.719999999999s)]
*  So the bear opened the door and ate his seats. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6045.719999999999s)]
*  Ate his dashboard. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6050.28s)]
*  Ate everything. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6051.92s)]
*  Dumber bears. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6052.92s)]
*  They just smelled leather. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6054.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6055.2s)]
*  They just assumed that it was an animal. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6056.2s)]
*  I don't like that a bear can open a car door. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6058.24s)]
*  That doesn't feel good. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6060.72s)]
*  Well, I think they're smart, man. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6061.72s)]
*  And if they've done it before, that's the thing about bears when they attack. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6063.36s)]
*  They were discussing that to us when we move up there. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6067.679999999999s)]
*  They said if they get your garbage, it's a real problem because they're never going to [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6070.16s)]
*  stop coming back. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6073.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6074.88s)]
*  It's a food source. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6075.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6076.88s)]
*  Once they find it, they're like, you don't scare them off. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6077.88s)]
*  You scare them off for now. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6079.12s)]
*  That was like me at that 7-Eleven dumpster, man. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6080.679999999999s)]
*  As soon as I found out they had the hot and reddies in there, I was like. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6082.679999999999s)]
*  I was on all fours. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6088.08s)]
*  It's a funny story now to look back though, right? [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6092.2s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6096.08s)]
*  I loved it, man. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6097.08s)]
*  That's one of the awesome things about pulling it off. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6098.08s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6101.48s)]
*  Dude, being here after doing it so hard for so long, like I did it, it feels cool when [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6102.88s)]
*  something pays off in comedy. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6108.96s)]
*  Yeah, it does. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6110.6s)]
*  Because I did it gnarly. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6112.2s)]
*  Like, Joey Coco Diaz, when he tells those stories, I'm like, oh, I did that as well. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6113.2s)]
*  That's how everybody does it. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6118.76s)]
*  You do those Tribble runs. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6120.08s)]
*  You do those weird gigs in the middle of nowhere. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6121.6s)]
*  Entertainment and Macs. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6124.4400000000005s)]
*  Everybody has those stories. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6125.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6126.68s)]
*  It's one of the fun things about doing comedy. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6127.68s)]
*  It's the best, dude. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6129.16s)]
*  That's why those YouTube guys are fucked. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6130.24s)]
*  I know. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6131.56s)]
*  If you get famous on YouTube and then you start doing comedy as an open micer, you're [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6132.56s)]
*  already famous. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6135.52s)]
*  You already got your own crowds coming to see you. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6136.52s)]
*  But their crowds are dumb because they're into that kind of humor. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6139.12s)]
*  Comedy is so big now that it's boutique and you can find exactly what you think is funny. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6142.04s)]
*  That's true. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6145.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6146.72s)]
*  If you want to be a YouTube guy's fan and go to see his shows, you don't care that he's [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6148.52s)]
*  not competent at comedy because you just want to get the fucking selfie with him after the [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6150.280000000001s)]
*  show. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6153.88s)]
*  Have you seen the meet and greets for those YouTube guys' shows? [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6154.88s)]
*  No. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6156.88s)]
*  So they'll do like 35 minutes and then they'll do a Q&A typically. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6157.88s)]
*  And then there's like a two and a half hour meet and greet afterward where people come [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6160.8s)]
*  on, buy the t-shirt, take the picture. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6163.4800000000005s)]

*  But then you look out at the crowd and you're like, oh, you guys don't know what good comedy [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6177.0s)]

*  You know, any weirder than anybody who becomes famous for no fucking reason? [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6194.96s)]
*  In matters of taste, there is no debate, you know. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6198.64s)]

*  I think it's good overall because now people who might not have gone to comedy clubs are [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6203.44s)]
*  getting into the comedy club system. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6206.879999999999s)]
*  So they get that email and then they receive the, hey, you know, it's your birthday. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6208.5599999999995s)]
*  Bring 20 friends type shit. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6212.16s)]
*  And then it gets more people to get eyes on comedy, even if it is through like an ulterior [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6213.4s)]
*  way. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6217.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6218.679999999999s)]
*  What freaks people out though is when YouTube guys start doing weekends at a club they used [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6219.679999999999s)]
*  to work at and they go, hey, what the fuck? [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6222.5199999999995s)]

*  I know. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6227.44s)]
*  And then I have to do a rap date there. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6228.44s)]
*  And it's like, what the fuck? [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6229.44s)]
*  What's a rap date? [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6230.44s)]

*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6237.599999999999s)]

*  It's fun for the crowd. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6241.48s)]
*  It's fun to go from like the warehouses that I was performing in to, because I came at [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6242.48s)]
*  it from like a punk rock, like hardcore DIY thing where it's like I'll perform anywhere. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6246.599999999999s)]
*  And then you just live on the road and you come home. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6252.16s)]
*  I'd be gone for like three weeks and come home with like $600. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6254.639999999999s)]

*  I'm like, I'm in a dream right now. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6491.2s)]
*  I did a college where I had to stand on stage and the stage was two like lunch tables that [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6492.2s)]
*  they pushed together. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6498.599999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6499.599999999999s)]

*  So there's a speaker up there with you and you're standing on these rickety lunch tables. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6502.599999999999s)]
*  And then these guys are calling me a fag, yelling out and I started tearing them apart. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6508.16s)]
*  And when I started tearing them apart, then all of a sudden everybody starts laughing. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6513.92s)]
*  And they come up to the side of the stage and said, you're not allowed to swear. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6518.88s)]
*  I go, not allowed to swear? [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6522.6s)]
*  Like, what the fuck are you talking about? [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6523.6s)]

*  Of course. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6529.8s)]
*  They all start cheering. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6530.8s)]
*  I go, so you guys are old enough to go to war. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6531.8s)]
*  You're old enough to die for your country. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6533.64s)]
*  But this fucking guy over here doesn't think I can swear in front of you because you don't [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6535.76s)]

*  Let's light this place on fire. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6545.64s)]
*  And everybody starts screaming and cheering. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6546.64s)]
*  And then the guy goes, fine, we'll deal with the consequences later. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6548.76s)]
*  Do whatever you want. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6551.64s)]

*  Oh yeah, and 4chan got to the bottom of it. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6847.36s)]
*  He would not divide us. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6850.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6851.2s)]
*  And then they used flight patterns and shit. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6852.2s)]
*  It was the most brilliant thing that anyone's ever done on the internet. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6853.2s)]
*  It's weaponized autism. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6856.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6857.2s)]
*  It was amazing. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6858.2s)]
*  And then, do you know that Radiolab took the podcast down where they were describing [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6859.2s)]
*  it? [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6864.5599999999995s)]
*  I heard that podcast. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6866.04s)]
*  Why'd they take it down? [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6867.04s)]
*  Because they were saying that 4chan is associated with racism, homophobia, all sorts of other [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6868.64s)]
*  things and it's just like to elevate that website and to talk about that. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6875.68s)]
*  And so they decided to delete it. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6881.04s)]
*  But I had already listened to it by the time they deleted it. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6883.280000000001s)]
*  Is it back up? [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6885.400000000001s)]

*  That's so fucking woke speak. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6896.8s)]
*  They called us out saying that in telling the capture the flag story in the way that [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6898.68s)]
*  we did, we essentially condone some pretty despicable ideology and behavior. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6902.64s)]
*  No, you're not. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6907.160000000001s)]

*  When you're reading that or seeing that and listening to that, you just have internet [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6958.679999999999s)]
*  wizards figured out a way to get to a spot where something annoying was on the internet. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6963.24s)]
*  Where a dork was flexing. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6968.28s)]
*  And they won. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6969.28s)]

*  They ate his larva. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6974.2s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6987.0s)]

*  Just because some of it exists on an internet free website like 4chan where basically anything [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=6997.92s)]
*  goes. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7004.36s)]

*  Yes. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7006.36s)]
*  That's what happens sometimes. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7007.36s)]

*  No, they're not Nazis because they figured out where Shia LaBeouf's art installation [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7014.24s)]
*  was. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7017.36s)]

*  make you frown. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7036.28s)]
*  Well, that's fucking A. Kids are being used to being treated that way. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7037.28s)]
*  That's why they're demanding it. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7040.4s)]
*  You should be able to listen to an actual Nazi talk because it's educational. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7043.08s)]
*  Because you get to see this slippery logic they use and apply it to human beings and [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7048.44s)]
*  how disgusting it is and how it's always been like that throughout history. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7052.8s)]
*  People have othered people for whatever reason. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7056.58s)]
*  Usually it's because it makes it easier to subjugate them, easier to dominate them. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7059.88s)]
*  Dude, Hitler was no good, but he could move a crowd. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7063.84s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7249.36s)]
*  It seems to be affecting you. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7250.36s)]
*  I'm having a nice time. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7251.36s)]

*  I'm wondering why. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7254.12s)]
*  I don't know, dude. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7255.12s)]
*  Maybe because I'm a big fat guy and you're cut from marble? [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7256.12s)]
*  Maybe we have different metabolisms? [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7258.88s)]
*  Well, I'm just wondering like what is it about the honey that like, because the other guy [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7260.88s)]
*  that took, well, he took more than me. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7265.84s)]
*  Trans-maxing. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7267.400000000001s)]
*  I'm giggling. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7268.400000000001s)]
*  This is a subculture of young men who embrace trans identities, not because they believe [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7269.5199999999995s)]
*  they were born with the wrong body, but because they can't get no buzzer. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7273.639999999999s)]
*  Dude, did you hear about the dude who ran the Discord cult where he would like, if you [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7278.04s)]
*  want to get in and be able to see photos of ladies like this, you have to send me a photo [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7283.5599999999995s)]
*  of yourself dressed up like a lady like this. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7287.879999999999s)]
*  That was like a way to prove that you were cool. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7289.879999999999s)]
*  And then he was blackmailing all these dudes being like, look, he's trans. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7292.16s)]
*  We got his ass and like threatening to send these pictures to their family and then they [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7296.8s)]
*  would have to send Bitcoin and shit to this guy. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7300.2s)]
*  The problem with not being funny. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7302.12s)]
*  Because a photo of me in a dress is worth zero dollars to me. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7305.92s)]
*  I know, dude. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7310.16s)]
*  Like, yeah, okay, I put a dress on. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7311.16s)]
*  Big deal. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7312.76s)]
*  Look at my lipstick. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7313.76s)]
*  I look great. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7314.76s)]
*  I put some fake eyelashes on, bitch. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7315.76s)]
*  I look like Rosie O'Donnell over here. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7317.72s)]
*  If someone got a photo of me like wearing high heels walking around in girls underwear, [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7319.64s)]
*  I'd be like, yeah, I did that. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7324.320000000001s)]
*  It was funny. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7326.24s)]
*  We're bulletproof in that way. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7326.92s)]
*  In that way. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7328.52s)]
*  But man, if you're a banker and there's pictures of you in a dress, you're fucked, man. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7329.52s)]
*  You're in fucking deep shit. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7334.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7335.96s)]
*  If you work at like a college. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7336.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you're in deep shit. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7337.88s)]
*  Then they're mad at you for appropriating culture. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7339.76s)]
*  That's one great thing about working for the UFC. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7341.56s)]
*  If they caught you like wearing a dress somewhere, no one would give a shit. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7343.32s)]
*  Yeah, they'd probably like blow it up and put it in the locker room. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7347.12s)]
*  Like, see, we're inclusive. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7349.32s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7350.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7351.84s)]
*  We're making friends all over. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7352.36s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7354.16s)]
*  You went full tycoon over there. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7355.96s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7357.68s)]
*  Yeah, when you lean backwards, it's tycoon. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7359.16s)]
*  It feels good though. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7363.84s)]
*  It's fucking lighter, dude. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7364.84s)]
*  I can't keep this thing lit. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7365.84s)]
*  I should have another one, but Ari stole it. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7366.84s)]
*  I keep blowing smoke. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7369.28s)]
*  They still have two here. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7370.28s)]
*  But Ari, she feed... [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7371.28s)]
*  I think I told him he could have it though. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7372.28s)]
*  Did I tell him he could have it? [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7373.92s)]
*  We were a little lit by that time. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7375.56s)]
*  So how many days are you in town for, Mr. Talent? [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7379.56s)]
*  I leave on Thursday, man. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7381.52s)]
*  Nice. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7382.72s)]

*  Nice. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7385.72s)]
*  The Fat Man's in the Little Boy. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7386.72s)]
*  Yeah, the Little Room is awesome. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7388.08s)]
*  It's such an intimate little room. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7390.2s)]
*  It's such a cool little room. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7392.76s)]
*  That's where Chappelle did his... [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7394.240000000001s)]
*  He did the first night there, the first show. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7397.04s)]
*  I think it was Chappelle that night. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7399.0s)]
*  Shane Gillis and Chappelle was the first show ever in that room, which is... [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7400.0s)]
*  What an amazing show. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7403.4800000000005s)]
*  I know. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7404.4800000000005s)]
*  I was here for South By and Chappelle was going on and I had to run over and do my South [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7405.4800000000005s)]
*  By shows and I was like, fuck, I want to stay here. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7408.88s)]
*  I want to experience. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7412.08s)]
*  It was pretty fucking dope. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7413.2s)]
*  It was pretty dope. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7414.72s)]
*  It was cool to have... [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7415.72s)]
*  First of all, it was cool to have Louis in early because Louis gave me some really, really [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7417.12s)]
*  good advice and we fixed some things because of his advice. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7422.08s)]
*  Right before cement was about to be poured, we shrunk the stage in the Little Room. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7425.8s)]
*  It was Louis' advice and we dropped the ceiling down a little bit in the Little Room and that [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7430.44s)]
*  was also Louis' advice. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7434.32s)]
*  It was already a pretty small ceiling, but he's like, drop it down even more. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7435.32s)]
*  Make it flat right here. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7439.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7440.0s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7441.0s)]
*  He's like, drop the ceiling in there. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7442.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7443.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7444.0s)]
*  And then in the big room, he had us drop the main ceiling down as well. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7445.0s)]
*  It's nice, man. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7449.84s)]
*  It's nice to have. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7451.6s)]
*  It's nice to have it set up that way and to have guys like him and his advice and to have [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7452.6s)]
*  Dave come down and Dave just loved it. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7458.68s)]
*  Dave's building his own place. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7460.88s)]
*  He's building his own place in Yellow Springs. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7462.08s)]
*  In Ohio? [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7464.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's called the Firehouse. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7465.16s)]
*  It used to be an actual firehouse. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7466.16s)]
*  Wow. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7467.16s)]
*  Is there going to be a pole to the stage? [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7468.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7469.24s)]
*  That would be cool. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7470.24s)]
*  I mean, it's still there. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7471.48s)]
*  Maybe it's been something since then, but it used to be a firehouse. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7472.48s)]
*  Having him come out and checking this out and then he's like, dude, now I'm inspired. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7480.16s)]
*  So whatever he's going to do in Yellow Springs is going to be very interesting because I [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7484.12s)]
*  think he's doing 120 seats. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7487.76s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7489.5599999999995s)]
*  I think he's doing the size of Little Boy. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7490.5599999999995s)]
*  Damn, dude. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7492.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7493.719999999999s)]
*  Imagine that. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7494.719999999999s)]
*  You can go see Dave Chappelle at any given night. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7495.719999999999s)]
*  In his backyard. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7497.88s)]
*  What a great idea, though. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7498.88s)]
*  He's Dave Chappelle. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7499.88s)]
*  You could do that anywhere. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7501.52s)]
*  Why not? [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7502.52s)]
*  Why not build your own club and have the people come to you? [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7503.52s)]
*  Of course they're going to come to see Dave Chappelle. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7505.96s)]
*  It'll be a vacation destination like your club is. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7507.56s)]
*  People were from all over the world last night at Kill Tony. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7510.72s)]
*  But I don't know how many hotels they have in Yellow Springs. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7513.28s)]
*  Build a hotel. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7516.36s)]
*  Build a fucking hotel. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7517.36s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7518.36s)]
*  Become the monopoly. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7519.36s)]
*  Then the neighbor's going to complain, there's Dave Chappelle. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7520.36s)]
*  Kill the neighbors. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7521.36s)]
*  Kill the neighbors. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7522.36s)]
*  Who cares, Dave? [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7523.36s)]
*  I like how you think immediately with the perfect answer. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7524.36s)]
*  So that spot's going to be interesting to see. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7527.400000000001s)]
*  If more comics start doing this, buying and opening clubs. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7531.400000000001s)]
*  I was with, damn dude, Shane's so fucking funny. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7535.52s)]
*  I was with Shane last weekend and he was talking about the club. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7538.400000000001s)]
*  If you got a bunch of comedians in a room, like Monkeys with a Typewriter, they would [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7542.92s)]
*  hammer it out and it would fucking look like your club. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7546.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7549.400000000001s)]
*  It's perfect, dude. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7550.400000000001s)]
*  Well, because it was built just for that. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7552.400000000001s)]
*  We had all this time. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7556.12s)]
*  I already had the employees lined up. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7557.599999999999s)]
*  So it was all this time to just do it right. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7560.2s)]
*  And you assembled a squad, dude. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7563.08s)]
*  You got the A team in there. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7564.36s)]
*  It's pretty awesome. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7566.44s)]
*  They're awesome people. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7567.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7568.44s)]
*  And now I got to hang out with EGOT and we get to sit in the back and say rude things [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7569.44s)]
*  to each other. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7571.68s)]
*  The fact that all this is happening while a really robust open mic program is happening, [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7572.76s)]
*  dude. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7577.599999999999s)]
*  Dude, you got a farm team, dude. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7578.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7579.599999999999s)]
*  I kind of like that in a way. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7580.599999999999s)]
*  It's fun. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7581.599999999999s)]
*  You should be proud of yourself. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7582.599999999999s)]
*  I'm excited. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7583.599999999999s)]
*  I'm excited about it. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7584.599999999999s)]
*  It's one of those things you probably shouldn't think about too much. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7586.08s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7589.04s)]
*  Just accept it. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7590.04s)]
*  I think that's why the honey is working for me because this whole time I was sitting here [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7591.04s)]
*  thinking I'm on the Joe Rogan experience and then the honey hit and I'm like, oh, I'm just [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7593.84s)]
*  like trying to keep a cigar lit and drinking a beer with a cool guy. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7597.92s)]
*  But that's what it really is. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7602.400000000001s)]
*  That's what's weird about it being this popular. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7604.56s)]
*  It's just hanging out. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7606.72s)]
*  I know. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7608.4400000000005s)]
*  But you know this is like a really big deal. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7609.4400000000005s)]
*  You know? [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7612.280000000001s)]
*  Like maybe I'll sell out Cedar Rapids this weekend. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7613.280000000001s)]
*  Well, I hope you do. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7615.32s)]
*  You're a funny guy. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7616.32s)]
*  Thanks, man. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7617.32s)]
*  It's nice to be able to do it. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7618.32s)]
*  I mean, it's one of the cool things about this game. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7620.44s)]
*  Putting people on? [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7622.44s)]
*  Yeah, I love it. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7623.44s)]
*  Oh yeah, dude. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7624.44s)]
*  All these skulls. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7625.44s)]
*  You know, there's not that many of us, buddy, out there in the world. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7626.44s)]
*  People with skulls? [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7632.04s)]
*  No. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7633.04s)]
*  Oh, comedians. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7634.04s)]
*  There might be like a thousand of us. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7635.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7636.04s)]
*  You know? [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7637.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7638.04s)]
*  Not that many. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7639.04s)]
*  I don't know, dude. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7640.04s)]
*  I've been traveling the world a lot doing stand up because that's a real up and coming [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7641.04s)]
*  thing now. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7644.36s)]
*  Like Paris and you know, like Bratislava and stuff. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7646.12s)]
*  Italy, like Barcelona. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7649.4s)]
*  And there's a lot of comics out there. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7651.719999999999s)]
*  But good God, American comedians are the best to ever do it. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7653.16s)]
*  I'll say that. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7655.92s)]
*  It's our shit. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7657.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7658.96s)]
*  It's like we invented the timing. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7659.96s)]
*  We invented the whole rhythm of the thing. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7660.96s)]
*  It's like rock and roll. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7662.759999999999s)]
*  There's something about, I don't know what it is, there's something about the way like [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7663.759999999999s)]
*  a lot of Europeans are raised that it's a hurdle to get to American stand up. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7667.92s)]
*  Less of a hurdle for Australians. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7672.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7674.08s)]
*  They slide right into it. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7675.08s)]
*  They're funny people. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7676.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7677.08s)]
*  They're wild. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7678.08s)]
*  Yeah, my boy, Monty Franklin's coming tonight too. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7679.08s)]
*  Nice. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7681.12s)]
*  But in terms of like English first American, there's a few guys like there's Ricky Gervais [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7682.12s)]
*  and there's a few guys who could really do it. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7688.12s)]
*  But it's like it's a different style of communication over there. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7690.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7693.92s)]
*  It doesn't necessarily apply that directly without completely remapping how you talk [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7694.92s)]
*  about things. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7699.04s)]
*  It's the whole storytelling thing they do over there, dude. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7700.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7702.08s)]
*  Jeffries, obviously, he rules that Connolly guy. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7703.44s)]
*  He's fucking good. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7705.44s)]
*  Good Connolly. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7706.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7707.44s)]
*  Scotland, right? [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7708.44s)]
*  But it's like if you go to a place where English is the second language and you're the American [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7709.44s)]
*  comedian, you're bodying everyone. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7712.5599999999995s)]
*  It's nuts. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7715.5199999999995s)]
*  It's a bloodbath. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7716.5199999999995s)]
*  Why do you think the level over here is so much higher? [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7717.5199999999995s)]
*  Because we've been doing it longer. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7719.64s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7720.64s)]
*  I think so. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7721.64s)]
*  And also like we value humor a lot more than other places do, I think. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7722.64s)]
*  I think also it's real hard to develop if you're the funniest guy in the room. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7725.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7730.5599999999995s)]
*  For sure. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7731.5599999999995s)]
*  You have to have people you aspire to. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7733.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7734.320000000001s)]
*  That's one of the more important things about comedy communities. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7735.320000000001s)]
*  And that's one of the things that I thought a lot about when I first got here. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7738.280000000001s)]
*  When I first got here, before I thought about like, Jesus Christ, you really want to open [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7741.280000000001s)]
*  up a fucking comedy club. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7744.6s)]
*  Is that really what you want to do with your time? [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7745.6s)]
*  You don't have time already. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7747.6s)]
*  You don't have any time. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7748.6s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7749.6s)]
*  How are you going to do this? [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7750.6s)]
*  But then I thought like that's actually a very valuable piece of the puzzle. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7751.6s)]
*  And the more I didn't have it, the more I was realizing like it's most of my fun at [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7756.120000000001s)]
*  nighttime is hanging out with comics and talking. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7762.28s)]
*  Most of my fun at nighttime. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7764.8s)]
*  It's either, you know, like talking in the green room or it's fucking around after the [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7766.28s)]
*  show, going and having a drink or getting something to eat. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7772.92s)]
*  Like, that's like some of the most fun times I have. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7775.64s)]
*  That's why we're the luckiest people, dude, because everywhere you go, you hang out with [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7778.04s)]
*  the funniest people in that city. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7780.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7782.08s)]
*  But if you don't have that, if you're just in, you know, whatever, some weird town somewhere [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7783.08s)]
*  and you start an open mic night, it's hard to get good. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7787.12s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7789.4800000000005s)]
*  You need like real comics around you. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7790.599999999999s)]
*  Really good comics around you. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7792.5199999999995s)]
*  It's not even enough to be watching it on YouTube. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7794.24s)]
*  You got to kind of see it live. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7797.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7798.959999999999s)]
*  You got to experience it live. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7799.959999999999s)]
*  That's like what you go on the road and then you meet someone really funny in like South [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7800.959999999999s)]
*  Bend or Cincinnati and you're like, yo, dude, you got to get the fuck out of here. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7804.799999999999s)]
*  You got to go somewhere else because you're really funny and you're not going to get as [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7808.0s)]
*  funny as you can here. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7810.759999999999s)]
*  And there's also a thing that happens when comics get established and then they get their [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7812.16s)]
*  own audience and then they bring the weakest possible opening act and then they go on [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7816.48s)]
*  afterwards only in front of their audience and they look like a hero. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7821.36s)]
*  You know, it's a weird thing because your act sort of deteriorates without you even [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7825.28s)]
*  knowing it. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7829.24s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7830.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7831.24s)]
*  You ossify. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7832.24s)]
*  You get soft. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7833.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7834.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7835.24s)]
*  Some shit goes wrong. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7836.24s)]
*  You don't, you got to be around killers. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7837.24s)]
*  You got to be, Bill Bursa this once, he was talking about somebody and he goes, you got [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7838.24s)]
*  to do the clubs. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7840.959999999999s)]
*  You got to do the clubs. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7841.959999999999s)]
*  These guys, they get to a certain point, they stop doing the clubs and they, the, the, the [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7843.04s)]
*  their acts falls apart. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7846.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7847.599999999999s)]
*  It's a hundred percent true. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7848.599999999999s)]
*  Like you got to do it in front of live people, small crowds, medium crowds. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7849.599999999999s)]
*  And that's why we set up these two rooms. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7854.799999999999s)]
*  We have small and then a regular. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7856.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7858.679999999999s)]
*  250 and a 120, which is like the right numbers. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7859.679999999999s)]
*  You know, it's like 300 is the magic number for a comedy club. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7863.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7866.2s)]
*  For it to be intimate but still big. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7867.2s)]
*  You know, 300 is the magic number. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7868.2s)]
*  So anywhere you can get between like 250 and 300 is like the sweet zone. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7870.599999999999s)]
*  It's like ComedyWorks. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7874.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7875.92s)]
*  Sweet zone. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7876.92s)]
*  You get to those big fucking stand up live in Phoenix. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7877.92s)]
*  That's huge. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7881.6s)]
*  It's impersonal. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7882.6s)]
*  So big. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7883.6s)]
*  It's like a small theater. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7884.6s)]
*  It's fun for the people in the front, but it's like a small theater. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7885.6s)]
*  You watch people do crowd work in those big rooms and there's people in back and it's [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7887.04s)]
*  like, who is he talking to? [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7890.0s)]
*  Zero idea. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7891.200000000001s)]
*  Let's see the back of the head back there. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7892.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7893.200000000001s)]
*  They have zero idea what's going on. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7894.200000000001s)]
*  It's funny when like when I was opening for Tim, like figuring out how to do comedy in [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7895.200000000001s)]
*  front of like 300 or 3, 600 people or whatever it is. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7899.4800000000005s)]
*  Because you can't do crowd work. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7902.68s)]
*  You have to have an act. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7904.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7905.8s)]
*  That's when I got super strong is I had like a bulletproof 25 instead of relying on like [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7906.8s)]
*  riffing or, you know, talking to the crowd. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7910.48s)]
*  It's like, no, here are my jokes and these are proven. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7912.96s)]
*  I can't imagine those arenas you do. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7915.76s)]
*  Those are fucking crazy, dude. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7917.639999999999s)]
*  Those are weird. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7919.04s)]
*  But they're actually kind of intimate if it's in the round. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7920.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7923.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7924.0s)]
*  I don't necessarily think that an arena like where the the back is the stage and, you know, [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7925.0s)]
*  the audience is in front of you like normal is is as intimate as a theater. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7931.88s)]
*  It's less intimate than a theater, but more people. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7938.0s)]
*  But when you're in the round, there's something about being in the round that's more intimate [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7940.64s)]
*  than a theater. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7945.6s)]
*  It's really weird because you're surrounded by people and the people are seeing the other [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7946.82s)]
*  people like everybody sees everybody and everybody's enjoying one of the things about laughter. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7951.56s)]
*  It's contagious. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7956.32s)]
*  You're actually seeing looking straight ahead of people laughing. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7957.32s)]
*  It's kind of more fun. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7961.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7962.16s)]
*  And there's like this weird sort of sense of like we're all here together having a good [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7963.16s)]
*  time thing that is less apparent when behind you is just a stage wall. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7967.12s)]
*  Do you remember those Zoom shows you ever do that shit? [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7971.88s)]
*  No. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7974.76s)]
*  Yeah, you don't have to. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7975.76s)]
*  No, I wouldn't have done it. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7976.76s)]
*  I did it. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7977.76s)]
*  Oh, money? [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7978.76s)]
*  No, just because it was like, oh, I'll entertain some people in the middle of the day, you [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7979.76s)]
*  know, and they're just like, oh, God, dude, I watched people bomb at the laugh factory [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7983.32s)]
*  doing stand up for no audience. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7989.68s)]
*  Yes. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7991.4800000000005s)]
*  And it was so weird, like the steps they were taking to make sure everyone was safe. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7992.4800000000005s)]
*  They put you in a giant hamster bubble if I could roll you up to the stage. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=7996.160000000001s)]
*  No. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8000.72s)]
*  They bubble boy do? [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8001.72s)]
*  I would have done that for sure. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8002.72s)]
*  I would have loved to have been a little. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8003.72s)]
*  Imagine they develop a hamster shoot and just roll out from the green room. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8005.72s)]
*  Okay. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8009.72s)]
*  Sam talent. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8010.72s)]
*  Ready to launch. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8011.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8012.72s)]
*  You roll onto the stage. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8013.72s)]
*  I would have keep rolling, dude. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8014.72s)]
*  I would go right through the door. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8015.72s)]
*  Gravity has a weird effect on a man of my size. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8018.8s)]
*  So people are on that stage with a microphone and no audience. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8021.0s)]
*  So weird. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8025.8s)]
*  You need an audience. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8026.8s)]
*  You can't practice stand up in a vacuum. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8027.8s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8029.280000000001s)]
*  That's why it's like the only like pure way of entertaining. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8030.280000000001s)]
*  Look at Tim Dillon when he does his show. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8032.56s)]
*  He has an audience of one. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8034.280000000001s)]
*  The producer. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8036.52s)]

*  He's so funny and he's such a good person. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8075.72s)]
*  He's a fun guy. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8078.04s)]
*  That's the weird thing about me. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8079.04s)]
*  Crazy as fuck too. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8080.32s)]
*  Oh sure. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8081.32s)]
*  I love him. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8082.32s)]
*  Yeah, undiagnosed. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8083.32s)]
*  There's definitely some shit going on. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8084.32s)]
*  But he makes good real estate choices too. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8088.599999999999s)]
*  His fucking brand still, what he's doing is he's developing material like in a laboratory. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8091.0s)]
*  It's so good because he's gotten that muscle of doing that and ranting is so strong now [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8095.759999999999s)]
*  because he's used to putting them together. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8100.4s)]
*  It was funny we were talking about it because he's like all day long now. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8102.16s)]
*  I can't relax because I'm thinking, okay, what's my take on this? [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8106.36s)]
*  What am I going to say about that? [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8110.48s)]
*  I'm mad about this. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8111.48s)]
*  What am I mad at? [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8112.48s)]
*  What am I getting off about? [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8113.48s)]
*  I'm like, oh, right, because you have to come up with all of it yourself. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8114.88s)]
*  You have to have valid things, things that are going to capture people. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8118.12s)]
*  I want to see his take on Dylan Mulvaney. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8122.2s)]
*  I bet it's amazing. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8124.16s)]
*  I bet it is nuanced and profound and vulgar and smart. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8125.16s)]
*  I bet it's amazing. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8129.2s)]
*  Dude, Tim and I, when we were on the road together, he would just find a really expensive [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8130.2s)]
*  house and a range of viewing of the house. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8133.4s)]
*  And we'd go in and waste some realtors time for an hour. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8136.32s)]
*  Like she'd be like, and these are the windows. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8140.639999999999s)]
*  And he'd be like, very good, Charlotte. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8142.08s)]
*  And then she'd turn and he'd be like, dog shit trash. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8143.08s)]
*  I wouldn't even kill someone in this room. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8146.5599999999995s)]
*  Hell, it sucks. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8148.48s)]
*  It could be good. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8149.48s)]
*  Might be bad. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8150.48s)]
*  Why does he go and look at houses? [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8151.48s)]
*  Because it's something to do on the road. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8152.48s)]
*  That's so weird. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8154.04s)]
*  One time a lady took us upstairs and it was like, the downstairs was beautiful and the [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8155.04s)]
*  upstairs was just like leftover materials, total rush job. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8158.639999999999s)]
*  And we're like, oh fuck. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8162.76s)]
*  And she grabs us and takes us into the bedroom and she points at the fire alarms and she's [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8163.76s)]
*  like, these are about to be the industry standard. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8166.72s)]
*  These are big. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8169.72s)]
*  These are going to take the world by storm. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8170.72s)]
*  And Tim turns to me and he goes, it's not good when she's selling the fire alarms. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8171.72s)]
*  You know the house is bad. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8174.92s)]
*  You know the house is bad when that's the selling point upstairs. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8176.92s)]
*  He was talking about what he does on the internet. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8179.8s)]
*  Like I watch a lot of YouTube videos, mostly nonsense. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8184.04s)]
*  And he goes, I'm on Zillow. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8188.36s)]
*  He is, dude. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8189.36s)]
*  He's on Zillow. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8190.36s)]
*  He's looking at houses constantly. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8191.679999999999s)]
*  I know. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8192.68s)]
*  But I mean, you got to, I mean, that's what his original thing was. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8193.68s)]
*  He sold subprime mortgages. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8196.76s)]
*  Oh yeah, he scammed America. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8198.32s)]
*  As part of the crisis. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8199.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8200.32s)]
*  He fleeced the nation. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8201.32s)]
*  Bro, have you seen when he does Meghan McCain? [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8202.32s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8204.76s)]
*  Because Meghan McCain, that is one of the funniest fucking things I've ever seen in [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8205.76s)]
*  my life. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8209.119999999999s)]
*  Apparently she doesn't like it, which I can understand. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8210.119999999999s)]
*  No way. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8211.119999999999s)]
*  I can understand. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8212.119999999999s)]
*  It's not a slight against you that he does this, by the way. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8213.119999999999s)]
*  That is not you. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8217.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8218.039999999999s)]
*  He's got a ridiculous comedic caricature. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8219.720000000001s)]
*  He's invented a character. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8222.52s)]
*  It's a lampoon, Meghan. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8223.52s)]
*  Yeah, he's invented a completely different character than you. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8225.12s)]
*  He's just, wouldn't it be funny if Meghan McCain was this insane? [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8228.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8232.880000000001s)]
*  It's just like, holy shit. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8233.880000000001s)]
*  Also, Meghan McCain, she really has huge breasts, which Tim pointed out to me. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8234.880000000001s)]
*  Oh, are they secret? [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8238.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8240.320000000002s)]
*  She does a good job keeping them under wraps. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8241.320000000002s)]
*  It's crazy when a gay guy points out a cool set of Hooters and you're like, I want to [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8243.160000000002s)]
*  see the world through your eyes. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8246.04s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8247.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8248.04s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8249.04s)]
*  Well, he studied her. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8250.04s)]
*  Yes, he did. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8251.04s)]
*  Yeah, he studied her for that piece. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8252.04s)]
*  Like a predator. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8253.04s)]
*  Like a bobcat looking at a chicken. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8254.04s)]
*  He's like that falcon getting let loose out of the window, dude. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8256.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8259.04s)]
*  That's how Tim sees the world. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8260.04s)]
*  It's prey. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8262.04s)]
*  Oh. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8263.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8264.04s)]
*  He's the man. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8265.04s)]
*  He is the man. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8266.04s)]
*  I was so excited when he decided to come out here, too. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8267.04s)]
*  Oh, he's so excited about being here? [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8268.04s)]
*  Let me tell you. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8270.04s)]
*  He loves it in Austin. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8271.04s)]
*  He hates Austin the City. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8272.04s)]
*  I know. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8273.04s)]
*  He loves the club, though, but he hates everywhere. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8274.04s)]
*  Of course. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8276.04s)]
*  That's half the fun of Tim. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8277.04s)]
*  Dude, Tim will call me and he's like, I'm going to get off the road for a couple months. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8278.04s)]
*  And then like a week later, I see his dates and it's like, you're a fucking gypsy, dude. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8282.04s)]
*  He's not going off the road. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8286.04s)]
*  No, he loves it out there. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8287.04s)]
*  He also keeps houses in a bunch of different states. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8288.04s)]
*  He likes it. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8290.04s)]
*  He does. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8291.04s)]
*  But we talked about it. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8292.04s)]
*  The week after he moved here, we had a deep freeze where it fucking rained, freezing rain [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8293.04s)]
*  for like five days in a row and shut everything down. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8299.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8302.04s)]
*  And I had him on the podcast right afterwards. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8303.04s)]
*  He goes, we were considering suing you. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8304.04s)]
*  Where the fuck did you move me? [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8307.04s)]
*  That never happens, dude. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8313.04s)]
*  It happened again this year. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8314.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8316.04s)]
*  It happens. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8317.04s)]
*  Tim will call you and he's just in the middle of a conversation he's been having with himself. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8318.04s)]
*  You know? [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8320.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8321.04s)]
*  He'll be like, Duncan Trussell's got a puppet. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8322.04s)]
*  What's going on there? [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8324.04s)]
*  That's how you say hello. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8325.04s)]
*  Is that OK? [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8328.04s)]
*  Are we allowing puppets now? [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8330.04s)]
*  It's good. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8332.04s)]
*  It works. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8333.04s)]
*  But it could be bad. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8334.04s)]
*  Tim, the whole trick to doing Tim is you say one thing and then say it could be bad. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8335.04s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8338.04s)]
*  You go the opposite way. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8339.04s)]
*  Bud Light, transgender. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8340.04s)]
*  Could be good. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8341.04s)]
*  Could be bad. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8342.04s)]
*  Yeah, this is what's stupid about the world today. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8343.04s)]
*  Our conversation about Bud Light and Dylan Mulvaney is going to make news. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8344.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8349.04s)]
*  The dumbest thing ever. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8350.04s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8351.04s)]
*  I'm on the side of everybody having a nice cold Bud Light. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8352.04s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not into Bud Light at all anyway. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8356.04s)]
*  So for me- [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8359.04s)]
*  Can I have that other one? [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8360.04s)]
*  Yeah, you can have it. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8361.04s)]
*  Thanks, man. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8362.04s)]
*  I get it. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8363.04s)]
*  People like a cold, bland drink. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8364.04s)]
*  Hey, Tong, take the day off. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8366.04s)]
*  I like a Zima. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8368.04s)]
*  I'm on Bud Light. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8369.04s)]
*  I like a Zima. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8370.04s)]
*  Yeah, you like to test the metal of your mouth. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8371.04s)]
*  But I just like, I think it's funny when people, oh, I saw a really funny one. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8374.04s)]
*  Somebody took Travis Tritt. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8379.04s)]
*  This is a photo of Travis Tritt and it said that Travis Tritt will no longer sell Anheuser [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8382.04s)]
*  Bush because of Dylan Mulvaney. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8388.04s)]
*  And then it said also Travis Tritt and he's basically wearing the most feminine country [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8390.04s)]
*  leather outfit, like a blue leather outfit with strings hanging down from it, like one [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8397.04s)]
*  of the most unmanly looking tight leather pants, high heels. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8403.04s)]
*  Let's see if you can find that. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8408.04s)]
*  Dude, we're so lucky we're comics because if we tried that shit, we would get lit up, [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8411.04s)]
*  dude. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8415.04s)]
*  For sure. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8416.04s)]
*  There's so many comics that keep me grounded. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8417.04s)]
*  It rules. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8418.04s)]
*  Yeah, getting lit up is very important. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8419.04s)]
*  Yeah, the group chat. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8421.04s)]
*  No, that's not it, but that's one of them. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8422.04s)]
*  He was wearing like that kind of shit. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8424.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's it right there. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8427.04s)]
*  But it said also Travis Tritt and show this outfit. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8429.04s)]
*  Navajo grandma, Travis Tritt. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8432.04s)]
*  Imagine if that guy came over, he's dating your daughter and it wasn't Travis Tritt. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8434.04s)]
*  It was Travis Tritt, he gets a pass. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8437.04s)]
*  Obviously he's a superstar. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8439.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8440.04s)]
*  But if it wasn't Travis Tritt and this guy came over, it's like, where do you work, man? [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8441.04s)]
*  Minikie. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8445.04s)]
*  What do you do that you have that outfit? [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8446.04s)]
*  I sell brake pads. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8448.04s)]
*  You're going to fucking Chili's baby back ribs with that fucking outfit on? [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8449.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8452.04s)]
*  What are you doing, buddy? [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8453.04s)]
*  There it is. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8454.04s)]
*  That's the picture. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8455.04s)]
*  That's the picture. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8456.04s)]
*  He rules. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8457.04s)]
*  That's the picture. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8458.04s)]
*  This is also Travis Tritt. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8459.04s)]
*  Good for Travis. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8460.04s)]
*  Good for Travis. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8461.04s)]
*  Low cut shirt. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8462.04s)]
*  That guy's not into transgender stuff. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8463.04s)]
*  I don't know why. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8464.04s)]
*  He's had his hair. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8465.04s)]
*  He's spent so much time in a salon. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8466.04s)]
*  That's exactly the point. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8467.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8468.04s)]
*  That's the point. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8469.04s)]
*  Maybe we hate what we fear we are. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8470.04s)]
*  It's like that Guns N' Roses song, Live and Let Die. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8471.04s)]
*  That's when I first came to LA right after the Guns N' Roses scene had busted loose. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8475.04s)]
*  It was like 1994. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8486.04s)]
*  That's when I first came to LA. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8487.04s)]
*  It was so different then, man. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8490.04s)]
*  Such a weird place. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8493.04s)]
*  It was like this launching pad for dreams. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8494.04s)]
*  That's what it felt like when you got there. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8497.04s)]
*  Everyone was just there to pursue a dream. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8499.04s)]
*  There was like electricity in the air. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8501.04s)]
*  When you're in your 20s and you're in LA and everyone's trying to make it, people are trying to get on sitcoms. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8503.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8510.04s)]
*  Can't go out again. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8511.04s)]
*  Of course. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8512.04s)]
*  I'm 0 for 8 over here. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8513.04s)]
*  These are tightly, but they're nice. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8514.04s)]
*  They're a nice pull, but they're a little tight. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8515.04s)]
*  You see that picture going around with it too? [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8518.04s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8520.04s)]
*  So he was drinking Bud Light with a transgender person. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8521.04s)]
*  Yeah, in 2003. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8524.04s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8525.04s)]
*  Well, he changed his views. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8526.04s)]
*  People have all changed, Kid Rock. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8527.04s)]
*  He got a little tense. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8529.04s)]
*  He got a little tense. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8530.04s)]
*  I think when it became so prevalent, people start to panic. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8531.04s)]
*  That's what it is. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8535.04s)]
*  It's like, what is happening here? [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8536.04s)]
*  What are we doing? [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8538.04s)]
*  Why is it so prevalent? [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8539.04s)]
*  People evolve. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8542.04s)]
*  Maybe people feel safer to come out and be themselves. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8543.04s)]
*  It could be that. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8545.04s)]
*  It could be that. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8546.04s)]
*  It can also be people just like people are easily influenced in any way. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8547.04s)]
*  People are influenced in a way that if there was something that came along, anything that came along, [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8553.04s)]
*  that gave you a sense of belonging to a group and then a sense of being praised for that, [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8559.04s)]
*  and then a sense that you're in part of a new movement. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8567.04s)]
*  All those things are very attractive to people, no matter what it is. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8572.04s)]
*  If it involves religion, if it involves gender, if it involves whatever ideology. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8575.04s)]
*  If you all of a sudden can become a group, you're in a group, [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8581.04s)]
*  you're praised for being a part of that group and praised for your decisions, [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8584.04s)]
*  and you get all this attention now, and you also get this feeling that you are on the right side [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8588.04s)]
*  and there's a righteous element to it. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8595.04s)]
*  This could be with anything. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8598.04s)]
*  This is how people get sucked into all sorts of stuff. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8600.04s)]
*  Then there's also gender dysphoria, which is absolutely real. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8604.04s)]
*  Which is legit, yeah. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8608.04s)]
*  100% real. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8609.04s)]
*  It's a psychological condition that's existed forever. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8610.04s)]
*  They don't understand it because biology is strange. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8613.04s)]
*  And that's the reality of being a human being. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8616.04s)]
*  There's so much variation, there's so many variables, [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8618.04s)]
*  there's so many things that can go right, so many things that go sideways, [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8620.04s)]
*  so many things that are odd or queer, as it were, weird things. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8623.04s)]
*  That's why my number one beef with people that get really religious is the gay stuff. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8627.04s)]
*  What do you want them to do? [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8634.04s)]
*  Are you or are you not pro-freedom? [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8636.04s)]
*  Right, dude, freedom is the big thing. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8639.04s)]
*  Liberty, pursuit of happiness. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8640.04s)]
*  I'm telling you, these guys are happy when they fuck guys. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8642.04s)]
*  Hell yeah, good for them. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8645.04s)]
*  I know a bunch of them. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8646.04s)]
*  They're all being honest. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8647.04s)]
*  They're happier than me. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8648.04s)]
*  They're doing great. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8649.04s)]
*  Again, go down Santa Monica Boulevard. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8651.04s)]
*  It's five blocks and the guy's having a great fucking time. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8653.04s)]
*  Go to Tim Dillon's hotel room. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8656.04s)]
*  Don't, don't. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8657.04s)]
*  Don't go to Tim Dillon's hotel room. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8659.04s)]
*  Leave him alone. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8660.04s)]
*  Yeah, no, dude, I just think that it's really weird to be... [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8662.04s)]
*  Some things you can't unsee. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8664.04s)]
*  Or unsmell. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8665.04s)]
*  There's just people who are so obsessed with the idea of expressing themselves [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8666.04s)]
*  and they get mad at other people for doing the same thing because it weirds them out, [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8674.04s)]
*  dude. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8677.04s)]
*  You know what I think it is? [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8678.04s)]
*  It's one of those things where if you buy into this side of the group, you have to adopt [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8679.04s)]
*  a bunch of different ideas. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8683.04s)]
*  And all those ideas, you can't be pro-life, but also think that we need to take away all [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8685.04s)]
*  the guns. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8692.04s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8693.04s)]
*  No one's going to let you in their group. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8694.04s)]
*  No. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8695.04s)]
*  What side are you on, you crazy fuck? [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8696.04s)]
*  You just... [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8697.04s)]
*  You're a pro-life person who thinks that we should take everyone's guns. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8698.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8702.04s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8703.04s)]
*  Pro-life is over there with the First Amendment. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8704.04s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8708.04s)]
*  You're on the wrong team. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8709.04s)]
*  Also, pro-life, you never whoopsied in a girl in El Paso? [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8710.04s)]
*  Whoopsies. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8713.04s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8714.04s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8715.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8716.04s)]
*  Well, the conversation about that that I've had with people, with religious people, particularly [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8717.04s)]
*  this one guy, was very weird because it was like his thought was at conception. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8721.04s)]
*  So I was like, what if it's the day of? [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8726.04s)]
*  What is the day of? [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8728.04s)]
*  And you can just take something and it just vanishes. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8730.04s)]
*  We're talking about like two cells. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8733.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8735.04s)]
*  Nope. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8736.04s)]
*  No, two wrongs don't make a right, even under rape. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8737.04s)]
*  They were talking about raping children being raped. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8739.04s)]
*  Come on. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8741.04s)]
*  I was like, you're out of your fucking mind. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8742.04s)]
*  This is crazy talk. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8743.04s)]
*  Also, it's not pro-life or anti-life. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8744.04s)]
*  It's pro-choice, anti-choice. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8746.04s)]
*  That's the whole framework. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8747.04s)]
*  But if I was a conspiracy theorist, if I was a real tin foil hat guy, I would say if I [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8748.04s)]
*  wanted to keep everybody fighting against each other, my chess move would make the whole [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8754.04s)]
*  thing. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8760.04s)]
*  My chess move would be conservatives get rid of Roe v. Wade. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8761.04s)]
*  Let's get rid of fucking arms in the streets. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8764.04s)]
*  And then liberals, let's start pushing the most radical ideas and try to make them mainstream. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8767.04s)]
*  The most radical ideas, like exorbitant taxes for the wealth, income inequality. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8777.04s)]
*  Ignore all the money the same side as pumping into the military industrial complex. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8784.04s)]
*  Ignore all the influence of the pharmaceutical companies. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8789.04s)]
*  Just concentrate on social ideas. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8792.04s)]
*  And push them. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8794.04s)]
*  And get wacky people in your cabinet. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8795.04s)]
*  Even if these people are totally incompetent, if you can say this is the most diverse cabinet [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8797.04s)]
*  that's ever been assembled, and that's what they do say, and then you've got that fucking [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8802.04s)]
*  crazy dude with the beard who wears a dress who's non-binary, steals women's luggage. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8805.04s)]
*  That fucking dude is wearing the White House in charge of getting rid of nuclear waste [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8810.04s)]
*  or some shit. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8813.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8814.04s)]
*  Let's get a wig on that guy. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8815.04s)]
*  Fucking amazing though when stuff like that happens. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8816.04s)]
*  If I wanted to keep people divided and not pay attention to centralized digital currency, [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8820.04s)]
*  which Tulsi Gabbard's freaking out about now that they're trying to do that. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8826.04s)]
*  If I wanted to keep people ignorant of that stuff, that's what I would do. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8830.04s)]
*  I would move the cultural chess pieces in a way that I have the loudest fringe people [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8834.04s)]
*  on this side and the loudest fringe people on that side, so that all the people that [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8840.04s)]
*  generally agree on most stuff don't ever get along. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8844.04s)]
*  Because they're either on this side or that side, and that side is represented by a dude [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8847.04s)]
*  with a beard and a dress who steals women's luggage, and this side is represented by that [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8852.04s)]
*  fucking lady who assaulted me in Aspen. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8857.04s)]
*  It's like Trump's our real president. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8860.04s)]
*  I knew you were a patriot. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8861.04s)]
*  Like, oh no. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8862.04s)]
*  It's like, you don't want to be associated with these people. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8863.04s)]
*  You don't want to be associated with these people. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8867.04s)]
*  You don't want to be associated with anti-vaxxers, and you don't want to be associated with [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8869.04s)]
*  whatever, fucking fill in the blank that this side hates. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8873.04s)]
*  There's no war but class war, dude. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8877.04s)]
*  But it's almost like it's engineered. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8879.04s)]
*  Oh, it is for sure. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8882.04s)]
*  They tried to use class war, and then people realized that money does move everything, [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8883.04s)]
*  so they saw through that. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8887.04s)]
*  Then they tried to use race against each other. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8888.04s)]
*  Race got together, so now it's ideologies, dude. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8890.04s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8892.04s)]
*  Then they can do whatever they fucking want behind the curtain, because our eyes have [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8893.04s)]
*  the wool pulled over so egregiously. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8896.04s)]
*  Then there's this beautiful component of climate change. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8898.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8901.04s)]
*  They throw that in there, too. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8902.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8903.04s)]
*  This is one that people duke it out over. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8904.04s)]
*  People on the right say, it's not that big of a deal, and it's a natural cycle, and [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8906.04s)]
*  it's this and that. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8911.04s)]
*  Most of these people, they're pumping out these narratives without even really paying [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8912.04s)]
*  attention to the facts. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8916.04s)]
*  Then there's other people that say, we're going to boil in 30 years. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8917.04s)]
*  The ocean's going to boil. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8920.04s)]
*  We're all going to die. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8921.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8922.04s)]
*  The more time goes on, the more we look at this whole trend of the weather, the more [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8923.04s)]
*  it occurs to me, at least, that it's never been stable ever in the history of the world. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8928.04s)]
*  It's all fucking like this and that, and it goes ice age, and it gets crazy hot, and it [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8933.04s)]
*  goes cold again. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8937.04s)]
*  It's like, it's always done that. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8938.04s)]
*  It's not like if we don't do anything, it just stays stable. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8940.04s)]
*  Let's just say that right away. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8943.04s)]
*  Even if we didn't exist, this fucking thing is not stable, even if we did not exist. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8945.04s)]
*  Then the question is, how much do we affect it? [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8951.04s)]
*  We definitely affect it. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8954.04s)]
*  For sure. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8955.04s)]
*  There's no chance we don't. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8956.04s)]
*  We're pumping gas into the atmosphere. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8957.04s)]
*  What kind of an effect? [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8959.04s)]
*  It's having a warming effect. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8960.04s)]
*  How bad is that warming effect? [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8962.04s)]
*  That's what we need to know. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8964.04s)]
*  What do we have to do to stop that warming effect, or at least slow down that warming [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8965.04s)]
*  effect? [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8969.04s)]
*  That's what we need to know. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8970.04s)]
*  All this fucking panic and hysteria, and you need to get rid of this and get rid of that, [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8971.04s)]
*  and we're going to go all electric. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8974.04s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8975.04s)]
*  What are you, pro-lithium mining in the Congo? [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8977.04s)]
*  Is that what you are? [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8980.04s)]
*  Are you pro-child slavery to get cobalt? [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8981.04s)]
*  Where are you getting these batteries? [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8984.04s)]
*  How are you getting 8 billion people to move around electric cars? [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8986.04s)]
*  Where do you get those minerals? [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8991.04s)]
*  You don't. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8992.04s)]
*  They literally don't exist. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8993.04s)]
*  No, there's not enough. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8994.04s)]
*  There's not enough. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8995.04s)]
*  There's also no ethical consumption under capitalism and all that fucking Marxist stuff [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=8996.04s)]
*  that's true but also sounds tried at this point. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9000.04s)]
*  It's like, I think that we'll be lucky if we make it to 100 years to see the seas boil [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9003.04s)]
*  without some kind of economic collapse crushing us or out there selling our holes for bullets [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9007.04s)]
*  and salt. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9011.04s)]
*  I think we're going to have an economic collapse, but I don't think the whole world will. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9012.04s)]
*  Don't we move the needle on the world, though? [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9016.04s)]
*  For now, but what happens is what always happens. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9019.04s)]
*  A new empire takes over. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9022.04s)]
*  Sure, China is using quantum computers to hack all of our fucking shit, dude. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9024.04s)]
*  They're saving all of our information to the point where they can get quantum computers, [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9028.04s)]
*  and then they can hack everyone's PIN codes and bank accounts and just steal all the money [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9031.04s)]
*  from America. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9035.04s)]
*  That's the big move. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9036.04s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9037.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9038.04s)]
*  So that's TikTok. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9039.04s)]
*  Well, that's part of it, dude. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9040.04s)]
*  TikTok's the Trojan horse. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9041.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9042.04s)]
*  Uh-oh. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9043.04s)]
*  I've got to put my money in gold. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9044.04s)]
*  Yeah, dude, so what? [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9047.04s)]
*  You know there's only enough ... Did you see this? [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9048.04s)]
*  I saw this the other day. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9050.04s)]
*  The amount of gold in the world is so small. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9051.04s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9054.04s)]
*  The amount of gold in the world is something like 75 feet square. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9055.04s)]
*  What? [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9060.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9061.04s)]
*  I thought they had vaults full of it from floor to ceiling. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9062.04s)]
*  I thought so, too. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9064.04s)]
*  Four knots. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9065.04s)]
*  The actual amount of gold in the world, they said, was like the size of a cricket pitch. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9066.04s)]
*  What? [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9071.04s)]
*  Something like that. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9072.04s)]
*  Is that bullshit? [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9073.04s)]
*  No. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9074.04s)]
*  It goes up. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9075.04s)]
*  It goes up. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9076.04s)]
*  We've got to leave here and go get some gold. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9077.04s)]
*  It's volume. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9078.04s)]
*  It's not just going to cover it one inch. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9079.04s)]
*  Right. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9080.04s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean the size, but 75 feet square. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9081.04s)]
*  That's like a solid brick. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9083.04s)]
*  That's like it's showing pictures of it on the Wilbeth and Corp. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9084.04s)]
*  Can you show me? [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9087.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, but it's like ... [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9088.04s)]
*  Can you show me what it looked like on the Wilbeth and Corp.? [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9089.04s)]
*  It's towering. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9091.04s)]
*  Okay. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9092.04s)]
*  But still, but it's still not that much. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9093.04s)]
*  That's the whole world. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9095.04s)]
*  It's like half of a twin tower. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9096.04s)]
*  So, it's 75 feet high and how long is it? [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9100.04s)]
*  It's using very strange ... [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9104.04s)]
*  What is it saying? [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9106.04s)]
*  Metric tons. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9107.04s)]
*  Okay, so it's only ... It's 208,874 tons of gold that's been mined throughout history, [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9108.04s)]
*  of which around two-thirds have been mined since 1950. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9115.04s)]
*  And since gold is virtually indestructible, this means that almost all of this metal is [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9118.04s)]
*  still around in one form or another. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9123.04s)]
*  Wow. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9125.04s)]
*  But is owning gold going to help you when I'm on a leash from a warlord? [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9126.04s)]
*  They're eating off my back. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9130.04s)]
*  Do you know the most fun conspiracy theory about gold? [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9132.04s)]
*  No. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9134.04s)]
*  It's a really good one. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9135.04s)]
*  It's from the work of Zechariah Sitchin, who was one of the guys who translated the ancient [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9136.04s)]
*  Sumerian texts. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9144.04s)]
*  And he believed that the human race is a product of accelerated evolution and that the Sumerian [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9145.04s)]
*  text depicts these godlike beings called the Anunnaki who come here from a planet called [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9152.04s)]
*  Nibiru that's on an elliptical orbit every 3,600 years, comes between us and Mars and [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9158.04s)]
*  causes cataclysms because of the gravity and all the chaos. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9164.04s)]
*  But that these beings came down here and inserted their DNA into lower primates and created [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9168.04s)]
*  this being. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9174.04s)]
*  And one of the reasons why it came here is because gold is very difficult to find in [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9175.04s)]
*  the universe. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9180.04s)]
*  Now, if that's the truth about the earth only has that much gold, imagine that one of the [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9181.04s)]
*  reasons why these beings gave us this desire to have gold, why gold was so popular always [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9186.04s)]
*  early on. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9192.04s)]
*  And it was a useless metal. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9193.04s)]
*  So what? [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9194.04s)]
*  It was pretty. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9195.04s)]
*  How come you could buy a house with bags of gold? [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9196.04s)]
*  Shouldn't you have steel for a sword or for arrowheads or something? [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9198.04s)]
*  Salt? [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9201.04s)]
*  Well, anything would be more valuable. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9202.04s)]
*  Well, salt was very valuable. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9203.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9204.04s)]
*  But this is different because this is like a form of money. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9205.04s)]
*  Like, why has it universally been regarded as valuable, like really early on? [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9207.04s)]
*  And what he said was that they realized that they could take these suspended particles [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9213.04s)]
*  of gold and put them in their atmosphere and it would protect them because their atmosphere [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9218.04s)]
*  was eroding. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9224.04s)]
*  And so this would be like reflective, like reflective particles they spray in the atmosphere. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9225.04s)]
*  Like what Bill Gates wants to do where he like blocks out the sun. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9230.04s)]
*  So this is what's crazy about this. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9232.04s)]
*  This guy wrote about this in like the 1970s. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9233.04s)]
*  He wrote this, what is it called? [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9235.04s)]
*  The 12th Planet, I think. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9237.04s)]
*  That was the first of them. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9239.04s)]
*  I think he wrote multiple books on this, on the Sumerian text. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9240.04s)]
*  But in, I think it was like the 1970s or somewhere around then, they were having this sort of [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9244.04s)]
*  symposium on what to do in the sense of like ozone depletion and climate change. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9251.04s)]
*  Is there a way to suspend reflective particles in the atmosphere to block out some of the [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9258.04s)]
*  harmful rays of the sun? [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9263.04s)]
*  So that was their idea. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9264.04s)]
*  So what this book is trying to say is the reason why humans are obsessed with gold is [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9265.04s)]
*  because like the aliens designed us to mine and get the gold. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9270.04s)]
*  And then they would use that gold to protect their atmosphere. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9275.04s)]
*  So they impregnated us with this idea that gold has value because they need it to enhance [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9279.04s)]
*  their ability to keep living. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9285.04s)]
*  It's a fun idea. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9286.04s)]
*  It's a very fun idea. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9287.04s)]
*  All that shit's fun. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9288.04s)]
*  If you're doing bong hits and you're like watching documentaries. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9289.04s)]
*  High on hallucinogenic honey. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9291.04s)]
*  And you hear Joe Rogan saying it in your head. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9293.04s)]
*  It's cool when you see Zechariah Sitchin too because he's this like very scholarly looking [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9295.04s)]
*  gentleman with an awesome name. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9301.04s)]
*  And he's like pointing out all these different things like the caduceus, the sign of a man [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9303.04s)]
*  medicine, like the universal sign of medicine. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9308.04s)]
*  He's like that's the double helix of DNA. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9311.04s)]
*  That's what that is. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9313.04s)]
*  That's why it sneaks around like that. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9314.04s)]
*  And he says it represents medicine in ancient Sumer. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9315.04s)]
*  And it also like it's present in these very weird stone tablets. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9319.04s)]
*  Some of these stone tablets have images of this like enormous being with this human like [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9324.04s)]
*  creature on its lap. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9331.04s)]
*  But the thing has a tail. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9332.04s)]
*  It's really weird. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9334.04s)]
*  It's really weird stuff. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9335.04s)]
*  And then also they also had a depiction of the entire solar system, all the planets in [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9336.04s)]
*  the solar system and roughly the same size and roughly the same place. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9342.04s)]
*  So they had an idea of what planets were out there in 6000 BC or whatever it was. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9345.04s)]
*  5000 BC. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9352.04s)]
*  That's fucking insane. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9353.04s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9354.04s)]
*  How does everything we know now. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9355.04s)]
*  It's fucking insane. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9356.04s)]
*  And it's wild to look at. [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9357.04s)]
*  Like you see this clay tablet. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9359.04s)]
*  It has what is like clearly the sun in the center. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9360.04s)]
*  Like look at this thing. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9363.04s)]
*  How wild is that? [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9364.04s)]
*  Are the Anunnaki the albino ones? [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9365.04s)]
*  Are those the albino aliens? [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9366.04s)]
*  I don't know that. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9367.04s)]
*  I don't know anything about that. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9368.04s)]
*  I am only like familiar with the chariots of the gods type shit. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9369.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9370.04s)]
*  Chariots of the gods is interesting too. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9371.04s)]
*  I met that guy. [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9372.04s)]
*  Really? [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9373.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9374.04s)]
*  Eric Von Daniken. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9375.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9376.04s)]
*  I went to a lunch. [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9377.04s)]
*  It's very wealthy guy that I know is interested in this kind of stuff. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9378.04s)]
*  And I think one of his friends was as well. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9379.04s)]
*  And so they decided to have this guy come over and they said, you know, do you know anybody? [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9380.04s)]
*  And he said, yeah. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9381.04s)]
*  And I said, yeah. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9382.04s)]
*  And he said, yeah. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9383.04s)]
*  And he said, yeah. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9384.04s)]
*  And he said, yeah. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9385.04s)]
*  And he said, yeah. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9386.04s)]
*  And he said, yeah. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9387.04s)]
*  I think one of his friends was as well. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9389.04s)]
*  And so they decided to have this guy come over and they said, you know, do you know [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9390.76s)]
*  anybody who knows a lot about this stuff? [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9394.6s)]
*  And then my friend called me up and said, do you want to come and talk to Eric Von Daniken? [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9396.76s)]
*  Yes. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9400.560000000001s)]
*  I was like, yes. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9401.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9402.560000000001s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9403.560000000001s)]
*  I was asking him all these questions. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9404.560000000001s)]
*  I think he's a true believer. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9406.0s)]
*  He's a true believer. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9408.18s)]
*  He's a true believer that all these things are created by aliens, whether it's the pyramids [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9409.18s)]
*  or all these other structures that are impossible to do today. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9415.64s)]
*  I'm a believer that all those structures are most likely the evidence of a super advanced [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9419.96s)]
*  civilization that existed that got wiped out by meteors. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9426.48s)]
*  And also that they like conducted energy, right? [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9429.199999999999s)]
*  They did something different than we're doing. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9431.279999999999s)]
*  No one really knows. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9433.0s)]
*  And they're all built along the same lines, right? [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9434.0s)]
*  Like the Nazca lines? [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9436.279999999999s)]
*  Some of them are. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9437.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9438.72s)]
*  And there's that's the Nazca lines is different. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9439.72s)]
*  That's that's in Peru. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9441.8s)]
*  That's really interesting stuff because it is enormous things that are laid out on the [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9443.28s)]
*  sand or on the ground that you can't see unless you're in the sky. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9448.28s)]
*  It's real weird. [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9451.52s)]
*  And some of them look like landing strips. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9452.52s)]
*  It's like, what were they doing? [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9454.2s)]
*  I have no idea. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9456.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9457.24s)]
*  No one knows. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9458.24s)]
*  No. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9459.24s)]
*  I think most of that stuff that they keep finding, like the structures of Gobekli Tepe [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9460.24s)]
*  and all these other structures they find around the world, they don't really know where they [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9463.16s)]
*  came from. [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9466.12s)]
*  I think a lot of that is probably evidence of some shit that existed a long time ago [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9467.12s)]
*  and they got wiped out. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9471.800000000001s)]
*  And there's a real lot of evidence. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9473.32s)]
*  There's a purpose globally, too, though. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9474.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9475.32s)]
*  There had to be some kind of like mass communication to arrange those structures, right? [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9476.32s)]
*  Well, at least in the people that were in that area. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9480.039999999999s)]
*  What's interesting to me is the most spectacular ones all came from Africa. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9483.039999999999s)]
*  And we know human beings all came from Africa. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9486.439999999999s)]
*  And the most spectacular ever in the history of humanity still exists in Egypt. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9489.119999999999s)]
*  And they're like, you know, the very most recent they could be is like four thousand [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9493.92s)]
*  five hundred years old, which is bananas, dude. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9500.6s)]
*  It's bananas. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9504.28s)]
*  It's like, what was going on down then? [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9505.28s)]
*  Also all those cities like the one in Peru that's built like Machu Picchu, twelve thousand [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9507.24s)]
*  feet or whatever. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9511.2s)]
*  How do you get the fucking stones up there? [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9512.2s)]
*  How the fuck did that happen? [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9513.68s)]
*  I'm going down there with my dad in May. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9515.28s)]
*  The wackiest theory I heard was that that used to be at the base of water and that everything [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9517.76s)]
*  out in front of that at one point in time, many, many, many, many thousands of years [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9523.44s)]
*  ago was all water. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9527.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9528.880000000001s)]
*  Beats effectively been substantiated or that might be just a wacky theory. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9530.16s)]
*  But if it's not, how did they do that? [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9534.039999999999s)]
*  And how do they they made them so they're all like kind of jigsaw pieces and they all [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9536.92s)]
*  slide right into each other. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9540.279999999999s)]
*  And they're fucking enormous and they're perfectly fit together. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9541.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9544.56s)]
*  It's not just like random like fill in with no. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9545.56s)]
*  These guys are artists and engineers and wizards. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9547.8s)]
*  Like how the fuck do they do that? [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9551.24s)]
*  It's crazy to be a mason and also be able to design some kind of structure that can [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9552.88s)]
*  communicate and or create energy to empower people who live almost two miles high. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9558.039999999999s)]
*  I should say it's beyond any kind of fathoming that I can do. [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9563.439999999999s)]
*  Well, what's really weird is that a lot of them have these structures that are designed [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9567.0s)]
*  in mirror of the cosmos, too. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9571.56s)]
*  So they're very aware of they're very aware of all the stars in the sky and all the constellations [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9573.72s)]
*  and they put that a lot of it in their design. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9579.32s)]
*  They did it in Mexico. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9582.56s)]
*  The Aztecs did it. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9583.56s)]
*  The Mayans did it. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9584.8s)]
*  So just imagine if there's one time I could go back and see what the fuck was life like. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9586.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think it would be ancient Egypt. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9592.039999999999s)]
*  OK. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9593.8s)]
*  What were you guys doing? [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9594.8s)]
*  How the fuck did you do this? [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9596.0s)]
*  Like what was what was life like? [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9598.119999999999s)]
*  What what what kind of people were around back then? [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9599.88s)]
*  We have like some bodies, but the bodies a lot. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9602.599999999999s)]
*  Do you know that Cleopatra? [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9605.679999999998s)]
*  She lived closer to the invention of the iPhone than she did to the construction of the pyramids. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9608.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9615.88s)]
*  No. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9616.4s)]
*  Cleopatra was not that long ago. [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9617.4s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9619.4s)]
*  When was she around? [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9620.039999999999s)]
*  I think a couple thousand years ago. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9620.92s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9622.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9623.24s)]
*  What time is Cleopatra around? [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9625.08s)]
*  Died somewhere in the range of 50 to 30 B.C. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9627.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9633.039999999999s)]
*  So a little less than 2000 years ago. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9633.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9636.76s)]
*  And then the pyramids were 2500 years at least before that. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9637.119999999999s)]
*  Fuck, dude. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9641.119999999999s)]
*  And maybe more. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9642.52s)]
*  What about the Maoris? [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9643.68s)]
*  Those dudes who navigated all the way to Hawaii. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9645.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9647.4s)]
*  Fucking kayaks by the stars. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9647.84s)]
*  Fucking kayaks. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9649.92s)]
*  I'd go back there. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9650.8s)]
*  I'd see what those boys were up to. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9651.88s)]
*  Hardcore shit. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9653.68s)]
*  You just launch off of your island and you're like fingers crossed we're going to find some other shit out there. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9654.519999999999s)]
*  Fingers crossed you didn't even caught a hurricane. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9658.519999999999s)]
*  Or they knew or someone told them there was shit out there. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9659.439999999999s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9663.119999999999s)]
*  Well, I bet they went on fishing voyages and I bet they just kept going further and further out. [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9664.92s)]
*  Really? [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9670.0s)]
*  And then when you do it over time and you figure out how to get back, they probably just I don't think they did it all in one crazy trip. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9670.36s)]
*  No, but I think that they had expeditions that they would probably report back from lesser islands. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9675.84s)]
*  Come back and be like, yeah, now we have set up over here. [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9680.24s)]
*  Right. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9683.119999999999s)]

*  So we don't have any more water. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9697.64s)]
*  All we have is coconut milk. [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9698.96s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you look and you see waterfalls and shit. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9699.92s)]
*  You're like, oh, no wonder why they're so happy. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9702.24s)]

*  Don't get me wrong. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9720.04s)]

*  And we were walking down this dirt trail. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9945.56s)]
*  And there was this really high grass to the right of us. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9949.36s)]
*  And inside the high grass, yeah, that's the noises they make. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9952.4s)]
*  Going after that pumpkin. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9955.68s)]
*  Listen to the noises. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9956.48s)]
*  Get along, boys. [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9960.199999999999s)]
*  Bro, I mean, they sound like little demons. [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9961.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9962.88s)]
*  They're mean. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9963.519999999999s)]
*  They won't share that pumpkin. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9964.119999999999s)]
*  But we were walking down this trail. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9967.16s)]
*  And to the right of us is this high grass. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9969.68s)]
*  And inside were wild pigs. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9971.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9973.119999999999s)]
*  We were fighting. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9973.4s)]
*  And dude, it sounded like demon shit. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9974.32s)]
*  It sounded like Lord of the Rings stuff. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9976.72s)]
*  It's like, oh, I was like, Jesus Christ. [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9978.8s)]
*  It's like Mordor. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9983.72s)]
*  Like if we were hunting demons, and that's just what they looked like. [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9984.960000000001s)]
*  Turn around. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9988.8s)]
*  It'd be terrifying. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9989.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9990.04s)]
*  Like hearing that noise coming out of the grass, I was like, what the fuck? [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9990.56s)]
*  They will charge you, too. [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9994.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9995.6s)]
*  That's what's scary about wild pigs. [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9995.960000000001s)]
*  They'll fucking go after you. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9997.4s)]
*  Don't pigs turn feral within two weeks or something crazy? [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=9998.92s)]
*  I think it's like they start to morph within five or six weeks. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10002.72s)]
*  Yeah, they grow tusks real quick within a year. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10006.04s)]
*  Well, their face elongates. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10008.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10010.32s)]
*  That's like, this was all explained to me by Steve Rinella. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10010.92s)]
*  He was the guy, actually, that I was pig hunting with when we heard him in the grass, [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10013.72s)]
*  like demons. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10016.76s)]
*  It was the craziest noise, dude. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10017.439999999999s)]
*  So he said that this one species, you know, people say wild boars and wild. [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10019.76s)]
*  It's all one species. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10023.8s)]
*  It's called Suscropa. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10024.92s)]
*  And they're all interchangeable. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10026.92s)]
*  They just selectively breed them for different things. [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10028.32s)]
*  But it's one species, which is nuts. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10030.679999999998s)]
*  So when a domestic pig gets out, like some of these pigs, [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10033.64s)]
*  have you ever heard of Hogzilla? [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10037.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10039.16s)]
*  Hogzilla is this giant wild boar they caught. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10039.8s)]
*  They said that's most likely that was a domestic pig that somebody fattened up and got real [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10042.2s)]
*  enormous, and then it broke out. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10047.0s)]
*  And it just made its way to the woods. [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10048.720000000001s)]
*  So your classic pink pig became Hogzilla. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10050.2s)]
*  Their hair changes. [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10054.08s)]
*  It gets thicker and darker. [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10056.2s)]
*  And they just look totally different. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10058.640000000001s)]
*  Nature. [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10060.240000000002s)]
*  It's wild, dude, because it's like they're like gremlins. [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10060.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10063.960000000001s)]
*  Like the gremlins, and they feed them after midnight. [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10064.44s)]
*  That's what happens to the pigs. [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10066.400000000001s)]
*  They're like, we're cool as long as you feed us and keep us in a fucking barn. [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10067.44s)]
*  Keep us in this contained fenced area. [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10072.0s)]
*  We're good. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10075.48s)]
*  That's like the majority of Americans. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10076.08s)]
*  And then as soon as you can't get food anymore, they're going to turn and start eating each other. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10077.72s)]
*  That's what it is. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10081.48s)]
*  We're going to be fucking eating each other's kids and shit. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10082.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10084.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10085.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10085.92s)]
*  The last of us. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10086.52s)]
*  I don't think I'll do well in that situation. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10087.44s)]
*  You might rise to the occasion, buddy. [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10089.64s)]
*  Dude, I'm trying. [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10091.24s)]
*  Because comedians will be the first against the wall, and they'll use my back for leather [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10092.24s)]
*  for their chariots. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10096.68s)]
*  My wife's a doctor, so she's going to be very valuable. [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10098.36s)]
*  They're going to want her. [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10101.04s)]
*  Right. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10102.080000000002s)]
*  I'll just be like an ox. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10102.720000000001s)]
*  I'll have a yoke in my mouth pulling the carts. [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10104.28s)]
*  Maybe your football and wrestling experience could come in handy. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10106.960000000001s)]
*  Oh, I would easily. [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10109.68s)]
*  I would fucking eat someone real quick, dude. [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10111.240000000002s)]
*  How quick? [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10113.400000000001s)]
*  Easy. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10113.92s)]
*  As soon as I need to. [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10114.720000000001s)]
*  Power goes out for two months. [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10115.6s)]
*  Two months? [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10116.36s)]
*  Four and a half days. [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10117.560000000001s)]
*  Four and a half days later. [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10118.76s)]
*  I'm going next door with my Mossberg. [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10119.080000000002s)]
*  Being like, what have you got in here? [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10120.880000000001s)]
*  Who's ripe? [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10122.36s)]
*  Hand it over. [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10123.28s)]
*  I have no problem with cannibalism for some reason. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10124.28s)]
*  Would you want to kill and eat the people that were a problem first? [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10126.12s)]
*  Just like clean up society, Dexter style? [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10129.68s)]
*  No, I'm still lazy. [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10131.56s)]
*  It'd be proximity. [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10132.44s)]
*  It would be whatever was in my grasp. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10135.04s)]
*  I bet you wouldn't be lazy. [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10136.92s)]
*  You'd probably lose a lot of weight. [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10138.08s)]
*  Your joints would feel better. [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10139.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10140.32s)]
*  Because you wouldn't be doing whatever you're doing now. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10140.84s)]
*  You'd be trying to find food. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10143.68s)]
*  Whatever I'm doing now. [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10145.12s)]
*  So you would also only be drinking water, [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10146.0s)]
*  because that's probably all that's available. [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10148.36s)]
*  Once everybody cleans out all the warehouses of soda, [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10150.76s)]

*  It would be a thing. [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10156.76s)]
*  You bust it open for special occasions. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10157.640000000001s)]
*  Hey, I got a bottle of Dr. Pepper in the basement. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10159.720000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10169.48s)]
*  It'd be a can this big. [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10170.24s)]
*  It'd be like eight glasses. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10171.4s)]

*  Pepsi would become our sacred beverage [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10178.12s)]

*  What is Yellow Jackets? [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10203.92s)]
*  They eat their friends? [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10204.56s)]
*  There's a bunch of girls who got like a. [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10205.4s)]
*  You said that so easily. [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10206.72s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10207.76s)]
*  It's fictional. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10210.44s)]
*  It's not a documentary. [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10212.52s)]
*  But these girls get like trapped in the woods. [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10213.88s)]
*  They're on like a soccer team or whatever, [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10217.32s)]
*  and their plane goes down and they have to eat one [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10218.759999999998s)]
*  of the girls after she dies. [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10220.279999999999s)]
*  It's like she's already dead. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10221.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah, if she's already dead, it's not that big of a problem. [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10222.72s)]
*  Munch her. [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10224.119999999999s)]
*  But here's the issue with eating someone after they died. [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10224.64s)]
*  If they starve, they don't have any nutrients in their body. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10226.679999999998s)]
*  Is that true? [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10229.48s)]
*  So eating them, yeah. [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10229.8s)]
*  Like they've already leached all the nutrients out [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10230.64s)]
*  to go to their liver and heart. [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10232.4s)]
*  What's that? [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10233.8s)]
*  What are you hearing this? [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10234.119999999999s)]
*  Like shipwreck books. [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10234.88s)]
*  Really? [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10235.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10236.4s)]
*  I've read a lot of books about shipwrecks. [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10237.08s)]
*  Their meat won't have vitamins. [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10239.56s)]
*  It's not valuable. [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10240.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10242.16s)]
*  It's not valuable if they're starving to death? [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10242.76s)]
*  Yeah, because they've used all of their nutrients [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10244.48s)]
*  to keep their organs alive. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10246.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10249.56s)]
*  So it's like eating Styrofoam at that point. [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10250.08s)]
*  That makes sense. [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10251.44s)]
*  Because if you eat healthy things, [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10252.28s)]
*  it's probably healthier. [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10253.76s)]
*  That's why Wild Game is so good for you. [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10255.04s)]
*  Right. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10256.64s)]
*  That makes sense. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10256.92s)]
*  Like eating Elkhart rules compared [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10257.6s)]
*  to eating just like a guy who died in the hospital. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10259.44s)]
*  Guy who got cannibalism. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10262.56s)]
*  It's perfectly natural. [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10264.72s)]
*  A new scientific history argues. [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10265.68s)]
*  OK. [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10267.76s)]
*  Whatever. [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10269.08s)]
*  That's what they're trying to normalize next [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10270.2s)]
*  after they normalize the Dalai Lama. [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10271.96s)]
*  Where do these libs end? [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10273.439999999999s)]
*  Is that what they're doing? [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10275.119999999999s)]
*  Fucking cannibalism? [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10276.08s)]
*  Fresh, you want to adoptionate my kids. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10277.199999999999s)]
*  Suck up my tongue. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10279.48s)]
*  They want minor, what is it, minor attracted people. [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10280.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10283.679999999998s)]
*  They tried that one for a little while. [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10284.199999999999s)]
*  Fuck that shit, dude. [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10285.919999999998s)]

*  That was one thing that really surprised me. [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10314.84s)]

*  See, those things drive like dog shit. [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10410.92s)]
*  That's the problem. [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10413.96s)]
*  I like when a car looks like a snub nose pistol. [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10414.72s)]
*  That looks pretty dope. [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFKVYl9vj6s&t=10416.84s)]
