# JRE MMA Show #80 with Evander Holyfield
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 07, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyUAzkDdZ9g)
*  Boom, and we're live. What's up champ? How are you? I'm great, and how you doing? I'm
*  great man. It's a pleasure to meet you. I've been a fan forever. Oh good. I've seen every
*  single fight you've ever had. So for me, it's a, it's an honor to have you in here, man,
*  as a giant boxing fan. All the way back to Dwight Kaui. Saw you fight in the Olympics.
*  Saw everything. Yeah, you did. Everything, man. Yeah, for real. And I understand you're,
*  you're going to do an exhibition now. Well, yeah, I'm preparing for one, you know, you
*  know, me going over, going over to Japan and being able to go over there and see the, the
*  Tauhont, whatever that. Tsunami? Tsunami. Yeah. And the point is in the tsunami, going over
*  there and helping people. And I figured, why not do an exhibition? Right. So it's like
*  a benefit for the tsunami victims. Yes. You look great. You're in great shape still. Well,
*  thank you. You know, you never got out of shape. Well, yeah. Heart of the game. Yeah.
*  Easy to maintain and rebuild. Easier to maintain and rebuild. Yeah. But now at your age, like
*  what was the last time you had a fight? Was it like 2011? Is that what it was? Yeah, 2011.
*  So it's been like eight years, which is, you were thinking of competing like deep into
*  your fifties though. Well, yeah, the thing is, is that I'm always trying to stay in shape,
*  but really didn't want to get hit again. Right. Right. Right. Like that. But exhibition, I could
*  do an exhibition. Who is the exhibition against? I don't know yet. I'm thinking about, you know,
*  I wanted to be ready at both, me and him buddies. Now you could do it with somebody you're friends
*  with. Right. They know that they not going to hit you too hard if you don't hit them too hard.
*  Right. So it'll be more of a sparring sort of a deal. Yes. Now how often are you training now?
*  Well, you know, I'm always training. I shadow box. I don't hit the bag, but I'm ready to do it now
*  because I'm actually going to be performing. I want to look good, but I don't want to get in a
*  doggy doggy fight. Right. You don't want to get into a war, right? You just want to have like a
*  little exhibition sparring match, just a little, just combinations, not hit each other too hard,
*  that kind of deal. Well, yeah, we hit, we can hit hard to the body, right? Not the head. Right.
*  Right. Right. Now at this stage of your life, you know, it's been a while since you competed. Are
*  you worried that those competitive juices might get fired up again and you might want to actually
*  fight again? I don't think I will ever go back in because I did everything I wanted to do. Right.
*  I feel that I got as far as I wanted to get. And, you know, I'm the only four-time heavyweight
*  champion in the world. Ever. But I ain't got no reason to be mad with nobody about anything. I
*  can think that I had a great career. You had an unbelievable career. Yes. Only four-time heavyweight
*  champion in the world ever. I mean, I can remember way back in the day when you were moving up from
*  cruiserweight to heavyweight, you know, and it was one of the rare times where we were watching,
*  back in those days, if folks who don't know, it was kind of taboo for boxers to live weights.
*  Yeah, it was. And it was Mackie Shilstone that got you ready for that, right? No, no, no. Tim
*  Hallmark. Yeah, Tim Hallmark. Mackie Shilstone got Spinks ready. Got Spinks ready. Yeah. And I came
*  after that. And the point of coming out to Mackie Shilstone, everybody thought about the weight, but
*  Tim Hallmark would talk about flexibility, all the things you had to do when you lift weights.
*  Right. Yeah. Because everybody used to think before that that if you lifted weights, it made
*  you stiff. Yeah. And Tim was able to, he did everything with me to show me that that's just a
*  myth. Right, right. Condition is about, you know, heart rate and all this. And then, you know,
*  when you lift weight, you just got to do more. Right. It seemed like back then the problem was
*  when people would lift weights, they would get sore, and then they would go to the gym and they
*  wouldn't perform as well. And so everybody would say, our weights are making you stiff.
*  They didn't allow themselves to get through a full program with a real strength and conditioning guy
*  like Tim Hallmark or Mackie Shilstone. They were the first guys really to bulk guys up.
*  Right. It's all about confidence and someone taking it to another level, you know. And I think that
*  at that time, people just kind of, in this level, this is all we know and this is only far we can
*  go because you have to work harder. Yeah. If you lift weight, you're going to have to work harder.
*  Right. With me, I was able to bring a ballet teacher and I had ballet too. Did you really?
*  That's the reason why I was able to still be flexible and being able to be quick and all that.
*  And, you know, I did all that, but I ain't let nobody know I was doing ballet.
*  I'd like to see some video of you doing ballet. Is it out there?
*  No, we didn't. No. Did you wear a tutu?
*  No, no, no, no. You know, I got stressed a lot. I mean, you're talking about Miss Kennedy,
*  that's her name. And so I kept her to the day and she ended up slipping, breaking her hip.
*  And because she was like 70 years old when she would stretch him in, had me doing all the splits
*  and all this, but it worked. Yeah. Well, you were one of the first like
*  supremely conditioned heavyweight boxers, you know, when you'd see you, you were sculpted,
*  and you would be able to put that output out for the entire 12 rounds. I mean, you had those
*  incredible fights at Riddick Bow. I know you guys are friends now, but God damn, did you guys have
*  some wars? We had battles. And I think the big thing, because he kind of bully, you know,
*  and he a big guy and he used to always look at me and say, a good big guy beat a good little guy
*  anytime. And every time we go in and practice, I bust him up. But you know, I was four years
*  older than him, but he was bigger. And but I was always getting. Yeah. Well, you guys had some crazy
*  fights, but the craziest one was probably the one where the guy landed in the middle of the ring,
*  the guy with the parachute with the, what was that guy's, what did he call himself? The fan man.
*  That's right. He had a fan that was powering his parachute and he literally landed in the ring.
*  That was an outdoor arena in Vegas. Is that what it was? Well, it sure was. And it made and held
*  the fight up about 30 minutes. That was crazy. I had come back at that time. I had him hurt. Yes.
*  And like that and it saved him. Yeah. Well, you had him hurting. Then everybody got cold.
*  I mean, you cooled off. I mean, it almost seems like they should have canceled the fight.
*  Well, you know, it was half of the fight. You know, they cast the fight. They were at the
*  payers again. There's a picture up there. Like, look at that. What was going through your mind
*  when you saw that guy land on the ropes like that? Well, it shocked me. And then, because when he did
*  the light story like this and Curtis Mayfield had just got paralyzed, but same thing with the
*  thing fell down. Oh, lights fell on him. Yeah. Curtis Mayfield, he got paralyzed that way? Yes.
*  Oh, wow. So you thought maybe the lights were about to fall. Well, yeah. And I was trying to
*  make sure that I could make that quick step, get in or get out. Right, right, right. Yeah.
*  So this guy, once you finally realized that it was a guy on a parachute with a fan behind him,
*  how mad were you? You know, I couldn't keep my mind on him. I got to keep my mind on Redd Boat.
*  No, everybody asked me that. And I'm like, my mind, you know, you have to have a one track mind
*  is you're going to be real good. You're going to be the best. You have to have that one track mind.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's not something you can pay attention to, but was it hard to get your mind
*  back into it after the settle and they had to clear the guy out and arrest him and clean the
*  ring out and everything? No, I stayed focused. And my whole thing is that I felt that I won the first
*  half. Right. I got this next half. Why did it take a half hour to get that guy out of there?
*  You know, Redd Boat's wife was there. She was pregnant and she had to leave and all this. So
*  many things happened because the guy happened to come over at the barricade and so all these people,
*  they don't beat the poor man in the head. They don't knock him out like this. I mean, he got a
*  really good beating for coming in. I hope he did. Yeah, he did. Yeah. Is he still in jail?
*  No, no, no. He passed now. Oh, he's gone? Yeah. Oh, well. I guess that's his legacy.
*  Well, you know. You fucked up your fight. That's his legacy. You're right. But I won. Yes, you did.
*  Yeah. I mean, look, man, you had some incredible fights, but to me, one of my fondest memories is
*  you know who Kevin James is from the King of Queens? Yeah. The TV show. Me and Kevin James
*  were at my house in Encino the night you fought Tyson, the first one, the first fight when you
*  dropped Tyson. I'll never forget it because back then we knew that Buster Douglas had beaten Tyson,
*  but we kind of almost thought it was like a fluke. But when you were battering Tyson and then you put
*  him down and stopped him, I'll never forget Kevin James jumping off the couch, just jumping. Oh,
*  my God, we're throwing our arms up in the air. I mean, that was for sure one of the greatest
*  heavyweight championship victories in the history of the sport. It was just an incredible fight
*  because in a lot of people's eyes, Tyson was like this, a bad guy. He was like, people thought of
*  him as like a thug, you know, and you were thought of as this like really good guy. And many people
*  didn't think that you were going to be able to beat him. So when you didn't just beat him, but
*  you took it to him, you took it to him. You know, like early on in the fight, you could tell that
*  you had decided you were going to push him around. And, you know, once you had stopped him,
*  I mean, it was that was pandemonium in my house. Everybody was going crazy. They couldn't believe
*  it. Well, I know, you know, I'm like, you know, I'm a Christian. But the point of the matter,
*  I work hard, I train hard. And you know, my mama said, ain't too many things that you do well.
*  So son, you know, which one which one is sports you're going to do? Because I was a good athlete.
*  I could I but football and boxing was my two best ones. But you know, I played basketball,
*  I did baseball, I did everything. My mama said, and enough time in a day to be the best
*  at everything. Yeah, don't say so you got to pick one. So when I played when I played football in
*  10th grade, and they put me on the bench, and I start crying. And my mother said, you can't quit
*  to the season is over. So I had to play on a play on that game. They found and let me play
*  in the championship game. And they seen how good I was. And they asked me was I coming back next
*  year? I said, No, sir. He said, Why? I said, my mama said, I ain't got to like this. My mama told
*  me, you got to bet on yourself or you're gonna bet on the coach. So in boxing, you bet on yourself.
*  Right. And in team sport, you bet on the coach, you bet on the coach, you bet on the other players,
*  and you bet on the coach letting you play. Right. Right. Whereas in boxing, they have to let you
*  fight. That's right. You may be asking somebody tag in for you. Now, when did you think that
*  boxing was going to be your career? Was it right after that? It's like around 10th grade?
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. You know, after 10th grade, I realized that, you know, it don't came down to one
*  one sport that I really do real well. And so that when I, you know, I just put everything in it.
*  Well, you were part of that incredible Olympic team, too. I mean, so many great fighters came
*  out of that Olympic team, right? Yeah. Breland, Purnell Whitaker, Taylor. I can tell you all of
*  Paul Gonzalez, 106, Steve McCurry, 112, 19, Robert Shannon, 125, Meldred Taylor,
*  132, Purnell Whitaker, 139, Jerry, Jerry, and 147 with Mark Breland, 156, Frank Tate, 165,
*  Virgil Hill, 178, Virgil Hill, and then Henry Tillman and Tyrell Biggs. What a team. Yeah.
*  Crazy team. Nine gold medal, one silver, one bronze. Amazing. Yeah. And you, besides Michael
*  Spinks, you were one of the rare guys to move up, to move up and be successful as a heavyweight.
*  Did you just decide, like after you'd beat Dwight Muhammad Kaui, who was a cruiserweight champion,
*  and you'd beat, you know, some real good names at that weight class, you just decided that
*  heavyweight was where the real money was at? Well, actually, you know, my goal, I wanted to be
*  heavyweight champion of the world. And, and the only person I knew is Mike Tyson do it, I could do it.
*  So, so when Mike Tyson whooped everybody, you know, you know, you know, people tend to make
*  up excuses. Now, Mike Tyson is a small person. Right. He, he, after me, he hit hard, but he's
*  got short arms. Right. And so I seen Mike whooping, whooping people that 6'4", 6'5", 6'6",
*  they outweigh him by 20, 30 pounds. He beat the daylights out of him. Right. I figured if
*  Mike could do it, I could do it. So that gave you inspiration. That gave me inspiration. My
*  own thing is that, you know, you know, you know, I actually, you know, before it's a cruiserweight
*  division, I kind of went through that. And what's the next goal is to go up and, you know, and,
*  and I, I chose to do it. And a lot of people say, man, you crazy. Well, you know, you have to be a
*  little bit to be in this anyway. Yeah. There's no doubt about that. Right. Yeah. So when you first
*  did fight Mike Tyson, was that like something you had always knew was going to happen? Once he got
*  out of jail? Well, it was like, it was like this. My mama used to tell me, she said, now,
*  let me tell you something, by a good fighter who can't wish him away, they ain't never going
*  nowhere. You got to face it. And so, you know what? And, you know, and everybody in everything that
*  I've done, everybody will always remind me, you didn't beat Mike Tyson. Right. And I'm like, well,
*  you're right. And I said, but it's not like it was my fault. Right. Like this. I said, you know,
*  every time I got ready to fall, something happened. I said, but it wasn't my fault.
*  Well, you ain't really the champ until you beat him. It was amazing that he was so popular.
*  Especially in my house. When people get mad at me, they tell me, I can't wait until you fight Mike
*  Tyson. That's crazy. And so the thing is, is that, you know, he was that person that I watched
*  everyone in his fight. And I realized you can't make that many mistakes with Mike.
*  When you finally did beat him, do you think when you did fight him and did beat him, do you think
*  that that raised your celebrity and your notoriety to a different level? Not really. I think that it
*  let people know that you ain't got to be considered a bad person to be good in the ring.
*  Yeah. Because when you know, my own thing, I could box. But everybody thought that because
*  I didn't curse a lot, I don't get in trouble that you, you ain't mean enough to be the mean guy.
*  Most so then, I'm a skillful fighter. I took care of my body and I did everything right.
*  I'm, you know, in general, I fought a lot of guys who are a lot bigger. But it's art to the game.
*  It's really our art. It's really our art. It is not just one thing you just, you hit harder
*  because you got to be able to take something to give some. Right. Well, you always could take it.
*  Yeah. That was a big part of your career when you had an iron chin. I mean, Riddick Bowe was a
*  giant man and he hit you with some bombs and those wars that you guys had. You were able to
*  take some incredible punches. Well, yeah, the art with me, I knew that I could take it, but can you
*  take it? And so the whole big thing is the whole big thing, my whole thing, my whole big thing with
*  Mike is that what Mike had told somebody, say, everybody got a plan to they get hit. And he was
*  right. Because, you know, if you hit this guy worried about you hitting him and he worried
*  about getting hit. So he got to worry about it. Right. But I knew if you hit me, I'm going to hit
*  you back. And so that was part of the plan was to let him know that early. Right. It seems like
*  that was when you fought him, particularly in the first round, you pressed him. And that was a rare
*  moment to see someone like really pushing Mike back and getting Mike back on his heels. Well,
*  and see, in the other game, if you like Mike get you back, that may be it. Right. So you had to
*  attack him. So the whole big thing, the whole big thing with me was it's things that my mama said,
*  she said, let me tell you, when you know, when you know how good you are, when somebody press you
*  with what you're doing, she said, might load a press other people, but can he handle the press,
*  my mom said, do it back to him, do it back. If you want to see somebody stop doing something to you,
*  do it to them. All of a sudden, they'll stop. People really don't like what you make what you
*  do to somebody. And somebody do it again, you get ticked. Right. Like that. So the thing was to,
*  we practice just putting pressure, putting pressure, putting pressure,
*  make him feel the same way that he make other people feel. So that was the game plan going
*  into that fight. Yeah. Was there anything surprising about that fight? Not to me, because I didn't want
*  no surprise, because of the surprise you may get knocked out. Right. But the thing is, is to stay
*  on him and let him think about all these, those things. Now, once you stopped him in the first
*  fight, the second fight is the fight that's probably the most famous fight, because he bit
*  a chunk of your ear off. And I saw it when you're coming in here. Show everybody that. Did you ever
*  think about getting that fixed? Well, no, you know, no, that's my identification. I got my ID. I can
*  show my ear. That is right. If you want to get into somewhere. Do you know who I am? Look at my hair.
*  Yeah, that's crazy, man. That was one of the craziest moments when Mills Lane
*  looked at you and you were jumping up in the air and looked at Tyson and realized,
*  holy shit, he bit a chunk out of your fucking ear. Right. Like what, what were you thinking at that
*  time? Biting him back. I'm serious. I was getting ready to bite the daylights out of him and I was
*  going to bite him in the face. I would bite him in the face. I wouldn't wait for the ear. I was going
*  to get the fat stuff. You know, when you're from the ghetto, they say, if you do something,
*  you got to do it worse than what they did. Right. And so, you know, and I told Mike and on the talk
*  show, I said, no, I said, no, I, I won't pretend it like, like I would hurt him real bad. I said, but
*  I'm going to trip you up and bite you right in your face. Everybody know what I was going to do.
*  I said, but, you know, this, this prophet told us before the fight, he told me, he said, look,
*  he going to do something in your face area that, but you got to stay focused because if,
*  if you don't stay focused, God, that's the only way he going to get you. Right. So by him,
*  bite me on my ear when, and then, and I knew I was getting ready to bite him back. And, and, and, but
*  my corner person started telling me, keep a mind on the Lord. And because the prophet told me, he
*  said, only way he can get you to get your mind, he, he going to do something to you. Right. And
*  I thought he go hit me with elbow, a hit button, anything like that. But I never ever thought in my
*  life he would bite me on the ear. And bite a chunky ear. And it hurts so bad. And people say,
*  how bad did it hurt? I said, did you see how high I jumped?
*  No, it was crazy. You just leaped up in the air. Yeah. Yeah. It hurts so bad. And I said, Dan,
*  I said, Dan, that guy, my corner guy, Tim Hallmark, kept telling me, keep my mind on the Lord.
*  And I ain't want to hear that. You know, even though he was saying that, and I was, man, I was
*  still, I was just trying to remember that, get him. I want to bite him. I really wanted to bite
*  him back. And, and all of a sudden, it hit my mind that they always catch the second person.
*  Right. I'm telling you, anything in life, and I'm the one that people always did something to them,
*  they will always catch me. And I was the only one to get caught all the time, because they always
*  catch me trying to get the get back. So revenge is the Lord. So you don't go get back because
*  you're going to get caught. Yeah. I was amazed that they didn't stop the fight immediately.
*  Well, they came back and check and he asked me, you all right? And I said, yeah, I least wanted
*  to hit him. Right. I really wanted to hit him. I was really upset. He tried to bite you twice,
*  right? Well, he bit me twice. He bit you twice. He bit me. When we went back in and he thought I
*  was going to be scared, and he seen I caught him with these two shots, then he bit me again. Man,
*  and I jumped back and I was just getting ready to kick him in the balls. And the bell rang, and I
*  went back to the corner, boy, and I was so doggone mad, I was really going to get him. And they stopped
*  the fight. Yeah. And then I got mad because they stopped the fight. Because you were going to get
*  him. I wanted to get him back. Well, it seemed like he thought that you were going to get him,
*  and he was trying to find a way out. Well, yeah. That's the only thing that made sense. Well, yeah.
*  But the thing is, the only thing that I guess with me and what I stand on is that I was able to
*  forgive him. And that has been the turnaround in my life to tend to make people always wonder about
*  the ear bite. And I said, but I forgave him. And everybody said, so what's special about that? I
*  said, but everywhere I go around the world with the Muslim or whatever, and people say, wow,
*  this guy can't forgive. How can you forgive when you're already beating the guy? Yeah. I said,
*  but it's what life has to be if you're going to survive with even your brothers and sisters.
*  Because if you don't forgive nobody, you're going to be a mad person. You're going to find yourself
*  locked up. Right. Right. And it's going to haunt you. Whereas if you forgave him, it took a weight
*  off your shoulders. Yeah. Mike and I, we do a lot of things together because the forgiveness part.
*  It's cool to see you two together now. I mean, when I have seen things that you've done together,
*  I'm like, wow, it's crazy. Like after he bit you, those crazy fights and to see you together laughing
*  and joking around together, it's pretty interesting. Well, I mean, when you tell people,
*  you know, when you don't choose your parents, you don't choose your neighborhood, you ain't choose
*  your skin color, you ain't choose to be tall or short, but you know, this is your statue. And
*  and two people, two people came from the ghetto who box and box was the only thing I did real well.
*  Okay. And football. And but the thing is that after all that, look at how much money we made
*  doing something that we by doing it properly, we make money. Yeah. We make money and we can both,
*  you know, raise our family in the way that we want to raise them. How long did it take
*  after the fight before you forgave them? I think after about that time, I, I got into the locker
*  room and everybody started complaining. I can't believe he did this, this, this, this. I said,
*  look, I said, did he bite you? They said, no, I okay. I said, he bit me, right? And I said,
*  now I'm going to forgive him. And you know what? Y'all got to forgive him too. They said,
*  what you mean? Forgive him. I said, he ain't bite you. I said, he bit me. I said, look,
*  I will forgive him. Wow. So you forgave him in the locker room right after the fight.
*  Yes. Because the thing is, the thing is, I, you know, I was really mad coming,
*  coming down and people throwing water and people are mad and they upset because they
*  didn't get a chance to see what they really wanted to see. Right. Like this. And so they were mad and
*  they were upset. And, and I asked, you know, me, I figured who in control? God. So I said, Lord,
*  what is this thing all about? He said, forgiven. And I said, who in the world want to forgive?
*  But this is what it is. We, we're the two very important people that everybody come to see
*  and they need to know that forgiveness is a big part of life. And so I was able to do that. So
*  in the point of being able to do that, you know, I, I realized that it made my life better
*  all over the world. You know, the Kleenex. Kleenex? Yeah, sure. That's, that's a very
*  powerful thing, man. It really is. That's a very powerful decision. And, you know, it's a very
*  powerful statement, you know, to, for you to forgive him after that. I mean, that really,
*  that probably did a lot of good for a lot of people to realize, man, if a Vander Holyfield
*  can forgive Mike Tyson after he bit a chunk of his ear off, I mean, that's a, that's a strong
*  statement of character right there. Why you're not, the thing is, I didn't know a little earlier
*  than that, they may not have got that. They would have got some. You bit his face. But, but, but
*  it's amazing how, what time would do for you. Right. Right. At one point in time, I'm telling
*  you, something would have happened. Right. But because they gave me a little time to think about
*  and gave me and, and I was like, and you know, and you know, with me, when, when things,
*  things don't go right, I go back to the prayer and say, Lord, what is this about, all about?
*  Right. And he said, forgiveness. And, you know, and I wouldn't be who I am is it wasn't from
*  forgiveness. Everybody don't fell short somewhere. Right. Like that. So, you know, the whole big thing
*  is, and, and I talked to the week, a week after that, I talked to Mike, we were, we were, we was
*  at the All-Star basketball game in New York and, and I looked up and everybody was streaming. And
*  I wonder what they were streaming about telling me to watch out. I'm like, watch out for who?
*  I looked up at Mike and he had the big bad coat and he like this. And so everybody was
*  telling me that it wanted me that Mike, Mike there, he had a big bearskin coat.
*  No, you know, you have a big fur coat and the stuff like that. And he wouldn't do nothing to
*  shake hands and a week after a week after, you know, I'm saying so, you know,
*  your ear is probably still sore. No, no, I want to even that. The thing is with my ear, my ears,
*  almost like a testimony. Right. And, you know, it's almost like you win a trophy yourself.
*  There are a person looking and said, man, he became the guy. So I see that more people,
*  when they see me, they look at my ear, then that's the same as in here. I smile. Not in anger. They
*  smile and say, well, he, he became that guy. Wow. So when you saw Mike, did you guys talk?
*  Yeah. Yeah. A week after the fight? Yeah. What did he say to you?
*  Matter of fact, his, his room with next door to mine. And I didn't know we came, we came out,
*  we come out at the same time. He looked, he looked, he asked me, is it all good? I said,
*  yeah. So we get on the elevator, the guy, and we come down with a door open. Everybody was shocked.
*  And so they were shocked. Wonder why we wasn't fighting. Right. And it was just you two in the
*  elevator or other people as well? Just you two in the elevator. Yeah. So, and so at the Shagon Park,
*  they said, man, man, we thought they would be fighting. And I told the guy, I said, man,
*  I said, you know how much money I got paid in that fight. How much money can you think
*  we're going to fight for fruit? Was there ever talk about a third fight?
*  Wait, people mentioned it. You know, they, they mentioned it. Right. And, but, you know,
*  the thing is, is that they want to give a lot of money and they, they were asking me to try to,
*  and that my one thing is that I kind of feel like it's kind of bully for you to ask somebody to fight,
*  to fight you again, when you know, you're going to win again. Right. I'm so, you know, so the whole
*  big thing is, you know, I just didn't, I didn't think that if Mike, if Mike wanted to do it,
*  I would have done it, but I wasn't going to go ask. I think, I think you've been a bully when you
*  know you're better than somebody and you want to, you want to play them in something that you know,
*  you're going to beat them. Right. Right. You know, it's a challenge. It's how about a challenge.
*  You think that I can come back and beat you, but you know, just, just, you know, you feel that you
*  better. And so I think it'd be wrong for me to ask it. Right. No, that's, that's amazing. I mean,
*  but that just shows what kind of a person you are. Like that shows what kind of character you have.
*  And that sort of defines your career that you are the guy that did always seek the big challenges.
*  Yeah. You know, I, you know, winning this, you know, I, you know, the nickname real deal and I
*  was like, and people asked me, how you get that name real deal? I said, you know, I just, I thank
*  God for anything that great and come from God at all given time. You know, I'm, you know, I had a
*  mom who, who had a sixth grade education, but she raised me. She raised the four time headway
*  champion of the world. She stayed on me all the time. And my brothers and sisters said,
*  mama, you're going to make a sister to him. You don't let him go out. You don't let him do
*  nothing. My mama said, he's going to be all right. You just wait and see. And, and when I think about
*  she never did give in to what nobody said about, about me and I became who I am. And I'm just, so
*  I'm just so thankful that in the Bible said all good things come from God, anything that is good
*  for you, it came from God. It sounds like you rely on your mom and you rely on your mom a lot
*  for wisdom. Well, that's all I had. That's all I had because my brothers and sisters and stuff,
*  all of my own thing, all of them like me a lot. They may like me a little bit,
*  but my mama, I know my mama loved me. They like me a little bit. Yeah. But it's, it's amazing to
*  hear that your mother was right at every stop, at every step. All of her advice all paid out. I mean,
*  she knew there was something special about you. Well, my mom thought, my mama knew something
*  special about everybody, but you had to do the work. And in the art of me is just my mama had a
*  heart attack. My mama had a heart attack. And so my mom would at home with me to make sure that I
*  would practice. But you know, where everybody else, my mom worked 10 to 10 with them.
*  So I was the youngest one. So she had a heart attack when I was like, when I was about six
*  or seven years old. So I got caught in everything. So I got more whooping than everybody. So out of
*  all that whooping, the good person showed up. Yeah. You got more advice than everybody.
*  Have you ever thought about doing Mike's show? You know, Mike has a podcast now.
*  I did it. Did you get high with him? No, I don't have to get high to do it. But you know,
*  I did it last month. Oh, okay. Is it out already? I haven't seen it. I got to check that episode out.
*  That's incredible. What was it like to sit with him at the ranch and hang out with him?
*  It was okay. The thing is, you know, I will answer the questions and he kind of
*  asked me, I said, man, I know you're gonna do a little bit more than that. I said, you know,
*  if I did, I forgot it, Mike. I forgot it. You let your past be your past. You know,
*  you got to keep to move forward. He's a different person now. Well, I think he is. Yeah, no, he is.
*  He's a very interesting guy. He's a very smart man. Yeah, he is a lot smarter than what people
*  give him credit a lot. Now that's what they don't know about. Yeah, I know that. Yeah, no, he's very
*  introspective, very smart, and very humble, you know, the way he looks at life now, like, and
*  he doesn't even think about his old days. Like, he doesn't like that guy. He doesn't like who he used
*  to be. It's very interesting when you talk to him. Well, yeah, and your past is your past. That's
*  what you have to leave it alone. Yeah, and he smokes $40,000 worth of weed a month.
*  Well, I guess you have the money. You don't have to worry about it.
*  Well, you're involved in CBD now, right? This is what resin sports is. Yes. How amazing is CBD?
*  It's incredible, right? It's amazing how good it is for your health. Yes. And so many people have,
*  you know, your kids, and like, your kids don't even ask to have the problem. And some of them come up
*  with these problems. If you then have this CBD, then your kids probably wouldn't be, wouldn't
*  function as properly as they function. It's amazing. It's got so much, this stuff got so much benefit,
*  even though if you take advantage of anything, too much anything, it's not good for you.
*  Right. But I mean, I don't think there's any way you can overdose on CBD, right? It's all just
*  healthy for you. It's just oils. Well, I know it's oils and different things. How much of it do you
*  take a day? For me? Yeah. I rub it on my legs and stuff like that. And I just now found that
*  they got some oral drops that are really good for you. Now, I didn't know that. Oh, the oral
*  drops? Yeah. Yeah. So that you put on your tongue. Yeah, I love those. Yeah. I didn't know that. Now,
*  now that I know that, it's taking me some drops. Yeah, I do both. I take the drops and I rub it on
*  my muscles as well. And I say it's good for your memory and all this stuff. Now, I didn't know that.
*  I'm gonna probably remember a lot of stuff for that. Well, you got through a crazy
*  boxing career remarkably well. I mean, your health is there. You look great. And do you have any
*  injuries or anything that still carries with you after all those years? See, that's the thing. I
*  juiced a lot. I juiced a lot. Me, man, the best juicer and all that I did. I ate very clean with
*  stuff like that. Did you have nutritionists that prepared your meals? Yeah. I had some people
*  talked about nutrition, but I kind of ate the way that I want because I knew, but I was very
*  disciplined in what food to eat and what not to eat. When you were eating, did you meal plan or
*  did you just eat whatever you wanted to? What was a typical meal for Evander Holyfield when
*  Evander Holyfield, when you were in your peak condition and you're training for a fight,
*  what would be a typical meal during camp? Well, I juiced. I ain't like nothing green.
*  So I had to juice that. Juice the greens. Spinach, kale, that kind of stuff. I do that. That's the
*  first thing I put in there. Then I get a chance to eat what I want to eat. So I like steaks.
*  I like chicken a lot, but the thing is that I like pan apples. I like apples. I like all this fruit
*  stuff that you cut up, the berries and all that. These are the things that actually kind of,
*  people saying, do you have any tingling in your hand, your feet or anything? I said,
*  well, I don't have anything. I said, do I suppose to? I said, well, other people do.
*  I swear, but what did they do? What did they eat? I really ate real clean, real good.
*  Well, tingling usually is associated with nerve damage. A lot of times people have back issues
*  and neck issues from years of fighting. I think even Mike had some neck surgery because of issues
*  that he was having with his neck. But Mike did a lot of bridges. Remember on his neck, he did a
*  lot of bridges, like wrestling-type bridges where he's bouncing on his neck and rolling around back
*  and forth. That's not necessarily supposed to be the best thing for your neck either.
*  No, I did that too. Did you do that?
*  I see somebody doing something and they're good. I'm going to try it out. I'm going to try it out.
*  So did you try it out after you saw him do it?
*  No, no, no. I started doing that as a kid in football practice. We rolled on the neck and
*  all this and stuff like that. You kind of felt that you were strong as you can hold your head up
*  and bridge like that. I did that a lot.
*  How many days did you work? Your typical boxing workout was sparring, hit in the mids,
*  and then road work. But you would also do strength and conditioning and some serious physical
*  exercise. How did you break up training camp? How many days a week did you spend doing weight
*  lifting-type stuff? How many days were you doing the other things?
*  With the boxing part, I do that five days a week. The weight lifting, three times a week.
*  I only have three workouts a day. Three?
*  Yeah, three workouts a day. You got to understand, my conditioning coach,
*  he was especially in conditioning. So we ain't going to do all...
*  All... Each and every training, he's going to do certain things. The most important thing was
*  the boxing. We get the boxing part out first. Then what type of run we're going to do. We ain't just
*  run five miles. We're going to sprint sometimes. He'd come up with these different methods that
*  that you have three workouts a day, but you're tired. You probably didn't work number
*  15 minutes, but you're tired. That's a tough 15 minutes. So he had these things that allow me
*  to understand that whenever I get tired, this is when you know how I'm going to shape you into
*  what you do when you're tired. It's a thinking program most of the time.
*  I tired myself out and your knees hurt and you can't do nothing the next day.
*  You get tired out. That 15 minutes went over you. You got all this energy.
*  Everything was about recovering.
*  Everything about recovery. Right. He was basically shocking your system with a bunch of different
*  kinds of workouts and then allowing you to recover. Do you think if CBD was around back
*  then, you would have probably used it a lot? I'm not for sure. I'm not for sure because
*  the whole thing with me is understanding what do it do for me. I wasn't the type of person that
*  concerned about you. Now I got to understand what's going to happen, what it's going to do for me.
*  If it makes you do this, is it going to make me do this? Just see if it's going to make me feel
*  good, it's going to make me be confident. I'm going to have to depend on this the rest of my life if I
*  start. I remember the Pan American game in 1983. They got the cow practice to pop everybody's neck
*  and put them in where they can fight good because they want to see everybody win.
*  I'm the only one who can do it. They said, why? I said, because I don't have any money.
*  They said, well, you don't have to pay any money. I said, yeah, but if this feels good,
*  I'm going to need it every day and I ain't got no money. So what am I going to do?
*  I said, my mama told me don't start nothing you can't pay for. I'm the only one that didn't
*  go to the cow practice to work or nothing because I didn't want nothing that I can't afford to do.
*  So of course, when I turned pro, coming from the pro, I was able to afford it. Now I go to
*  cow practice all the time now, but why get something new that you can't pay for? Then you're
*  going to make up an excuse to why you didn't do good today because I ain't had nobody crack
*  my neck. I ain't had nobody do this. Anything that is done, you got to be able to afford to do it.
*  05.30 Was it hard for you to retire?
*  05.30 No, I just wanted to know that I did the very best. What I didn't want to do, I didn't want
*  to retire and then come back. I have a time to do it right. My mama used to do it right
*  and when you stop, make sure it is over. After one of my last fights, I met the Clisco brothers
*  and I asked them why they didn't want to fight. They said, you know,
*  Emmanuel Stewart told us that you don't need to fight him. They chose not to fight because
*  Emmanuel Stewart told them. But I guess the most positive thing about the whole situation,
*  when I was coming back from Russia, I seen a table Ali and Ali, when he lost against Larry
*  Hall, he was trying to beat four times. He said, why just be happy for three? He said,
*  why did I have to go four? When I seen that, I said, why would I have to be five? I said,
*  I'm on the top. Why not? I'm the best that had ever been. I broke our league record. Why don't
*  just rest and be thankful? I chose to because the fact that the records are meant to be broken,
*  somebody is going to break it eventually. Long boxing continues to go because you're looking
*  for it to improve, the game to improve. 06.30 That's a great attitude that I wish
*  more boxers would have because it's for fighters, many times the highs of being a champion and
*  winning big championship fights on television under the bright lights. Those highs are so high
*  that after they get off and they retire, they just miss it. They miss it so bad. And we've seen
*  everybody, all the greats from Larry Holmes to Sugar Ray Leonard, all the greats come back,
*  except Hagler. Hagler never came back. And Andre Ward says he's not going to come back either. But
*  Hagler to me was one of the most impressive because he's just after that Sugar Ray Leonard
*  fight, he went, we're good. I'm done. That's it. 07.30
*  It was amazing because the fact is, you're accustomed to people. You don't have to talk
*  when you're a good fighter. Because everybody asked me, why you ain't never said that? I said,
*  I ain't have to say that. When people look at it, they start talking about how good are you.
*  So I don't have to say that. 08.30
*  Well, that was a big part of you was your humility, but confidence. You were always a humble man,
*  but always a very confident man. And as a fighter, that's a very admirable quality. Like you didn't
*  have a lot of haters or detractors. When you were the champ, people just appreciated who you were
*  as a man. 09.30
*  Yeah, I get it. But all that goes to credit, my mom used to tell me when she said,
*  zip the lip up and zip them up now. You're talking a little too much. Zip it up.
*  09.30 Yeah, you were never a guy that bragged.
*  When you see these guys like Floyd Mayweather, he gets so much attention. Obviously, he's an
*  incredible boxer, maybe one of the best boxers, if not the best of all time, but just always talks
*  crazy amounts of shit. But that has also got him a crazy amount of money and a crazy amount of
*  attention. But you never went that route. 09.30
*  Well, you know, because the fact is it wasn't about money. I'm telling you, the love that you have
*  and that you can account to say, anytime somebody asks me something, it's not just me.
*  Yeah, my mama, I can always account to these people that this boys club, like, you know,
*  I tell people, I said, now, I started going to the boys club at the age of six years old.
*  I said, now, I said, I didn't choose my neighborhood that I chose to live in. I said, but
*  I said, but everybody in that neighborhood told you ain't gonna be nothing. I'm from
*  I'm from an ass kid. You growing up and you were telling you ain't gonna be nothing.
*  You ain't gonna be nothing. And so going to that boy said the boy slept so I talked about goals.
*  What do you want to be? I'm something you know, I've that kid, I can't lie and say,
*  they always asked me, what do you want to be? So yeah, all I just know I want to be great.
*  They say, and what? So if you don't do nothing, you got to find out what you want to be great in.
*  So you let you play basketball, let you play baseball, all these different things every day.
*  You know, you an age group, six, seven, eight years old, we could do all these different things,
*  wood shop, you know, they wouldn't let you do what you want to do. You have to, you know,
*  you have to you have a group of people you have to different at different hours, different time,
*  you go to these different things, make sure that you learn to see all the different things that
*  you could be. But if you know, if you never was in, in class and have rules to tell you to do what
*  you want to do, you may not ever become nothing. I became who I am because I went through that
*  boys club and they, they wanted me to learn all these different things. You find that you're
*  gonna be great and everything. But at least you know when to be quiet, when to talk, when not to,
*  because you're not going to be the greatest one in all the things that you do.
*  Do you have any regrets when you look back on your championship career?
*  Not not at all. Nothing. Not at all. I'm about the whole thing is that, you know, I'm,
*  I'm a lot better than what I even dreamed of or whatever thought about and like this. But all
*  these things that I wanted to be, I, you know what the ultimate thing I wanted to do to make my mama
*  proud. I wanted my mama to be proud of me because my mama cried so much about what,
*  what you should have did with it all. And you know, and I just wanted to be one of the ones that
*  I did what my mama said and she was proud of me and all that. And, and, and eventually it became
*  that way. Well, how could she not be proud of you? Well, you know, four time heavyweight champion.
*  I mean, you're a Vanderholle field, but you, but you know, when I, now, when I came back from the
*  Olympics, now I kind of had that ego a little bit because I had done something that nobody else
*  done in my family. So I bought my mama a house, but she, what the house that I want to give her
*  that I want to put in a nice neighborhood. She wanted to be in a nice neighborhood.
*  She said, I want to be by the bus stop. She's cause I don't want to be dependent on when you
*  gonna come pick me up or not. I said, mama and good and good. They don't have bus stop cause people,
*  they don't want everybody seeing what they got called people steal. My mama said, but I don't
*  want to depend on you cause I don't know when you're going to come over here. Not. I need to be able
*  to bust out. So I was kind of upset because I want to buy my mama this nice house for me to talk
*  about. My mom want to get a house that ain't nobody want to talk about it as a big old, old house.
*  But my mama didn't care about that. My mama care about if everybody come home, everybody got a room.
*  Now I want to, I want to give her a three, three bedroom. She want to get an eight bedroom for
*  nothing. Now her house gonna call 250 on one. I want one and it's called 50,000. And so she
*  want to take the 50,000. I'm trying to figure out I want something I can brag about. I bought my mom.
*  But my mama said, you know, son, she's a son. I love more than you. I love them too. These my kids,
*  just like, I don't love you no more. I love them. And so when my mama told me that I came to
*  understand that she was thinking about if everybody came home, everybody have a room, but you come in
*  that three bedroom and it ain't gonna be enough room for everybody. What was the size of the house
*  that you built? You built some crazy gigantic. 54,000 square feet. What? Yeah. 54,000 square feet.
*  Yes. Why did you build a house that big? Well, the thing is I thought about all the things that,
*  all the things that I didn't have. And I thought about what I could afford. And, and I was thinking
*  about generation. You're not this, that I didn't build a house just for the family. Now for the
*  grandkids. And I figured, you know, you know, I love my kids and they're going to have some kids
*  and then they're going to have some kids. I'm so, you know, you will have a place still for everybody.
*  Oh, so it's practical. To me, to me, it was because you only do what you can afford to do.
*  Right. And you could afford to make a 54,000 square foot house. Jesus. How many acres was
*  that thing on? Well, we had 175 acres. When that was done, that must have been crazy.
*  Yeah. It cost a lot more than it probably would have if I would have thought about it. If I knew
*  what I know today. And then, you know, like what, what was different? Different is I've just,
*  I just got people to do it. And, and then didn't have no organization to get professional people
*  who know how to do it. It just caused the house cost me a lot more than, than it should have.
*  It was a famous house because it was so big and so expensive. Yeah. Well, yeah, yeah. But you know,
*  cause you did somebody then somebody get a little cheaper than you. You're kind of, kind of mad.
*  Oh, when you sold it, you mean? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How much did you wind up selling it for?
*  Five million. And how much did you build it for? 20.
*  Wow. That's a big hit. Well, yeah. Yeah. Somebody got a deal. Well, but you know, but
*  it's part of life. You learn from your mistakes. Who's living in it now?
*  A guy named Rick Ross. Rick Ross, the rapper? Yep. Really? Yep. That's crazy. Yep. Wow. Good for him.
*  Yeah. And they, they doing the movie, coming to America there. Are they really? Yep. Yeah. So I
*  will be a part of it too. You're in that, right? Coming to America too, right? Yep. When is that
*  starting to film? Coming up, coming up in about a week or two. Is that Eddie Murphy as well? Yes.
*  And Arsenio Hall? Yep. All right, man. That's beautiful. That's going to be crazy to be in
*  your old house. Yeah. Well, it ain't crazy, but you know, I get invited over there a lot and they
*  still call it my house. Well, you designed it, right? Oh yeah. Yeah, I did. Did you put a gym in
*  it? I, I, gym, I put, I put everything in it. Pretty much I, I copied it off Scarface. Move
*  a Scarface, you know? That's the only, that's the only movie that I've seen that, you know,
*  and you know, people come up in a tough situation and they become all that they are. Right. And so
*  I, I've thought that in one way or another, I'm not that, but I came up a tough way too. Right.
*  And so the thing is that you want your kids to have more than you have and something better.
*  Well, that's what, I mean, every great champion wants that. They want a house that shows like,
*  this is where the heavyweight champion of the world lives. And when you got 175 acres and 54,000
*  square feet and the way that house looked like, that looks like a world championship house.
*  Well, I had a ring look like a championship belt too. Really? Yeah. Like shaped like a
*  championship belt. Is there pictures of that online? I want, I want to see that.
*  How long did it take to build that? A year. Just a year? Yeah. Damn. That's fast. For a house
*  that's 54,000 square feet. Well, you know, but they did. Wow. Do you still live in Atlanta now?
*  No, I live in Fort Lauderdale. What are you doing down there? Well, you know,
*  uh, it's, it's good for tax and all that. Oh yeah. For sure. Florida's got great tax rules. Yeah.
*  There it is right now. You can see the house from the roof. That is a crazy spread. Look at the size
*  of your pool. Yep. You get lost in that pool. That's just like a championship belt. That's amazing.
*  Yeah. That is amazing. Now, do you, uh, do you still work in boxing? Like do you train fighters
*  or anything like that? Do you work with anybody? No, I'm, I'm part of the promotion. I'm part of
*  the promotion. I, you know, I don't think is that I, I don't exactly want to coach on one person
*  because I don't want to be that adversaries that if I'm in your calling, they go, they go, I'm just
*  going to give it to you. And people tend to think that. And, but, you know, cause I, I know,
*  I know how it was when, when I was getting ready to fight, I was getting ready to fight George
*  Foreman and Muhammad Ali came in the ring and, and he waved his hand. So he come and tell me,
*  he said, I'm for you. You know, tell me about you. Then he went and told George Foreman the same
*  thing. That's hilarious. Fighting George Foreman must've been a trip too, because you're fighting
*  someone from a different generation. You know, he was a legend from Ali's generation. Yeah, it was,
*  it was, it was like kind of different to me. And so I didn't really want to fight George. I just
*  wanted to fight Tyson. And so my, my business manager, Shelly Finkel told me, he said, you've
*  entered. It's my job as your business manager to tell you the thing about money. He said, you know,
*  I said, I want to get the 30. He said, no, I'm going to get you 50 million. I said, how? He said,
*  if you fight George first, they're going to get you 20. He said, but if you fight
*  Tyson first and get 30, they ain't going to get you 20 to fight him. He said, they don't think you
*  can beat George. I said, I said, man, I said, George, oh, I said, yeah, but they believe George
*  going to knock you out. That's the only reason why they're going to give you 20 million dollars.
*  They're not giving you 20 million dollars because they think it's an easy fight.
*  Well, George, even though he was old, could still knock people out when he knocked Michael Moore out.
*  I mean, that was crazy. Of course he knocked him, knocked him out after, after he lost against me.
*  He knocked Michael Moore out because I lost against Michael Moore. Yeah. So it's show you that
*  he didn't give up on, on his dream. Right. His dream was to be the champ again. Yeah. And he
*  eventually got it. The oldest ever oldest ever guy to regain the championship. Yeah. And I kind of
*  said, because I think I supposed to be the oldest because I, you know, that big old Russian that
*  was value well, I'll follow him. Yes. And, and ESPN, they scored it. They had me 11 to one
*  and they get a decision to value well. Yeah. No, I saw that fight. That was a bad decision.
*  Yeah. And I said, never to say it. So, um, you should have won. What, how old were you at that
*  time? I was four to six. So you were a year older. Yeah. And so I constant tell Tyson, I said, you
*  know, I can tell that we had the best era. I was because you're the youngest heavyweight champion
*  of the world. I supposed to be the oldest. So I said, what kind of era that is? You had both of
*  the people. Yeah. Yeah. Cause you know, cause at the time you're amazing. Tyson did this thing at
*  20 years old, 20 years old. Cause I had a lot of people they would talk about and say, Oh, you
*  know what? You know, you were this, you were just a great, I said, but I had, I said, Tyson was 20.
*  I said, I ain't going to tell them what I would have been if I would have been something at 20.
*  Right. I said, you know, I said, I said, you talking about a kid. I said, I said,
*  I'm the head of the world at 28 years old. And everybody said, well, you, you act so different.
*  28 in a 20 year old, you're, you're going to see some difference. A lot more maturity. Yeah.
*  It's a different person. Yeah. To be in 20 and winning the heavyweight championship of the world.
*  I don't know who could do that and not go crazy. Well, because the thing is he was the most
*  photographed person at that time. Yeah. Every time you look up, you see Mike on it. Yeah.
*  You see Mike on it. I'm something that just, and did a lot of incredible stuff too. He certainly did.
*  What do you think about today's era of boxing, particularly the heavyweight division? I mean,
*  it's, it's real exciting right now. I think it's coming back. Yes. I think coming back, you know,
*  Ruiz don't sneak through the picture and didn't, and, and I like that because here's a guy you
*  look at, you may think he can't fight, fight him. He can fight. Yeah. Ooh, that Andy Ruiz can throw
*  some combinations. Yeah, sure. I'm like, and I was, I was telling a friend of mine, I would tell a
*  friend of mine, I said, now I said, they picked the wrong guy. He said, what you talking about, man?
*  He don't look like he's, I said, he just looked like that he can fight. I said, I spar with him.
*  I said, he the first person I ever sparred that I say, I never want to fight. Really? Yeah. I said,
*  he was that, he was that good. I'm saying, you know, now at that time I was, I was, I was 46.
*  So he had to be probably 19. And I just said, and by then my first time ever seeing the guy,
*  I said, I don't want to fight him. I just, I was glad that I retired after 46. Oh, he has
*  beautiful combinations and you look at his body and you say, oh, that's a guy that's overweight,
*  but underneath all that fat, there's an incredible athlete. But that's what I'm saying.
*  You know, so you just can't, you just can't go by how I look these days. Because Anthony Joshua
*  looks like a Greek God. We sure did. I mean, he looks like he's carved out of stone. Oh yeah.
*  He knocked him down. That guy got up and knocked him down three times. Crazy. And then you got
*  Deontay Wilder, who's one of the craziest heavyweight knockout artists ever. I mean,
*  that guy has preposterous power. Well, you know, I'm something, you know, and because people ask me
*  about him. I said, well, you know what? I was the only thing I can say. He from Alabama too. I said,
*  I'm from Alabama. So I was in the water. I said, but it's his confidence. You know,
*  Deon, he go in, he go in and he fight his fight. And when he can see that shot, he throw it in.
*  And everybody said, but he get wild at the end. I said, at least he know the guy hurt though.
*  Right. Right. He don't get wild before the guy get hurt. But he know the guy hurt. I said, so he can,
*  he can take chances throwing looping shots like this because the guy hurt. I said, but
*  at least he's smart enough to know. But I remember the time when he got hurt,
*  he got knocked down and all that. And one thing that he show, he had confidence called
*  people who don't have confidence, they get hurt. They started trying to run. Right. When he got
*  hurt, he came forth. And that's the reason why he was able to survive that round. Then the next round,
*  he knocked the guy out. Well, Ortiz and him are going to have a rematch. Yeah. I'm talking about
*  that's the guy that he was. Ortiz is no joke. He's a dangerous fighter. That's the reason I
*  couldn't figure out why you would give another chance. Which shows his confidence. He's show
*  confidence because the fact that the man now ain't nobody even after that fight, want to fight Ortiz
*  still. And they said, nah, I'm a wishing me go away. Yeah. Because he's a good fighter and he,
*  he's one of the most, most clever fighters out there. Yes. And that's the reason I like,
*  okay, you did it one time. Okay. You know, why let him knock somebody else out and let him
*  upset somebody before he come back. And Ortiz is getting old. I mean, no one even knows how old he
*  really is because he's from Cuba. You know, this speculation that he's 50 years old. People don't
*  even know. Right. They don't. But he's an amazing fighter. So skilled out of that Cuban amateur
*  program. I mean, his boxing is just top notch and he had Deontay in all sorts of trouble.
*  But you're right. Wilder showed that he could overcome adversity and that his power, that's
*  one of the more impressive things about him. His power doesn't go away. He keeps that power like
*  deep in the 12th round when he knocked out Tyson Fury or knocked down Tyson Fury in the 12th round.
*  It looked like it was over. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. This is what you talk, what you
*  talk about confidence. And I told him, I said, look, man, I say, you're the only person I know
*  that tall and lighter than me. That's true, right? Yeah. He fought 213. He fought 213.
*  He was 209 when he fought Tyson Fury. 209, the day of the fight. Crazy. I said that's what you're
*  saying. I'm saying, I'm saying, I'm saying, I said, now, that's what you talk confidence in all this.
*  And I said, but he don't worry about it. Right. I'm like, you know, see, and that's why I like it,
*  certain people to me. But me, everybody said, man, you, they started talking about this stuff. I said,
*  look, I care about that. I can fight, man. Yeah. And you know what? When he started talking to
*  people and people get scared of him because he said, look, man, I can fight. I know what I could do.
*  Yeah. He know he, all he got to do is hit you with that big right hand. Or the left hand.
*  I just don't understand because he, cause I seen him when he hit this boy, now I'm doing left hook.
*  He got a hook now. Well, that 12th round, it was a right hand and a left hook behind it and snapped
*  Tyson's head back. But I mean, Tyson Fury is incredible too, man. That guy got up after that.
*  99% of the people on planet earth would still be out cold after those two punches.
*  What I'm, what I try to get people to see, I see now the referee then supposed to let him get up.
*  Most people, most fighter would get up, but the referee, dive on your jump on you, won't let you
*  and say it because for you to lay flat like that for four or five seconds, they supposed to do that.
*  Right. Most referees would have called it off right there. Yeah. Well, thank God he didn't.
*  Well, you know, I'm not for sure. It messed up the whole thing. He would have been the champ.
*  And so now, yeah, but aren't you excited that he got up and then Tyson Fury went up winning the
*  rest of the round? Well, wait, yeah, he did. He did. But still when you do the thing right,
*  your job for be saving the fighter. Right. I see what you're saying. So you think the referee
*  should have probably saved. Yeah. I'm supposed to do with it. I'm the mouth thing because I'm
*  saying if it was anybody else, they would have did it. You know what bothers me? What bothers me is
*  the count was more than 10 seconds. Well, that's what I'm saying. That's what bothers me. What
*  bothers me is I think it shouldn't be the referee going one, two, it should be a number. Like there
*  should be like a timer. They do have a timer. They had a timer. This is how you know they get,
*  they have a guy when a referee thinking he count to. Right. But he's counting. I want a number,
*  like a digital clock that shows you 10 actual seconds. I think they should have something
*  like that to leave it up to the referee. Some referees like one, two, three other referees,
*  like one, two, and that's not seconds. That's not seconds. You're right. Because you know what,
*  even after that, the referee to brush a glove, don't look at it. Look at seconds.
*  When you look at it, he had about 30 seconds. He had 30 seconds. And then they said,
*  oh, he would come back. I said, but you know, they wouldn't did that to anybody else.
*  I said, but how, but now, now what bothered me was what bothered me? I said, how do you,
*  I said, if he go in the other country and fight and they other, and the guy doing him like this,
*  they stop in the fight. Right. A lot of referees would have stopped that fight. I said, they,
*  I said, stop the fight. I said, now, I said, how is it when somebody can come in your country
*  and, and, and they, and you give them the ups. Right. Right. Right. I said, I said, I said,
*  something is wrong with that. I said, I just think it was because it was such a big fight.
*  Like everybody wanted to see that fight. It was such a huge fight. Well, you know, I'm saying,
*  even though I'm saying you go in another country, you know, is that fight close anywhere? You're not
*  getting it. Right. Right. You're not getting it. Right. And you can like, just like, like I, I,
*  I, I'll hit that guy. The guy, the guy even throw no punches, some of the rounds. But they said,
*  I remember they asked the guy, I said, how could you win a round when you didn't throw a punch in
*  that round? The only person who's ever done that is Willie Pep. Right. Willie Pep won rounds just
*  by being a slick defensive fighter, but he was so impressive that people gave him the round anyway.
*  You know, that's a, that fight was, that was a fight that begged for a rematch, just begged
*  for a rematch. And it bothers me. That's one of the things that bothers me about boxing sometimes
*  is that these fights, they don't, they don't come to fruition. And then if, I mean, he almost lost
*  in his Tyson with that, that cut in his last fight. I mean, that was a bad cut. Yeah. They
*  could have stopped that fight. You know? Yeah. Because, but you know, they, they stop it. They
*  stop it when they want to stop it. So you got to understand who, who, who lead this thing off
*  to a point where that you got to get some, in the game with me and the boxing, I just wanted
*  it to be right. Cause I know how, how important it is for anybody who put their life online
*  to be a fighter and want to say I, I, it was fair. I did, I did my all. At least I got my
*  opportunity. Yeah. Well, listen, Evander, I really appreciate your time. I really appreciate you
*  coming in here. And like I said, I've been a giant fan your entire career. So it was an honor to meet
*  you and an honor to have you on here, brother. Thank you very much. Thank you. Evander Holyfield,
*  ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, sir. Bye everybody.
