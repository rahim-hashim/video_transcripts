# Joe Rogan Experience #1494 - Bret Weinstein
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 18, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRCzZp1J0v0)
*  If anybody sounded the alarm that all this madness was gonna
*  Come to fruition in the real world. It's you sir. You were you were the guy like you were the one who was saying
*  This is what's happening at evergreen and if you don't know go Google it
*  Brett Weinstein evergreen and
*  Now it spills out into the real world. Just like I said it was gonna you did I did I said it
*  I said it in several different places and
*  Pretty clearly, you know, it could have been a tiny bit more precision, but it was highly accurate
*  You were highly accurate and often maligned and mocked
*  Yeah, people didn't think it was a big deal. They think you're much ado about nothing
*  You're making a big deal about some kids that are voicing their opinions on things
*  But what you recognized early on was that there was an authoritarian aspect of it a force compliance
*  Aspect of it. That's very dangerous
*  Yeah, it's all about force and
*  You know, I've started to get calls in the last week or two the people who
*  Who mocked me and others including you for making too much of what appeared to be college kids going wild on college campuses?
*  Some of them have started to call and say I got it wrong
*  What do we do now and actually I I appreciate those those calls and those contacts because really that is the question
*  What do we do now to pull it back
*  Yeah, the genie back in the bottle or as Douglas Murray says, how do you put the brakes on this thing?
*  How do you put the brakes on this thing? Indeed? Well, I have to tell you I'm not optimistic
*  I think that this is actually the people who are catching up to the fact that evergreen has now spilled over into the world
*  I have not caught up to the fact that this is
*  Unstoppable at this point with the current configuration
*  The absence of leadership is going to prevent us from doing what we should do and
*  That means that the next set of predictions are far more dire. What is your next set of predictions?
*  Well, I would say we are headed for a collision course with
*  With history, I mean we're really staring at many scenarios that end in some kind of civil war and
*  While I do think it is still possible to avert that outcome
*  I don't know the name of the force that gets in its way
*  That's it's really troubling. What do you think these kids want? Not just kids. What do you what do you think the people that are?
*  Facilitating chaos. What do you think they want? Well, I think there's some danger in
*  casting them as one thing because I think we have several things fused together and
*  That until you understand what has joined forces with what you're not gonna there's no way to answer the question
*  All right, let's break it down. Okay
*  So one thing that we're seeing is and we really have to take this back a number of years to understand why it happened
*  But we are seeing
*  Occupy 2.0. Hmm. Now I
*  Participated in occupy
*  Originally occupy made a lot of sense
*  It was a complaint about the tarp program and too big to fail and the fact that the American public was
*  Not protected when those who had created the financial collapse were and that was a legitimate
*  Gripe and it was also a legitimate gripe at the beginning of the Tea Party movement
*  Occupy then morphed into a an
*  Anarchist movement that was just simply hostile to civilization and it became absurd
*  And so when I say this is occupy 2.0
*  This is the anarchist version of occupy that has now reemerged and it has fused with Black Lives Matter, which
*  As I've said lots of different places if Black Lives Matter just simply meant what those words imply. I'd be on board with it
*  It doesn't it means a great deal more than that and we're beginning to see that in the last couple of weeks
*  What else you think it means? Well, let's put it this way for some reason it means
*  Abolish the police which is
*  Possibly the stupidest proposal I have ever heard and it's not like we haven't seen what happens when you do that
*  I don't think that that's a just a fearful response to the obvious police brutality that we saw in Minneapolis
*  What's the best response? We have to do something
*  We need to defund the police and then everyone's like good job great great first step at least well
*  No, it's a dishonest presentation and I'm concerned that there as I've also said in many places
*  the proposals that are coming out of this movement are
*  quite foolish the strategy is incredibly smart and so that is confusing to people because when you hear
*  Folks in the street demanding that we abolish the police you think well, okay, that's never going to happen
*  If it even started to happen, it would be so complex to make it happen that it can't possibly be
*  They just need to blow off some steam
*  Nope, that's not right
*  The fact is the police in some places can effectively be halted in their tracks and really if there's one
*  Most important lesson out of the whole evergreen fiasco
*  It's that the police can be withdrawn from a situation and chaos takes a matter of hours to emerge which we're also seeing in Seattle
*  Yeah
*  The defunding of the police which is happening in Minneapolis. What are they doing in replacement of the police?
*  well, I don't know and I will say that the thing that is trotted out as the example that tells us that
*  Defund the police which doesn't really mean defund the police. It means abolish the police
*  We are told that that's safe on the basis of something like the Camden example with Camden just they
*  They sort of broke the police down but then built up a new version of the police
*  Yeah, they shifted it to a different jurisdiction and look
*  I'm not arguing that we don't need massive police reform and frankly
*  I'd be up for a discussion of a total rethink of the way we do policing but the idea that you could withdraw the police
*  first is
*  Absolutely insane Mark Lamont Hill had a
*  Very good point about the guy who was killed. What is the gentleman's name that was killed in the drive-in drive-through?
*  fast food place
*  Richard said I say his name
*  Who was just drunk and compliant and peaceful until they were telling him they were gonna arrest him
*  Even said get me an uber and what his point was is a very good point
*  Why were the police even called for that?
*  This is a nonviolent person who just happened to be drunk. Was he doing something he shouldn't have been doing? Yes, but obviously
*  compliant polite
*  Speaking just like very reasonably until it escalated into this tussle and then he lost his life
*  If they had just had some sort of a program where they could we're gonna park your car, sir
*  Or we'll have someone drive your car to your house
*  we're gonna call you an uber or we're gonna take you home and
*  We're gonna just write you a ticket and work this out in court. You're not gonna go to jail
*  You don't have to be arrested. You don't have to be handcuffed. You're gonna be treated like a monster
*  You fucked up you made a mistake, but you're not a bad person
*  You're not a person who's trying to hurt people the police should be there for
*  robbers murderers
*  Rapists, that's that's what we need the police for and this is another none of those things
*  This is just a guy who fucked up and he got drunk and he and then as they were speaking to him
*  clear real clear
*  Not a bad guy like the way he's talking to the cops just talking to him very reasonably even asked for an uber
*  Well, look I am no fan of this aggressive style of policing
*  I'm not a fan of the militarization of the police. I've actually I mean I've had run-ins with the police
*  I've been hit twice by cops. So it's not that I happen
*  well, one of these is a long story that goes back to my first research gig in Jamaica and
*  The other one was I was participating in a protest. I mean, I was very young I was probably 20
*  And there was a protest about homelessness in Berkeley and frankly it happened without my awareness that there was gonna be a protest
*  But I happen to be nearby and I was sympathetic and so I joined it and I was coming down the street with the protest and the
*  Cop hit me with the with a baton
*  Knocked me down. So anyway, I'm no fan of this stuff. I'm not defending it, but
*  That's not what this movement is really about and even if it is to the extent that it is what this movement is really about
*  It doesn't deal with the root cause we're dealing with a symptom and it's not a symptom that you can treat in isolation
*  Well, I had Jaco Willink on the podcast on Monday and he had a great point
*  obviously Jaco was a Navy SEAL commander and worked with the Navy SEALs to create programs for training and
*  What he said is that these cops have the minimal amount of training?
*  It's the tiniest amount of training and then they send them on the street
*  He goes
*  20% of their time should be spent training 20% it should be de-escalation drills
*  simulation drills
*  Educating them on how to communicate with people in various situations
*  Educating them as if one cop is in a confrontation with someone the next cop should step in and say let's let's just calm down
*  Mike, let's go go deal with this over there and I'm gonna handle this and sir
*  Let's let's let's take this from scratch. Like let's work. Let's work this out
*  And that having higher qualified police officers better trained police officers more
*  better compensated police forces, so they're not taxed out is really the answer to all this and these people are
*  They're you know, nobody wants to be a cop right now. So who's doing this, right?
*  Who's the new generation from now out when when people sign up to be a police officer?
*  Who's gonna do this?
*  This is you have a few that are gonna answer that call because they feel like it's a they have a duty
*  But you're gonna have a lot of people that just
*  they can't get other jobs and so they choose that and maybe they're not the cream of the crop and
*  That's very bad for people with guns and tell other people what to do
*  I hear two things in what you're saying and one of them
*  I fully agree with the implication of what you just said is that less funding isn't the solution if anything more funding is so
*  That we get better qualified people better training train them, right?
*  we get people who are better suited to the job in the first place and then we train them better so they know what to do and
*  I agree with that
*  The part that I'm worried about is that I also I think I hear you grasping at straws and frankly, they're familiar
*  I hear everybody grasping at straws here
*  And what I think is not getting said is that brutal policing is a feature not a bug, right?
*  This is part of a system that is about something else and to the extent
*  that I think we can all recognize that there is something absolutely organic about the
*  Anger that has caused people to spill into the streets in large numbers
*  That anger is the result of a process that does not begin with policing. It begins with
*  economic phenomena and political phenomena and
*  one of the things that spooks me is
*  This movement in part because it is leaderless and I would argue rudderless
*  It is not correctly addressing the actual problem. It is lashing out at things that it can see it's lashing out
*  Anecdotes but the only solution here the only proper solution that actually saves the Republic is a solution that addresses the core problem
*  economic despair
*  communities that are filled with crime and violence and gangs and the people that come out of these communities with very little hope and
*  All the models that they operate under the what what they model themselves on is what they see around them
*  Which is all this crime and they they don't have this sense that there's a very clear path out of this
*  Well, let's I want to step back to something that will sound too remote to be useful, but I'm sure it isn't
*  I would claim that this actually goes back to a
*  Shift in the Democratic Party during the Clinton administration
*  during the Clinton administration the Democratic Party effectively
*  Switched it took up the Republican Party's business model moving away from
*  defending the interests of common people as its
*  Reason for gaining power and that created a problem. So during the Clinton administration we saw
*  The end to aid with family to families with dependent children. We saw NAFTA. We saw basically an abandonment of the core
*  Reson DeTra for the Democratic Party now the Republican Party at that point
*  Was the party of business, but that doesn't really mean the party of business
*  What the Republican Party was was the party of well-established large businesses
*  Which frequently meant as it was catering to their interest that it was?
*  Preventing small businesses from rising up that would threaten its constituents now the Democrats took up this model
*  They went into influence peddling as well during the Clinton administration and they became the party of other businesses
*  So now you have two parties that are basically dealing with competing business interests vying for power
*  But what that does is it excludes the interests of regular folks?
*  And so regular folks have been getting a shaft ever since nobody is representing their interests
*  They're getting wise to it and they're feeling the effects on the street. They are feeling the system is rigged. It's rigged against them
*  It's not even evenly rigged against them. So, you know in black communities, there's a perception
*  It's specifically rigged against us and you know what it is, but the way it is is very subtle, right?
*  It's not a matter of racism being ubiquitous, you know inside every white head
*  It's not like that. This has very little to do with modern racism, but what it has to do with is a
*  Property of our system. So, you know, there's a cybernetic principle the purpose of a system is what it does
*  It means that don't listen to what somebody says that the system is for look at what it accomplishes
*  That's what it's for and our system basically has two things that it accomplishes
*  it
*  basically keeps real change from happening and the reason it keeps real change from happening is because people who are winning in the present system
*  Will continue to win if the system continues to do what it does and they may lose if the system changes and starts doing something
*  else so it creates what I would argue is a kind of
*  Organic conservatism those with power don't want change because it threatens them and the other thing that our system does
*  Is it reproduces?
*  present
*  Patterns of distribution into the future and what that means is racism that has almost died out
*  Is still alive and well in a sense because all you have to do is take people who are born into a neighborhood that is
*  Devoid of opportunity and continue that pattern if no opportunity shows up
*  Then people who were oppressed are now going to continue to be oppressed and so it feels personal but it isn't it's just reproducing an existing
*  pattern and
*  A lot of that emanates from these communities that have been disenfranchised and economically distraught
*  from slavery like literally
*  From then where we're dealing with the echoes of slavery and it doesn't get addressed and when people do bring it up and they start
*  Talking about reparations people roll their eyes and people go
*  So long ago, but the results of that are still alive today in the south
*  There's still alive today in many communities that were redlined as recently as the 1960s, right? That's exactly right. And so
*  We basically have set ourselves up for a confused response because there is a subtlety
*  The fact that ancient racism people who are dead their racism still haunts us today
*  Through mechanisms of the reproduction of patterns of distribution and mind you when people hear distribution
*  They freak out because they think you're talking about wealth
*  I'm not talking about wealth and we can talk about why I wouldn't bother but what we're talking about is opportunity
*  Opportunity has been hoarded. It has been concentrated in some zip codes and almost totally excluded from other zip codes. And so
*  you're right the patterns of slavery moved into Jim Crow and now they've moved into a phase where
*  They are very subtly infused in into our system
*  And so it is causing people to have the sense that
*  There is an enemy and it is out to get me when it's not exactly an enemy that's out to get you
*  It's a pattern right? It's a pattern that definitely needs to be addressed. And so
*  The natural place would have been the Democratic Party
*  But the Democratic Party because it has taken up with big business is not going to do it even though it would be a winning
*  political strategy the Democratic Party is more interested in serving the political the
*  Economic interests of its actual constituents than it is serving the interests of its nominal constituents. And so
*  Why are you seeing something that looks
*  Like a communist revolution beginning in the streets for the natural reason which is that people are feeling excluded from
*  From their share and they are being excluded but this
*  Revolution that is beginning in our streets is no more
*  coherent or desirable than you know, then Maoism and it's going to be
*  Brutal in in the Maoist way or possibly the way that it unfolded in the French Revolution or it maybe it'll be some
*  You know unique version and it'll get its own name
*  but if we want the Republic to survive we're gonna have to prevent this from happening and
*  Because it's a leaderless movement. Who do you even talk to who do you reason with? Yeah, that's what's fascinating about it, right?
*  Because it's emerging not just in America, but it's also in England
*  it's and it's in all parts of the world people are protesting and
*  In many ways, I think that's it's probably because
*  Love it or hate it America sort of takes the cultural lead for the world in a lot of ways when it comes to
*  movements and particularly art and and and you know
*  expression and I
*  See this leaderless movement and it seems so attractive to young people that do feel disenfranchised by the system
*  So I watched them
*  I mean I've seen so many videos of these people out there screaming and cheering and chanting and they feel like they're a part of
*  Something right and they are right, but what is that thing that they're a part of like?
*  What's the end goal that doesn't seem to have been?
*  Really clear still like there's kids out in they were out in
*  Woodland Hills out there
*  chanting no justice no peace and
*  I'm like, okay
*  What justice you talking about are you talking about George Floyd?
*  well that in that case it seems like that guy's gonna go to jail for the rest of his life and
*  I don't know if that's justice or not that police department has been disbanded
*  I don't know if that's justice or not. But what is justice and what is peace? It's just a slogan, but they feel good saying it
*  No justice no peace
*  But what I don't know what you're saying
*  but you feel very passionate about what you're saying and I think if you pulled one of those kids aside and
*  Said what's your message? And what are you trying to do?
*  I think a lot of them would have nothing to say and that's what that's very concerning to me
*  I'm very concerned about that because it seems like they're very
*  enthusiastic and passionate about an invisible enemy and an enemy that they can't they can't put on a scale they can't
*  Tangibly describe it in a way that I understand it completely. It just seems like
*  the structure of things
*  They feel like is is unjust
*  it is unfortunately a
*  zombified collective
*  Fighting a boogeyman that they have invented
*  Which again doesn't mean that their frustration is not about something very real that does require a solution
*  but to the extent that these people have
*  De-individuated and they've become a true mob and they are pushing policies that make no sense and endanger us all I mean
*  There is no
*  neighborhood in the US
*  That is going to be safer for the absence of the police and it really doesn't even matter how corrupt the police are
*  The absence of the police is going to create a power vacuum and we're going to get warlords as we're already seeing in miniature in
*  Seattle as we already saw at evergreen. Yeah, so it's not a coherent proposal, but I
*  have a concern that the reason that this is leaderless is
*  Is
*  That something that I think is unrelated. I really think it's unintentional
*  but there is something about the way that influence happens in
*  This era that has taken all of the would-be leaders and it has trapped them in the gig economy
*  And so we have a lot of people who would be in an excellent position to steer this
*  Justifiable anger at an enemy that is actually worth attacking to curb the violence and to make this a
*  moment of useful and necessary change I would argue overdue change, but those people are
*  Instead of being leaders, but they are as influencers and influencers don't have the kind of power
*  Necessary to shape a movement and they don't have the position to negotiate on its behalf and this is very dangerous
*  Where do you think this escalates to do you have a map in your mind of where the territory is
*  Yeah, I mean I would say there are several ways it could go but unfortunately
*  the dynamics
*  Look almost unresolvable if somebody does not speak for the movement and with it being unresolvable
*  You've got a conflict between
*  You've got a conflict between rural people and urban people you have a conflict between
*  Blacks and those who are self-declared allies and ally doesn't really mean ally but
*  foot soldiers on behalf of this movement and people who won't go along with it and
*  What I'm trying to raise people's awareness of right now
*  is that
*  There's something in us being raised in the US. There's something in us that thinks that
*  The great leap forward in China cannot happen here that what happened in Cambodia cannot happen here
*  That Nazi Germany cannot happen, right?
*  And you know the Soviet Union couldn't happen here. I don't know what characteristic it is that people think makes it impossible
*  I don't think it's impossible. I think if there is a characteristic that makes it unlikely
*  It is the structure it is the Constitution which I would argue is showing its age
*  But nonetheless the values that America aspires to the reason that the world does pay attention to us and
*  Still even with all of our brokenness allows us to lead it
*  That reason is that the values that were described were honorable even if they even if we didn't meet them
*  but what we aspired to be was great and
*  I
*  You know, I resent Trump's make America great again because there are populations for whom it has simply never been great
*  right
*  so I think that last a in MAGA is just a finger in the eye for people and it was designed to be but
*  The structure what it aspires to be is great and heading in the direction in which it could be great for everybody is
*  Obviously the right thing to do
*  But what we are now doing and the thing that troubles me most about this movement is that if you listen to it closely
*  And I have listened to it very closely it is explicitly about
*  Disassembling the very things that make the West marvelous, right? It is anti science, right?
*  It does not want policy based on science. In fact, you also well, I mean you saw last week presumably that it got
*  nature the journal nature science magazine
*  Caltech it got all of these
*  just absolutely
*  Top level scientific institutions to broadcast the hashtag shut down stem
*  What oh, yeah. No, I'm not aware of this at all. Oh, well, and this is another thing
*  We're losing our minds because to me the idea that you would be unaware of this is hard to imagine because it was so much
*  Going on it was so thoroughly all over my feed though
*  But I'm discovering this there's stuff absent from my feed too that I should know about and I'm finding the same thing
*  Well, here's the thing. Yeah, I don't read my feed. Well, you don't read your Twitter feed, but you're plugged into enough people
*  You have conversations in this room things have to be like almost nuclear before I'm paying attention to them these days just for my own
*  Personal sanity. Yeah, I I've stepped away from almost all social media other than posting. Yeah, it's actually
*  I can say something perfectly weird. I don't really aspire to great wealth
*  But there is part of me that wants to be wealthy enough that I can afford to ignore my feeds, right?
*  Yeah, can't now I have to be plugged in but
*  but anyway, the
*  The thing that that's really concerning here and I you know, I I don't want this podcast to be all about concern
*  There's it is thousands of scientists go on strike to protest systemic racism and stem
*  More than five thousand scientists and two prominent scientific journals shut down operations and pledged to use the day to address racial
*  Inequalities in science the strike follows two weeks of demonstration spurred by the police killing of George Floyd a black man who died after
*  a white police officer
*  People on social media are spreading word about the strike with the hashtag shut down academia. Mm-hmm shut down stem and
*  strike for black lives
*  Shutdown academia is terrifying
*  Shutdown stem is equally terrifying but I mean like what takes its place. What do you expect?
*  Well, if you shut down academia, like what are they what are they saying when they say systemic racism and stem?
*  What does it mean? It's representation in terms of like the
*  What are they saying?
*  so
*  this is so sad because
*  truly if you if you really wanted to
*  To raise black people out of the quagmire the economic quagmire
*  They find themselves in if you wanted to do it en masse you would arm them with the most powerful tools
*  Right the most powerful tool and the tool that is best positioned to address biases
*  Especially subtle biases is science. That's that's what the scientific method does
*  That's it's one reason for existing is that it takes that which you think and allows you to see why it is wrong
*  Right. It takes your biases and forces you to see what's wrong with them
*  That's what science is for now the reason that this movement is attacking stem has to do with the connection of this movement
*  to critical theory and
*  Critical theory didn't come from the sciences. The word theory is basically
*  Pilfered right it's being used in a most ironic fashion critical theory is a narrative
*  That's now becoming a religious movement and it is anti stem on the basis that it claims that stem itself science itself
*  Is racist inherently what do they mean when they say when they're saying critical theory? Yeah, what does that encompass?
*  Well, my understanding is that critical theory was born as an honorable investigation of biases that exist inside of our court system
*  racial biases and
*  That it has now morphed into something that its originators don't recognize and don't respect that it has become
*  Basically, I mean, you know, you've you've had Jordan Peterson on your podcast many times once with me and
*  You know he what he talks about with respect to these these are cultural Marxists and they are wielding this postmodern
*  Doctrine what he's talking about is critical theory. All right, critical theory is basically a
*  Trojan horse that exists in academic departments that are dedicated to its study and what it does is it?
*  Uninvents progress in other fields and that's a very
*  Uninteresting process when it's hiding away in some corner of your university where you don't have to listen to it
*  But what has happened is it is now reached enough people that it has spilled out into public and the nonsense that you hear about
*  Shutting down academia shutting down stem
*  Abolishing the police all of this is standard fare in those phony departments when you say uninvents progress
*  Now what do you mean by that? Well, I mean that we have a system and you know
*  I'm as upset about what doesn't work about it as anybody but we have a system that accomplishes a great deal and
*  this
*  style of thought
*  That all of these departments that end in theory
*  That don't actually function by normal rules of logic or the scientific process
*  these things are an
*  Attack they're like an autoimmune disease of the academic culture and by and large the scientific part of the academy
*  Keeps its head down and it stays away from people who believe in this stuff and it tries to do its work
*  But what has happened is that the dynamics the demographics have changed?
*  Such that these departments which weren't taken seriously by the sciences are now dictating terms to the sciences
*  Which couldn't possibly be more dangerous because to the extent that
*  The the argument more or less is that the sciences are unfairly biased in favor of those who are
*  Currently successful and that that bias is actually preventing people who are not succeeding under current conditions
*  from getting there and therefore
*  We need to hobble these disciplines to level the playing field. Well, imagine that
*  That America surrendered its advantage in the sciences in order to
*  Even if you could level the playing field inside of the US by doing that which you can't but even if you could
*  This would so hobble us in the world that it would be an insane
*  Policy to pursue is there any debate going on about this?
*  Clearly what they're saying is if you're looking at the vast majority of the scientists they represent
*  What what is it the European Jews are a lot of them? There's a lot of various people of European ancestry
*  Asian folks
*  less
*  African Americans less Africans, so they're saying that because of this this is clear
*  This is clear evidence of racism. Yeah, which is total nonsense
*  What is it evidence of it is well, it's evidence of a number of things and you know, I find myself
*  In two places on a lot of these arguments on the one hand somehow
*  I'm sitting here on your podcast defending academia when on any normal day
*  I would be telling you academia was so incredibly broken and science has been so incredibly
*  Incredibly corrupted by its contact with the market that we have to fix these things because that is in and of itself a threat
*  You know to the West here. I find myself saying wait a second
*  These people are actually telling you what they think they think science is the enemy and instead of democratizing
*  The tools of science and giving them to the people who need the most they want to end science. So
*  The problems are several unfortunately, they're not
*  Tremendously interesting. They're sort of dry inside baseball stuff
*  But we I think we have to cover them though
*  Just to sort of take the legs out from under this racism argument when it comes to representation
*  Sure. So first of all, let me just say academia is
*  tremendously liberal and that I
*  I
*  Mean that in both senses. Let's take the honorable part of it, right?
*  Inside of a university there is every desire to bring people who do not look like
*  The old white guys that have done so much of the past work in science. There is a desire to
*  To broaden, you know
*  So it is not true that privately scientists are harboring racist views and talking about them and then you know behaving themselves
*  When they're around people who are of a different color, it's not like that. Okay
*  There is a desire to have those people show up and get the job
*  Because for one thing it takes the pressure off to the extent that departments don't look like the demographics of the country in which these
*  Departments are housed, you know that raises questions. And so there's a desire to bring in anybody who
*  Makes it clear that that's not going on. However
*  let's say that you were
*  You were black and you grew up in a neighborhood where the odds were stacked against you and
*  You made it. Let's say that
*  you know, you had people who
*  Said wise things to you and they got you to focus on the right stuff and you managed to dodge the stuff that
*  Captures so many and you made it right? Let's say you got into Harvard
*  You got a really good quality degree in a in a in a proper science
*  Well, what are you gonna do with it? You're gonna go into academia
*  That would be insane because I don't know what the numbers are
*  I don't know what fraction of people who get PhDs actually get the job that they've trained for but it's tiny
*  It was a really I'll be like one in 20 really? Yeah
*  Because there's only so many positions and every year you're graduating
*  Hundreds and hundreds of people with those degrees. Well, but there's also a very good reason for this
*  I mean, it's a terrible reason, but there's a very easily comprehended reason
*  So universities are fueled in large measure by what's called overhead of the grants
*  So if you get a million dollar grant half or more will go to your university, right?
*  So that's what builds the buildings and fuels the place
*  So the university has an incentive to get as many people
*  File grant applications as they can and they have an incentive to hire people whose grant applications will be large rather than small
*  So this for example is one of the reasons that science has taken up arms against theory
*  That is to say proper scientific
*  Theoreticians like me and it is instead hired people who run big expensive
*  experiments because big expensive experiments have big grants and those big grants bring in money, but if you were a university and what you wanted
*  Was to have people writing big expensive grants who were capable of getting them
*  then what you would want to do is you would want to free those people from teaching and
*  You would want to get people who weren't so
*  Expensive to do the work of the university and the way you do that is you bring them on as graduate students and you pay them
*  An appalling wage you claim you claim that they are not actually workers that they are students and
*  They they do most of the teaching and they do a lot of the work of the university for incredibly
*  Low amounts of money. They live under poor conditions and increasingly
*  They have to come from abroad where they are in some sense getting a deal that still makes sense
*  But this means that we overproduce PhDs
*  We give people degrees instead of money to do the work of the university
*  In order that the people who are capable of getting the grant spend almost full-time doing that job and it's a racket
*  Mmm, so in that I wasn't aware of that at all. I didn't know how it works
*  Yeah, it's a racket and and the person you should talk to the person who knows the most about this is actually Eric my brother
*  So what he unearthed was actually that there was an explicit
*  Conspiracy to game the visa system in order to keep this system running then in fact effectively a
*  fake shortage of
*  Science students was created to allow the universities to basically flood the market to drive the wages down
*  but all of these things mean that if you are coming from
*  circumstances that have
*  Been challenging and you make it you don't want to go to graduate school in the sciences because it's a dumb move
*  You're gonna take having gotten your head above water and then you're gonna voluntarily drown
*  And it doesn't make any sense. You're much better off even as bad as you know being a doctor has become it used to be a great
*  Job now, it's kind of a sucky job, but you're better off doing that because at least it's a job
*  You'll pay off your loans, you know, you'll make it and so basically what we see is that there are lots of reasons that a rational person
*  From certain demographics is less likely to go into the sciences that's not racism in the sciences
*  It's again one of these echoes of a past
*  Racism or a past indifference that is having huge impacts on the present. Hmm
*  Okay, um, so these people that want to
*  That think that stem is racist and they want to dismantle it
*  What do they propose like what what do they propose and replacement of stem and academia? So I
*  What they want is so strange and preposterous that it damages my credibility to even say it
*  I will I will answer your question. Okay, but I know that what I'm saying sounds preposterous
*  I'm saying sounds preposterous
*  Okay, the only reason that I'm so certain of it is that I've talked to them directly and I watched this happen at ever
*  You've talked to them Greg directly. So, you know, this is actually what they want
*  Well, I can't say they because undoubtedly there's variations
*  But I can say that to the extent that I've actually had these conversations with people I was left
*  Completely shocked by you know, there was an there was an example at evergreen
*  where
*  we were in a faculty meeting and I
*  Said that the proposals that were moving through were a threat to the
*  Enlightenment values that were the basis of the institution and what I got back was something I had never heard before
*  Which was an attack not only on the enlightenment but on the idea of enlightenment. I
*  Was just so stunned. I was a college professor amongst faculty and somebody was actually saying out loud
*  That enlightenment was a problem and nobody in the room said anything
*  What did they mean by enlightenment is a problem? Well, so here's here's what I say to to people who asked me about this
*  students in particular
*  The enlightenment was a
*  European project
*  Right. It definitely had a light skin tone
*  Right. It was it was European men
*  It was not a Jewish project
*  But I am not embarrassed about taking the tools of the enlightenment and wielding they don't belong to Europe
*  Right. They're human. They're human tools
*  They were a discovery in Europe and arguably the discovery in Europe happened because of unfair exclusion of other people
*  but at some level who the fuck cares these are the most powerful tools ever and
*  You can't
*  Uninvent them the thing to do is distribute them as broadly as possible
*  But if you're in critical theory, first of all if you end up in critical theory any one of these fields women's studies
*  Queer studies, whatever it is
*  You have already
*  Forgone this option. You don't end up in
*  Critical theory if you have the chops to do science
*  So in effect you have people who don't stand to personally benefit from opening those doors
*  Because they wouldn't go through them arguing that nobody should go through those doors. So
*  Let's take a side step here
*  Critical theory when you're talking about gender studies or queer studies, or why do you think those are not valid?
*  avenues for people to pursue well because the
*  Method is non-existent if you were to do these things properly you would study them with the tools of stem
*  Right, but we know from we know that's not what goes on inside of these departments
*  And we also know that the product doesn't add up from the point of view of science. You can't take the claim for example that
*  If a man decides that he is a woman then he is a woman
*  It's not a valid claim
*  It just doesn't stand up and you can't claim that sex is a spectrum either that claim doesn't stand up
*  These are empty and we could have a discussion about what we are to do in light of the part of
*  Gender that is flexible
*  But we're not having that conversation because we've got an ultimatum on the table either you agree sex is a spectrum or
*  You're the enemy
*  so
*  All I would say is just empirically this is what happens now. I will also say
*  One of the most telling incidents that happened during the evergreen riots is now
*  Finally it's been covered by PBS. I've talked about it on my podcast a
*  student of Heather and mine an excellent student one of the best ones we ever had
*  As a young woman named Odette
*  Odette is half black her mom is afro-caribbean
*  She was known to be my student and Heather student during the riots and she was actually
*  confronted and physically bullied by the rioters who accused her of
*  Being a race trader for studying science this actually happened and
*  What I'm telling you what did they say when they say you're a race trader for studying science?
*  What what's what specific discipline? Well, she was studying
*  Evolutionary biology with Heather and me and and they said you were a race trader for studying evolutionary biology because
*  Because science is racist
*  Yo
*  It's nonsense and I hear you're trying to parse it as if it makes sense
*  And I think that I just don't understand as a person who spent three years barely paying attention in college
*  I don't know how it got to that
*  I don't know how it got to that. I don't know how that becomes an actual course. I don't know how that gets funded
*  I don't know how that you can get a degree from that. Well, so what I've heard of late
*  And I'm it may be James Lindsay who is the originator of of this phrase ology, but there's a term
*  racism of the gaps and racism of the gaps is a
*  Reference to the god of the gaps hypothesis anything we can't explain in science is explained by God, which is obviously nonsense
*  but racism of the gap says any place where that we see a
*  Success differential the explanation is inherently racism. So if we see an absence of black people in math
*  Obviously, the answer is racism. Do they apply that in areas where black people excel?
*  No, because this is a self-serving
*  Modality like hip-hop
*  Right. And so let's go back to Odette for a second
*  Trying to parse what they're saying as if it has content logical content is a mistake
*  Mm-hmm trying to parse it as a tactical move makes a lot of sense
*  Okay, let's imagine that Odette was not the courageous person that she is and that she had caved right imagine. You're cornered
*  You know, you're alone. You've got a mob that's actually physically confronting you for studying science
*  If she was not a person of strong character she might have signed up with them
*  if she had signed up with them then a now they have a
*  Potentially powerful ally right a black person former student of or at that point
*  I guess current student of Heather and mine who would say yes
*  In fact science is racist evolutionary biology particularly so I was in that class yada yada yada and people are easily influenced and that
*  Man being bullied by that would probably cause a lot of people to cave into that and give into that just for
*  Conformity just so the people who accept them. Yes
*  And so thank goodness that Odette is somebody who is of incredibly strong character
*  Who really got the message of evolutionary biology very deeply and there's nothing that they could have said or threatened her with it
*  Would have caused her to make the move that they wanted her to make but processing it tactically is important
*  What they're doing is tactical and what they did with shut down stem
*  Tactical they were proving their power, right?
*  They were able to get the most important scientific institutions to broadcast a demand to shut down stem
*  that's an amazing level of power and
*  actual scientists that are in
*  disciplines that are
*  Legit like evolutionary biology who went along with them
*  Well, you know I contacted Richard Dawkins as this was happening
*  Because I didn't see anything on his feed that suggested, you know, he hadn't made a statement
*  I thought it would be powerful him to do for him to do it. He was totally unaware. It was going on
*  All right
*  So you have the most important institutions broadcasting this thing something about our environment is not calling it to the attention
*  of people who might be in a position to say something and
*  The whole thing is it's setting us up. We're in we're in
*  Tremendous danger and what what do you think their motivation is?
*  Power power. Well again, what happens if they get through they shut down stem then what do they do?
*  How do you know, did they are they thinking this far ahead? They're not playing
*  this long game
*  Okay, I
*  would just I would tell people who aren't aware of me and what I think and believe that I am
*  Very progressive. I am very interested in making a fair system
*  As am I as I know you I know you are
*  So what I'm about to say sounds like one of those right-wing crazy things
*  What they want well
*  Imagine the following look first of all, let's talk about reparations for a second. Okay. Okay. I am NOT a fan of the idea of reparations
*  I think it would be a terrible failure would be a disaster, but I do believe that something of
*  Very substantial magnitude is justified. I just don't think reparations is the answer. I completely agree
*  Okay, I think reform in terms of communities
*  I think spending massive amounts of money to rebuild communities and give people hope. Yes
*  economic opportunities
*  Massive investment communities that have been systematically frozen out and I would put I would put American blacks and American Indians at the top
*  Of the list because I believe they have a special claim is particularly Native Americans are particularly distraught because they've been
*  Subjugated to this weird position when they're stuck on these reservations
*  So we'll come back to this maybe but I think that there's something very special that happened with blacks and with Indians
*  Yeah, it's not exactly alike, but it has to do with their different origin stories that these two populations
*  Have both suffered a parallel
*  I
*  Don't even know what to call it an obstacle. Yes, that doesn't that makes them unlike
*  Anyone other Americans. Yes
*  so
*  Not in favor of reparations, but I would be in favor of something that did the job that reparations are imagined to do
*  Okay
*  what this movement is is an attempt to create a
*  slant in
*  Every single interaction that does the job of reparations its reparations
*  24 hours a day seven days a week in every room in every institution in every context, right?
*  now
*  That will be the uninvention of America
*  it is in some weird sense a mirror for the America that
*  Blacks and Indians have faced they have faced an America in which everything was slanted against them. It has grown less so
*  But again, we have the echoes of that deeply slanted America that are broadcast into the present
*  at a high level of intensity
*  but
*  you cannot do reparations inside of
*  Every institution every hour every discussion that is not a plausible plan
*  Even people who support the idea of monetary reparations of the solution if they understood the dynamics of trying to infuse it into every
*  Interaction there is no way it could possibly work and it invalidates all of the most important principles on which America runs
*  So we are really talking about uninventing America and substituting a reparations program for it
*  which
*  It just couldn't possibly be a bigger hazard and think think for a second. You're trying to imagine what the hell I'm talking about
*  imagine the courts, right
*  now
*  There is a problem
*  There's a process called jury nullification and Eric has pointed out that jury nullification
*  Is a huge hazard in an era where people are saying as much nonsense about
*  Who's guilty and who's innocent and what it has to do with race as we have because effectively you can instantly create a situation
*  In which the law doesn't apply to certain folks because of the color of their skin, right?
*  That would be an advantage you could argue that it was compensatory for years of being on the other end of that deal
*  But it cannot be made to function. But the other thing is also possible
*  Right, you can not only have the law not apply to people on the basis that they have a skin color that suggests
*  They've had a raw deal
*  But you can also make the law apply to people because of their skin color we can have show trials
*  Right. I was effectively exposed to the equivalent of a show trial at evergreen, right?
*  I was convicted of racism and it happened at for various reasons
*  I knew damn well that the charge was completely empty based on my history as a human being and so I
*  Felt I could stand up to it and withstand it and I guess in a way I did on the other hand
*  My wife and I were driven out of the college. So yes, I survived it but I didn't survive it intact
*  Right. I made it somewhere else
*  but that show trial mentality I
*  mean it would be a perfect fit for the
*  The Maoist part of this of this movement's ethos
*  I mean we're already seeing struggle sessions people being forced to admit things that aren't true
*  right, do you think part of the
*  part of the influence of this is that we
*  particularly
*  white Americans
*  Realize that there's a significant difference
*  There's a significant disparity between opportunity that people in these disenfranchised communities of color have versus us
*  There's a difference and so
*  when someone from these
*  Critical theory disciplines should I even say discipline some lack of discipline when they promote this
*  People that are in recognition that there is a problem in this country that there is a situation this country and
*  to voice any
*  Sort of disagreement with this movement that seems to represent the idea that there is a problem
*  You you become a part of of racism
*  So in order to stand out as not being racist you are literally abandoning
*  The ideas of science you're abandoning all this just so that you don't get labeled on the wrong side of history
*  Yes, and I was alerted to something a few days ago that I was not aware of
*  which is
*  It's gonna sound far-fielder
*  But what I ran into was somebody describing what had happened to American POWs in the Korean War
*  Who were being administered by the Chinese?
*  The Chinese had a very sophisticated
*  Mechanism for
*  basically brainwashing and
*  The mechanism was something that I have seen in this movement
*  But didn't understand had a formal history one always imagines brainwashing to be this very aggressive
*  Thing but
*  the
*  incrementalness of
*  The move that was arranged for these POWs was the key feature
*  So the first thing that apparently POWs were asked to do
*  Was to write essays and it was really important that they write it rather than just say it
*  But that they write essays on topics that any reasonable person would think was fair like
*  America is not perfect. All right, you could write that essay. I can write that essay. There's no moral compromise in it
*  Or the other example was, you know unemployment is not a problem under communism
*  Okay, that doesn't strike me as a bridge too far
*  Communism has lots of problems, but maybe that's not one of them
*  so
*  People were marched from these very tiny concessions where really the concession was just you're gonna write what I tell you
*  Right rather than any part of the content to an
*  Absolutely massive shift in their understanding and along the way they were for example induced to
*  to write more
*  Substantial concessions with some very tiny reward like a piece of fruit or something something that's actually
*  Desirable and if things are scarce you can understand wanting it
*  But it's not such a big concession that you can say to yourself. Oh, yeah
*  I said something I didn't believe because I got a lot out of it
*  So you actually talk yourself into imagining that you really do believe the thing you wrote you must otherwise you wouldn't have written it
*  so what I'm seeing is
*  all sorts of
*  excellent people making the first
*  Concessions on to or the first steps on to the slippery slope and it's spooking the hell out of me
*  so, you know, I must say I saw I
*  Saw Dave Chappelle's 846 thing and like you I thought
*  Wow, do I get what he's saying on the other hand? I really thought he got it wrong. What'd you think you got wrong?
*  Well, what do you effectively?
*  Said what he effectively
*  Suggested was that he was on board with the movement and it was clear that this was based on
*  His massive frustration at how deaf the white population has been to black suffering
*  Which I agree with I think the white population has been largely deaf at least in recent decades
*  but I
*  Don't know how much he knows about what the movement actually is and what it wants. In other words, I have the
*  Maximum respect for Dave Chappelle. I have for a very long time. I think he's tremendously insightful
*  But I don't know
*  I mean
*  I think he's got the same problem tuning into the world that everybody else does which is he gets some slice that's fed to him
*  or maybe like you he is not tuned into these things and so he gets whatever crosses the
*  the threshold some other way and maybe he's not seeing
*  That this movement is a spouting nonsense about getting rid of science and he's not seeing that it's behaving in a Maoist
*  Way and he is seeing the videos that we all see that suggest to us that there is a very serious
*  problem with race-based police brutality and the problem with that of course is that
*  You can't do that analysis with anecdotes no matter how egregious they seem
*  Is it weird to connect all those things together though when you're saying the movement if this movement doesn't have any leaders and you're talking
*  About police brutality, but you're also talking about
*  Maoist ideology that weasels its way into academia is that really the same thing is it all one thing?
*  Well, I don't you know multi-headed hydra
*  I don't think it is one thing but I think it's like a coalition of things and I think each of those things is
*  Comprehensible, you know in isolation and we can understand what happens when you fuse them together and
*  All I can say is
*  We did see this in miniature at evergreen and people did say you're making too much out of it and they were wrong and
*  But you saw it on the ground the problem with seeing it from a distance is you can minimize many things
*  When you're you don't experience the emotions you don't see the fear
*  You don't see people running through the parking lot with baseball bats looking for you like they were doing
*  You know
*  It's a different thing when you're actually there and you realize that this mass hysteria does lead to pretty
*  Despicable acts and that there is sort of a mob mentality that that grips people and it allows people to be capable of some pretty
*  heinous shit and what we see here in America is such a combination of factors, right you have
*  Covid which shuts everything down. So people are stuck at home for all these months
*  Then you have this George Floyd thing, which is one of the worst
*  Cases of police brutality I've ever seen because it was so torturous
*  Yeah, I mean if you really know how long eight minutes and 46 seconds is with someone leaning on your neck
*  You would know how fucking horrific that is
*  And then you have the looting yeah, and then you have the mass movement of
*  All these people taking to the streets saying we've got to change things
*  We know things are wrong and on top of that you have looting and on top of that you have businesses failing because of the looting
*  You have chaos people getting their lives destroyed you have so many things happening altogether at once to call it a movement
*  It don't it's like one of the things we were talking about with black with excuse me
*  Occupy Wall Street back in the day was we're saying they don't seem to know exactly what's going on, but it's like the immune system
*  Surrounding something that's wrong. Like it's like something's going on here. Like all these white blood cells are
*  Flooding into this area. I forget who made that analogy. It might have been me
*  It was so long ago, but we're like they don't
*  Necessarily know what to do or what it is
*  But they want to camp out around that area and figure out what the fuck's going on
*  Yeah, and I you know
*  Like I said at first I was on board with this and I thought there was something right about it
*  And you know, I even thought the leaderlessness of it was great for two weeks and then it became very very stupid
*  but
*  Yeah, it is an immune reaction and that's a normal part of history, you know in
*  Revolutions are not started by a bunch of intellectuals who have some idea what system they want to
*  Correct, right people who are fed up
*  And so that's what Dave Chappelle was responding to and I totally get it. But the problem is we are all
*  in danger of being marched in the direction of things that are
*  Anti-american that are in fact anti-black
*  Because we are trying to
*  Grant the right concessions on the right points and it's a it's a case in which you can't track what's really happening
*  Well enough to do it surgically
*  So I really I'm so afraid to actually go down this next road
*  But you raised the case of you know, George Floyd and what we saw on that tape. I
*  Want you to think about the question of what you actually saw on that tape and what it actually tells you what you actually know
*  And what you don't know
*  I'm worried
*  Look best possible thing from the point of view of the well-being of the world
*  Would be that Derek Chauvin is guilty of murder and he is convicted of murder and he is sentenced for the maximum
*  Allowable time that would be the best agrees
*  I'm not sure that that's actually what is supposed to happen. Why is that?
*  Okay
*  The question is
*  Did you witness a murder? Are you sure you saw a murder?
*  What do you mean by that? Well murder is a crime. Yes. Okay, presumably
*  There was a lot of complaint about the fact that Chauvin wasn't charged with first-degree murder
*  Right, but he didn't what story would make it sensible that he wanted to kill
*  George Floyd that that was his purpose. Well, you know, do you know that he knew him?
*  You know
*  he knew him in advance and that they had had words and they had they had had problems when they worked together because
*  Derek Chauvin was a shithead to customers and he was
*  Violent to customers. Yeah, he and George Floyd worked as bouncers in the same establishment. Yep, and that's the
*  That's the the word well from the point of view of the well-being of the world and from the point of view of us all
*  Processing this right in some sense
*  I mean, you know with the understanding that there is nothing that could possibly happen in an investigation
*  Or in a court that's gonna bring George Floyd back
*  Right. Okay. So with that in mind the best thing that could happen is that he is actually guilty of something egregious
*  He's charged with it. He's convicted right, but what makes you think that it's not murder. This is what's oh
*  I'm not saying it isn't murder. It may well be murder, but I'm saying that what we saw doesn't tell us that it was murder
*  Why is that? Okay, so
*  There are several things about what we saw
*  What we didn't see but now know and things that are possible. Okay
*  One thing is that it appears that George Floyd was complaining that he could not breathe before he was on the ground
*  Okay, that he may have been having a heart attack before he was on the ground now again, even if that's true. I
*  would think
*  He obviously was deserving of immediate medical attention
*  And so I am not arguing that it would not be criminal if he was dying of a heart attack and that's ultimately what killed him
*  But what I'm saying is that we're at the case
*  That he was having a heart attack. He had apparently methamphetamine and fentanyl in his system at the time
*  We're at the case that he was having a heart attack
*  You mean you say in his system is it was it just because he tested positive for it or was it active in his system?
*  Was it something that he had taken fairly recently but the effects of it were no longer active?
*  I'm not an expert and maybe I misunderstood what I read
*  But I thought that these things were recently in his system rather than just detected at trace. I don't know
*  I don't know either. So let's let's leave it. So again, I
*  Am NOT rooting
*  I understand what you're saying to be the reason why I bring that up is coming from someone who works very closely with the UFC
*  And you saw to one of the things that I'm finding out is that their methods of detection now are insanely
*  sensitive and you can detect in time
*  Incredibly small
*  non-psychoactive amounts
*  Months and months and months after use. Okay. Well, then it's obviously not relevant
*  The possibility that was having a heart attack is clearly relevant. It's possible
*  I mean if he did say he can't breathe
*  It also could be that he was struggling and there was a tussle and he's just exhausted and he couldn't breathe
*  But or that reports that he said he couldn't breathe before he was on the ground or erroneous
*  That's also possible could be a lie you when you look at what that man did when you look at what Derek
*  Did to George Floyd with his knee on that man's neck? I could 100% kill a man that way. Well, okay
*  So here's the problem. Okay
*  Apparently that technique is a
*  Technique that is authorized by the police department in question under some circumstances and apparently those
*  Circumstances were present in other words
*  It may be that the policy of the Minneapolis Police Department means erratically changed
*  No, it may be that the policy killed George Floyd because the policy allowed him to do that
*  Yeah, well, maybe it even required him to do it. I don't know but but the guy wasn't resisting
*  That's the problem when he's on the ground. He's just got his knee on the guy's neck
*  Did you watch the whole video I did watch the whole there's another problem with the way he did it with there's a
*  Drain there you see that cement drain and his neck is laying on the edge of the cement drain that that it's like a bone
*  When you choke man, you know, you you don't use the meaty part of your body
*  You use the bone and that's essentially that divot that that drain is laying right where his neck is
*  I don't know if he placed him there on purpose. Yeah, but I wouldn't doubt it
*  Well, I'm not saying Derek Chauvin didn't kill George Floyd. I'm not saying it wasn't racially motivated
*  I'm not saying that this wasn't murder in the first degree based on prior interaction
*  I'm not saying any of that
*  What I'm saying is that we don't know in the public based on what we have seen
*  We don't know this to have been murder because if this was Derek Chauvin
*  being a dick and
*  using the
*  policy of the police department and being indifferent to its effect then
*  That is for a court to decide whether or not it is murder in other words if he was right doing the policy as the policy
*  Is laid out based on the criteria that would trigger the policy. Have you read any of this?
*  What about the policies? I've read a bit. What have you read?
*  I read it say it said I'm going to struggle for the words that the acronym stands for there is a
*  a
*  situation
*  Called e xd s
*  Extreme
*  Boy, I don't have it. Maybe Jamie can find it. Okay, but
*  again
*  The real point here is not that he is innocent
*  I don't believe him to be innocent my real point is that we are all acting as if we have seen with our own eyes
*  Something that is unambiguously murder and I don't believe that we saw that
*  I believe we saw something that may well have been murder and may well not have been murder and that the way that we
*  Determine whether it is murder is in a courtroom with due process
*  Well, isn't it through autopsies because independent autopsies did find that
*  Asphyxiation and the cutoff of the blood supply to the brain were responsible for his death now
*  There was a police department autopsy that was refuted by two
*  Individual independent attorney independent examiners, you know what you need what you need a court
*  You need a court to examine the evidence
*  You need a court to examine the evidence and you need it to be done in front of a jury that is free to
*  Decide either way and here's what I'm really concerned about
*  Because we all think we saw a murder right we think it's unambiguous we think it's open and shut right
*  The entire case is going to unfold in that context, right?
*  And if he is exonerated we are going to assume that this is a miscarriage of justice
*  Yes, right, which means I mean put yourself in the position of a member of the jury
*  If you don't think this was murder
*  You may well be the person who stands in the way of a judgment and causes
*  Who knows what to erupt?
*  This is we're talking about Rodney King times a thousand times a million times a million
*  Particularly if you look at what happened just from the reaction to this one murder, right?
*  I mean we've seen cops murder people and we've seen a
*  Minimal reaction by the public just protests and people get angry this erupted around the world
*  Nobody nobody anticipated this or saw that but it speaks to the powder keg of
*  Circumstances that we were talking about all this different pack dynamite of coved the lockdown financial distraught
*  But can we agree that it could be that?
*  His being found not guilty would set in motion events that could be right up to civil war
*  catastrophic, so if that is the case what I believe is
*  Likely to happen is that he's likely to be convicted irrespective of the evidence. He's gonna be sacrificed
*  Right and you agree that that might be for the best of everybody
*  Well, what I want to point out is that we don't behave that way
*  We don't behave that way the most
*  the center of what we are as Americans is a country in which you are entitled to
*  Do process in a court of law that your guilt has to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt
*  And if we are gonna start sacrificing people because there is a mob in the street threatening to turn the place upside down
*  then I
*  Mean you know what that is, right?
*  That's the uninvention of America and you know, you can't use the term lynching for it because of the racial connotations of that term
*  But if we are talking about sacrificing individuals because a mob has decided that they are guilty
*  then
*  We are in America anymore. I think when you look at the spectrum of probability if you had a pie of
*  Is he guilty of murder?
*  Did he murder him by leaning on his neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds or did he not I would say did he not?
*  Is so small
*  You would have to have a fucking magnifying glass to look at it if I am an expert on choking people
*  You know, I understand what happens to the brain when you cut off the blood supply. I've had it done to me
*  What that guy is doing is torture and I think I could I know I could kill a man that way
*  I know I could yeah if I if I decided to lean on someone's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds with all my weight
*  That's a dead person
*  There's no way you're gonna survive
*  All right
*  If your neck one side of your neck is on the concrete and the other side is 200 pounds of my body all
*  Focused on my knee and I'm balancing my my weight on your neck. You're a dead man
*  Okay, so but that's what we saw well, right?
*  I know what you're saying that maybe he also had a heart attack, but the idea that those two are not related
*  Seems to me to be
*  Outside of the realm of possibility. So I want to I want to make a trade with you. Okay, okay, I
*  Absolutely hope that you're right
*  Okay, I hope this is clear
*  but in exchange for that I want the agreement that
*  The American thing to do is to convict him by the evidence in a court of law
*  And if the evidence is not sufficiently compelling
*  That's not what's supposed to happen that that would be un-American for that to be the way he was convicted
*  I agree and we are convicting him in the court of public opinion, but we're doing it based on a video of a man
*  Putting all his weight on this guy's neck for eight minutes and 40. That's I mean
*  When you roll in jujitsu class generally a rolls between five minutes
*  Maybe ten minutes or something like that and the idea of a man being on my neck the entire time is fucking terrifying
*  Oh, I believe I saw a tremendous miscarriage of justice what I don't know and what I don't think any of us
*  Understand is what is the policy? Did he exceed the policy? Did he enact the policy?
*  I just can't imagine what is the cop would think that that was the way to do it
*  it's one thing if someone is resisting arrest and they're very dangerous and you're
*  Handcuffing them and you put your knee on your neck on their neck to hold them down in place
*  And I think that is a valid move if you've a guy and he's got a gun or he's wired on PCP
*  And he's very strong and there's a bunch of you trying to hold on to the guy and someone leans on his neck
*  I'm all for that, but then when you're done when you got him cuffed let him go
*  He's not a threat that guy wasn't even moving. I wanted just begging for his life
*  I wanted George Floyd to be taken to a hospital
*  It seems clear to me that he needed to be taken to a hospital, but I don't know okay here
*  We got it here. That's like a fine. I think
*  Officer can also use two type of neck restraints in less severe circumstances one is called
*  Conscious neck restraint which is an officer applies light to moderate pressure to the side of a person's neck
*  But does not intend to knock a person unconscious that could be used against people who are actively resisting so that alone
*  Just dismisses this whole idea because that's not what was going on there that guy was not actively resistant
*  The other neck restraint is one meant to render someone unconscious that could be used when someone is exhibiting active aggression and
*  For life-saving purposes again. This does not apply
*  Department policy said neck restraints can't be used against people who are passively resisting so right there
*  It says neck restraints should not have been used against George Floyd because he was not
*  Violently resisting that's not what was going on. He was not exhibiting a great active aggression. He wasn't do that
*  He was begging for his life. He was calling out for his dead mother's mother. I know it's horrific shit. I
*  Am feeling the need to emphasize. I do believe I saw a miscarriage of justice
*  But I know that the American thing to do is to have all of this out in a court of law where all of the appropriate
*  Arguments are on the table. I agree with you. I don't I don't see a
*  Way where he wasn't guilty
*  But I do agree with you that it should be tried in a court of law
*  But just based on that I say he's guilty and then we're also looking at the comparison between the Eric Gardner case
*  Which I also thought was horrible and I also said as a person who's an expert in martial arts. That was a chokehold
*  They were saying it wasn't a chokehold that was a chokehold
*  But here's the thing about the Eric Gardner case
*  They should have never fucking arrested that guy in the first place. He was just selling loose cigarettes
*  What kind of world we're living in we grab a guy by his neck because he's selling loose cigarettes and
*  When those guys did tackle him and take him down to the ground and held on to him when he said he can't breathe
*  He also appeared to be in poor health and it was likely that the altercation which probably wouldn't have killed you
*  Killed him and it was awful terrible, but this was a hundred times worse
*  Well, can we come you say what kind of a world are we living in where somebody?
*  Selling loose cigarettes has this kind of interaction and yes, you know, we can say the same thing for George Floyd, right?
*  We're talking about yeah counterfeit $20 bill. Yeah, right, but I want to go back to what I said before
*  Police brutality is a feature not a bug. Yes, I agree with you. So what I mean by that is
*  If you are going to freeze people out of their share of the well-being that is generated by society
*  You are going to have to keep them from revolting and so what you do is you set up some sort of arbitrary
*  Administrator of authority that people run in contact with that they fear right you set up some force that
*  Disincentivizes misbehavior and that force isn't just the police. It's obviously the
*  the
*  Prison system as well. Here's where I'd argue with you about that
*  That is that only applies if you only see that force
*  Exhibited towards poor people and disenfranchised communities, but you don't what you see with police brutality
*  You see police brutality being utilized on wealthy people if they don't know
*  You see if they don't know that they can't get away with it
*  Do you know the case of the the young man that was killed in the hotel in Arizona? Of course. Yeah, it was horrific
*  Horrific in on video this guy being forced to crawl on the ground by this cop and then the cop shoots him in the back
*  He's trying to reach to pull his pants up. Yep. There's no threat right clearly no threat. No weapon
*  No
*  nothing is you got a monster who just wants to fucking shoot people and
*  I think it points to what Jocko was saying a lack of training a lack of quality people and a lack of a
*  Process of weeding out people that would be more inclined to use police brutality and that process
*  I think should be similar to buds like what Navy SEALs have to go through or
*  Rangers have to go through and it should be something that weeds out people of weak character
*  So the police should be something that's a very difficult job to get where you only get the cream of the crop of human beings
*  of character of
*  Emotional stability people that would not do something like that who would recognize that man on the ground as being a father and a husband and
*  Human being is a part of our community and you don't gun him down just because you're a fucking piece of shit
*  And that's what that guy did well
*  So it's not just a bug that's designed to keep people of disenfranchised
*  Communities from speaking out and demanding their fair share
*  It's a bug of human beings who have power over other human beings
*  It's when you know the Stanford prison experience or experiments which of course have been sort of discredited in some ways
*  That they actually probably wanted out of it
*  So they expect but the idea behind it makes sense to us that if you give people power over people
*  They kind of tend to abuse it when people have just unchecked authority over folks. They tend to
*  They tend to use that it's a it's a feature of human beings. Oh, believe me. I mean like I said before I
*  only told you the
*  Simpler story of my run-in with the cops, right?
*  I know that that putting a badge on somebody and giving them a weapon and giving them all of that power
*  It brings the worst out in many people and it's very very
*  It's very dangerous. Yes
*  But I still I
*  Still see something systemic here that isn't being discussed. I don't think we disagree on that. I think that's there as well. I
*  Think there's multiple factors. Well multiple factors. Yes, but let's put it this way
*  My claim is that opportunity is being hoarded right at the top of the economic ladder
*  Opportunity is widespread. You can do very well the farther you get down the economic ladder
*  The less opportunity there is and the greater the danger of you are falling off the bottom
*  Right in some communities you start off off the bottom
*  Yes, and you cannot access the ladder up in such cases
*  It is not surprising that people resort to crime
*  The reason most do not resort to crime is that they have better options, right? People are wired to pick better options
*  so
*  Let's talk about a couple things. Okay, and I do hope we get to some science at some point
*  But yeah a lot of time brother. Good. All right, so let's talk for a second about
*  Why?
*  The black community has a special problem in America. Can we talk about that? Sure
*  All right
*  So I want to talk about two things one has to do with the special origin story for the African derived population of Americans
*  Obviously slavery is where most
*  African Americans come from they arrived through that mechanism
*  But slavery has a special interaction with the normal structures of being a human being
*  Right. So a human being is
*  sort of a generalist creature with a
*  capacity to have its software
*  reworked for different habitats the reason that human beings are
*  Able to exploit every terrestrial habitat where plants grow
*  Is that they don't all have the software program. That's the same right? You can have a software program for
*  hunting in the Kalahari you can have one for
*  Terracing the Andes to grow potatoes you can have any one of a number of software programs
*  Well slavery took the software program that
*  Africans who were brought into the slave trade had and it did its best to erase that program and to render that program
*  Non-functional it rendered it non-functional by combining people from different places who didn't even necessarily speak a language
*  So there was not one culture available and it sort of forces
*  The bootstrapping of a new culture which was composed of various things
*  But of course there was a you know prohibition against teaching slaves to read and things like that
*  So there was a systematic breaking of the original culture
*  that Africans had who were in the New World and a substituting of a
*  Version that was not as much of a threat to the slave holding population, right?
*  And at the point that slavery comes to an end it is not as if frankly even
*  We you know
*  We didn't even have the tools to talk about these things in responsible terms
*  So there wasn't enough known about how the mind works and what its relationship is to the to the body and all so
*  The the thing that makes the black population and the Indian population different
*  I would argue is the systematic hobbling of the onboard
*  The inherited evolved culture in the case of Indians by transporting them to
*  To reservations and by putting them in schools that disrupt
*  the passage of normal culture and in the case of
*  Africans it was
*  You know breaking apart of families keeping people from being in contact with others
*  They had the right language to talk to and all so in any case that carries through to the present it creates a
*  situation where
*  There has not been access to the materials to fully bring
*  To fully update software am I making sense yet? Yes, okay?
*  You're speaking about this almost purely from like an evolutionary biology perspective
*  Yes
*  I'm afraid that it's not it's not properly going to come through what I'm saying is that when you have one population in
*  Control of how another population
*  Accesses the shared culture that it's never fair right and so we saw this with
*  You know conquistadors who came into the new world and were
*  Forcing Catholicism on the Inca for example right so there's this there's always this attempt to to
*  handoff culture that serves the powerful and
*  undermines those who might rebel against them
*  Okay, now let's
*  Let's go back to the question of how opportunity is distributed
*  Okay, so for some populations you have very little opportunity, and you have a tremendous hazard of falling off the bottom of the ladder
*  And not having there's not enough
*  Mechanism to allow you to get back to it that creates
*  crime
*  Let's say that those who control or who write the rules of the system do not want a revolt even though this
*  Scenario would set them up for it right so one thing that happens is you create a tendency to
*  Incarcerate right you have rules that freeze certain people out of
*  opportunity and then you have a system that is capable of incarcerating massive numbers of them and we
*  Incarcerate a much larger fraction of our population than any comparable nation right and a very disproportionate
*  fraction of people in that system are black
*  so
*  Here's the part that I don't hear discussed
*  When you take
*  Men out of a population it has a very predictable effect
*  You take men out of a population it undercuts the bargaining position of women in mating and dating
*  Right so if you take men out of the population it means that those men who are still present in that population are in very
*  High demand right now men being men if they're in high sexual demand it is hard to get them to settle down
*  Right a man who has lots of options is much harder to persuade to become monogamous and
*  Participate in traditional family raising
*  Okay
*  So what that does is it creates an environment in which you have many more single-parent homes?
*  Many more children growing up without their fathers present which of course
*  hobbles the kids who are raised in that situation because humans are so
*  Difficult to raise they're so costly in terms of time and energy and resources that one person has a much harder time doing it
*  Than a team of two people and
*  This sets in motion all of the things for which white society
*  imagines that there's some cause inside of being black when in fact it's a demographic
*  Process a demographic process that unfolds very naturally if you remove a disproportionate number of men from a population and
*  undermine women's bargaining position
*  That making sense absolutely okay, so why are we not having that discussion and why are we instead talking about
*  Shutting down stem stem is exactly what you need in order to understand how that process works and to figure out what you would
*  Have to do to fix it. Well, I think those things are in many people's eyes so distantly connected
*  You know what they look at the economic disparity and the crime and the gang problem and the prison problem and the income
*  problem and the incarceration problem and
*  They they look at that and then they look at stem as being a completely different thing it's like
*  what your your connection and what the way what you're saying about
*  The the fact that the hobbling of these communities is so systemic
*  It's so it's so a part of how they're established and set up and there's and it's repeating itself
*  Over and over and over again generation after generation, you know that
*  In many people's eyes, it doesn't doesn't seem related
*  It doesn't seem related exactly and this is this is why you need those
*  Enlightenment values and the tools that arise out of right is because you need to be able to look at it scientifically
*  Right if this is this is causal. Yeah. Yeah, you have to go dispassionate in order to make a compassionate policy
*  They can't be taboo subjects that can't be breached by white people because of your privilege, right?
*  So what I'm watching is a train wreck in which we have a movement that is unhooking exactly the tools necessary to see what really
*  Is going on right? Right? There really is a problem and what this movement is doing is it is advancing a phony explanation
*  Bad policy and then on the other side everybody who's not going along with this, you know
*  Or a vast majority of those who are not going along are thinking. Okay, those people are just crazy
*  Right, they're complaining about something that doesn't exist. This is this is nonsense
*  It's chaos and we it has to be shut down. And so anyway, the truth is neither of those things
*  The the movement is advancing wrong ideas
*  But the energy that fuels the movement is about real legitimate complaints
*  Yeah
*  And the people who are against the movement because they don't buy what's being said or don't understand the actual unfairness in our system
*  Are being emboldened by this they're not being woken up to it
*  They're being deafened to the fact that there's actually a problem that needs solving and they're thinking the whole thing was phony to begin with
*  Right. So that looks to me like kind of worst possible
*  Like we're setting ourselves up not to be able to solve this and if we don't solve it
*  We are headed to chaos one way or another even if this dies down. It'll be back. Yeah
*  Um, I feel that always when I hear people discuss jobs
*  Like when I hear presidential candidates discuss jobs and unemployment
*  and you know and
*  Boosting up the economy and like when trump discusses the fact that you know when the economy was doing well before covet that there was
*  Black unemployment was at an all-time low and that you know, he was all these great things were happening. It's like
*  addressing
*  You're not addressing the foundation you're only addressing like the windows of a house we keep the windows shut and this house is solid
*  but if the foundation is rotten because the termites and you're just ignoring it and you just
*  keep
*  Stacking boards up to level it out when one side sinks because the rotten wood gives way you're not fixing that
*  These are temporary patches the real issue is
*  Is very clear the one of the ways I've looked at it is and this is a very simplistic way that I
*  Sort of say if you really wanted to help America if you're really patriotic, what's the best way to help America?
*  Well, you'd want less losers
*  How do you get less losers? You find the spots where the people have an unfair shot and you fix that you fix those spots
*  Whether it's a South Side of Chicago, whether it's Baltimore you find these disenfranchised
*  Areas and you fix them. That's the only way you give people much more opportunity you give people you
*  You set it up. So people have if not the same advantage a far superior advantage
*  That then they have now in terms of their ability to make it
*  through the navigate the
*  terrifying waters of being a young adult and getting through the system without going to jail and without making terrible mistakes and then having some
*  Sort of an economic opportunity that it gives you hope that you actually strive for something and you get rewarded for your effort
*  And you see other people get rewarded for that effort as well
*  And that becomes the model that you're using you use this model of you know
*  The model that we see in a lot of upper middle class communities. You see there's a path Mike made it through look at Mike
*  Now he has a Corvette, you know
*  Tom made it through look at that nice house and you see that and you just emulate that
*  Whereas in these communities that have been established that they've had this problem for
*  Decade after decade and nothing's been done about it
*  And so they hear all this this talk from politicians about black unemployment and this and that but meanwhile the fucking neighbor is exactly the same
*  No one's done anything to fix it. No one's done anything to
*  I mean, and I think it's a tremendous problem in terms of like what effort needs to be done to fix it
*  And I'm a moron. I'm not the guy to fix it. I don't I don't understand how it could be done
*  I don't know
*  But I don't but I do understand that there's not work being put into doing it other than through the people in the community and community
*  activists and and some some people that have you know that are
*  Philanthropists have tried to figure out a way to do their best to put a dent in it
*  It's never been addressed on a national level
*  It's not addressed like no one's no president has ever made an address even Obama where they've sat down and said
*  Here's the areas of this country where it's really hard to make it and this is what we're gonna do to fix that
*  Yeah, I agree, but I still don't think here at the root. What's the root?
*  the root is a
*  System that is so politically corrupt that it is not even interested in doing what it needs to do
*  It is interested in doing the bare minimum that it can do that prevents revolt and now it's screwed up now
*  It's got revolt on its hands
*  But if you actually wanted to solve this problem, you have to solve it at the causal level, right?
*  You can't have a system in which people are choosing between candidates from two corrupt parties
*  both of which are
*  Hell-bent on stealing well-being from them and transferring it to their actual constituents. I
*  Agree so yeah, that's that's a problem as well. I don't think it's a problem as well. I mean imagine for a second
*  Right. How did we get here? It's 2020. We are facing a global pandemic, which incidentally I do want to talk to you about
*  Okay, we are facing a global pandemic. We are facing
*  rioting in the streets a movement that's showing signs of a
*  Maoist challenge to the most fundamental aspects of the West
*  Right, and we're gonna have to choose between Donald Trump and Joe Biden
*  What?
*  right neither one of these people is
*  Capable of or inclined towards the kind of leadership that you have just described we would need agreed
*  So that means that a very at the very least if we do not
*  Divert our course right if November comes and we are choosing between
*  Those two then that means we're putting off any solution at least four years
*  Because the president the president would be essential to changing our course
*  Right, and this is just built into these parties now, right Obama. I can't figure out why it's the case
*  I really like Obama personally. He seems like the right guy to me, but
*  his his administration at an at a policy level was
*  Indistinguishable from Bush in some ways it was worse
*  So what we've got is parties that decide what we get to choose from and the game is to prevent us from having any
*  Choice that could possibly solve the problem. So we have to fix that
*  We have to address that problem and we have to break their stranglehold and you know
*  in fairness
*  Trump was a challenge to that two-party duopoly. He's not really a Republican, right?
*  But he's also not really an alternative it's like a third crime family, right?
*  Yeah, you've got the Republicans the Democrats and now they sort of co-opted their ideology to fit his needs. Yeah
*  But it's not a solution, right? So we have to get that solution
*  Which means we have to get by the parties Trump proved that was possible
*  Right. I think if there's any of it there was ever a time where an independent party has a chance now
*  The time if someone steps in and has a real solution and also for in terms of the distribution of that information
*  now is the time because you could just post something on YouTube where you're
*  Demonstrating like they're a step-by-step process
*  You could take hours to do it like this is what I want to do and this is how I'm gonna do it
*  You break those down the clips almost like a podcast and if someone was a person of substance that we really believed in
*  We said that person can really do this this actually could happen. Let's vote independent
*  It could happen
*  They don't have a monopoly on the distribution of information anymore
*  And that's terrifying to them because they used to be able to count on the shills on the left and the right
*  To get the word out for them, but they don't have that anymore. You have so many people that
*  Really don't have an ideological
*  Foundation in either one of them that are talking and they're reaching millions of people
*  that's a rare moment in time and this is in my opinion the very best time for someone to step in that's not
*  They're not compliant. They're not they don't have to give it
*  They don't they don't need that policy machine behind them or the political machine behind them
*  Well, I've got a plan. Okay, but we would have to find a really big podcast
*  I think to get enough momentum is none of those out there. You haven't encountered a big time
*  They don't exist
*  All right, you want to hear the plan? Sure. Okay, the rock and Jocko Willink
*  Well, you know, let's put that
*  Okay, let's put that to the side. It's not part of the plan, but it actually could fit. Okay, okay
*  So here's the the plan this plan needs a better name, but the working title is the dark horse duo plan
*  and the plan looks like this we
*  draft
*  Two individuals we find two people one of them is center-left and one of them is center-right and
*  These people have to have certain characteristics a minimum set they have to be
*  Patriotic they have to be courageous and they have to be highly capable, right?
*  But that's it. Okay center left and a center right and we pair them together
*  We draft them
*  With the following plan that they will govern as a team that is to say every important decision will be
*  discussed and they will decide what to do as a team and
*  Only in cases where they cannot reach agreement or whether something has to be whenever something has to be decided on a very short
*  Timescale like a military decision does the person who inhabits the role of the president?
*  govern alone, okay
*  We draft these folks and then four years down the road
*  They switch and the one who had run for president now runs for the vice presidential spot and the one who was vice president now runs
*  For president and they continue this way until one of two things happens either
*  We vote someone else in or one of them has inhabited the office of president twice and is no longer eligible
*  And then that person has to be replaced. So we have a patriotic team governing together
*  From center left and center right
*  When you say drafted that's the problem like someone has to be motivated
*  To ruin their fucking lives to try to run this country. Well, that's what happens to everybody that does it
*  I agree, but then that's an obstacle you're spelling out an obstacle that I would argue is solvable that we know these people who?
*  Okay, so okay. Let's just say that's the plan so far
*  Yeah, and talk about what problems it solves as much as you want
*  I feel like I should have a drink and listen to this. You're welcome to have a drink. It's probably a good idea
*  But go ahead but okay. So here's my proposal
*  So the plan could be right and my proposal for who we draft could be wrong
*  And I'm happy to see other people swapped in okay, but my proposal would be
*  Admiral William McRaven on the right
*  You know who that is? No, I don't. Okay. He is a Navy SEAL former Navy SEAL
*  He was until 2018 the Chancellor of the University of Texas. He is a
*  very cogent
*  Center right
*  Republican
*  He was the lead on the bin Laden raid and he is I think
*  Universally respected by people who know him. I've never heard anybody say negative things about him
*  On the center left. Let me see this gentleman. I'm gonna look at his face. Yeah, you're gonna know oh
*  Yeah, I've seen that guy before I like it was like a president to me
*  Yeah, it looks like a president to me too. You know who else looks like a president to me who Andrew Yang?
*  I'm down with that. Okay, so like what you're saying now good. So here's my point
*  Those two guys together those two is that camera on yes Admiral your country needs you
*  It really does never more than now
*  And I know that the job of president is a sucky one. I'm sure the job of vice president's even worse
*  but
*  please consider this plan because
*  The Republic is in jeopardy
*  Now we already know
*  That Andrew Yang is up for the job because he ran for office. Yes, you know faced appallingly
*  Stupid obstacles that in my opinion may be the reason that he's not the nominee
*  So here we got two people one of them I think will do so out of duty
*  The other is crazy enough to want the job in the first place
*  and
*  What are they? Well, they're both patriots. They're both courageous and they're both highly capable
*  This is the road out. I don't know
*  the
*  the Navy SEAL gentlemen, but my graven the graven but
*  Andrew Yang has some really good ideas. Yeah, I mean and reasonable ideas across the board and
*  When in terms of many things not just universal basic income, which was the thing that he was most popular for but but even law enforcement
*  He's got some great ideas about a lot of things. He thinks outside the box a brilliant guy open to anything
*  Yes, I'm sorry reasonable. So I would suggest one
*  last part of the plan
*  Right, which is that we Americans have to get over the idea that when somebody runs for office
*  Especially the office of the president that the right reaction is to ask them a million questions about what they will do
*  In office what policies they advocate. This is absurd presidents don't make policy
*  They certainly influence what policy is made
*  but the important thing about a president is that they listen to the right sorts of people and that they have a mind capable of
*  Processing what they hear so that they can
*  Integrate the information necessary and in the case of this plan we're talking about two people who would do that as a team
*  So what I would really be interested in as they are running against
*  Trump and Biden is hearing who it is that they would bring into an administration
*  how would they make decisions about the things that matter to us and
*  Figuring out who they would bring in I think is bound to be far more informative
*  Than dogging them about you know what they're gonna do about health care and how they're gonna pay for it
*  The thing about asking someone what they're gonna do though is
*  It does influence people whether or not they're willing to vote for that person. They want to see a plan
*  I know what you're saying is a reasonable person who understands the system
*  But for the average American they do want to see a plan to how to get out of a lot of the messes that we see
*  Well, you know the funny thing is we think a lot of things are true about what people want
*  for one thing we've been told that people are stupid and that you know, they're hopeless and
*  If you know, I mean you're really
*  One of the earliest innovators here
*  You have found that people that we've been told have an attention span so short that they can only deal with a sitcom
*  Are interested in a three-hour conversation about complex topics with people from all over the map, right?
*  People are ready to listen and what I'm trying to say is
*  We have a wrong idea
*  Right in our in our sense of what elections are and really that wrong idea isn't even about the fact that we think
*  We want to hear the plan
*  It's about the fact that we know that our power in the system is so limited that the only way we could possibly
*  Exert any influence on the policy that gets made is if we can get somebody to promise us something into a camera enough that they're embarrassed
*  Not to do it when they get an office and we also know that doesn't work, right?
*  So in the office they just do whatever they're gonna do in the right place
*  So my point would be look I will I will literally vote for any
*  competent courageous patriot
*  I actually don't care in what direction they're ruling
*  Yes
*  I would prefer that they were progressive because I believe we need to make progress or we will perish but any
*  Courageous capable patriot is good enough because a courageous capable patriot will do way better than we are doing with the current method
*  Yeah, and I'm seeing this one thing that I keep hearing over and over again from people on the left that really disturbs me
*  It's this concession that what you're voting for is the cabinet you're voting for the the you know
*  You're the Supreme Court you're voting for
*  Someone who's not gonna reverse Roe versus Wade. That's what I keep hearing from my friends on the left and
*  You know, they've basically just they just made this concession in their head like hey, you know
*  This is what I'm voting for now
*  They've given up and the news media on the left has completely ignored all of these
*  Biden speeches that clearly show some sort of cognitive decline
*  In fact, I've actually like David Pakman who I respect a lot
*  He was kind of arguing against it that it didn't that it didn't show his decline
*  And I was I was trying to look at it in a way that it made sense
*  Trying to be rational about him like, okay, maybe he's just exhausted or maybe this or maybe it's pressure
*  You know, sometimes people get really tongue-tied and panic under pressure and words come out all fucked up that that is possible
*  But there's a trend and if you go back to when he was a younger man that trend didn't exist
*  it's you're seeing it you're seeing a change and the idea that as you get older you
*  Become less comfortable with the media
*  Less comfortable with speaking publicly that doesn't jive with me, right? That doesn't make any sense
*  So like I agree with you. I see a decline but irrespective of what that is
*  Joe Biden is an influence peddler. Yes. He is not an idea guy, right? He's
*  the same idea as Hillary Clinton in a different
*  Morphology who cares? This is not an answer to any known question
*  This is stay the course at a moment when we could not afford to stay the course less, right so
*  Look
*  How dare the Democratic Party do this to us again at this moment?
*  Well, they did it to us before this moment happened. That's the thing
*  They did it to us before covid they did it to us before the looting and before the demonstration
*  It was this moment these things were they thought it was gonna happen the way it happened
*  I thought they when they if I thought that I feel like they felt that if they got Joe Biden in there if none of
*  This stuff had happened. You would just be dealing with one
*  Solution to the problem that is Donald Trump, right?
*  But even if we are if we bend over backwards to be generous to the Democratic Party
*  Yes
*  It did this in a moment when we didn't know that covid-19 was going to spread right and we didn't know that there was going to be
*  Massive riots in the streets over who knows how many cities
*  We did we should have known that this was building
*  Right. The possibility of a pandemic was always on the table the fact that we have a pandemic and that that makes it clear
*  Well, why we need a cogent leader. It was obvious that this could happen under any presidency
*  Yeah, but there's a lot of other things again. It's hard to say that the possibility of a pandemic is on the table
*  So we should have been prepared for it
*  I mean the possibility of an asteroid all impacts on the table the possibility of a solar flare that wipes out the power grid
*  Always on the table. Yeah, but you're making my point
*  My point is you can never afford to have somebody who isn't a courageous capable patriot in that office
*  How dare they play games with this thing?
*  It's not theirs to screw up right and this also was highlighted the problem of Donald Trump's ego
*  Yeah, you know, I mean people would say his egos
*  Yeah, he's got an ego problem, but look he's getting the job done
*  He's doing great things but then in the face of this pandemic
*  When he's being criticized like almost to the point where he can't handle it anymore
*  You know like some people can run at a pace of five miles an hour
*  But when you force them to run at a pace of seven miles an hour things get slippery
*  You know, you start you start feeling cramps you start looking for a way out and he's right now about nine miles an hour
*  And it's not looking good. Nothing. Nothing's I mean, he's tweeting about
*  Not falling down a ramp and why were you walking like that?
*  He's all the fake news media does why was this a slippery ramp and I'm not gonna give them a ring
*  Like what the fuck are you even paying attention to?
*  Yeah, the fact that your ego is so fragile you're paying attention to criticisms the way you walk down a slippery ramp
*  Like they would have ignored that it would have been a non-issue
*  But it's an issue that you your ego is so fragile
*  That you have to address the fact that they're criticizing the way you walk down a ramp with fucking slippery dress
*  Shoes on those shoes suck
*  I never wear them if you wear those I went to a cowboy boot store the other day and I was like
*  What can you do with these bottoms?
*  Like I'm thinking if you got to get away from something some shits going down
*  You can't run with these fucking things on another for dancing so you can yeah these slip around with that
*  But that's what dress shoes are. Yeah, they wear those leather sole dress shoes that slip like crazy
*  There's no tread on them. They're nonsense. That's what that guy's wearing
*  Well, not a ramp well and you know nice pair of Adidas with some good traction
*  I agree. I always wear practical shoes because you never know when you're gonna run shit goes down exactly. Yeah, exactly
*  So say eat the ego is you know it highlights what it gets it gets really magnet
*  Well, you find the weaknesses in the system when the system gets tested and now it's being tested
*  Across the board across the board and that insecurity
*  Believe me our enemies know it's there. Oh for sure know how to exploit it. Yeah, so
*  Enough games. Yeah, we have to escape this and you know to my
*  Friends who are still believers in the Democratic Party at some point of which I have many
*  If you hate Trump right if that's really your cause and you're not gonna be able to see clearly anything until
*  We are we have removed him from office
*  That is also on the Democratic bill
*  Hillary Clinton advanced Trump's candidacy because she wanted to run against him
*  So if you if you have Trump derangement syndrome, you still have to be angry at the Democratic Party for putting us in this predicament
*  Yeah, she legitimately thought he'd be the easiest to beat so she wanted him to run. She thought she was gonna humiliate him
*  She severely underestimated
*  People that were upset at the current system and that his rhetoric this idea of draining the swamp would actually resonate with so many people and also that
*  People look at things in a very two-dimensional way, you know
*  They're not looking at it in this really complex nuanced way and if you can paint a couple of good
*  Slogans together build that wall make America great again
*  All that kind of shit that that is like that's a brilliant way of manipulating people because that's the stuff they remember and he's a master
*  Sleepy Joe Briden crazy Hillary Clinton lying Hillary, you know, he
*  Crazy Ted lying Ted. He has all these nicknames for people. I don't even remember most of them
*  But there's some brilliance in it. Oh, he's he is a he is a political genius. Yes. Yes. Well a manipulative
*  Genius in the sense that he understands how to use the media because he's been in it forever
*  These fucking people have been in it in this Bush League way
*  Like you don't even know what it's like they have a real master communicator in that role
*  have you had someone that was a master public speaker in that role really knew how to give a
*  blistering takedown of someone like Trump or someone like Biden easy easy easy
*  Both those guys. Yeah, they're vulnerable as fuck
*  They are and let's get him the hell out of there as you point out and you are dead right about this
*  If ever there was a moment, this would be it. Yeah, this would be the moment
*  But do you think that you can get that guy to run
*  We have to draft him. It's a matter of duty and I see doing right now
*  I don't know
*  I think I think he may have retired after he left the
*  The chancellor position probably right now digging a bunk or somewhere outside of Waco fuck this place
*  But you know, I mean look the way the way you would draft somebody like that is you would let them know that we'd have
*  Their back. Mm-hmm, right? Yeah, we they would earn our loyalty and they would have to have it
*  But if they did then it's the perfect moment do you think there's enough time here?
*  We are in the middle of June was it the 16th 15th was today
*  16th of June
*  July August September October November five months actually the world we could be
*  You know, we could be speaking Chinese in five months
*  You ain't kidding
*  look
*  the thing about 2020 the thing about 2020 is I don't
*  You can make an argument about what's possible
*  2020 is not the year to make such an argument and because it threw all the fucking
*  Wrenches into the gear every wrench all the sand into the oil into the eyes. Yeah, it's fucking crazy
*  I'm going stark raving sane
*  Mmm. Yeah me too. Yeah, I think so you want to talk about kovat. I do what are your what are your thoughts?
*  What are your thoughts on the lockdown? Yeah
*  Well, let's put it this way. I'm
*  Not speaking in a vacuum here. I've heard a certain amount of your take and
*  My take is a bit different. I
*  Am very concerned about
*  SARS-CoV-2 I am not concerned about it because it is as lethal as we feared
*  It might be it isn't as lethal as we feared it might be but I'm afraid of it for other reasons
*  One it is brand new to us evolutionarily it just showed up in human beings and so
*  In my opinion we screwed up the lockdown badly because we went halfway
*  that a very short very intense lockdown could have ended it and that that would have been the smart thing to do and
*  Unfortunately, the political will was not there. But if you're I am looking at New Zealand with utter envy
*  Imagine at this moment being free of SARS-CoV-2. Yeah, they nailed it, but they also have so few people
*  Oh, they definitely had it easier. But the point is they did prove it was possible. Yes. So in my opinion we should have
*  locked down severely for six weeks or something along those lines and we should have driven it to extinction and
*  The problem is that that runs a foul of all kinds of things including civil liberties concerns
*  Which I also hold I hate the idea of a government crackdown in which they're dictating with whom you associate and all of the rest
*  right, I hate it as much as anyone but
*  We are dealing with a brand new landscape when it comes to a global pandemic and what's more we are dealing with a virus
*  That I think is not what we have been told it is also
*  so I have
*  Initially, I thought that this was a bat-borne virus that had been transmitted to people
*  From the wild probably through the bush meat trade probably through the seafood market in Wuhan
*  In fact, Heather and I were in the Amazon where we had no
*  connectivity to anything for a couple weeks and when we came out
*  What was then called novel coronavirus was just beginning to be discussed and it so we became aware of it as we came out
*  I was like, oh, what the heck is that? Huh? And
*  I looked into it and immediately I saw the story adds up, you know
*  It's a coronavirus of a kind that's known to circulate in bats. There's a seafood market and I thought okay
*  I know what the story is and I tweeted
*  I don't know enough about the story yet
*  But looks to me like the Wuhan on seafood market is the source that the virus comes from bats and we have to talk
*  about the bush meat trade, which has always been a terrible idea and
*  Immediately people tweeted back at me
*  So you think it's just a coincidence that there's a biosafety lab level four in Wuhan where this started and I thought what?
*  That's a heck of a coincidence
*  And so I started to look into it. I retracted the tweet
*  I said, maybe I don't know enough about the story yet
*  and I started to look into it and I went down the rabbit hole because as much as we have been assured by a
*  Huge range of experts that this has to have been a bat-borne coronavirus
*  transmitted to people
*  Possibly through pangolins maybe through some intermediate hosts that we don't yet know
*  that story looks less and less likely and
*  the story that is looking more and more likely what I would call the lab leak hypothesis is looking ever stronger and
*  Anyway, I've been in contact with other people who have reached that conclusion. We have faced all kinds of pushback
*  but in a sense
*  Again, we still don't know it is possible that this came from the wild without human meddling but the
*  the virus itself
*  has several components that suggest that it is actually the result of manipulation in the lab and that it escaped probably from
*  Wuhan Institute of Virology, but there's another lab in Wuhan
*  It
*  It may well have escaped and we may be dealing with consequences are the of the
*  The fact that it was manipulated in a lab. So one of the techniques that labs who study viruses like this
*  Use something so the research is called gain of function research
*  Gain of function research means you are taking a virus and you are adding a capacity to it in order to study
*  How it works and then one of the things that is done to study how it works is something called
*  Passaging where a virus is infected and a creature is infected with the virus and then
*  The virus is allowed to pass between individuals of that species
*  It can also be done in tissues and cellular tissues
*  Where tissues are infected and the virus is allowed to spread from one cell to the next and what happens is evolution?
*  so
*  There's a strong possibility that this virus was under study
*  That it was enhanced in the laboratory and that we are dealing with
*  Consequences that are the result of that enhancement that make it more dangerous than it would otherwise be
*  What do you believe those enhancements are well, so the enhancements are one of the enhancements there is a
*  Something called a foreign site a firm site in the genome of this virus
*  Furren sites are not known. It doesn't mean they don't exist, but they're not known from other beta corona viruses
*  And this firm site is conspicuous
*  It's conspicuous in that it is in the genome as an insert rather than mutations of nucleotides that were there
*  It's like somebody spliced it in that's one thing which could happen naturally
*  But it may well not have and it has a flanking sequence
*  Which has this is probably going to be hard for people to follow but
*  nucleotides that is DNA code for
*  Proteins which are made out of amino acids
*  There's an amino acid called arginine and there are two arginines coded for in the genome of this virus, but
*  Because there are so many possible codes triplet codes and
*  Only 20 or so amino acids there's redundancy
*  and so which code is used to trigger the production of an or the the inclusion of an arginine is
*  Variable and the two arginines are coded for in a way that is not seen in in nature in this way very frequently
*  so
*  Let's just say there are elements of the genome that are
*  Conspicuous and suggest possible laboratory manipulation
*  The fur in sight that I referred to that has been inserted either by a natural process or by a laboratory process
*  greatly increases the
*  Transmissibility of this virus which means various things it could be the explanation for why this virus is
*  Infecting so many different tissues in people who get sick
*  Right the list of symptoms is huge here
*  And that's a very troubling thing from the point of view of treating it medically is all of the things that can go wrong
*  What the body once you're infected?
*  it also means that the virus is very good at jumping between people and
*  that
*  High transmissibility is obviously one of the things that makes
*  COVID-19 such a difficult pandemic to control right? It's hopping between people so readily that
*  It just it runs away
*  so in any case and then there's a third question that I have which is maybe that there's something about the
*  Fact I don't want to say fact as if it is a fact, but if this was an escape from the laboratory
*  Then the virus I mean just as you know, maybe we'll end up talking about the telomere problem in mice
*  Which you spoke to Eric about and he was on your podcast last but
*  Evolution to the lab evolution in the lab takes place and changes that the people in charge
*  Want to happen occur and then things they're not even thinking about occur. There's adaptation to the laboratory environment
*  the people who work in labs are unaware of and so one of the questions I have is
*  This virus is highly transmissible unless you're outdoors then it seems almost not transmissible
*  That's a very conspicuous. I mean for one thing bats live outdoors, right?
*  hmm, so
*  Is it possible that this virus has adapted?
*  to the laboratory environment an indoor environment and that it has forgotten how to get transmitted outdoors and if we are casual about the
*  Outdoor environment that actually it could relearn that trick that we should take it we a we need to be outdoors for various reasons one
*  It appears that vitamin D is very
*  Protective in the case of kovat 19 prevents the transmission and you end up way less sick if you have proper vitamin D
*  So in the northern hemisphere here while the Sun is shining we should be outdoors. We should not be locking down those environments at all
*  We should also be very careful outdoors, right because anytime we allow it to be transmitted outdoors
*  That is going to it creates a evolutionary
*  Signal a selective signal that's going to retrain the virus to be transmitted outdoors
*  Which is not something we want at the moment
*  This might be an advantage that we have and we're gonna lose it if we're not careful, which is why
*  I'm very careful and why I wear this thing
*  Around so that you know, I can pull it up at a moment's notice if I'm going to talk to somebody
*  Because even though I think the virus is very difficult to transmit outdoors, which is something we've seen in the data of South Korea
*  for example
*  It could learn that trick and why is it easier for it to turn do we know why I don't know indoors
*  We don't know so we don't know the mechanism and there's no good reason that we don't know
*  We should know because it could be that it's UV light UV light is very
*  Powerful destructive stuff, but if it's UV light then that suggests
*  It's difficult to transmit outdoors during the day and it should be easy to transmit outdoors at night. It's not UV light
*  Then that's not likely to be it
*  So there is something weird going on with viral load
*  Maybe it's not weird
*  But it's it's weird for those of us who learned how viruses work from the the usual textbook
*  Diagrams where a virus gets into a cell and triggers an infection
*  But here it seems like if you talk to someone briefly your chances of picking it up from them
*  Even if they're sick is pretty low
*  But if you talk to somebody for an extended period of time where you're constantly breathing air that they're exhaling
*  Then your chances go up up up and up and
*  That's so there's a possibility that just the exposure to UV light as people are even if they're outside
*  Talking for the same amount of time just the fact that these particles are going through the air in the sunlight that it
*  Kills the viruses ability to transmit. It's possible. I don't know that
*  When you think about things like you know what a stereo pen is
*  Oh like a UV like it. Yeah, it's a UV wand the backpackers use they can drink creek water. Yep
*  It's crazy if you ever seen when it's not doesn't even take that long
*  Yeah, you take this wand you put it in like a bottle water bottle and you spin it around in this creek water
*  And it kills all the bad stuff totally and it's weird man. It's weird the light can do that
*  Oh my goodness. Well, the UV light is amazing stuff. Yes
*  You know what happened when Trump said something about getting UV light into the body
*  Well, there was an actual publicly traded biotech company that had an
*  invention for when people are intubated taking this this tube with UV light and in
*  Inserting it into the lungs of these people and they were actually pulled off of Twitter
*  Twitter actually banned their account because they thought there was some wacky Trump supporter who was trying to substantiate
*  The president the president just got lucky
*  Yeah, he's basically maybe we get the light and put it in the body somehow
*  Disinfect the cleansing you remind me of Sarah Cooper when you do he was he was on to something though in a weird way that this
*  publicly traded biotech company had an idea that when people they are on an incubator when they have been intubated when they they are on
*  This ventilator this tube will go down the same tube that the air is coming through
*  Yeah, and actually flood the lungs where they're infected with COVID-19 with UV light and kill it
*  Well, the thing is I don't think he got lucky
*  I think he did something that he's routinely doing which isn't very high quality in terms of leadership, but
*  Somehow he's getting briefings. He's tuned into some channels. There was discussion
*  I remember seeing it there was discussion about how UV light might be used to treat a COVID-19
*  Infection and I was actually alerted by this discussion to the fact that there was apparently a lot of work on this technique
*  Previously that actually UV light had been successful used in various ways
*  where it could be used to
*  Purify blood and things and I was sort of surprised to discover and then I heard the president say this
*  I thought that that's what he was talking about. My guess is something crossed his feed
*  Somebody in a briefing said well, mr. President
*  There is a promising theory promising therapy blah blah blah blah blah UV light blah blah blah blah blah
*  and he just walks out the door and riffs on it, which is why Sarah Cooper is so funny because basically she exposes the
*  I don't know who Sarah Cooper. Oh, you know, maybe I do you've probably seen her she's um
*  Making these videos where she lip-syncs Trump. Oh
*  That's no she's not the one who did the thing where was it a
*  Dr. Fakenstein or the faking put Trump's face on a baby. Have you ever seen that one? No, I haven't seen that one
*  Oh, that one's wonderful. Are you telling me best ones ever you haven't run into Sarah Cooper. I may have I've seen so many people mock him
*  It's so hard to keep track of who's who okay, but there she is. Yep. Let's give you some volume on that
*  more for the black community than any other president and let's take a pass on Abraham Lincoln because
*  He did good, although it's always questionable, you know, in other words the end result we are free. Mr. President, but we
*  Take a pass on a honest Abe as we call it you say you in general that is the dumbest fucking thing a person's ever said
*  Has been an office well that maybe he's done more than maybe Abe Lincoln who freed the slaves
*  He's giving Abe Lincoln a pass cuz he did pretty good. How crazy is that? It's crazy, right?
*  It's just like he's stuck
*  He said something and then he gets stuck trying to substantiate what he said
*  He should have said except for obviously Abe Lincoln who sleep freed the slaves and everyone would have been like yeah, okay
*  It's braggadocious, but perhaps reasonable. It's wrong and stupid, but at least it's not crazy. It's not absolutely fucking insane
*  Yeah, and then the fact that he's saying it to a black woman's like, oh my god. Yeah. Well he
*  So that's the thing is he's winging it. He's winging it. We can't she's doing she's just lip-syncing
*  Well, unfortunately, I don't know whether the audience saw it in sync or not find the baby one
*  The baby one's amazing. If you don't have it, I could I could airdrop it to you the baby one
*  You need to say okay. I guess it's fucking amazing. All right somebody it was either the faking or dr
*  Fakenstein do you know who was Jamie do you remember one of those fake artists who takes you know?
*  They use the face swap technology and they put Trump's face on this baby and then they changed the words
*  It's someone caught a baby doing something and they talked to the baby and the baby was trying to lie and get their way out
*  Of it. It's like an old video, but then they put Trump's face on it, and then they changed here go ahead
*  This the original baby
*  You touched you food
*  You touched you food
*  It's adorable
*  So now president you said the virus was just like the flu
*  You did you also said the virus could go away by April
*  You said it would disappear like a miracle
*  If you find it folks anybody who's listening to this you should see it because it's really disturbing seeing a
*  Baby with Trump's face. It almost looks like Sam Kinnison as a baby
*  Anyway anyway, which brings us back to McRaven and Yang and the dark horse, but still the kovat stuff. Yeah, we have really getting um
*  Yeah, so
*  What I would say is first of all I do think I am very much in favor still
*  Driving this thing to extinction by being properly sober about it briefly. Can I
*  pause and address this one issue that seems to be sure when
*  It seems to be an issue when someone says that it might have come out of a lab
*  This is a right-wing left-wing thing for whatever reason you get labeled a right-wing
*  conspiracy theorist if you think it came out of a lab and you
*  People on the left are so
*  They're so willing to dismiss that without any real evidence for we've been poisoned by these
*  These ideologies when it comes to conspiracy or whether or not something is actually true
*  But we've been fed the wrong information
*  That stuff is if you don't believe the official narrative that's being discussed on CNN
*  You must be some sort of a right-wing nut right and
*  Right and
*  Have you faced that? Oh, of course. I faced it and I'm it's hard to escape it, right?
*  So I've tried to be very careful. I have described it as a hypothesis, which is what it is
*  I have tried to show that there are different probabilities for the different origin hypothesis
*  Even China now admits that it wasn't from the seafood market. Do they? Oh, yeah, what do they say? It's from well
*  Don't they say it's from us? I
*  Have not heard that I have but they
*  Let's put it this way there are
*  One of the things that is in my opinion the strongest piece of evidence that there that the lab leak
*  Hypothesis may be correct is that there is a missing phase in the evolution of this virus
*  When a virus jumps from one species to another it is not well positioned
*  It is typically very poor at its job because it doesn't have any evolutionary experience with that host
*  So it's not good at leaping between that host cells
*  Which means that it's always in very small numbers and it's not good at leaping from one individual to the next
*  That's the key question
*  When something leaps into a new species and then it becomes a pandemic it's because it has solved that second problem
*  It has figured out how to infect that creature in such a way that the creature spreads it to others of its kind
*  There is no evidence in the case of this virus that that happened
*  it showed up in Wuhan and
*  Spread immediately it became a pandemic it already had experience
*  now
*  How it got that experience? We don't know there are evolutionary ways. This could have happened, right?
*  It could be that we have not found the initial population that it circulated in
*  Right or it could be that it circulated in a creature that we haven't found either but
*  The fact that there is no evidence that it shows up in Wuhan and immediately spreads
*  tells us that this virus was
*  well adapted to ourselves and well adapted to transmit between individuals and
*  That is conspicuous one way you could get there is if somebody a had added components
*  To a virus in order to make it transmissible to humans
*  So the research in question would be research that was interested in discovering
*  What a pandemic in humans of a bat-borne coronavirus would be like so that we could do something about it
*  Maybe we could prevent it. Maybe we could create a vaccine ahead of time. But if you're creating a
*  virus that has enhanced capacity to infect humans in order to study what will happen if a virus ever escapes into the human population
*  Then you are running the risk that the virus you are studying will escape would they have added something like a fern site?
*  Absolutely, it is established in the literature that the addition of a fern site makes the virus much more
*  Transmissible in human tissue. So if you were going to study it, this would be high in your list of things to do
*  You could also passage it through human tissue in order to effectively train it on
*  The infectious pathway inside of people which again we might be suffering the downstream consequences of that if it escaped
*  the Wuhan Institute of Virology
*  so
*  These things have an amazing impact and I hear a lot that what does it matter? It's with us now
*  We just have to deal with it, which is nonsense because a we need to have it never happen again
*  B there may be things that we could understand about what its nature is that would help us fight it
*  But C we have a really serious problem now because all but a few of the world's leading
*  Virologists the experts in
*  Coronaviruses in particular have sworn that this must have come from nature and couldn't have come from the lab, which is nonsense
*  Why do you think they did that?
*  Unfortunately, this goes back to
*  Our earlier discussion our scientific system is broken
*  Our scientific system is broken
*  we need our scientists to be empowered to tell us what we need to know and
*  We need them therefore to be freed from a system where they are
*  Fighting for grant money in order to continue their work
*  This entire group of people is now in jeopardy because if this turns out to have been a leak from the lab
*  Then we are all suddenly going to become aware that gain of function research puts humanity in jeopardy
*  That one accident in gain of function research can cause the evaporation of who knows how many trillion dollars
*  it could cause and this is one of the other things I wanted to say to you about the danger of
*  Letting this virus run its course
*  If we don't stamp it out
*  We a don't know that people who have been infected are not going to continue to have
*  Outbreaks we don't know that yet
*  We don't know whether or not people who've had it are going to be immune to it in the future that's probable
*  but it's not certain and
*  we don't know that it's not going to become a
*  permanent fellow traveler of humanity the way flu is and
*  even if this thing evolved to become flu like if it became as
*  Unserious as the flu the flu is very serious and
*  The cost that humanity pays for having flu circulate every year is immense
*  So even if the only thing that has happened in the long term if we let it go and it evolved into another flu like
*  Pathogen then we have
*  Increased the number of flu like pathogens that we have to deal with annually
*  Substantially and that would be a major loss to humans. So
*  My sense that we should be much more aggressive about dealing with this is really about the fact that I think we have a
*  short time horizon in which to deal with it that it will learn new tricks and it will become harder to defeat the longer that
*  we
*  Play around with it. And so an aggressive short-term move. It's really
*  You know, it's the lesson of pulling off the band-aid
*  We're not doing ourselves any favors by pulling it off slowly
*  What do you think we should do right now?
*  Well, I would say I mean the problem is this a much harder argument to make now than it was at the beginning because we're
*  All so frickin sick of lockdown. I mean Portland is still under full lockdown
*  But not when it comes to protests, well, of course not that's the other problem, right?
*  There's a massive hypocrisy in the way we we're treating businesses versus treating protests
*  It's an epidemic of hypocrisy
*  Not only that the Blasio in New York City won't allow people when they're asking people that have tested positive for COVID-19
*  You're not allowed to ask them whether or not they've been in a protest
*  So they're doing contact tracing without valuable data because they they want to be progressive
*  That's insane. Oh, he's insane. Yes
*  So you asked me what I would do I would and again, I don't want to be in this position
*  You know months in here I want to be in this position months ago
*  Of saying the right thing to do is a six-week lockdown that will be unbearably painful
*  But hopefully it'll be short and then intense contact tracing
*  But we've done a lockdown with essential businesses open. Well, we've done
*  That's not a real lock. We've done a half-assed lockdown and the thing that we've done that I find the most
*  Troubling is that we have not
*  Bootstrapped a mechanism for
*  High quality ubiquitous testing because if you want to do if you did a six-week lockdown a
*  real lockdown right hold your breath and get through it and
*  Then you open back up with testing that's so high quality and so universal
*  That you can spot anything that happens and you can treat it locally, right?
*  You don't come into work if you don't pass this test and if your work puts you in contact with other people were going
*  To test you regularly, right?
*  If you did that we could have driven it to very low levels and then we could have dealt with the flare-ups
*  but what we're doing now is we're just gambling and
*  It's insane, right? We're gambling and
*  There is no
*  That I can detect there is no
*  movement that says open back up and
*  Be very aggressive about things like masks my feelings if you're pushing open back up
*  You ought to be pushing things that would make opening back up as safe as possible
*  But our masks really effective because one of the things that the CDC was saying was that you should really only wear a mask if you're
*  Treating a person with kovat. Yes, except that we can effectively know that what they were really
*  I don't even want to give them credit for really saying it the motivation for saying that nonsense
*  Was that they were trying to preserve masks for people who needed it most as what Fauci said
*  So they basically lied to us. They lied to us flat-out which some of some of us were not some of us were shouting and
*  Saying this is garbage advice. Yeah, and you know your question is do mass really work
*  Masks work when both parties wear them they work really well
*  so
*  you know and I don't know why we are pushing this madness of
*  Masks that scream medical right? So one of the things you know bank robber
*  Yeah, man, you're an old-school bank robber. I'm the mojito bandita. Yeah, you've got a bandana
*  I do yeah, but you know the fact is the bandana. All right, maybe I look like a goofball
*  But the fact is it's more fashionable in my opinion than a medical. Oh, you mean fashionable. That's cute
*  It's also more comfortable though, yes, so the fact is I have it I can pull it up as needed put it down
*  it's not hanging on my ear and
*  That flexibility the fact that I don't feel so terrible walking around with it actually makes me use it when I should use it
*  The best is really a neck gaiter. Have you ever used a neck gaiter? Mm-hmm
*  Yeah, you wear them when you're hunting you're you want to obscure a lot of your face, you know, so animals can't see it
*  It's all camouflage. It breaks up the pattern of your face
*  It really is you just slip it back down again and pull it back up and it actually stays in place
*  That makes total sense. But yeah, I mean the funny thing is I'm an animal biologist
*  So the same thing should apply to me, but I've never heard that never heard of a neck gaiter
*  No, I've heard of a neck gaiter for other things but not for hunting. Oh, yeah. Oh super common. Yeah
*  Pull up. There's a photo of me in
*  Linai wearing a full Sitka outfit. I look like a ninja
*  Linai is a very interesting place to hunt because it's one of the few places where you could say it's
*  Mandatory to hunt animals because they have an invasive species called axis deer. That's me. See that thing on my face
*  That's a neck gaiter and it's actually in the Sitka the the hunting gear that I'm wearing
*  It's actually built into the hood
*  So and it's not just something that you wear around your neck
*  It actually is built into it so it slides up and it goes down on your neck if you like it to but then when you're
*  Moving forward it could slide down these animals that live there. There's literally
*  30,000 deer on an island of 3,000 people and
*  there it's an invasive species they were brought there and given to King Kamehameha by the
*  By India in like the 1800s and there's no predator so they're just out of control
*  You've never seen anything like it is crazy when you're there like the mass
*  Populations and it happens to be one of the most insanely delicious animals as well
*  Also super switched on because they evolved to avoid tigers
*  So I've got videos of these things where an arrow is coming at them from 80 yards and as the arrow is about
*  You know 15 yards away. They hear it and they're get out of the way
*  They move so fast like they are the fastest deer I've ever encountered in my life by far
*  like nothing's even close to them and
*  You know you you have to be sneaky to get close to these things that's why you dress like that
*  That's cool in some sense. So actually can I connect that to the the viral question? Sure. Okay
*  So the connection is gonna be a weird one
*  There is only one
*  terrestrial mammal
*  natively in Hawaii
*  There's only one terrestrial mammal species
*  Okay, there's aquatic there's whales and things but and seals but there's a there's only one terrestrial mammal
*  I'm trying to guess what that would be. Yeah a
*  Mammal terrestrial mammal. Well terrestrial may be misleading here. I just mean on land. Oh seal. Nope
*  No, well, they're seals, but that's that's an aquatic mammal. Okay
*  It's a bat. Oh
*  Right. So here's the thing Hawaii is as remote from mainland as anywhere. Yeah, it's really isolated. Yeah and
*  That means that the story of how a terrestrial mammal gets there
*  is pretty rare because
*  Think about the condition how would almost any terrestrial mammal you can think of get there
*  So at some point some pregnant bat
*  Probably got blown off course by a storm and probably barely
*  Crawled up on the beach, you know, you know, so they flew thousands of miles
*  Well, my guess is it almost never happens but it did happen once with this bat
*  But anyway, my point would be Hawaii is a tropical
*  landmass
*  You would think it would have high diversity because it's tropical right tropical places tend to have very high diversity
*  Hawaii has very low diversity because it's so far from everywhere, right?
*  So the thing is almost nothing can make it over the gap
*  That big saltwater gap is very hard for anything to cross
*  So what that means is that everything that's in Hawaii is very well adapted for things like crossing
*  Huge gaps and not very well adapted for everything that would compete with that capacity
*  so that sets Hawaii up for being
*  Invaded by any creature that you transport there if you can solve the how do you jump the gap question by transporting on a
*  airplane or a ship then the
*  Species that are there are not in a position to fend it off competitively because they're not adapted to compete
*  It's a low diversity environment where everything had to cross some amazing gap to get there
*  So it's a sitting duck for invasive species like the one you're describing
*  Okay. Now, here's the connection to the viruses
*  If it is true that this virus originally came from a bat was being studied
*  Probably the Wuhan Institute of Virology
*  Was enhanced and then escaped was enhanced for the infection of human tissue and then escaped
*  It is the equivalent of us having transported something very dangerous over a gap
*  It couldn't have crossed on its own
*  Right, and we are sitting ducks for this thing
*  So this is why I'm really
*  On high alert about this now
*  What are your feelings when it comes to the high number of people that are asymptomatic?
*  Or the high number of people that get it and it's
*  very small
*  Deal to them. They just cough for a couple days and that's no big deal. Yes
*  Well, so I've been advocating from the start that we should be much more aggressive in the way
*  we are studying this that in fact
*  you remember the
*  Aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt had an outbreak and it docked in Guam
*  My thought was I want to see that carrier
*  Used to study the virus
*  It's too bad that it docked in Guam because they ruined a circumstance and it's not that I wanted to see people infected
*  And it's not that I didn't I wanted to see them get the highest quality treatment possible
*  But it was an isolated population in which you could have studied
*  The spread of this virus and because it's an aircraft carrier you could also get anything you needed you could have built
*  Hospitals on the deck you could have given them the finest possible care and we could have learned a lot
*  About how the thing is transmitted what the symptoms mean who is actually shedding live virus based on what symptoms they have rather than studying this
*  haphazardly amongst infected people in hospitals where you don't really know who they've been in contact with and all of that
*  So we missed that opportunity. We could do the same thing with military bases
*  Or any isolated population where you can actually have enough data to know what these things mean as it is
*  We're left with all kinds of questions, right?
*  It seems that some of the people who are asymptomatic
*  Actually have significant damage to their lungs
*  They have this ground glass opacity pattern in their lungs, even though they didn't show any symptoms. What are the numbers of these people?
*  Well, it's been at least a month since I've seen anything on it
*  But it was a fairly high percentage. It was like 30 or 40 percent
*  I think of the asymptomatic people so all I can say is that makes no sense to me, right?
*  You're talking about significant damage to the lungs. It seems like that would in and of itself cause a symptom
*  Yeah, I think the people to study would be those NBA athletes
*  Because a large number of the NBA players attested positive from at least Jamie you would know better than me
*  Was it one particular team where these athletes were?
*  For two or four guys on that team two or four guys on the team
*  16 and they were all asymptomatic. I don't think anybody got really sick that I've heard of. Yeah
*  I would like them to be studied because they're peak physical specimens, you know, the professional athletes and it's such a
*  cardiovascular
*  Sport, you know, you're constantly sprinting and moving and you have to be in tremendous shape to play
*  Professional basketball at the highest level I would think I would want to know what's going on with their lungs
*  Yeah, what is it like when you get an elite athlete and you give them this disease and why are they?
*  Asymptomatic is it a function of their cardiovascular endurance?
*  I mean is there something about the capacity of their lungs the fact that they're I mean what happens you give that to?
*  David Goggins for instance someone who can run a hundred mile races and and and doing back-to-back, you know
*  Someone who's got extreme cardiovascular fitness like Cameron Haynes or something like that. Sure
*  I want to see that we could learn a lot about what this thing is really up to as it is
*  We're we're grasping at straws. You've got a large list of symptoms. We've got people who seem to be
*  Asymmetric and yet asymptomatic and yet damaged
*  so
*  It's hard to know what to make of it
*  It's also hard to know what to make of the haphazardness of our response to it
*  Yeah, like why are we screwing this up? So badly?
*  Don't you think that we didn't know what it was when it happened and then when it did happen there was a lot of
*  competing information
*  There's China was giving us bad information for for one case the World Health Organization in January was saying that there's no evidence
*  It transmits from person to person. We know that we know now that that's not the case
*  Well, but think about how fucked up our situation is right imagine that you you had some courageous
*  Highly capable Patriots
*  Governing, right? This thing gets detected
*  You call the right people into the room. Okay, you say okay, what would a reasonable person do at this moment?
*  But then we've got a problem, right now you see another part of our system that has
*  Become feeble and inept you see the virologist might circle the wagons in order to protect their access to grant money
*  So the very people who need to tell you holy shit, this could be very dangerous. Here's what may have happened and
*  Here's what we would do to figure out what the epidemiology will look like what the symptomatology will look like those people may be
*  covering their asses at all of our expense, so
*  What I'm really telling you is that yes, we have to deal with kovat 19
*  But we also have to bootstrap our way out of a predicament where our whole system has been overrun by perverse
*  Market incentives that is causing everybody to turn into a liar or a dupe
*  And we can't live that way
*  This is we've got too many high-tech problems to be dealing with anything other than high quality
*  Information about the nature of those problems and what the possible solutions look like but how do we?
*  Mitigate all these errors and all the how do you how do you eliminate all the bullshit that we're dealing with and how do?
*  We filter it out and what would be like the best pure information?
*  Where would it be?
*  Distributed from well the you know this this is weird because it's gonna sound
*  Self-aggrandizing maybe but what's happened is
*  You've had the people who have the right characteristics for
*  This moment pushed out of the system. They've been told to comply with various things
*  They've been forced to play games that corrupt them and those who couldn't do it
*  The ones who will speak the truth even when it hurts them get pushed out in one way or another and so in some sense
*  This is the moment at which we have to figure out where those people went
*  And we have to build a system that pays attention to what they've seen what drove them crazy
*  Okay, and so you know the telomere story is that story writ large
*  Let's tell that story because we discussed it on a podcast with your brother, but a lot of people might not have heard it
*  So let's let's let's talk about what you discovered and what what you mean by this, okay, so
*  I was a graduate student in evolutionary biology. My specialty was actually bats
*  That's what I said. I studied tent-making bats, which was great
*  and by the way, I think the danger of viruses leaping from bats to people is
*  actually less than we are being told that people who are selling the idea that we have to study these viruses with gain-of-function
*  Research are leading us to believe a virus is gonna leap out of a cave at any moment and infect us and the large number of
*  People who study bats regularly and are not catching these diseases suggest that that's not really true
*  Were they the ones that were skeptical about this idea that it came out of this wet market? No
*  I actually haven't heard from them
*  But what I can say is there are thousands of people who study bats who handle them regularly and they're not constantly getting sick
*  So I think what we're learning is that there are a lot of viruses that could potentially jump and could potentially adapt to humans
*  When they do jump they almost never spread. Can I ask you a question before you continue?
*  Sure, because I know it's gonna deviate us off topic
*  Was there there was a story that I read a long time ago
*  and I think I read it in the New York Times and it was a story about these
*  People that were studying bats and they had parked themselves out in front of this gigantic cave to sort of film
*  these bats coming out of the cave and they didn't anticipate that the bats were gonna shit on them and
*  They got insanely sick from some hemorrhagic virus and wound up dying like shortly afterwards
*  You know this story. I don't know this story. I'm now feeling bad about having laughed that they got crapped on by these bad
*  No, I should have I should have warned you that it was a bad story
*  but I remember reading this story that you know, they talked about the
*  Millions and millions of bats that flew out of this can't believe it was in Africa
*  They flew out of this cave and that they shit whenever they fly out and that these people didn't think about this
*  They just wanted to film this thing and they just got covered in
*  Batshit and it got in their eyes it got everywhere and they got a horrible virus from it. It was definitely a virus
*  No, I mean, I don't know. So there's a member that I'm getting really sick and dying shortly afterwards and
*  Them not being able to identify exactly what it was that killed them
*  So let me let me say a couple things on this front one
*  There is a pathogen that people who study bats in caves my bats didn't wrist in caves
*  But people who study bats in caves sometimes get histoplasmosis, which is a fungus. It's a fungus
*  That's also afflicts people in the poultry industry
*  So anyway, that's a danger
*  There are viruses but the story that you're describing
*  Suggests the pattern that I'm suggesting which is that
*  Sometimes things jump
*  they don't tend to spread that jump and spread are two different skills and the chances that something jumps are
*  Relatively small when something jumps it then has to spread it has to accomplish both tricks in order to become a pandemic and
*  The likelihood of it doing both things. Well is pretty low
*  so most of the time it doesn't jump and when it does jump it doesn't tend to spread and it sounds like your
*  Example of these people tragic as it is represents a case in which something jumped but didn't spread
*  Now there is also the the lab leak stuff is
*  extensive but there is
*  One of the pieces of evidence in that story is that there were some minors in Yunnan
*  Who came down with a pneumonia?
*  There was something like six miners who came down with a pneumonia who had worked in a cave that had these horseshoe bats
*  So to the extent that the lab in Wuhan was known to be working on bat coronaviruses
*  For the purpose of preventing a pandemic they were getting their bat coronaviruses
*  from this cave in Yunnan province long way from Wuhan and
*  The cave was identified because these miners had come down with this pneumonia of which I think three of them died
*  So it's again a case in which something jumped but it didn't spread no pandemic arose out of it
*  So what we're looking at is the strong possibility that we were looking to prevent a pandemic at some place where something had jumped
*  but had not spread and then we took viruses from there and imbued them with the characteristics that allowed them to spread solving its second problem, so
*  that's a
*  Frightening story to me it is frightening
*  And is it particularly frightening that it's coming out of China because we're not getting really good information from them because their propaganda so strong
*  Yes, and no
*  The Chinese have not behaved well
*  They have not informed us in the way we need to be informed on the other hand one of the reasons that this is a political
*  football rather than a scientific question is that there is a perception and in fact this perception has been amplified
*  by the president
*  That this is potentially if this leaked from the lab that this is a Chinese problem
*  Yeah, this lab in China was part of an international community of virology researchers
*  The grant that they would have been working from came from the NIH or at least one of them did
*  So this is really if this is a lab leak still not saying it is but that's a strong possibility if this is a lab leak
*  The failure is one of the international scientific community in this particular lab weren't they
*  Didn't they get admonished for something that happened within like the last two years they had gotten
*  safety violations, yes, and there was a
*  2015 paper
*  Concerned about gain-of-function research and the potential for exactly this sort of thing to happen
*  So anyway, there was concern but like so many things I think it hovers outside of most of our awareness
*  So we discover, you know after the Deepwater Horizon accident
*  We discover that we're drilling these really deep deposits that we can't plug a leak when it happens after the financial crisis
*  We discover that we're using leverage in a way that can cause one of these catastrophic economic meltdowns
*  The Aliso Canyon disaster reveals that we're storing, you know
*  Natural gas in these old oil deposits and that it can leak and not be plugged
*  Fukushima reveals to us what we've been doing
*  With nuclear reactors and spent fuel
*  We always find out after the accident that we're engaged in some really dangerous thing now people inside these industries know
*  But they also have a conflict of interest. So nobody warned us
*  Right, and we need to really get ahead of that problem
*  We need to start finding out what it is that we don't realize humanity is doing that's going to go bad on us next
*  Right. Okay back to the mice. Okay
*  So I was a graduate student studying bats in I was in michigan
*  and
*  I was
*  Interested in evolutionary trade-offs. That's my signature thing
*  And there was a very good piece of work from a guy I knew george williams great evolutionary biologist about the evolution of
*  Senescence that is to say the process by which we grow feeble and inefficient with age what most people call aging
*  And basically that's classic paper explained why it is that creatures like us
*  Get old and die
*  and the answer was
*  basically this
*  that you have a
*  Genome that's complex. It's full of genes, but there aren't enough genes to have a gene for every
*  Trait that you have in fact, they're a tiny fraction of the number of genes you would need to cover all of the various characteristics
*  You have so genes always do multiple things
*  And in the case when a gene does something that's very good for you when you're young
*  At some cost when you're old
*  Selection tends to favor it because you may not live long enough to suffer the cost
*  and so if you have the trait that makes you powerful when you're young and you've got
*  Uh some cost that you're going to pay when you're old, but you're not going to live to get it
*  It may be a freebie, right?
*  So selection sees early life much more clearly than it sees late life and it prefers things that help you early
*  Even at a cost of harming you late. That's the basic answer. It's called the antagonistic pliatropy
*  uh theory of senescence
*  But at the point that I started working
*  We knew that this was right. We could tell that the hypothesis was true because it matched all sorts of observations about wild creatures
*  Certain creatures live longer than others even when you correct for things like body size
*  So creatures that fly
*  Live longer than creatures that are of the same type and size that don't fly why because they can fly away from danger
*  If you can fly away from danger
*  You're more likely to make it to an older age the better selection can see the harms that
*  Afflict you when you get there
*  So selection doesn't prefer a bias in favor of youth if you can fly away from danger same thing applies if you're poisonous
*  If you have a shell
*  If you have a really good defense then selection sees your late life better
*  Okay, so we knew that this hypothesis was right
*  But what we had never found at the point that I was working in the very late 90s on this
*  Was a gene that matched the description. We knew that selection was finding these genes
*  And accumulating them, but we had never found one of the genes in question and that was very conspicuous. I called that the missing pliatropy
*  so
*  anyway, I was sort of on alert about this it was a curious fact and
*  um, I
*  Saw a talk given by somebody who was talking about
*  Telomeres and he was talking about telomeres and their relationship to cancer
*  So telomeres are repetitive sequences of dna at the ends of our chromosomes
*  And they grow shorter every time a cell divides
*  right, so it's like a fuse or a counter that ticks down each cell division and it drops to zero and in
*  Uh, or not zero, but it drops to a number that the cell refuses to divide after that
*  And some people were working in one set of labs on the possibility that this was causing us to grow feeble with age
*  Because if your cells can't divide anymore, then they won't replace themselves and your tissues won't be able to maintain
*  right
*  Another group was studying this question of telomeres with relation to cancer and they were saying eureka
*  Every time we look into cancer it has this enzyme called telomerase turned on which elongates telomeres
*  And these two groups were not talking to each other. They were each claiming that they were about to cure their respective disease
*  One group was saying if we can activate telomerase then we can lengthen your life
*  And the other group was saying if we can turn off telomerase we can cure cancer
*  Right, and I put two and two together and I said this is the missing pliatropy
*  Here we have something that is protecting us. It's helping us in youth
*  We have a counter that is limiting the number of times a cell can divide and presumably preventing cancer
*  Right, and the cost is you can't maintain your tissues forever. So you grow feeble and inefficient
*  so
*  That made a hell of a lot of sense to me
*  I couldn't convince anybody else
*  That this was sensible. I couldn't even get them to understand what I was saying because in evolutionary biology there has traditionally been a bias
*  Not in against mechanism the study of cellular biology not because there's anything wrong with studying cellular biology
*  as an evolutionary phenomenon
*  but because
*  Early in the study of evolution, we just didn't have the tools to look into the cells
*  So evolutionary biologists got used to thinking about the form of creatures and the behavior of creatures
*  But not thinking about the internal mechanisms because there just wasn't a lot that could be said
*  Anyway
*  I retained an interest in the cellular biology. I saw these two things that needed to be connected and I started to work on the puzzle
*  It turned out that that hypothesis would answer a great many questions that were otherwise very difficult to answer with respect to how
*  Aging functions, but there was one huge obstacle
*  The obstacle was that a fact that was well known about mice
*  Did not fit with the idea that telomeres were fundamental to the aging process
*  And the fact that was known was that mice had
*  Extremely long telomeres and yet they lived short lives
*  So if it were true that the length of your telomeres dictated how quickly you were going to age
*  then a
*  Tiny creature with very long telomeres ought to be able to replace its tissues really well and it should it should age
*  It should age very very slowly
*  So I thought there's got to be something wrong with this the hypothesis answers too many questions
*  For that obstacle to be real and I thought maybe it's maybe one person has run a test
*  And everybody else is just parroting it
*  And I went and I looked and that wasn't the case
*  and um
*  I finally realized that
*  All of the mice that had been looked at were coming from one source
*  That there was a laboratory in bar harbor, maine called the jacks lab
*  that was the source for all of the mice being used in all of the laboratories in the country and
*  I started to wonder is there something going on at that lab? Maybe mouse telomeres aren't long
*  The ultra long telomeres of mice aren't real. Maybe that's a feature of laboratory mice and wild mice would have short telomeres
*  In which case the hypothesis would make sense
*  and I called up
*  one of the
*  Leading people in the field a woman named carol grider who has now won a nobel prize
*  And I said carol, you don't know me. I'm an evolutionary biology graduate student
*  I have a question for you. Is it possible that
*  All mice don't have long telomeres that that's really just laboratory mice and she said
*  well
*  I think mice have long telomeres
*  But it's interesting if you order mus spritus rather than mus musculus and you order them from europe
*  And how long their telomeres are depends on what supplier you get them from
*  So this is interesting. So anyway, we both agreed that it was really interesting
*  She decided she was going to test the hypothesis. She put her graduate student mike heeman on the case
*  We exchanged some emails
*  And uh, anyway, they tested it and they got some mice that weren't really wild but they were much more recently in captivity and lo and behold
*  They had short telomeres. Okay, so that was an amazing moment
*  My prediction had turned out to be true which meant a that my hypothesis about
*  Sinescence and cancer and aging might well be true. That was important
*  But it also raised a bunch of really difficult problems
*  One was
*  If it is true that all the mice that are being used to study
*  Physiology are broken in this way. Then how are we blinding ourselves?
*  Is it possible that we are using all of these mice that would be terrible models for
*  Wound healing for senescence for cancer for a whole number of things
*  How is it that we are allowing ourselves to take these mice who have been
*  Altered and using them as models for normal physiology
*  And the other problem may be even more serious was that we use these animals in drug safety testing
*  And the way we use them is
*  If you think about if you'd come up with a drug that you thought was useful
*  And you wanted to test whether it was safe to administer it to people
*  You can't really afford to give people a drug and then wait
*  40 50 years to figure out whether you've shortened their lives
*  Right. So at the point that you start testing these things on humans, you're really in the final stage the way we test whether a drug
*  is safe
*  for long term
*  Use or whether it is safe for your long-term life based on short use is we give large doses of it
*  To small animals that live short lives on the assumption that if it's going to shorten
*  Your 80 or 90 year life by 10 or 20 years
*  That it'll shorten a mouse's life long enough to see it
*  But here's the problem
*  If you've altered a mouse
*  In the laboratory environment by favoring the radical elongation of its telomeres
*  Then it has the ability to replace its tissues indefinitely
*  A toxin that will harm you by killing tissue
*  May not harm that mouse. In fact, it may actually help it because these mice are very cancer prone
*  So when we give a toxin that will damage you to a mouse that is highly resistant
*  To tissue damage you may slow down its tumors. And in fact, we've seen this a number of times where
*  A drug is given to mice and we get back the paradoxical result. Not only is it not toxic
*  It actually makes the mice live a little longer
*  right
*  so
*  My contention is that we had a problem where we were testing
*  Drugs to see if they were safe on animals that were predisposed to tell us that they were
*  And then when those drugs were released into the human population, it turned out they were not safe and people died
*  And the problem is I was absolutely unable to alert the world to this problem for reasons that
*  Still elude me. I published my paper. I went through I don't think we need to bore your audience
*  Especially if they've been through eric's description with the details of what happened in the attempt to bring this to public attention
*  but
*  The world of
*  Scientists working on the question
*  was unwilling to respond to the discovery that their model organism had this
*  Fatal flaw that was going to predispose us to see certain things and not other things
*  in the laboratory environment the governmental commission that was
*  Charged with studying the vioxx scandal, which I believe was likely the result of something like this in its 300 page report doesn't mention
*  Mice it doesn't the vioxx scandal, which was a it was a drug for arthritis, correct? Yeah gave people strokes
*  Yeah, it did heart damage. Yeah. And so anyway heart damage is actually probably not heart damage
*  And by that what I mean is if you take a drug a substance that damages tissues in the human body
*  It will show up as heart damage because of the special nature of the heart
*  So let's say that you took some drug that you know
*  Killed every 10,000th cell or every thousandth cell that would be destructive all over your body
*  The heart though is a special tissue. The heart has a very low capacity for self repair at a cellular level
*  Very low for reasons we could go into if you wanted
*  but
*  Because it has a low capacity for self repair
*  It is also very vulnerable to something that does some kind of general tissue damage
*  And it's also an organ that when it fails, it's absolutely conspicuous
*  So you would expect that if we had substances that were body-wide toxins
*  And we released them into the public having tested them on mice and not discovering that they were dangerous that you would see
*  Relatively young people die from heart conditions, which is where we would detect that there's a problem before we would detect it anywhere else
*  Hmm
*  So anyway the the government studied this problem after after viox and it put together a report and the report's 300 pages
*  It doesn't mention mice. It doesn't mention the genus mus. Do you think they did that to protect themselves?
*  Well, what I know is that I attempted to call their attention after the report came out. I
*  Looked at it and you know, it had a physical form, but it also had it lives online
*  You can search it and I could see that telomeres weren't mentioned
*  Mice weren't mentioned rodents aren't mentioned and so I tried to alert them to the fact that they had screwed up and
*  They blew me off. They wouldn't talk to me. So that is
*  it raises a question and
*  I to this day cannot answer the question. I can't even say whether or not so when I've tried to raise this issue
*  I have run into
*  Various kinds of resistance if I raise it with journalists
*  What I get back is typically I get interest back at first and they say okay. I'm very interested in the story
*  I'm gonna pursue it
*  I'm gonna make a few phone calls and then they come back to me and they either they go silent or
*  They say well, I talked to some people and they said it's been taken care of right?
*  Well, I don't know what it's been taken care of means. I published a paper that said
*  Here's a hypothesis about what's going on. Here's my I
*  proposed a mechanism whereby telomere elongation would have happened in the breeding colonies in question and
*  It's been taken care of as a very strange way to describe
*  Something that could be an enormous problem. Well, not only let's say that it was taken care of right?
*  Let's say that they have altered the the breeding protocol and they fixed the problem
*  You still have all those drug tests that they've done for you got all those drug tests you've got all of the papers you've got
*  My paper which proposes a hypothesis and I have a right to say actually it turns out to be correct or it wasn't
*  right, but so anyway, we got back all of these weird answers it's been taken care of or
*  Even more curious is the argument. Well, everybody knows that the mice are bad models
*  Which is insane because this telomere actually got that response. Yeah from
*  Several people I went to several different journalists and it wasn't that I was told who they contacted
*  What I was told was that they contacted somebody and this is what they heard and so they their enthusiasm
*  Evaporated at the point they make a phone call. So did they were they not aware of the consequences of this
*  problem with these mice so again, this is
*  We have a serious problem. It's not about mice. It's not about virology, right? It's a general systemic failure of reason
*  So what I encountered as a young somewhat naive graduate student was an instance
*  Which frankly woke me up to the fact that my colleagues even when human life was on the line
*  We're going to pretend they didn't know what was going on
*  It's quite possible. They didn't know
*  Until I had put out my hypothesis and
*  Carol Greider who later pretended she didn't know what I was talking about
*  Published the empirical work that revealed that indeed lab mice are unusual in having long telomeres after that work was out
*  There's no excuse for not investigating what the consequences were
*  I
*  Cannot explain it except to say that the culture of science has become so rotten that this sort of thing
*  Is maybe standard operating procedure
*  just protecting their ass and protecting the ass of those who give them jobs and and all the work that's been done that sort of
*  Establishes
*  That they should be doing these tests in the first place
*  I'm sure they tell themselves some story in which they are the heroes and they are protecting us from something but I
*  Look at my own medicine cabinet
*  And even though I am aware of what likely happened
*  I am in no position to protect myself or my family the only way to be protected from the downstream
*  Consequences of this error is to just not take pharmaceuticals. Jesus Christ. Yeah, it's a it's a it's a really huge problem and
*  The response of the system generally to shut down the lone individual
*  Trying to point out a serious problem is
*  It's just breathtaking and when you've when you've seen it when you've lived it
*  You you never go back, you know, you've looked into the eye of something that is willing to ignore
*  I mean it's willing to ignore it not only
*  human life
*  But it is willing to ignore
*  the
*  requirements of good science
*  How could you leave an error like that?
*  Undescribed and how is this being discussed on a fucking comedians podcast? Why is this not front page of the New York Times?
*  Why is this not leading on the news when you're talking about the safety of pharmaceutical drugs?
*  How is this not something that's an enormous story? Well this this raises another question
*  It's something I actually wanted to set the record straight about by and large
*  I thought Eric did a fantastic job of describing this. In fact, we're here at the
*  The tail end of this podcast and we're both tired and I feel like I've done a much worse job than he did describing the science
*  But I wanted to correct one thing and I think it will help answer the question. You just asked me
*  You asked Eric
*  why I had not pursued this and you said maybe was he afraid and
*  Eric indicated that that was some part of it
*  It's no part of it. And I think Eric has actually forgotten what happened
*  So I was dogged about this for a decade. I tried everything I could think of I talked to every journalist who would listen
*  as I said, I went to the
*  Committee on drug safety the Blue Ribbon Commission. I did everything I could think of I wrote and
*  when Carol Greider who
*  Refused to acknowledge my contribution got her Nobel Prize. I wrote what I think was a
*  Generous op-ed to the New York Times saying that her Nobel Prize was
*  Deserved but that we had this serious problem related to Mouse telomeres and that maybe now this Nobel Prize would give us the courage
*  To look at it. They wouldn't publish it. So I tried everything I could think of and
*  At one point a good friend of ours guy named Mike Brown who used to he was the former CFO of
*  Microsoft really good guy
*  I made a ton of money because he was at Microsoft on the ground floor and he used to hold something called science camp
*  And science camp involved gathering a bunch of really high quality people to talk privately where nobody was aware that we were even
*  Gathered right it really gave us the room to be frank
*  And I was there and I gave a talk on telomeres. I gave a talk about the science and I talked about the politics that had
*  that I had run into and
*  You know, they were blown away. It was you know, it's it's jaw-dropping stuff and
*  Afterwards Eric and Mike took me aside and
*  They said, you know
*  We understand why this is having the effect on you that it's having but you're wrapped around the axle
*  That was their phrase you're wrapped around the axle about the story
*  It's preventing you from doing what you need to do
*  And I didn't like hearing that and I you know, initially I thought no, that's not right
*  and then I think I think they were right and
*  So I let it go and I started I only talked about it with my students from that point forward
*  I tried to teach the science as clearly as I could and tried to keep the politics as far away from it as I could
*  And I you know, it's very hard to do but I let it go now at that point. I
*  was a
*  obscure
*  College professor at an obscure college. I had 400 Twitter followers
*  I wasn't in a position to push the case if somebody didn't want to hear it
*  Eric is right
*  That we are in a different era. I have
*  300,000 Twitter followers a hundred and thirty thousand YouTube subscribers. I
*  Got powerful friends
*  It is possible that that is enough to get this raised at the level that it would need to be raised in order
*  To get it addressed
*  But I'm not convinced of that my experience trying to get the topic addressed anywhere
*  For more than a decade was that it was it was like having a big hammer and there's a bell and you keep
*  Running at the bell and slamming it with the hammer and there's no sound it does not ring
*  There's nothing that you can do to make it ring now
*  Maybe maybe at this higher profile. There is now enough firepower to get that bell to ring but
*  Eric's podcast which is probably
*  Among the best places if you want to know the scientific story to go to you can listen to his the portal number 19
*  And you can hear him, you know, he catches me off guard
*  He forces me to tell this story, which I didn't I should have seen it coming, but I didn't so anyway
*  You get the the raw version
*  It is possible that we are now going to get the bell to ring
*  But but episode 19 of the portal did not cause it to ring
*  It caused a flurry of activity outside of mainstream scientific circles
*  But it did not cause anybody to sit up and take notice inside and that is the thing
*  I think we still don't know we don't know what force we're up against the pharmaceutical industry has
*  mice that will tell us that drugs that they are advancing into the market are safe when they are not and
*  Maybe that's the force that prevents the bell from ringing. I really have no idea
*  But I guess the question is is the era different because we're at a higher profile or isn't it?
*  It seems like we would need more than just the scientific community
*  Someone else in media to press the scientific community and say what's going on here to press the pharmaceutical industry and say
*  Address this is this an issue or is this not an issue? Is he correct if he is correct?
*  What do we do about this? And what does this mean? What do we do about this? And how many other this is are they?
*  I happened on this completely by accident. I happened on this because I was a
*  Generalist who was interested in interesting things and I was interested in evolution and this just
*  Happened to show up. And so yeah, I pursued it
*  there were features of my character that caused me to pursue it when others would have let it go, but
*  It still indicates that there may be many such things lurking that we have no awareness of and that
*  The fact that systems are so good at shutting down a story like this means that it would be
*  Very unlikely that you would have heard that there was a flaw like this
*  Hmm, so I don't know. I don't know the answer to your question. I do think
*  You know your point about the foundation
*  Being the important place to dealing with you know, the the rotten structure above is not where this has to go
*  It's got to go to the bottom level
*  What we are finding out is that in system after system something has gone wrong. I
*  Think there are a small number of themes that explain why these systems go wrong. I think we have
*  Taken the magic of market forces, which really are magic for certain things and we have infused them where they do
*  harm rather than good in other words in my opinion
*  Markets are
*  excellent at figuring out how to do things and they are terrible at deciding what to do and
*  We have put them in charge of both jobs. So we are so in love with the magic of what they can accomplish
*  That we don't realize that they you know science for example is too delicate to allow market forces to govern it
*  If you let market forces govern it it becomes like any other market and it turns scientists into salesmen and
*  Things like that
*  We have to get good at figuring out
*  Where we can afford to use the market where we have to insulate something from the market and at the point we do that
*  We'll be in a much stronger position to protect ourselves. But until we do we're just gonna keep doing self-harm
*  and on that note
*  You know Joe I was really hoping that this would be funnier I
*  Had a I had a tight ten minutes that I was gonna dribble out over three hours
*  I think didn't do it. He brought up some awesome stuff
*  I mean really very very important points across the board very brave points, too
*  And I always appreciate you man really do. Thanks and I really appreciate you too. If it is not clear your
*  Podcast which you have built is one of the few things of its magnitude that is not corrupt
*  Which is why I think you have so many good people willing to come here at the drop of a hat and talk to you
*  So I have no idea how it happened. We'll just keep doing it. All right. Thanks, man. Thanks brother. Bye everybody
