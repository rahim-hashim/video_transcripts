# Joe Rogan Experience #2030 - Protect Our Parks 9
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=6.0s)]
*  It starts! God damn it! The fun gun! Come on boys, let's go! Oh, sunglasses, they're options. I'm ready. I need them. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=10.0s)]
*  Norman doesn't fuck around. He gets here, he's got them ready to go. The lights hurt my eyes. Well you had a rough one last time. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=20.0s)]
*  Wow, this city brings out the evil in me. It's a party town. It really is. It's always been a party town. It's great. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=26.0s)]
*  It's a fun town. You guys went to see Nether Hour too, right? Yeah, it was fun. Those guys are cool. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=31.0s)]
*  They're really good. I'd only seen them after the Vulcan shows, but this was the first time I saw them on their own show. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=35.0s)]
*  They're fucking... Oh, you're crushing it. And Uncle Lazer! Yeah. Uncle Lazer got on and fucking played the harmonica. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=40.0s)]
*  I just thought he was a local coke fiend. Phenomenal. Phenomenal! He is down to your local coke fiend. I know that's all he wants. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=46.0s)]
*  A lot of guys who do coke also are good at harmonica. He's a good dude. I like that guy. He's funny. He's fun. Good energy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=51.0s)]
*  He ain't faking it. No, he's not. You know what I mean? That's that guy. He's a wild boy. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=58.0s)]
*  I had one heart to heart with him and he pulled me aside. He didn't break character at all. He was like, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=63.0s)]
*  Brother, let me ask you something. I was like, oh man, you're crazy. Wow, what a night. Rick Flair, Waka Flocka, Uncle Lazer. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=67.0s)]
*  Waka Flocka, Uncle Lazer. Like a mad lib. It was crazy. It's fun, right? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=75.0s)]
*  It's funny too because my uncle is named Uncle Lazer. He was a cantor. Oh, that's hilarious. Uncle Lazer. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=80.0s)]
*  Wait, your uncle's name was Uncle Lazer? Yeah. You had an uncle, Lazer? Yeah. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=86.0s)]
*  Was he a fucking American gladiator? What'd he do? He was a Holocaust survivor. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=91.0s)]
*  Bro, did you guys hear the story about those American gladiators? They got like no money. Really? Yeah, they got like no money. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=96.0s)]
*  They were celebrities. I know. They got fucked. They got royally fucked. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=101.0s)]
*  The Holocaust is the ultimate obstacle course. I was reading something about it. Jamie, were you the one who told me about it, Jamie? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=106.0s)]
*  There's a documentary. There's two documentaries actually about it. Salute. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=113.0s)]
*  Hey, praise Allah. So good to see you guys. What is this, number nine, ten? Nine. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=116.0s)]
*  Nine. Let's fucking go. Nine. Nine, nine, nine. Those American gladiators, bro, that's like pro wrestling. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=123.0s)]
*  That's a hard ass job. That's like you're crashing into people and stuff. You're taking people down. You're fucking battling with big Q-tips. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=129.0s)]
*  You're taking steroids and you're just spearing strangers. They beat the fuck out of some people. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=137.0s)]
*  Oh, they really unloaded on those guys too. They were like, ah. And those women. They barely got paid. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=143.0s)]
*  They barely got paid. It was NBC too, wasn't it? Remember that hamster wheel they would run in? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=149.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. Yeah, one of those broke and it went in the guy's back. They said he needed 75 stitches. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=154.0s)]
*  The hamster wheel? Yeah. Jesus Christ, dude. I used to love that Ninja Warrior show. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=161.0s)]
*  Oh, that's just great. Bro, some people are really good at that. It's very entertaining. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=167.0s)]
*  Like to be really good at that, you got to be a fucking athlete. You know who the best was? Like the 106 pound women. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=171.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. Yeah, they could just hold themselves up forever. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=178.0s)]
*  You know, we found that on Fear Factor. When we did, these guys had to hang from a pole over some water. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=180.0s)]
*  And the men broke way before the women. Yeah, well they're lighter. Yeah. Makes sense. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=186.0s)]
*  That's the only thing they're better at. Die. They say hanging is like really good for you, just to hang. I mean, not for everything. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=191.0s)]
*  I do that every day. Really? Yeah, yeah. I do that every day and then I also have this thing that I do where I hinge from my waist. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=197.0s)]
*  Go upside down? Yeah, but you don't go upside down from your ankles. The same company makes it, but I prefer this one because all the weight is literally from your waist forward. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=205.0s)]
*  You're not holding any weight in your legs, which I think makes you more tense and you might tense your back up. With this you just lean forward. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=215.0s)]
*  What is that thing called, Jamie? We talked about it a gang of times. The Dex II. The Dex II. We have one of those out here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=221.0s)]
*  That thing is the shit. That is the shit for your back, man. You also do back extension exercises on it, but just to hang there. I hang there in the mornings. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=227.0s)]
*  Oh wow. Yeah, I get in there and I feel everything go pop, pop, pop. You ever put the wife in there and really give it to her? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=236.0s)]
*  Hey, easy. This is a family show. You can get all these positions there. Yeah, you can do a lot with that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=243.0s)]
*  You ever do a jumping jack? It's like a basic thing. Do I? No, I do not do that. But it's a good move. Jumping jacks are really good. Yeah, trampoline. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=249.0s)]
*  That side to side shit. I used to do a lot of those. A lot of side to side things. Yeah. Till my last knee issue. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=259.0s)]
*  Jumping jacks is when I knew we were going to lose the war in Iraq. You ever see those videos of those guys teaching the Iraqi military? They're like, alright, we're going to do physical fitness. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=265.0s)]
*  Oh, like the terrorists? Not the terrorists, the Iraqi police. Oh. And the guys that were on our side. We had our guys training them and they would try to do jumping jacks. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=274.0s)]
*  Yeah, let's watch some of that. Really? I didn't know that. They can't do jumping jacks. ISIS does the bars. ISIS is monkey bars. Yeah, monkey bars. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=282.0s)]
*  Hilarious. Did you guys ever see those videos of kids in the 1960s in high school doing physical fitness? Yeah, it's jacked. Everybody's fucking. Everybody's like ripped. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=289.0s)]
*  And they're all doing chin ups. They're all doing monkey bars. They're like swinging. Yeah, they're ripped. They have 12 packs. What happened? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=299.0s)]
*  What the fuck? Video games. G.M.O.s. I think it's plastic. Well, there's a lot of preservatives in the food. This is Ninja Warrior. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=306.0s)]
*  That's trouble. So bad trouble. What fucking secret knowledge. The secret knowledge of jumping jacks has been. This guy's been kept from that. This other guy can't separate his legs at all. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=314.0s)]
*  This guy's hilarious. That guy's like. Closing every jump. It's like when the black comic brings the white guy on the dance. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=326.0s)]
*  These guys are amazing. He's doing the Kremlin dance. What the fuck is that? What is he doing? We're going to win. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=334.0s)]
*  I'd say they're doing the YMCA. It does look like that. It's fun to stay at the. ISIS, ISIS. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=340.0s)]
*  Bro, everyone sucks. One guy quit. He was like, I'm done. This is stupid. I'm all about the bar, but these jumping jacks are too much. It's too stupid. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=347.0s)]
*  Why am I doing this? When is this going to come up? I just want to kill myself. When is this going to come up? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=354.0s)]
*  My body feels better. A touch of the poison. Here's the kids. These are fucking young boys in 1962. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=359.0s)]
*  They were scared of the race war. This is all before plastic hit. What the fuck is this? Preservatives. It's plastics. Body shaming. Plastics? Yeah. Microplastics. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=370.0s)]
*  Microplastics. So thin. Not an ounce of body fat. They're endocrine disruptors. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=379.0s)]
*  What? Well, there was war in the air. You still had to fight in the war. Yep. There was war in the air. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=383.0s)]
*  The, you know, World War II had just ended. We were talking about going to Vietnam. Wow. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=388.0s)]
*  Man, look at these hot ass kids. This is ninja warrior shit. Look at these kids. Animals. This is sexy. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=393.0s)]
*  Look at this. They're all shirtless and sexy. But I bet none of them wrote a good book. I bet none of them sang a song anybody wanted to listen to. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=397.0s)]
*  That's fun. We're all fully loaded. We're hyper aggressive Americans. Yeah. I wonder. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=406.0s)]
*  I think that the microplastic thing is real. If you look at, there's a woman who wrote this book called Countdown. Her name is Shanna Swan. She's a doctor from Harvard. Right? I always ask. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=412.0s)]
*  Taint lady, right? Taint lady. Yeah. Taint lady. Talk to taints on here. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=423.0s)]
*  When you exposure to phthalates, like it's a type of, it's a chemical that's in plastics and some other things, it disrupts your endocrine system and it fucks up with mammals. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=427.0s)]
*  It makes with the males, it makes their taint smaller, makes their dick smaller, makes their balls smaller. Makes your sperm count grow down. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=440.0s)]
*  Interesting. And they find them in human beings. These are studies they've done in mammals. One of the best ways to determine male or female in young mammals is the male's taint is 50 to 100% larger. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=447.0s)]
*  So they look at that to see if it's a boy or a girl. And when you expose the animal to phthalates, that shrinks. And it sort of feminizes the boys. They have less testosterone, their penis is shrunk, their taint shrunk. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=460.0s)]
*  Son of a bitch. And there's a similar effect in human beings. And she believes that that's the driving force. And she thinks that we've been exposed since people have been using microwaves and everything's in plastic and water bottles in your car. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=473.0s)]
*  All these different chemicals. And then there's fertilizers and pesticides and herbicides and all that shit. All that shit's getting into your body. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=486.0s)]
*  It sucks to be the guy that was dating her. He was like, what are you researching? Why is everybody's dick small these days? What are you talking about, honey? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=495.0s)]
*  She's a hilarious older woman. She's really funny, man. She has a thing on her Instagram called the Jizz Quiz. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=504.0s)]
*  Whoa! I love that. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=511.0s)]
*  It's like she's funny. But she's talking about real science. It's kind of a disarming way to do it because she's such a sweet lady. But she's talking about what's going on with microplastics. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=513.0s)]
*  If you jizz in her face without telling her, it's a pop quiz. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=526.0s)]
*  Blah! God damn it. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=529.0s)]
*  You motherfuckers. God damn it. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=534.0s)]
*  You never know what's going to come up. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=537.0s)]
*  I think that really is it. And imagine when they introduced plastics to humans. It was just inevitably going to weaken us as a species. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=539.0s)]
*  Altered us. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=546.0s)]
*  And there's no way we could have known because we'd never had plastic before. So there was no plastic forever. And then 19, whatever it is, 50s, when does it start? Where people start using plastics everywhere. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=547.0s)]
*  Milk used to come in a jar. Glass. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=559.0s)]
*  And at the same time, there's a direct drop in sperm cell count and women are having more miscarriages. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=561.0s)]
*  Less fertility from both the male and the female. So it's not just feminizing. It's messing up the females too. And it's doing something to the males. It's crushing its reproductive system. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=568.0s)]
*  I think she said we'd eat a credit card of plastic a week. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=583.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what she said. But there's some dispute about that. It's like it's an average thing. Like are some people getting way more of it or are some people getting none of it? Like is there a way to avoid it? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=586.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know what's weird? When you check into a hotel and you see a family and they bring in like a 20 case of bottled water and you're like, what are you doing? You're going to be here two nights. You need all that bottled water? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=597.0s)]
*  See, you just buy a bottle of water. Where the fuck did it come from? Was it on a boat in Thailand for a month? Drifting across the ocean? Where did your water come from? I don't even ask. I just drink it. So what if I'm drinking some bullshit fucking chemicals that's going to make my tank shrank? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=607.0s)]
*  I'm a tap man. I love tap. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=627.0s)]
*  It's really not good for you. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=629.0s)]
*  What? Tap? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=631.0s)]
*  Yeah, tap water is not good for you. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=632.0s)]
*  Everybody in New York loves saying New York has the best tap water. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=633.0s)]
*  It's so ridiculous. It's like zero chance that's true. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=636.0s)]
*  Saying my shit smells the sweetest. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=638.0s)]
*  Wow, that's true. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=640.0s)]
*  It's like they said the water is good but the taps are all shitty. So you're drinking like the rust. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=642.0s)]
*  Bro, who's cleaning those pipes? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=646.0s)]
*  Nobody. That's what I mean. The rats. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=648.0s)]
*  Imagine if you could get like a camera down a mile or so into those pipes and see the crud. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=650.0s)]
*  I had a landlord tell me it was normal for it to come out brown in the beginning and I was like, can I come to your house and see if it's like that there? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=656.0s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? You're supposed to drink that? You're supposed to bathe in that? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=662.0s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=667.0s)]
*  I do the shower with the mouth open. You ever do that one? Let it flow right in? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=669.0s)]
*  When I was a kid I used to chug shower water. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=672.0s)]
*  I do that today. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=674.0s)]
*  There's some real disputes about fluoride in water too. To be honest I'm not super well versed in it. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=676.0s)]
*  It's good for the teeth. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=682.0s)]
*  Yeah, apparently sort of. But what's really good for the teeth is brushing your fucking teeth. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=684.0s)]
*  It's like, are we sure that you're supposed to be dumping fluoride in the water that people drink? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=689.0s)]
*  It is a bit of an assumption. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=695.0s)]
*  Do you know that fluoride lowers your IQ? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=697.0s)]
*  No! [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=699.0s)]
*  Yeah, it does. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=700.0s)]
*  Shit. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=701.0s)]
*  Exposure to fluoride lowers your IQ. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=702.0s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=704.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what the number is. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=705.0s)]
*  What exposure to, how much exposure to fluoride lowers your IQ? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=707.0s)]
*  I've been drinking it for 39 years. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=712.0s)]
*  Just drink it. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=714.0s)]
*  Imagine how fucking smart you used to be. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=715.0s)]
*  You'd be so much less autistic. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=717.0s)]
*  You were robbed. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=719.0s)]
*  You were robbed. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=721.0s)]
*  Pop Gizz. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=725.0s)]
*  I thought everybody here would say how much about it. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=726.0s)]
*  It says a significant inverse relationship was found between the fluoride concentration in drinking water and IQ. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=728.0s)]
*  It was observed that the IQ level was negatively correlated with fluoride concentration in drinking water. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=734.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=740.0s)]
*  It literally makes you dumber. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=741.0s)]
*  Ah, pop quiz. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=743.0s)]
*  But then again, you're buying this bottle water from who knows where that's been sitting on a dock. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=745.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=750.0s)]
*  I'm not asking, I mean, none of us are asking questions. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=751.0s)]
*  No, no we're not. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=754.0s)]
*  I don't even know where Poland Spring is. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=755.0s)]
*  I just unhooked my microphone. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=756.0s)]
*  We gotta vote for RFK, he'll save us. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=757.0s)]
*  Well, what is, what's the reason for that? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=759.0s)]
*  Is there a real good reason for fucking dumping fluoride in the water? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=761.0s)]
*  I'm sure the company that, it started so long ago. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=764.0s)]
*  What's the benefit, let's Google that. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=768.0s)]
*  What's the benefit of fluoride? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=770.0s)]
*  It's barely statistically significant. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=772.0s)]
*  Well the benefit here, the benefit is this. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=774.0s)]
*  It was teeth strong cavities. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=776.0s)]
*  It keeps teeth strong and reduces cavities. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=780.0s)]
*  So I guess the British aren't doing it. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=783.0s)]
*  Also called tooth decay by about 25% in children and adults. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=784.0s)]
*  Drinking fluoridated water, right, but what does it do to your brain? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=788.0s)]
*  And how much of an effect, how much better is it than just brushing your teeth? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=791.0s)]
*  Well, they say it's a cause of communism. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=796.0s)]
*  But what is, what's the reason for this? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=799.0s)]
*  I mean, we're forcing people to take care of their teeth [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=802.0s)]
*  and everybody else is gonna lose IQ points? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=807.0s)]
*  Like what? Is that the fucking deal? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=810.0s)]
*  Is there a better way? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=812.0s)]
*  But hold on a second, like isn't there a better way? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=814.0s)]
*  Can't you just clean your fucking teeth? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=816.0s)]
*  Like, I don't have any cavities. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=818.0s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=820.0s)]
*  I was gonna brush, but I decided to chug out of the sink. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=822.0s)]
*  Why do they give a shit about our teeth? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=825.0s)]
*  Goddamn dude, since the mid-1940s, compounds containing mineral fluoride [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=827.0s)]
*  have been added to community water supplies throughout the US to prevent tooth decay. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=831.0s)]
*  Boy, that sounds weird. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=835.0s)]
*  If I wanted to put on a fucking tin foil hat right now. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=837.0s)]
*  Health concerns expressed by opponents have largely been dismissed until recently. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=841.0s)]
*  Now evidence is mounting that in the era of fluoridated toothpaste [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=846.0s)]
*  and other consumer products that boost dental health, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=851.0s)]
*  the potential risks from consuming fluoridated water may outweigh the benefits for some individuals. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=854.0s)]
*  Last summer, for the first time in 53 years, the US Public Health Service [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=860.0s)]
*  lowered its recommended levels of fluoride in drinking water. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=864.0s)]
*  Boy, we're getting started early, huh? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=868.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=870.0s)]
*  I mean, if I was making fluoride, I would be like, shut the fuck up. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=871.0s)]
*  I think that's what they're doing. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=876.0s)]
*  The fluoride people are like, no, you need it in your water. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=878.0s)]
*  Shouldn't we research? Shut up. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=881.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=884.0s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. I got a lot of fluoride. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=885.0s)]
*  Any other trade-off like that. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=887.0s)]
*  Imagine any other trade-off that lowers IQs. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=890.0s)]
*  Imagine if we came along and said, we're going to put sunscreen in everybody's apples [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=893.0s)]
*  because some people are going to get cancer because they're not wearing sunscreen. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=901.0s)]
*  And okay, well, now everybody has to eat sunscreen apples. Is that the new rule? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=908.0s)]
*  That's what the fuck this is like. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=913.0s)]
*  This is like forcing everybody to eat sunscreen apples. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=915.0s)]
*  Like, hey bitch, I brush my fucking teeth. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=918.0s)]
*  Don't make me drink this stuff. What's in there? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=920.0s)]
*  Well, we got rid of lead paint. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=923.0s)]
*  And when you use one of them filters, does that get all the fluoride out? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=925.0s)]
*  I doubt it. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=928.0s)]
*  It gets a lot of shit out. You ever put high C in there? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=929.0s)]
*  Just see, it's still kind of pink. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=931.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=933.0s)]
*  Yeah, when it goes through. It's not clear. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=934.0s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=935.0s)]
*  You're a high C. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=936.0s)]
*  I'm a high K. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=937.0s)]
*  With that beard, he's a fucking B plus in mountains. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=941.0s)]
*  I know. Look at this guy. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=944.0s)]
*  You're a man who knows how to start a fire. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=945.0s)]
*  Moses. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=947.0s)]
*  Right. You'd be like, I'm trusting you with fire. I'm like, you shouldn't. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=948.0s)]
*  You look like a guy who knows where the fucking woodchucks are. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=950.0s)]
*  Oh, these ponds are safe to drink from. I don't know beavers here. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=956.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a thing that people drink out of ponds with. It's like a... [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=960.0s)]
*  Camelback thing, yeah. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=964.0s)]
*  Yeah, you put it in there and... [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=965.0s)]
*  Life straw. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=966.0s)]
*  Yeah, life straw. That's it. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=967.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=968.0s)]
*  Yeah, you suck through the... [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=969.0s)]
*  You can drink anything. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=970.0s)]
*  You can drink anything. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=971.0s)]
*  Where animals have been pissing. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=972.0s)]
*  Like if cows have been pissing in a puddle, you can drink it. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=973.0s)]
*  Those brittas are filthy. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=976.0s)]
*  Brita filters keep a healthy level of fluoride. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=978.0s)]
*  What? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=982.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=983.0s)]
*  They do not remove fluoride. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=984.0s)]
*  And it says on their website, a healthy level of fluoride. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=985.0s)]
*  They're in cahoots. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=987.0s)]
*  A healthy level of fluoride. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=988.0s)]
*  They are in cahoots, dude. I'm sick of fluoride. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=989.0s)]
*  But who the fuck decides what the healthy level of... [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=990.0s)]
*  A thing that lowers your IQ is. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=994.0s)]
*  Tell you, big fluoride. Big fluoride. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=995.0s)]
*  Yeah, who's running that? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=997.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=998.0s)]
*  How weird... [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=999.0s)]
*  If it's George Soros, I'm gonna be pissed. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1000.0s)]
*  Who's running big fluoride? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1002.0s)]
*  He runs everything. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1003.0s)]
*  If you were a journalist, wouldn't this be something you would cover? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1004.0s)]
*  No. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1007.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1008.0s)]
*  I mean, how many... [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1009.0s)]
*  It would just be a nice story to be that big. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1010.0s)]
*  How many journalists have covered this in the New York Times? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1011.0s)]
*  We gotta cover the Black Mermaid first. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1013.0s)]
*  Or a really good paper, the New Yorker or the Atlantic. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1015.0s)]
*  Wouldn't you want to cover this? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1019.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1020.0s)]
*  No, journalism's dead. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1021.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's so many stories about politics, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1022.0s)]
*  no stories about advances in medical shit, you know what I mean? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1024.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1027.0s)]
*  You never hear stories about that. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1028.0s)]
*  It's always just anger and... [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1029.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1031.0s)]
*  Never anything good. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1032.0s)]
*  Like, we're doing better than we were 20 years ago. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1033.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1034.0s)]
*  But I think that's always how people are, dude. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1035.0s)]
*  People are always extremely dissatisfied. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1037.0s)]
*  And because of everyone that's access to the internet, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1040.0s)]

*  Did Tim Dillon's video, did that get removed from Twitter? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1110.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1113.0s)]

*  Don't they just call themselves the Chicks now? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1162.0s)]
*  They can call themselves whatever they want, but I don't change. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1163.0s)]
*  Chicks sounds worse. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1166.0s)]

*  They were like the first people to get severe backlash. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1187.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1190.0s)]
*  Well, I mean now in retrospect, everybody knows that war was insanity. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1191.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1195.0s)]

*  They go, no, tell me if I'm wrong. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1200.0s)]
*  They said no George Bush jokes, no military jokes. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1202.0s)]
*  Whoa, he's the president. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1204.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was a weird time though, man. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1206.0s)]
*  It was a very strange time. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1209.0s)]
*  Looking back, the Bush hate was quaint compared to the shit now. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1211.0s)]
*  Oh, it was quaint. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1215.0s)]
*  It was fun. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1216.0s)]
*  Compared to the Obama hate and the Trump hate. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1217.0s)]
*  You know what it was? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1219.0s)]
*  It didn't get accelerant thrown on it. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1220.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1221.0s)]
*  The social media accelerant. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1222.0s)]
*  It was always in the air. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1223.0s)]
*  It was always in the air. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1224.0s)]
*  Everybody was furious at Bush for getting us into that war. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1225.0s)]
*  But it didn't ... it was like ... [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1228.0s)]

*  If the news didn't cover it, you really didn't know about it. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1235.0s)]

*  There wasn't really ... was Fox News even around back when Bush was president? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1245.0s)]

*  Well, first of all, in today's day and age, if they say they're a woman, they're a woman. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1381.0s)]

*  Anybody can be a woman now. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1391.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1392.0s)]

*  Jamie. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1394.0s)]
*  But also, how do you explain they have kids? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1395.0s)]
*  Like, Madonna's got kids. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1399.0s)]

*  Yeah, but she was pregnant. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1401.0s)]
*  He showed me a basic slide video of a filter. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1403.0s)]
*  There's not too many pictures of Michelle Obama pregnant, just saying. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1405.0s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1408.0s)]

*  They're hard to find. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1411.0s)]
*  I've been searching them before the conspiracy. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1412.0s)]
*  Yeah, but the thing about it is, why would they post it? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1413.0s)]
*  How many pictures of you in your underwear are there on the internet? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1416.0s)]

*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1422.0s)]
*  Like, why would anybody have pictures of them, you know, or her pregnant? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1423.0s)]
*  Isn't that personal? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1427.0s)]
*  Tell that to Ali Wong. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1428.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of pregnant specials. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1429.0s)]
*  There's a few. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1432.0s)]
*  There's so many pregnant specials. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1433.0s)]
*  But Ali was the goat. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1434.0s)]
*  She was the goat. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1435.0s)]
*  Ali was the originator. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1436.0s)]
*  Yeah, good for her. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1437.0s)]
*  I think it fucking added to it. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1438.0s)]
*  It did. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1439.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1440.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1444.0s)]
*  She was carrying a giant baby inside her. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1445.0s)]
*  That's hard to do. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1447.0s)]
*  Isn't it funny that with medical science, one of us could have a baby now? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1448.0s)]
*  You think? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1452.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're talking about, trans people are talking about getting a uterus. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1453.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1457.0s)]
*  This one guy. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1458.0s)]
*  I think you can. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1459.0s)]
*  Ari's too old. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1460.0s)]
*  This one person. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1461.0s)]
*  I've been menopause. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1462.0s)]
*  This one person was clearly trolling. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1463.0s)]
*  Personopause. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1464.0s)]
*  And what they said was that they wanted to get a uterus transplant and then be the first [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1465.0s)]
*  trans person to have an abortion. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1469.32s)]
*  In everybody? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1471.0s)]
*  In Texas. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1472.0s)]
*  Everybody was getting angry. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1473.0s)]
*  They're getting so riled up. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1474.0s)]
*  Both sides are angry at that. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1475.0s)]
*  That's a good one. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1476.0s)]
*  That's a good one. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1477.0s)]
*  The only thing that bums me out is that I could see a world, maybe not today, but I [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1478.0s)]
*  could see a world in the future where if enough biological men wanted uterus transplants, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1484.28s)]
*  they would start doing it. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1491.0s)]
*  People would start doing it. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1493.0s)]
*  I mean, they'll probably start convincing people. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1496.0s)]
*  Why would you want a uterus though? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1499.0s)]
*  That it's safe and effective. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1500.0s)]
*  Because they want to be a real woman. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1501.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1503.0s)]
*  They want to have women parts. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1504.0s)]
*  All women parts. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1505.0s)]

*  Why is everybody trying to make it? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1525.0s)]
*  Somebody's got to drive that fucking Uber Eats. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1526.0s)]

*  Why can't we all just get along? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1533.0s)]
*  All this chaos in society is just designed to get us to the point where we're willing [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1536.0s)]
*  to accept a biological male getting pregnant and then through that, that's how Satan comes. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1541.0s)]

*  That's it. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1552.0s)]

*  Remember that kid? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1557.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1558.0s)]
*  That's a similar story. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1559.0s)]
*  The dude gives birth. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1560.0s)]
*  God's going to come back and be like, all right, that's a wrap you fucking dummies. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1561.0s)]
*  You guys are great. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1564.0s)]

*  You guys are just, all right. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1572.0s)]
*  It's like when you're in an escape room. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1574.0s)]
*  We need help. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1575.0s)]

*  That probably fucked that kid up. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1581.0s)]
*  He went from cover of the Nirvana album to this. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1583.0s)]
*  It looks like you met Kevin Spacey. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1585.0s)]
*  Dude, imagine if you're a little kid and you're in a huge movie where you play the most evil [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1588.0s)]
*  motherfucker that's ever lived. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1596.0s)]
*  And then everywhere you go, people are looking at you sideways now. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1598.0s)]
*  He's scary. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1600.0s)]
*  How do you cast that? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1601.0s)]

*  All he did was look normal. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1605.0s)]
*  That's how terrifying children are. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1606.0s)]
*  He goes sideways still. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1607.0s)]
*  It is true. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1608.0s)]
*  The kid's got like a straight face and looks at you. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1609.0s)]
*  Hello, Shane. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1612.0s)]
*  Yikes. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1613.0s)]
*  You know where things are ... [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1615.0s)]
*  That's where you got to get them preemptively. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1617.0s)]
*  You got to go, come here, baby. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1618.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1619.0s)]
*  Touch him. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1620.0s)]
*  Shake him. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1621.0s)]
*  The only time when a baby is scary is when it's at nighttime in the woods. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1622.0s)]
*  Or when a baby's just standing there staring at you. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1627.0s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1629.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the scariest thing. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1630.0s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1631.0s)]
*  A naked baby just in the trail just standing there staring at you. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1632.0s)]
*  That's terrifying. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1636.0s)]
*  You'd be like, what the fuck is going on? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1637.0s)]
*  First of all, is this a trap? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1639.0s)]
*  Do I go towards the baby and then they rush me? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1641.0s)]
*  Or is this baby a demon? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1644.0s)]
*  Is this a fake baby? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1646.0s)]
*  Why is this baby naked in the woods at night? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1648.0s)]
*  We found a baby in Northern Thailand. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1651.0s)]
*  It's really dark. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1653.0s)]
*  We saw a baby on a road. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1654.0s)]
*  In the road? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1656.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1657.0s)]
*  There was a house like 200 yards up. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1658.0s)]
*  Is this your baby? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1660.0s)]
*  Oh my God, thank you so much. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1661.0s)]
*  Do you guys have cigarettes? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1662.0s)]
*  It's a fucking bait baby. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1663.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1665.0s)]
*  A bait baby. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1666.0s)]
*  A bait baby. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1668.0s)]
*  So they put the baby out so people save the baby. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1669.0s)]
*  You get some cigarettes. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1671.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1672.0s)]
*  A couple of loosies. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1674.0s)]
*  Yeah, a couple of loosies going a long way. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1675.0s)]
*  They used to do a thing where they throw a baby and you instinctually catch it and then they pickpocket you. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1677.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1681.0s)]
*  Did you have to catch it? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1683.0s)]
*  You got to catch the baby. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1684.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1685.0s)]
*  How wild is part of the world? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1686.0s)]
*  I was in Thailand. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1689.0s)]
*  I was watching this whole family on a moped. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1690.0s)]
*  There was a baby. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1693.0s)]

*  It's not cool at all. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1805.0s)]
*  Yeah, if you had COVID for one day, that's way better than the regular cold for like [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1806.0s)]
*  a week and a half. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1809.0s)]
*  It's like these rich chicks who can't just get a headache. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1810.0s)]
*  They have to have a migraine. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1813.0s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1814.0s)]

*  Always migraines. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1817.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1818.0s)]
*  I think migraines are debilitating. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1819.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I was going to say. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1820.0s)]
*  I think they're debilitating. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1822.0s)]
*  I think you're on your knees. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1823.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1825.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1826.0s)]
*  I'm sure that severity is different with different people. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1827.0s)]
*  I think Terrell Davis sat out of the Super Bowl for a little while with a migraine. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1830.0s)]
*  It's that bad. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1834.0s)]

*  Yes, dude. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1845.0s)]
*  A debilitating migraine. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1846.0s)]
*  Almost took him out of the Super Bowl. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1847.0s)]
*  Maybe CTE. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1849.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1850.0s)]
*  Well, you got to think that's a factor. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1851.0s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1853.0s)]
*  Great teeth on that. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1854.0s)]
*  Look at that fluoride. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1855.0s)]
*  Great teeth. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1856.0s)]
*  That's a late addition. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1857.0s)]
*  That was in his playing days. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1858.0s)]
*  These poor football players, man. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1859.0s)]
*  So what does he say here? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1860.0s)]
*  A migraine eventually came on and forced Davis to sit out of the second quarter of the game. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1861.0s)]
*  He didn't let it stop for long, though, as he was back in the field after having a [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1862.0s)]
*  I forgot to take his medicine pregame. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1867.0s)]
*  Oh, he has medicine for migraines. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1868.0s)]
*  Or his pregame meal two hours before kickoff. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1869.0s)]
*  He was dinged up. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1870.0s)]
*  What kind of preventative medicine do they have for migraines, Jamie? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1871.0s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1872.0s)]
*  I had a friend that in high school, if we would just start talking about it, he would [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1873.0s)]

*  say that fucking shit, we'll just start mentally getting it. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1878.0s)]

*  Terrifying. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1893.0s)]

*  He'd have to go lay down somewhere, couldn't see light. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=1895.0s)]

*  fucking island bro but you could stay on his island. That guy's a fucking bitch. Let no one on if you're a fucking man. What are you talking about? If he was a real man he wouldn't let up four seasons there. It's a big island Ari. It's tourism they gotta have a four seasons. That's the catch 22 because they hate all the whitey coming in but they also bring in more whitey who spend money. So what do you do here? It's like slavery. God damn. What? I don't know where you went. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=8488.36s)]
*  with that. Well it's a tough one because you know slavery is horrible but we get to live in America. You know slavery sucks but we sure did get a lot of sugar and coffee. And cotton. Jesus Christ. No no I was being I was joking because the joke was that sugar and coffee is not worth the human toll. That was the joke. I don't know coffee is pretty good. The problem is if you're too fucked up to hear the beginnings of jokes you're like wait what? [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=8518.28s)]
*  I would just like to explain this with a more critical eye. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=8548.2s)]
*  Let's get it back together. Sorry folks. Hey the Irish were slaves and the Jews pyramid. Barely dude. Apparently there's more slaves today than there ever was when slavery was legal. I've heard that. Yeah and the Uighurs. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=8555.2s)]
*  Well what's happening with those folks? I hate Uighurs. We don't even know what's going on in Ukraine. We don't really know shit. A lot of Nazis out there too. How could you know? A lot of white supremacy. I think we should be trying to know. Who's the one guy that had a Nazi tattoo and he had his sleeve covered when he received an award? Zalinski. No no no no no. He's the guy who played the piano with his dick. What? Yeah. I don't know this guy. No. Zalinski? Oh yeah. That was Zalinski. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=8574.2s)]
*  Yeah when he was a comic. Wait really? Zalinski was a comic and he played the piano with his dick. He was a pianist. What was the other guy I was asking about? The guy with the swastika? Yeah. See if you can find that. So some guy received some award. In a cupboard? I want to say an actor gave it to him. I forget who gave it to him. Was it Edith Hiller for killing most Jews? [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=8604.2s)]
*  When he received his award he had a... The winner of this year's killing most Jews award. No surprises everybody. A landslide repeat from 1943. What did they name him before him? Stalin? I guess so. It was the Pogroma Awards. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=8631.2s)]
*  The beginning of the invasion where everybody was on Ukraine's side. Hey Stuart! Ukrainian Nazis were invited to Disney World by the Pentagon. Oh totally. 22 DoD Warrior Games. What the fuck? [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=8651.2s)]
*  Liberal comedian John Stuart even honored a former hardcore Azov militant for his personal example. What the hell? I mean there's a lot more they're not sharing the story. But this is the guy. So that guy has this tattoo on his elbow. And so he had it covered when he was receiving his award. That's not a swastika tattoo. That's a dream catcher.

*  I wonder if the origin of that was like someone eating mushrooms and seeing these wild crazy patterns and saying oh that's good luck. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9017.5s)]
*  Wait, can you go back to the Hindu one? [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9025.5s)]
*  Although that guy is hilarious. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9027.5s)]
*  The one that said Hindu? Look at that. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9029.5s)]
*  Star of David Swastika? [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9031.5s)]
*  Because I've never seen a swastika. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9033.5s)]
*  Wow, it's facing the right way. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9035.5s)]
*  I've never seen a swastika while I'm tripping. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9037.5s)]
*  But I've seen the geometric patterns. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9039.5s)]
*  I've seen the geometric patterns like that. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9042.34s)]
*  That would be like a, I would certainly see how someone who had tripped before would think of that as a representation of what you see when you're tripping. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9044.34s)]
*  And why did those ones never go the other way? [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9052.34s)]
*  Don't click it, Jamie. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9054.34s)]
*  Because you know what, it seems like it's got motion to it. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9056.34s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9060.34s)]
*  And that's like what you experience when you're tripping and you experience whatever the fuck you're seeing. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9062.34s)]
*  The good luck version. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9067.34s)]
*  They're not static. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9069.34s)]
*  They're constantly moving and rotating. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9072.18s)]
*  And that looks like, if I was going to have a two dimensional drawing of something you could see where you're tripping balls, that's what it looks like. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9074.18s)]
*  And that's what it was. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9083.18s)]
*  It was a good luck thing for thousands of years. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9085.18s)]
*  And the fucking Nazis ruined everything. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9087.18s)]
*  That was the second worst thing they did. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9089.18s)]
*  Second worst thing they did. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9091.18s)]
*  And also, the crazy thing is how good they were at engineering. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9093.18s)]
*  How good their fucking cars were. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9102.02s)]
*  How good their engines were. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9104.02s)]
*  They suck, dude. Fuck Germany. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9106.02s)]
*  I'll be in Berlin in one week. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9108.02s)]
*  Bro, they did some wild shit. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9112.02s)]
*  They got rowdy. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9114.02s)]
*  Look at this building in San Diego. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9116.02s)]
*  Oh my god, it's a swastika building. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9118.02s)]
*  Oh shit! [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9120.02s)]
*  That's the right way. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9122.02s)]
*  But that's the correct way. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9124.02s)]
*  Son of a bitch. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9126.02s)]
*  Still got a Jewish landlord. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9128.02s)]
*  Jesus Christ! [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9130.86s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9132.86s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9134.86s)]
*  We used to live in the Lower East Side, me and my ex girlfriend. [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9136.86s)]
*  And the Jews, they owned the building, like I'm talking Hasidic. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9140.86s)]
*  And he would come in to fix something. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9144.86s)]
*  They have a tool belt. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9146.86s)]
*  So weird to see a rabbi with a beard like that, a yarmulke, the tassels, and a tool belt. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9148.86s)]
*  And he would fix your plumbing. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9152.86s)]
*  But he couldn't look at the girl. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9154.86s)]
*  He couldn't look at her. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9156.86s)]
*  That's very nice. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9159.7s)]
*  That's the type of tool guy you want. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9161.7s)]
*  You don't want some jacked hot guy coming in. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9163.7s)]
*  And you're sitting there like a pussy where you're like, I don't know how to fix a shelf. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9167.7s)]
*  Some jacked guy comes in and fixes it. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9171.7s)]
*  He's like, that took five seconds. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9173.7s)]
*  But the pipe's got a swastika on it. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9175.7s)]
*  And he tosses in a swastika pipe. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9177.7s)]
*  I gotta replace these pipes. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9179.7s)]
*  They're old or something. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9181.7s)]
*  Guys, guys, guys, this is my business. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9183.7s)]
*  This is my family business. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9185.7s)]
*  But I own a swastika. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9188.54s)]
*  It's good luck, guys. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9190.54s)]
*  That's all it is. It's good luck. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9192.54s)]
*  This is a fad. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9194.54s)]
*  This fad's gonna pass. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9196.54s)]
*  Look, it was good luck for thousands and thousands and thousands of years. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9198.54s)]
*  You really think that the Nazis are gonna rule it forever? [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9200.54s)]
*  I'm telling you guys. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9202.54s)]
*  I am very big on the swastika. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9204.54s)]
*  It's coming back. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9206.54s)]
*  That'd be like if the horseshoe all of a sudden became the symbol for killing Muslims or something. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9208.54s)]
*  Or gays. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9212.54s)]
*  It's a game they play now. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9214.54s)]
*  Right. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9217.380000000001s)]
*  There you go. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9219.380000000001s)]
*  Things like that do happen. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9221.380000000001s)]
*  I mean, rainbows used to mean leprechauns. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9223.380000000001s)]
*  It used to mean pots of gold. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9225.380000000001s)]
*  Now it means sucking another guy's ass. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9227.380000000001s)]
*  Let me cum in your butt and suck it out of your butt. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9229.380000000001s)]
*  And that means rainbows. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9231.380000000001s)]
*  Any time I see a rainbow, I think about sucking a guy's fucking dick and nuts. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9233.380000000001s)]
*  So much of my cum or someone else's cum in your butt that I could suck out. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9237.380000000001s)]
*  Guys, I don't think rainbow. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9239.380000000001s)]
*  I think pride. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9241.380000000001s)]
*  Well, remember, pride used to mean something else. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9243.380000000001s)]
*  Pride was like, we have pride in your butt. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9246.22s)]
*  I think I'm the best at sucking out of dudes butts. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9248.22s)]
*  I'm the proudest I am. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9250.22s)]
*  True pride. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9252.22s)]
*  But doesn't the bible say you shouldn't have pride? [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9254.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's a sin. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9256.22s)]
*  So there you go. You should have it. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9258.22s)]
*  It's a sin. It's in the bible. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9260.22s)]
*  Maybe that's how everybody got confused and thought that you shouldn't be gay. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9262.22s)]
*  That was in the bible too. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9264.22s)]
*  Don't be so proud of your becks and shit. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9266.22s)]
*  The eighth sin was anal. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9268.22s)]
*  Don't be so proud of your great life, guys. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9270.22s)]
*  That fucking, that Norm MacDonald joke about that is so good. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9272.22s)]
*  How's it going, is it? [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9275.06s)]
*  Oh, I love that joke. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9277.06s)]
*  Macluskey, old dog, he's like some guy working at a factory. [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9279.06s)]
*  He's like, here's my son, he graduated. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9281.06s)]
*  He's the first of the Macluskeys to graduate from college. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9283.06s)]
*  He's one of the... [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9285.06s)]
*  He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9287.06s)]
*  Here he is sucking a guy's dick. That's what I'm most proud about. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9289.06s)]
*  Oh, when he was on Dennis Miller. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9298.06s)]
*  I saw in it there were these [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9300.06s)]
*  old men and old ladies like [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9302.06s)]
*  with these signs that said, we are proud of our gay son. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9304.9s)]
*  That's an odd thing to be proud of, you know? [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9306.9s)]
*  Because it's not an achievement, you know? [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9308.9s)]
*  It's not like something you work all your life to be gay or anything like that. [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9310.9s)]
*  It's a great point. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9314.9s)]
*  We'll get a good point. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9316.9s)]
*  Oh my god, we're proud of him, Johnny. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9318.9s)]
*  He graduated from Harvard, you know? [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9320.9s)]
*  Now he's articling over at a law firm and... [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9322.9s)]
*  Oh yeah, he loves cock. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9324.9s)]
*  That's Dennis Miller. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9326.9s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9328.9s)]
*  That's a great bit. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9330.9s)]
*  He loves cock. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9333.74s)]
*  Did you ever see him do the one about the [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9335.74s)]
*  more black people means more crime? [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9337.74s)]
*  Yes, the radio show. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9339.74s)]
*  Poor people commit crime. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9341.74s)]
*  The lady's like, no they don't. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9343.74s)]
*  Wait, what? Oh, you gotta show that one. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9345.74s)]
*  They call in, they're like, no, we are poor. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9347.74s)]
*  No, we're poor. Yeah. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9349.74s)]
*  It's great, because the lady keeps calling them a racist. [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9351.74s)]
*  And he goes, wait, are you saying black people are richer than white people? [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9353.74s)]
*  Right. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9355.74s)]
*  No, I'm like, well then what? [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9357.74s)]
*  What was this on? [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9359.74s)]
*  Oh wow. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9362.58s)]
*  He's just making intentionally combative points that are correct. [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=9364.58s)]

*  And when he did that, he bumped him a little. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=10058.74s)]
*  And the guy immediately was like, you don't fucking bump me! [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=10060.74s)]

*  Phil's trying to fight him, too. [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=10080.74s)]
*  If Phil would have died defending Brady Quinn in Dublin, [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=10083.58s)]

*  He trains with McGregor. [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=10118.42s)]
*  Allegedly. He was on cocaine. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=10120.42s)]
*  He might have been fabricating. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=10122.42s)]
*  But you know how these guys go. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=10124.42s)]

*  This guy's gonna beat my ass in Dublin for being a Nate Diaz guy. [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=10149.26s)]
*  Anyway, the whole night, the guy leaves, everything's okay. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=10151.26s)]
*  The next night, get done with the shows. [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=10153.26s)]
*  Brady's in the green room. [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=10155.26s)]
*  We're all hanging out, we're having a good time. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=10157.26s)]

*  He must have had a problem with this bar. [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=10258.62s)]
*  The whole time he was like, let's go to another bar. [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=10260.62s)]

*  He gets out of all five of them, runs down the alley, [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=10274.62s)]
*  and then turns and looks at all of them and goes... [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=10276.62s)]
*  He squares up and runs off again. [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=10280.62s)]

*  Adolf Hitler. [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=10970.1s)]
*  That's the real problem with calling everybody you disagree with a Nazi. [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=10972.1s)]
*  Because there's fucking real Nazis. [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=10976.94s)]

*  I'll tell you what. [[03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=10996.94s)]

*  Everybody in the community was like, uh, no. [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11010.78s)]
*  You're obviously a bad parent if you're even trying that. [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11012.78s)]
*  Right. [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11016.78s)]
*  Also strapping the kids to the booster seats while they beat the fuck out of each other. [[03:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11018.78s)]
*  That is like the rock'em sacrum. [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11022.78s)]
*  That's a bigger problem than the words. [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11024.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11026.78s)]
*  And they didn't take the booster. [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11028.78s)]
*  Yeah, they've got mental disabilities. [[03:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11030.78s)]
*  How come everyone's like, trans is mentally problematic but like Nazis they're like, no they've made a decision. [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11033.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11037.62s)]

*  You're either a Nazi or you're anti-Nazi. [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11053.62s)]
*  No one's pro-Nazi that's not a Nazi. [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11055.62s)]
*  For real, if you're a dude today with holding up a swastika like on the side of a highway. [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11057.62s)]
*  You just drive by and go, that's... [[03:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11062.460000000001s)]
*  Get him in a home. [[03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11064.460000000001s)]
*  Get him in the Special Olympics, dude. [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11066.460000000001s)]

*  That's also a dumb guy. [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11074.460000000001s)]
*  To beat their ass. [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11076.460000000001s)]

*  They could be like really handicapped. [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11080.460000000001s)]
*  That's what they are to do that. [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11082.460000000001s)]
*  Same as the stolen valor people. [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11084.460000000001s)]
*  Just homeless people. [[03:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11086.460000000001s)]
*  I don't know, I found a green shirt. [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11088.460000000001s)]
*  I found a green shirt and I put it in the Salem witch trials. [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11091.3s)]
*  How? [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11093.3s)]
*  Because these two women kept calling out their witches, their witches, their witches. [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11095.3s)]
*  And eventually they were like, their witches! [[03:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11097.3s)]
*  And people just kept walking. [[03:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11099.3s)]
*  Women ruin everything! [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11101.3s)]
*  Even the Salem witch trials. [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11103.3s)]
*  Even the greatest moment of our history. [[03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11105.3s)]
*  That was pretty sick, dude. [[03:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11107.3s)]
*  You gotta ignore it. [[03:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11109.3s)]
*  Imagine how nice that'd be to fuck a chick and be like, nah, fucking kill her. [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11111.3s)]
*  I don't want that secret getting out. [[03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11113.3s)]
*  Bring that lady. [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11115.3s)]
*  Bar that shit. [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11117.3s)]
*  She's a witch. [[03:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11120.14s)]
*  You know what the cause of that stuff was, right? [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11122.14s)]
*  The fucking grain? [[03:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11124.14s)]
*  Ergot. [[03:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11126.14s)]
*  What does that mean? [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11128.14s)]
*  There was an early frost. [[03:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11130.14s)]
*  And sometimes when they have an early frost, they'll have high concentrations of ergot, which is a psychedelic chemical. [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11132.14s)]
*  So these people are essentially eating tainted grain, tainted beers. [[03:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11138.14s)]
*  There's stuff that had ergot poisoning. [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11142.14s)]
*  And ergot poisoning can kill you, but it can also make you trip balls. [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11144.14s)]
*  So it's very similar, apparently, to LSD. [[03:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11148.98s)]
*  So these people were drinking beer and eating bread. [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11150.98s)]
*  And getting fucked up. [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11154.98s)]
*  Taking some soup and then your wife flies out the window. [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11156.98s)]
*  And you're like, what the fuck? [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11158.98s)]
*  And you don't know what's going on. You think witches are real. [[03:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11160.98s)]
*  I love it. [[03:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11162.98s)]
*  Can we replace the stone ape theory that we've heard for 20 years with this new fact? [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11164.98s)]
*  Ergot! [[03:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11166.98s)]
*  It's the same exact thing. [[03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11168.98s)]
*  It's real similar. [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11170.98s)]
*  Because this is like, when I was in Greece recently, I told you about this, right? [[03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11172.98s)]
*  We went to a couple different places. [[03:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11177.82s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[03:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11179.82s)]
*  We went to... [[03:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11181.82s)]
*  The Acropolis? [[03:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11183.82s)]
*  Yeah, the site of the Illusenian mysteries. That was the wildest one. [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11185.82s)]
*  That's where they were doing these psychedelics. [[03:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11187.82s)]
*  And this is what Brian Murorescu's book, The Immortality Keys, is about. [[03:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11189.82s)]
*  So we go to this place where they invented democracy. [[03:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11191.82s)]
*  They invented everything. [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11193.82s)]
*  And they did it most likely while they were tripping balls. [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11195.82s)]
*  It's just very funny to admit or invent democracy. [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11199.82s)]
*  Look, maybe everybody in this room should decide what we do. [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11201.82s)]
*  Maybe we could have a fucking system where everyone gets an equal say. [[03:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11206.66s)]
*  What if there's five of us here? [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11210.66s)]
*  One, fifth. [[03:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11212.66s)]
*  Well how does that exist without tripping balls? [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11214.66s)]
*  Yeah, without tripping balls. [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11216.66s)]
*  Like, wait, but I own land. I know, I know. Good job for that. [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11218.66s)]
*  But yeah, I could kick you guys. [[03:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11220.66s)]
*  I guess you'd decide. [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11222.66s)]
*  That's how it was done forever. [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11224.66s)]
*  Until these guys started tripping balls. [[03:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11226.66s)]
*  And no one who's not tripping balls is going to come up with a system like that. [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11228.66s)]
*  And that's our number one problem with politicians today. [[03:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11230.66s)]
*  No one trips balls. [[03:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11232.66s)]
*  No one trips! [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11235.5s)]
*  None of these people are trippers. [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11237.5s)]
*  So none of these people have this idea. [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11239.5s)]
*  Biden trips. [[03:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11241.5s)]
*  He trips a lot. [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11243.5s)]
*  It's more like a stumble in a face plant. [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11245.5s)]
*  Joe, you should get every presidential candidate in here and trip fucking balls. [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11247.5s)]
*  Oh, that would be big. [[03:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11251.5s)]
*  Lock the doors. [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11253.5s)]
*  Who would you like to get do mushrooms with the most? [[03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11255.5s)]
*  Well, Trump would be interesting. [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11259.5s)]
*  With? I don't want to wash anybody. [[03:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11261.5s)]
*  Do mushrooms, like do a breakthrough dose. [[03:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11264.34s)]
*  A giant dose with one president. [[03:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11266.34s)]
*  Oh shit. [[03:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11268.34s)]
*  Who would it be? Lincoln. [[03:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11270.34s)]
*  Yeah, but alive, like someone who exists right now. [[03:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11272.34s)]
*  Like you could actually make it happen. [[03:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11274.34s)]
*  I'd like to talk to Bill about what he did. [[03:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11276.34s)]
*  Yeah, Bill would be good. [[03:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11278.34s)]

*  For sure. [[03:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11364.86s)]
*  That's part of the beauty of this all. [[03:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11366.86s)]
*  What did you say about my president? [[03:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11368.86s)]
*  Bob Dylan's thinking about the same shit that's happening now. [[03:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11370.86s)]
*  Oh I blocked that. [[03:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11372.86s)]
*  The thing is, there's crooked and there's like legal crooked. [[03:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11374.86s)]
*  There's all sorts of things. [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11376.86s)]
*  There's a lot. [[03:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11379.7s)]
*  But they're like, there's an incriminated crime. [[03:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11381.7s)]
*  We can't prosecute them. [[03:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11383.7s)]
*  There's a lot of legal crooked. [[03:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11385.7s)]
*  We're all aware. Like Congress fucking insider trading. [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11387.7s)]
*  It's legal crooked. [[03:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11389.7s)]
*  You can't charge them for it because it's not illegal. [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11391.7s)]
*  But Jesus Christ, what are you doing? [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11393.7s)]
*  And they're the ones controlling whether it's illegal. [[03:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11395.7s)]
*  They're also buying stock when they know that they're going to pass decisions. [[03:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11397.7s)]
*  It's all crazy. [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11401.7s)]
*  They're quiet. Don't get why anybody votes. [[03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11403.7s)]
*  It's a fucking crooked system you're entering into. [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11405.7s)]
*  Why even bother? [[03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11408.54s)]
*  Lesser of two evils I guess. [[03:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11410.54s)]
*  It's all people they're giving you. They're both fucked. [[03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11412.54s)]
*  Just live your life. [[03:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11414.54s)]
*  Get a new system. [[03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11416.54s)]
*  I don't want Trump to win just because I don't want to talk about Trump for the next four years. [[03:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11418.54s)]
*  That's what Jay said. [[03:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11420.54s)]
*  He likes Biden better because I don't have to talk about it as much. [[03:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11422.54s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want to talk about politics. [[03:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11424.54s)]
*  That's a good point. [[03:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11426.54s)]
*  Bro, they put Martha Stewart in jail for what? [[03:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11428.54s)]
*  What did she do? [[03:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11430.54s)]
*  Insider trading. [[03:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11432.54s)]
*  She knew about something and she goes, I'm investing anyway. [[03:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11434.54s)]
*  What I said after you signed your Spotify deal, [[03:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11437.380000000001s)]
*  on every podcast, I was like, yeah, he told me he was going to sign it. [[03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11439.380000000001s)]
*  So I invested most of my money in it. [[03:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11441.380000000001s)]
*  People are like, that's what I'm talking about. [[03:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11443.380000000001s)]
*  If you think I even know who to call to invest, you're crazy. [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11445.380000000001s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[03:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11447.380000000001s)]
*  But that's what's great about America. [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11449.380000000001s)]

*  Would it be insider trading if I bought Spotify stock? [[03:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11453.380000000001s)]
*  Me? [[03:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11455.380000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[03:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11457.380000000001s)]

*  I'm going to be able to do that. [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11461.380000000001s)]
*  I'm going to be able to do that. [[03:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11463.380000000001s)]
*  Me? Of course. [[03:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11466.22s)]
*  That's Pete Rowe's shit. [[03:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11468.22s)]
*  Because you have an idea why I would. [[03:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11470.22s)]
*  It seems cocky. [[03:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11472.22s)]
*  One of the founders of the company, Dr. Samuel Waxall, [[03:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11474.22s)]

*  Oh, the other way. [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11480.22s)]
*  Before the FDA made the announcement and the stock price dropped in price. [[03:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11482.22s)]
*  But wait, hold on. [[03:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11486.22s)]
*  Why would it be weird for you or illegal for you to say, [[03:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11488.22s)]
*  oh, I'm about to join this company. [[03:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11490.22s)]
*  Let me buy a bunch. [[03:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11492.22s)]
*  That's just insider knowledge. [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11495.06s)]
*  It could have gone down. [[03:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11497.06s)]
*  Yeah, you could have been like, fuck that, dude. [[03:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11499.06s)]
*  I'm not using Spotify. [[03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11501.06s)]
*  It's obvious in retrospect, but at the time, there was no guarantee that it would go up. [[03:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11503.06s)]
*  No. [[03:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11505.06s)]
*  True. [[03:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11507.06s)]

*  People were like, hey, that's a bad idea. [[03:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11511.06s)]
*  A lot of people were like, this is a bad idea. [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11513.06s)]
*  It would have been way better. [[03:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11515.06s)]

*  You gotta go two hands on the hammer. [[03:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11653.26s)]
*  Sense resistance, two hands on the hammer. [[03:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11655.26s)]
*  But that's a real alcoholic. [[03:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11657.26s)]

*  This is the first real leg break in the wrong place. [[03:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11926.98s)]
*  Lawrence Taylor. [[03:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11932.98s)]
*  Flee flicker action. [[03:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11934.98s)]
*  No, you've got to show the close up. [[03:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11936.98s)]
*  Lawrence Taylor called in fucking an airlift. [[03:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11938.98s)]
*  Here we go. [[03:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11944.98s)]
*  Oh! [[03:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11946.98s)]
*  Shout out Jamie Free-Spring. [[03:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11948.98s)]
*  Wow. [[03:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11950.98s)]
*  God almighty. [[03:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11952.98s)]
*  That snapped. [[03:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11955.82s)]
*  You didn't pronounce his name like Theismann. [[03:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11957.82s)]
*  They changed it at No-Dame so he could win the Heismann. [[03:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11959.82s)]
*  He was Theismann. [[03:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11961.82s)]
*  Joe Theismann. [[03:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11963.82s)]
*  And then he didn't win the Heismann. [[03:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11965.82s)]
*  He broke his fucking leg. [[03:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11967.82s)]
*  Did he come back from that? [[03:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11969.82s)]
*  How long did it take? [[03:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11971.82s)]
*  He was done for. [[03:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11973.82s)]
*  Did he come back at all? [[03:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11975.82s)]
*  He walks now. [[03:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11977.82s)]
*  No UFC fighter other than Anderson Silva's had multiple fights. [[03:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11979.82s)]
*  With having that surgery and being successful. [[03:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11984.66s)]
*  Anderson wasn't even one fight after that. [[03:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11986.66s)]
*  How was Conor? [[03:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11988.66s)]
*  Conor will be all right. [[03:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11990.66s)]
*  We don't know. [[03:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11992.66s)]
*  We don't know until he fights. [[03:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11994.66s)]
*  Chris Weidman, there was a lot of hope for Chris Weidman. [[03:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11996.66s)]
*  But he looked like he was having troubles. [[03:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=11998.66s)]
*  It's hard to say. [[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12000.66s)]
*  It's hard to say how much it was Brad Tavares. [[03:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12002.66s)]
*  Who's a bad motherfucker. [[03:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12004.66s)]
*  85, Theismann suffered a compound fracture. [[03:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12006.66s)]
*  The tibia and the fibula in his right leg when he was sacked by Lyme. [[03:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12008.66s)]
*  Career ending injury. [[03:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12011.5s)]
*  That was it. [[03:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12013.5s)]
*  What's he doing now? [[03:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12015.5s)]
*  WTEM. [[03:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12017.5s)]
*  It's a real hard one to break and come back from. [[03:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12019.5s)]
*  Tyrone Spong broke it in a kickboxing match against Gokan Saki. [[03:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12021.5s)]
*  It's another rough one. [[03:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12023.5s)]
*  I bet you still sort of feel it every time you plant. [[03:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12025.5s)]
*  You're joking, right? [[03:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12027.5s)]
*  That leg breaking one. [[03:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12029.5s)]
*  That's a great one. [[03:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12031.5s)]
*  I'm saying Gokan Saki. [[03:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12033.5s)]
*  That's the one. [[03:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12035.5s)]
*  It can't be. [[03:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12037.5s)]
*  He kicks him, right? [[03:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12040.34s)]
*  Yeah, he kicks him and his leg's snapped in half. [[03:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12042.34s)]
*  He's come back and he's done some boxing. [[03:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12044.34s)]
*  I think he did one MMA fight. [[03:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12046.34s)]
*  I don't know how many kicks he threw. [[03:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12048.34s)]
*  He got taken down a bunch. [[03:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12050.34s)]
*  There's also an NBA one that's pretty wild. [[03:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12052.34s)]
*  Shock of the beater. [[03:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12054.34s)]
*  I think that leg bone down there is just real vulnerable. [[03:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12056.34s)]
*  When they put it back together again, I don't think it's ever quite the same. [[03:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12060.34s)]
*  Here we go. [[03:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12064.34s)]
*  Don't make me fucking keep seeing that. [[03:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12066.34s)]
*  How does that happen? [[03:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12069.18s)]
*  Kevin aware, right? [[03:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12071.18s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[03:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12073.18s)]
*  Did he ever come back? [[03:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12075.18s)]
*  He came back. [[03:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12077.18s)]
*  Nobody even hit him. [[03:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12079.18s)]
*  What a fucking loser. [[03:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12081.18s)]
*  That makes you want to lay down for the rest of your life. [[03:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12083.18s)]
*  It's not so crazy how weird your body's so vulnerable. [[03:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12085.18s)]
*  Basic, like no chance block. [[03:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12089.18s)]
*  Normal shit. He's probably done that a hundred thousand times. [[03:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12091.18s)]
*  Don't keep doing this, Jamie. [[03:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12093.18s)]
*  Jamie, please. [[03:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12095.18s)]
*  Jamie, have some respect for humanity. [[03:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12098.02s)]
*  Oh my god, dude. [[03:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12100.02s)]
*  I cracked my little one. [[03:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12102.02s)]
*  Not the tibia, but the fibula. [[03:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12104.02s)]
*  I cracked that one once. [[03:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12106.02s)]
*  I got kicked with a heel that dug right into that thing. [[03:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12108.02s)]
*  I had a hairline fracture of it. [[03:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12111.02s)]
*  It lasted for a while. [[03:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12113.02s)]
*  I fought in a tournament with it. [[03:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12115.02s)]
*  I put soccer pads on it. [[03:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12117.02s)]
*  Those hard soccer pads. [[03:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12119.02s)]
*  I put those over and taped it on. [[03:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12121.02s)]
*  I was at the first Anderson one. [[03:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12123.02s)]
*  It didn't make sense. [[03:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12125.02s)]
*  He wraps around like a wet sock. [[03:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12127.86s)]
*  The crazy thing is, Anderson did that. [[03:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12129.86s)]
*  It happened to Anderson on Chris Weidman. [[03:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12133.86s)]
*  Then Chris Weidman did it on Uriah Hall. [[03:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12137.86s)]
*  It's such a rare injury. [[03:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12139.86s)]
*  For one guy to be involved in two of those. [[03:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12141.86s)]
*  In his whole career, it's kind of nuts. [[03:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12143.86s)]
*  It's kind of like the Lincoln. [[03:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12145.86s)]
*  JFK was shot in the Lincoln. [[03:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12147.86s)]
*  The Lincoln was shot at Kennedy Theatre. [[03:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12149.86s)]
*  Ford Theatre. [[03:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12152.7s)]
*  I got some here. [[03:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12154.7s)]
*  Kennedy drove a Ford. [[03:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12156.7s)]
*  Kennedy drove a Ford. [[03:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12158.7s)]
*  Ford fucked Lincoln. [[03:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12160.7s)]
*  Who killed Bush. [[03:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12162.7s)]
*  I thought if anybody was going to have a good shot at coming back, it was going to be Weidman. [[03:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12164.7s)]
*  Because he's such an animal. [[03:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12168.7s)]
*  If anybody figures it out, it might be Weidman. [[03:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12170.7s)]
*  It wasn't his speed also. [[03:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12172.7s)]
*  It was just like, potential. [[03:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12174.7s)]
*  It was a good shot. [[03:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12176.7s)]
*  It wasn't his speed also. [[03:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12179.54s)]
*  DeVars is fucking good. [[03:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12181.54s)]
*  You keep going, put your headphones on. [[03:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12183.54s)]
*  Oh yeah, you're going to want headphones for that. [[03:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12185.54s)]
*  They had an assistant named Kennedy, an assistant named Lincoln. [[03:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12187.54s)]
*  There's all types of... [[03:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12191.54s)]
*  But he was in a Lincoln when he got shot. [[03:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12193.54s)]
*  Hold on. [[03:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12195.54s)]
*  They're not all accurate. [[03:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12197.54s)]
*  Some of it's bullshit. [[03:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12199.54s)]
*  Of course it is. [[03:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12201.54s)]
*  It was back before the internet. [[03:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12203.54s)]
*  But the CIA didn't kill Lincoln. [[03:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12205.54s)]
*  Hey, what's the greatest bullshit story before the internet? [[03:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12208.380000000001s)]

*  What's the primary source of that? [[03:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12243.22s)]
*  Because I had heard that... [[03:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12247.22s)]
*  Was Richard Gere a Scientologist? [[03:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12249.22s)]

*  We know that, but was Richard Gere a Scientologist? [[03:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12261.22s)]
*  Yeah, but even if he did the Buddhist way... [[03:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12263.22s)]
*  He did the Buddhist movie and it became Buddhist and right after that it came out. [[03:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12266.06s)]
*  So that's what they say. [[03:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12270.06s)]
*  Interesting. [[03:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12272.06s)]
*  So wait, do you think he actually shoved the gerbil up his ass? [[03:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12274.06s)]
*  Yes. [[03:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12276.06s)]
*  According to that theory he's like, let me tell you everything I've done. [[03:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12278.06s)]
*  I thought they'd bring it up, Jamie. [[03:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12280.06s)]
*  To smear him because he left. [[03:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12282.06s)]
*  No, no, no. [[03:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12284.06s)]
*  Exposing his real shit. [[03:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12286.06s)]
*  It'd be like if you were like, I actually did get the vaccine. [[03:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12288.06s)]
*  Can you imagine if that's what you were into? [[03:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12290.06s)]
*  Joe Rogan got the vaccine. [[03:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12292.06s)]
*  Take the vaccine, get boosters, get boosters, get boosters. [[03:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12294.9s)]
*  Shout out to the CIA dude, they'll give me 50 fucking thousand dollars to say this. [[03:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12298.9s)]
*  If you're not getting vaccine, it's literally like holding a loaded gun to someone's head. [[03:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12300.9s)]
*  It really is. [[03:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12306.9s)]
*  And you can get a free Shake Shack from De Blasio if you get a booster. [[03:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12308.9s)]
*  Yo, what's up? [[03:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12310.9s)]
*  Well yeah, that was the first viral before viral. [[03:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12314.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12316.9s)]
*  Marilyn Manson's ribs. [[03:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12318.9s)]
*  So was he definitely a Scientologist, Jamie? [[03:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12320.9s)]
*  Richard Gere? [[03:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12323.74s)]
*  What do they got on fucking Tom Cruise then? [[03:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12325.74s)]
*  He's a Scientologist. [[03:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12327.74s)]
*  He's running that show over there. [[03:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12329.74s)]
*  He's running that show over there. [[03:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12331.74s)]
*  Will Smith? [[03:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12333.74s)]
*  He could shut it down. [[03:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12335.74s)]
*  He's probably the number one reason why new people walk through the door. [[03:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12337.74s)]
*  That's true. [[03:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12339.74s)]
*  I want to be that fucking guy from Mission Impossible. [[03:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12341.74s)]
*  I want to wear braces when I'm 50. [[03:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12343.74s)]
*  Let's go. [[03:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12345.74s)]
*  So many of my friends love Tom Cruise. [[03:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12347.74s)]
*  He rules. [[03:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12349.74s)]
*  Go watch Interview with the Vampire. [[03:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12352.58s)]
*  No, I understand there's greatness before. [[03:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12354.58s)]
*  Tropic Thunder? [[03:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12356.58s)]
*  He's amazing in that. [[03:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12358.58s)]
*  First try at comedy and it nailed it. [[03:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12360.58s)]
*  Nailed it. The dance, everything. [[03:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12362.58s)]
*  Bro, he's fucking great. [[03:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12364.58s)]
*  I'm not saying he's not great. [[03:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12366.58s)]
*  I'm saying he's slightly overrated. [[03:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12368.58s)]
*  I think if he was a Catholic, you'd fucking love him. [[03:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12370.58s)]
*  I mean, obviously. [[03:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12372.58s)]
*  But then he'd be Danny and Dave Lewis. [[03:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12374.58s)]
*  So what does that say? [[03:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12376.58s)]
*  Richard Gere's one of the most outspoken religious celebrities and religious choices Buddhism. [[03:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12378.58s)]
*  Gere was raised in a Methodist home and studied philosophy in his short-lived college stint. [[03:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12381.42s)]
*  But it seems religion is always interested in him. [[03:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12383.42s)]
*  But it became enraptured with Buddhism, [[03:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12385.42s)]
*  attributed to the Paul in the late 70s. [[03:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12387.42s)]
*  Okay, so he was never in Scientology? [[03:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12389.42s)]
*  No, no, you've got to look up Scientology in Richard Gere. [[03:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12391.42s)]
*  Damn, it sucks you get so high. [[03:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12393.42s)]
*  You telling Jamie how to become Buddhist? [[03:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12395.42s)]
*  First a list comes up that says there's people that quit. [[03:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12397.42s)]
*  And then he wasn't on the list. [[03:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12399.42s)]
*  This says he never officially converted. [[03:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12401.42s)]
*  Okay, so he probably... [[03:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12403.42s)]
*  Never officially converted. [[03:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12405.42s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. That was not him. [[03:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12407.42s)]
*  Wow, Richard Gere. [[03:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12410.26s)]
*  He was king, dude. [[03:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12412.26s)]
*  Did he fuck Madonna? [[03:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12414.26s)]
*  Who did? [[03:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12416.26s)]
*  He also fucked a gerbil. [[03:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12418.26s)]
*  But if he's... [[03:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12420.26s)]
*  Who would have fucked a gerbil? [[03:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12422.26s)]
*  And I made, that guy rules. [[03:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12424.26s)]
*  But if he dabbled in Scientology and then left, that might have been enough. [[03:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12426.26s)]
*  They already had him. [[03:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12428.26s)]
*  Day one, they got you. [[03:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12430.26s)]
*  As soon as you do the fucking clearance test. [[03:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12432.26s)]
*  Because a lot of people dabbled. [[03:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12434.26s)]
*  I think Seinfeld even dabbled in it. [[03:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12436.26s)]
*  That's all Richard Gerhamster's free. [[03:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12439.1s)]
*  Did you talk to Seinfeld about it? [[03:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12441.1s)]
*  No. [[03:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12443.1s)]
*  He dabbled in Scientology for a while. [[03:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12445.1s)]
*  Yeah, he tried it. [[03:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12447.1s)]
*  You know what it is? [[03:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12449.1s)]
*  I was watching an infomercial in 1994. [[03:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12451.1s)]
*  And they had that Dianetics book. [[03:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12453.1s)]
*  I didn't even know that was Scientology. [[03:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12455.1s)]
*  I thought, how to fucking improve your life. [[03:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12457.1s)]
*  So I order it and bro, they never stop sending me shit. [[03:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12459.1s)]
*  They were sending me shit and I was like, [[03:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12461.1s)]
*  I'm going to go to the bathroom. [[03:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12463.1s)]
*  I'm going to go to the bathroom. [[03:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12465.1s)]
*  They were sending me shit. [[03:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12467.94s)]
*  I didn't even read it. [[03:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12469.94s)]
*  I went out and played pool. [[03:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12471.94s)]
*  You're Tom Cruise. [[03:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12473.94s)]
*  They just had you. [[03:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12475.94s)]
*  They were like, if you showed a moment of weakness, we'll get you. [[03:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12477.94s)]
*  They had my address. [[03:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12479.94s)]
*  They just kept sending me shit, man. [[03:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12481.94s)]
*  Every time I'd get the mail, it would be like, more shit from Scientology. [[03:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12483.94s)]
*  More invitations to conferences. [[03:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12485.94s)]
*  This is the same way I am with your dumb fucking ivermectum recommendation. [[03:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12487.94s)]
*  They don't stop calling you. [[03:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12489.94s)]
*  Oh, it's Stallone's idea. [[03:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12491.94s)]
*  That's what Richard Gerhamster thought for a while. [[03:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12493.94s)]
*  Stallone thinks that Richard Gere is still mad at him for starting that whole [[03:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12496.78s)]
*  gerbil in that, well, you know story. [[03:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12498.78s)]
*  Wow, my god. [[03:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12500.78s)]
*  Stallone has denied it, though, but that's as far as some research can go. [[03:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12502.78s)]
*  That's awesome. [[03:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12504.78s)]
*  Stallone started it. [[03:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12506.78s)]
*  It says, Gere believes that Sly started the ridiculous urban legend about Gere and the gerbil. [[03:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12508.78s)]
*  Here's the deal. [[03:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12512.78s)]
*  Gere and Stallone were on the set of the 1974 Lord of the Flatbush. [[03:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12514.78s)]
*  The two actors got into a tiff over lunch one day. [[03:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12518.78s)]
*  Something about chicken grease, Sly's thigh, and a hot dog. [[03:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12520.78s)]
*  Whereupon Stallone emboweled him. [[03:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12525.62s)]
*  Elbowed. [[03:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12527.62s)]
*  Oh, elbowed him. [[03:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12529.62s)]
*  Far different. [[03:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12531.62s)]
*  Elbowed him on the side of the head. [[03:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12533.62s)]
*  The tension between the two actors became so fevered that Gere got kicked off the film, [[03:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12535.62s)]
*  which still angers him today. [[03:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12537.62s)]
*  Apparently to this day, he seriously dislikes me, says Sly, who adds, for the record, that he did not start the rodent rumor. [[03:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12539.62s)]
*  You know, he shoved the fucking gerbil up his butt. [[03:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12545.62s)]
*  I just want to say, for the record, I didn't start that rumor. [[03:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12549.62s)]
*  He for sure started that rumor. [[03:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12554.460000000001s)]
*  100% he started that rumor. [[03:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12556.460000000001s)]
*  I didn't start it, right? [[03:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12558.460000000001s)]
*  How strong was that rumor? [[03:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12560.460000000001s)]
*  It was the strongest one. [[03:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12562.460000000001s)]
*  That rumor made it to me in Boston and made it to Eddie Bravo in LA. [[03:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12564.460000000001s)]
*  Me and Sly, the only Sly could have done this. [[03:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12566.460000000001s)]
*  It has to be. You have to have a high profile. [[03:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12568.460000000001s)]
*  God, how did we all get it? [[03:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12570.460000000001s)]
*  It was true. It had to be true. [[03:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12572.460000000001s)]
*  That's kind of that theory. [[03:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12574.460000000001s)]
*  If they started a rumor about you that you're gay, it wouldn't catch on. [[03:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12576.460000000001s)]
*  Same thing with you. It wouldn't catch on. [[03:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12578.460000000001s)]
*  No chance it would catch on with me. [[03:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12580.460000000001s)]
*  That's a gay guy. [[03:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12583.3s)]
*  That's why it catches on. [[03:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12585.3s)]
*  If it's like, oh, this guy did this, it doesn't catch on. [[03:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12587.3s)]
*  Oh, that one it sticks to. [[03:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12589.3s)]
*  I gotta be honest with you guys, me and Jamie kissed at the mothership last night. [[03:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12591.3s)]
*  Nice. [[03:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12593.3s)]
*  I made out with him at Midsies. [[03:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12595.3s)]
*  I grabbed him by the back of his fucking hair and we kissed. [[03:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12597.3s)]
*  Stop it. [[03:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12599.3s)]
*  The Richard Deer caught on because it's true. [[03:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12601.3s)]
*  Jamie, you're being nasty. [[03:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12603.3s)]
*  I don't think it caught on because it's true. I think it caught on because Sly made it up. [[03:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12605.3s)]
*  Sly is the man. [[03:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12607.3s)]
*  Imagine how you would feel. [[03:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12609.3s)]
*  Knowing that the body of your enemy really did fly by in the water. [[03:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12612.14s)]
*  Knowing that the body of your enemy really did fly by in the water. [[03:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12614.14s)]
*  He really did get him. [[03:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12616.14s)]
*  Got him with that one. [[03:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12618.14s)]
*  I wonder what they argued about. [[03:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12620.14s)]
*  Who did he tell? How did he get it out? [[03:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12622.14s)]
*  When they took out the grease in the hot tub. [[03:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12624.14s)]
*  How did he get that out? [[03:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12626.14s)]
*  Was it a foreign policy conversation? [[03:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12628.14s)]
*  For real though, if that argument was just them in a fight and then Sly went around telling everybody that he shoved the gerbil up his ass, that's genius. [[03:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12630.14s)]
*  That's genius. [[03:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12638.14s)]
*  That's so smart that I don't think Sylvester Stone did it. [[03:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12640.98s)]
*  What an out of nowhere. [[03:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12642.98s)]
*  He's not stupid. He wrote Rocky. [[03:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12644.98s)]
*  He's very smart. [[03:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12646.98s)]
*  He did gay porn before that. [[03:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12648.98s)]
*  He did porn. [[03:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12650.98s)]
*  He did softcore. [[03:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12652.98s)]
*  National Enquirer Gossip Columnist said he never worked harder in his life trying to confirm that story. [[03:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12654.98s)]
*  Nothing more than an urban legend referring to not only the Richard Deer story but gerbiling as a whole. [[03:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12660.98s)]
*  Gerbiling! [[03:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12669.82s)]
*  There is no gerbiling. [[03:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12671.82s)]
*  Like falconing? [[03:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12673.82s)]
*  There is no gerbiling? [[03:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12675.82s)]
*  I think R.F.K. Jr. is a falconist. [[03:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12679.82s)]
*  Really? [[03:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12681.82s)]

*  I don't love that. [[03:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12685.82s)]
*  How cool is falconing? [[03:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12687.82s)]
*  It's about as cool as gerbiling. [[03:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12689.82s)]
*  There's a lawyer that insists it's real. [[03:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12691.82s)]
*  Of course it's real. [[03:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12693.82s)]
*  While it's colloquially called gerbiling, [[03:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12695.82s)]
*  the actual name from a medical mental health point of view is formicophilia, [[03:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12698.66s)]
*  which involves not just gerbils but other kinds of small critters as well. [[03:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12704.66s)]
*  This is a form of bestiality which essentially deals with things crawled on you or in you. [[03:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12708.66s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[03:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12714.66s)]
*  I saw a video of a snake being pulled out of someone's body. [[03:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12716.66s)]

*  Donkey. [[03:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12826.02s)]
*  Medieval time they were closer to ponies. [[03:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12828.02s)]
*  They were riding into battle, they were riding Shetland ponies. [[03:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12830.02s)]
*  I'm going sheep all day. [[03:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12832.02s)]

*  By the way I was just fucking around about fucking those horses. [[03:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12842.86s)]
*  You know what's crazy about horses? [[03:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12844.86s)]
*  I'd fuck a brown bear. [[03:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12846.86s)]
*  All horses came from North America. [[03:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12848.86s)]
*  But then they all got wiped out. [[03:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12850.86s)]
*  But they had already taken them to other countries. [[03:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12852.86s)]
*  So all the horses like me. [[03:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12854.86s)]
*  Yeah they all started out in America. [[03:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12856.86s)]
*  After 1482? [[03:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12858.86s)]
*  And then they got reintroduced by the Europeans. [[03:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12860.86s)]
*  That's not true. [[03:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12862.86s)]
*  It is true. [[03:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12864.86s)]
*  Horses evolved. [[03:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12866.86s)]
*  The species of horse evolved in North America. [[03:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12868.86s)]
*  But he's saying shit that's wrong. [[03:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12871.7s)]
*  He's talking and he's incorrect. [[03:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12873.7s)]
*  No they died. [[03:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12875.7s)]
*  They went extinct in North America. [[03:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12877.7s)]
*  But they had already made it over to Eurasia. [[03:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12879.7s)]
*  Across the Bering Strait, Eurasia on boats. [[03:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12881.7s)]
*  They had got horses to these other countries. [[03:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12883.7s)]
*  Something about 1492. [[03:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12885.7s)]
*  So horses, a lot of places where they were using horses. [[03:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12887.7s)]
*  Horses didn't come from there. [[03:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12889.7s)]
*  They literally came from North America. [[03:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12891.7s)]
*  And they came back after Columbus. [[03:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12893.7s)]
*  So what does a horse come from? [[03:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12895.7s)]
*  No stupid asshole. [[03:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12897.7s)]
*  Not after Columbus came? [[03:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12900.54s)]
*  No. [[03:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12902.54s)]
*  But then they came back after Columbus came. [[03:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12904.54s)]
*  Post-Columbia. [[03:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=12906.54s)]

*  From the 50s. Oh [[04:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=15993.9s)]

*  Of course not much stop, but sometimes there's fights like that every now and then a fight breaks out like amateur fights in Ireland [[04:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16019.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I mean, it's not gonna be a good day's indeed. Yeah, I don't think it was an amateur, but it was still [[04:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16026.460000000001s)]
*  You know like yeah, that's a little bit of a scenario that could have seen that happen in fights [[04:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16033.6s)]
*  That pitching movie was pretty shitty but as a golf he was pretty good. Yeah, remember Paul, you know [[04:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16038.900000000001s)]
*  When did this go away remember this why did that go away? Oh, yeah [[04:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16046.900000000001s)]
*  I can tell you if you want to know black people [[04:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16052.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[04:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16054.52s)]
*  Let's hear because they didn't have gloves on and when you don't have gloves on one of the things you realize really early on [[04:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16054.820000000002s)]
*  Is that you break these knuckles when you swing wild punches you catch people in their? [[04:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16060.2s)]
*  Catch people in the foreheads you're gonna fuck your fucking hands up like almost all the time [[04:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16065.619999999999s)]
*  So a lot of guys learned how to just kind of jab at you with these knuckles [[04:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16070.06s)]
*  No, no, this is the way you punched me [[04:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16076.78s)]
*  They would jab at each other with these knuckles so they stand there like this and they jab at each other with these knuckles [[04:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16079.02s)]
*  These knuckles can tolerate and these knuckles can't these knuckles break these over here break and which can to these two right here [[04:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16085.1s)]
*  These are the ones these are the ones okay breaking bricks [[04:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16095.58s)]
*  Yeah, I cracked this one once and I didn't even have to have surgery on it. They're thick. It's like a thick bone [[04:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16100.26s)]
*  It'll heal up. Yeah, but a lot of guys they break these down here. They break this down here [[04:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16105.22s)]
*  So what guys figured out how to do is to kind of jab each other with these bare knuckles [[04:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16110.699999999999s)]
*  And if you watch like bare knuckle boxing like they're kind of doing that now a little bit [[04:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16116.1s)]
*  Tense up and they're throwing big punches like a box or two [[04:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16120.539999999999s)]
*  But they're also kind of jabbing each other every now and then with knuckles [[04:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16124.179999999998s)]
*  Because you want to catch them with just these front two those you're really your primary weapons in your hand if you hit someone [[04:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16127.9s)]
*  Right here with the pinky on the forehead. It's touch-and-go man. You could shatter your whole hand [[04:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16134.14s)]
*  Oh, and then you have one hand. That's why I stick to slapping [[04:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16138.099999999999s)]
*  What was that? [[04:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16141.5s)]
*  Because these guys [[04:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16143.62s)]
*  This is a different story here because their hands are very wrapped like their knuckles are covered so their hands are protected [[04:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16149.3s)]
*  Yeah, so concrete what they're doing right here is a different thing [[04:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16155.78s)]
*  Damn [[04:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjw2-fygQA&t=16160.46s)]
