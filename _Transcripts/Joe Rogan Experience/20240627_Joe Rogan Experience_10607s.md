*  Hawaii, Wyoming. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=417.0s)]
*  Hawaii? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=419.0s)]
*  Mexico, West Virginia. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=421.0s)]
*  Hawaii, Wyoming, New Mexico, and West Virginia. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=423.0s)]
*  New Mexico is still getting after it. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=425.0s)]
*  It used to be Washington state [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=427.0s)]
*  up until that documentary, Zoo. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=429.0s)]
*  Do you know about that documentary? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=433.0s)]
*  No. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=435.0s)]
*  I'm new to the bestiality game. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=437.0s)]
*  There's a guy named... [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=439.0s)]
*  They called him Mr. Hands. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=441.0s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=443.0s)]
*  Mr. Hands got fucked to death by a horse. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=445.0s)]
*  So they made a documentary about it [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=447.0s)]
*  called Zoo. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=449.0s)]
*  That documentary is pretty interesting [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=451.0s)]
*  and it got very popular. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=453.0s)]
*  I want to say this is around [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=455.0s)]
*  the early 2000s, right? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=457.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=459.0s)]
*  If you haven't seen it, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=461.0s)]
*  you can just go Google Mr. Hands [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=463.0s)]
*  horse. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=465.0s)]
*  It's a tough one to watch. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=467.0s)]
*  When it gets in there, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=469.0s)]
*  you're like, how? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=471.0s)]
*  Where is it going? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=473.0s)]
*  What did you think was going to happen? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=475.0s)]
*  Well, he'd been fucked multiple times [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=477.0s)]
*  by that horse. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=479.0s)]
*  That apparently, the video [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=481.0s)]
*  was not the one that killed him. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=483.0s)]
*  It was another one that killed him. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=485.0s)]
*  That video was a successful... [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=487.0s)]
*  That was a success. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=489.0s)]
*  They got a gun. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=491.0s)]
*  The horse just jizzes immediately too. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=493.0s)]
*  Good God. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=495.0s)]
*  The best part is the guy [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=497.0s)]
*  who guide the horse dick [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=499.0s)]
*  into his butt, the guy goes, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=501.0s)]
*  too much? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=503.0s)]
*  When the guy makes the noise, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=505.0s)]
*  it's like, too much? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=507.0s)]
*  What the fuck do you think? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=509.0s)]
*  Is he a magician? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=511.0s)]
*  How is he making that dick disappear [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=513.0s)]
*  in his body? There's not enough room [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=515.0s)]
*  in his body. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=517.0s)]
*  He perforated his colon and just ruptured [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=519.0s)]
*  his innards and bled out from the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=521.0s)]
*  inside. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=523.0s)]
*  Then once they brought him to the hospital, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=525.0s)]
*  the cops are like, what the fuck happened? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=527.0s)]
*  What the fuck is going on? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=529.0s)]
*  I go, you know, stuff like [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=531.0s)]
*  going around, I don't know. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=533.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a tough one. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=535.0s)]
*  It's a tough one. It's a tough way to go. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=537.0s)]
*  Yeah, but also like [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=539.0s)]
*  there was hundreds of hours of footage. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=541.0s)]
*  It's pretty sad. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=543.0s)]
*  Thinking of like his mother, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=545.0s)]
*  you know, she gave birth holding that [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=547.0s)]
*  and just being like, someday this guy's gonna [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=549.0s)]
*  die from getting [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=551.0s)]
*  fucked by a horse. I bet she didn't [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=553.0s)]
*  think that. No one saw this coming. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=555.0s)]
*  Someday he's gonna be the president. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=557.0s)]
*  Yeah, this guy's gonna be the president. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=559.0s)]
*  Fuck my horse. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=561.0s)]
*  I think he was a software [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=563.0s)]
*  engineer or something. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=565.0s)]
*  He worked for Boeing. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=567.0s)]
*  So he was a very smart guy [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=569.0s)]
*  who just had [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=571.0s)]
*  a strange kink. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=573.0s)]
*  Kinks are fucking weird. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=575.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't have any. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=577.0s)]
*  I'm so lucky. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=579.0s)]
*  Imagine if you just like [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=581.0s)]
*  wanted to wear women's shoes and get fucked in the butt. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=583.0s)]
*  That's just your thing. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=587.0s)]
*  I'm straight, buddy. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=589.0s)]
*  He's got this thing, you know? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=591.0s)]
*  Yeah, thank God I don't have it. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=593.0s)]
*  I probably do. I'm not even trying. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=595.0s)]
*  Well, they say a lot of them, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=597.0s)]
*  they're imprinted on your early adolescence. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=599.0s)]
*  Like as your [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=601.0s)]
*  body is becoming sexual. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=603.0s)]
*  Nothing weird happened to me. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=605.0s)]
*  Luckily. Thank God. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=607.0s)]
*  I dodged two molestation attempts. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=609.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah, two. What'd you dodge? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=611.0s)]
*  Well, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=613.0s)]
*  I dodged one of them when I [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=615.0s)]
*  was probably like seven [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=617.0s)]
*  or eight years old. That was the scare. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=619.0s)]
*  Well, they were both pretty scary. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=621.0s)]
*  But that was the scarier one because I was at the library. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=623.0s)]
*  And I was by myself. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=625.0s)]
*  You know, I was a latch kid. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=627.0s)]
*  My parents just let me out of the house. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=629.0s)]
*  Which, you know, at the time [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=631.0s)]
*  was kind of normal. In retrospect, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=633.0s)]
*  like thinking about it now, I couldn't imagine [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=635.0s)]
*  letting my seven year old [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=637.0s)]
*  fucking wander around. Not just [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=639.0s)]
*  that, but walk to the public library. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=641.0s)]
*  In San Francisco. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=643.0s)]
*  And this guy, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=645.0s)]
*  I was looking at, you know, I was always into [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=647.0s)]
*  horror movies and [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=649.0s)]
*  monster movies and shit. And so I was [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=651.0s)]
*  reading these books in this, they had a [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=653.0s)]
*  section of monster books. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=655.0s)]
*  And this guy came up to me [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=657.0s)]
*  and he goes, do you like monster books? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=659.0s)]
*  I go, yeah. And he goes, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=661.0s)]
*  oh, I have some monster books in my car. You want to see them? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=663.0s)]
*  No. Okay. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=665.0s)]
*  I didn't know any better. I was [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=667.0s)]
*  fucking eight years old or whatever it was. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=669.0s)]
*  And as I'm leaving [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=671.0s)]
*  with this guy, the [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=673.0s)]
*  librarian starts [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=675.0s)]
*  screaming, Joseph, you get away from [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=677.0s)]
*  that man. You know, like [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=679.0s)]
*  that man just got out of jail. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=681.0s)]
*  And she yells at him [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=683.0s)]
*  to get out of there and the guy runs away and I just [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=685.0s)]
*  started crying and I was like, whoa. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=687.0s)]
*  So I dodged that bullet. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=689.0s)]
*  And then another time [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=691.0s)]
*  when I was 13, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=693.0s)]
*  when I was 13, we were hanging [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=695.0s)]
*  around this lake in [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=697.0s)]
*  Jamaica Plain. It was [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=699.0s)]
*  this like [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=701.0s)]
*  Jamaica pond was this [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=703.0s)]
*  place we would go and fish. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=705.0s)]
*  And there was another pond that was like this [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=707.0s)]
*  neighboring pond that was like slightly smaller. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=709.0s)]
*  And this guy was always [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=711.0s)]
*  like running around the lake. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=713.0s)]
*  He was jogging. And me and my friend [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=715.0s)]
*  Josh would be hanging out. This guy [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=717.0s)]
*  would come over and talk to us. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=719.0s)]
*  You know, he seemed like a super normal guy. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=721.0s)]
*  He used to be a teacher [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=723.0s)]
*  and he had retired and [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=725.0s)]
*  probably was like in his 60s. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=727.0s)]
*  And one day [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=729.0s)]
*  it's just me. He went for it. One day it's just [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=731.0s)]
*  me. And I'm [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=733.0s)]
*  fishing and he comes by and he's [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=735.0s)]
*  drunk. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=737.0s)]

*  been talking to this guy on and [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=749.0s)]
*  off. I had seen him, you know, for [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=751.0s)]
*  months. Yeah. Like you'd come by, say [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=753.0s)]
*  hi. It was always like casual, very [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=755.0s)]
*  good humored, very friendly. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=757.0s)]
*  But he was like setting us up. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=759.0s)]
*  And he comes by and [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=761.0s)]
*  then I realized after [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=763.0s)]
*  he tells me he loves me, but there can be no [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=765.0s)]
*  love without sex. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=767.0s)]
*  That's what he says. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=769.0s)]
*  And I'm like, what? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=771.0s)]
*  And I had a knife. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=773.0s)]
*  So I remember like I grabbed [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=775.0s)]
*  my knife in my pocket and I had my [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=777.0s)]
*  hand on my knife and I was like, oh my god, I'm going to [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=779.0s)]
*  have to stab this guy. Damn. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=781.0s)]
*  I was like, this is going to, because there was [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=783.0s)]
*  no one around. There was no one around. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=785.0s)]
*  Wow. There was just trees and [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=787.0s)]
*  forests. You were 13, you were like, I'm going to have to stab. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=789.0s)]
*  Oh, I was going to cut this guy. I would [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=791.0s)]
*  have trusted the guy. I would have been like, yeah, you're right. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=793.0s)]
*  You're smarter than me. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=795.0s)]
*  Well, I'll see you later. I don't know what [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=797.0s)]
*  to do. It was dangerous. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=799.0s)]
*  We had a guy go for us. There was a guy [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=801.0s)]
*  that used to linger. Hilarious, dude. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=803.0s)]
*  He was mentally challenged. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=805.0s)]
*  But he would always hang out around my high school. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=807.0s)]
*  And he would go to all the [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=809.0s)]
*  basketball games. One day, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=811.0s)]
*  we had a tape recorder for the National Anthem [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=813.0s)]
*  to play at the beginning of games. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=815.0s)]
*  They would just hold a mic next to a tape recorder. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=817.0s)]
*  It broke. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=819.0s)]
*  The mentally handicapped guy stood up [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=821.0s)]
*  and started singing. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=823.0s)]
*  And the whole fucking gym was like... [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=825.0s)]
*  Everybody just listened to the guy sing [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=829.0s)]
*  the National Anthem. Oh my god, did he get all the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=831.0s)]
*  words right? I don't remember. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=833.0s)]
*  I doubt it. I doubt it. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=835.0s)]
*  I think he was freestyling a little. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=837.0s)]
*  And the rockets [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=839.0s)]
*  he would try to get you. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=841.0s)]
*  He would go to games. But he was like... [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=843.0s)]
*  Again, it wasn't [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=845.0s)]
*  that long ago. It was long enough that people [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=847.0s)]
*  were like, yeah, he's weird. That whole thing. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=849.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a town pedophile, but he's a weird [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=851.0s)]
*  guy. So he would be like, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=853.0s)]
*  you guys want to play football? And we were [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=855.0s)]
*  little kids at the high school football game playing [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=857.0s)]
*  touch football. And he was like, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=859.0s)]

*  We knew what he was doing. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=867.0s)]
*  He was like, alright, see you guys. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=869.0s)]
*  Did he get away with it with anybody? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=871.0s)]
*  Probably. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=873.0s)]
*  If you get the mentally handicapped guy [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=875.0s)]

*  on the license plate. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=913.0s)]
*  Like a fake license plate on the front of his tricycle. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=915.0s)]
*  It was a sick tricycle. But he would come around [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=917.0s)]
*  and he would just...he would speak gibberish, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=919.0s)]
*  but every once in a while he would get kind of sexual. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=921.0s)]
*  Like he would come over and just be like, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=923.0s)]

*  And the reason [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1055.0s)]
*  for that is that's where the Catholic [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1057.0s)]
*  Church had moved a bunch [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1059.0s)]
*  of its priests. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1061.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean I read that story [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1063.0s)]
*  like this... I want to say [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1065.0s)]
*  it's New Mexico. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1067.0s)]
*  I want to say it was New Mexico. I think they [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1069.0s)]
*  fixed that. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1071.0s)]
*  I might have just spread a bunch of misinformation. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1073.0s)]
*  Fuck it. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1075.0s)]
*  I was reading the India thing [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1077.0s)]
*  first. What's going on? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1079.0s)]
*  Let's go with India first and then we'll go with the... [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1081.0s)]
*  Yeah. We covered it on the basis earlier. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1083.0s)]
*  I don't know the answer to this. I'm just giving you what I found. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1085.0s)]
*  Why is consensual teen sex a crime [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1087.0s)]
*  in India? Oh. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1089.0s)]
*  For teens to have sex with each other though. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1091.0s)]
*  Okay. Well they changed the law [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1093.0s)]
*  a decade ago to make it tougher [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1095.0s)]
*  on cases of child sexual abuse. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1097.0s)]
*  Oh. Okay. So it [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1099.0s)]
*  criminalizes all sexual [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1101.0s)]
*  activity by children under 18. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1103.0s)]
*  Interesting. Many [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1105.0s)]
*  adolescent boys [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1107.0s)]
*  in consenting relationships are finding [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1109.0s)]
*  themselves on the wrong side of the law. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1111.0s)]
*  Interesting. That's a bummer. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1113.0s)]
*  Interesting. That's why those guys are so [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1115.0s)]
*  fucking horny. You ever see them [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1117.0s)]
*  online? Are they? Yeah. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1119.0s)]
*  Don't fire them. Indian dudes will hit you in the comments. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1121.0s)]
*  Show bobs. Show [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1123.0s)]
*  vagina. Need bobs. Show bobs? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1125.0s)]

*  Marry me. Show bobs. Really? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1135.0s)]
*  Every hot chicks picture is followed by [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1137.0s)]
*  a thousand Indian dudes. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1139.0s)]
*  There's a billion people in India but they [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1141.0s)]
*  don't have the same problem that China has. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1143.0s)]
*  China has that weird problem where [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1145.0s)]
*  there's way more guys than there are girls. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1147.0s)]
*  That's crazy. Yeah. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1149.0s)]
*  They fucked up. The fact that they didn't [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1151.0s)]
*  see the math on that, that one [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1153.0s)]
*  child policy. I think they'd be [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1155.0s)]
*  pretty good at that. The math. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1157.0s)]
*  I would think, isn't that like [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1159.0s)]
*  a thing? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1161.0s)]
*  I don't know anything about that. I think that. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1163.0s)]
*  It's like how the [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1165.0s)]
*  fuck did they not see where that was going to [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1167.0s)]
*  be a disaster in the future? There's [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1169.0s)]
*  a whole generation of guys that have no girls. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1171.0s)]
*  It's like what are you going to do? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1173.0s)]
*  There's no girls. They're going to get aggressive. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1175.0s)]
*  What the fuck are they going to do? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1177.0s)]
*  Damn. Yeah. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1179.0s)]
*  Not good. Whack off the cartoons. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1181.0s)]
*  Because even in this country where it's 50-50 [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1183.0s)]
*  basically [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1185.0s)]
*  do you know that like 64% [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1187.0s)]
*  of men are single? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1189.0s)]
*  And only 34% of women are single? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1191.0s)]
*  How? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1193.0s)]
*  How's that? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1195.0s)]
*  How does that even work? Wait. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1197.0s)]
*  64% of men are [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1199.0s)]
*  single? Yeah. See if we can find the numbers. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1201.0s)]
*  It's men of a certain age. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1203.0s)]
*  Oh, you know what it is? It's just men [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1205.0s)]
*  fucking chicks that are like, we're not dating. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1207.0s)]
*  And women are like, no, we're [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1209.0s)]
*  in a relationship. You know how it is. I think it's a little [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1211.0s)]
*  of that. They're a fucking girl and she's like, what are we? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1213.0s)]
*  What have you been telling people we are? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1215.0s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1217.0s)]
*  We're nothing. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1219.0s)]
*  Can I just use you please? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1221.0s)]
*  Can we just use each [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1223.0s)]
*  other? Yeah. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1225.0s)]
*  Like the Bill Withersong? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1227.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, I'm not a guy that [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1229.0s)]
*  yeah, they want to date [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1231.0s)]
*  me. I'm not a guy that I just want to fuck that. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1233.0s)]
*  You don't get used? I'm not like a hot guy. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1235.0s)]
*  You wish you were used? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1237.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1239.0s)]
*  Do you? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1241.0s)]
*  Occasionally, back in the day, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1243.0s)]
*  that was the best thing. Getting used? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1245.0s)]
*  Yeah. If you had a gal [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1247.0s)]
*  that just wanted to fuck. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1249.0s)]
*  It's pretty neat. Oh my god. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1251.0s)]
*  Especially if you weren't into anything else. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1253.0s)]
*  Because sometimes, like, the [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1255.0s)]
*  reality is sometimes you're attracted to someone [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1257.0s)]
*  that you're not compatible with. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1259.0s)]
*  But they're hot. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1261.0s)]
*  So you're attracted to them sexually. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1263.0s)]
*  But the problem is usually [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1265.0s)]
*  that one person is [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1267.0s)]
*  into the other person more than [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1269.0s)]
*  you know, there's like psychological [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1271.0s)]
*  elements to it that become [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1273.0s)]
*  a problem. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1275.0s)]
*  Certainly. Yeah. And if the guy [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1277.0s)]
*  is the one using the girl, he's a piece of shit. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1279.0s)]
*  But if the girl is the one using the guy, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1281.0s)]
*  yeah, great. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1283.0s)]
*  Way to go. Yeah, she's a ball. We did flip that. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1285.0s)]
*  Adults between 18 [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1287.0s)]
*  and 29 who say they're single, yeah, this is [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1289.0s)]
*  it. So there's 51% [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1291.0s)]
*  of men in [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1293.0s)]
*  2019. What? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1295.0s)]
*  51% of men [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1297.0s)]
*  in 2019. And by the [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1299.0s)]
*  time it got to 2022, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1301.0s)]
*  it's 63%. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1303.0s)]
*  So the pandemic kicked [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1305.0s)]
*  it up 12%. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1307.0s)]
*  But the women stayed the same. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1309.0s)]
*  And just slightly more. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1311.0s)]
*  More who say they're single. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1313.0s)]
*  So 34% versus 32% [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1315.0s)]
*  for women. But the men went up [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1317.0s)]
*  12 fucking percent. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1319.0s)]
*  But what I think what they're saying [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1321.0s)]
*  is these women during the pandemic [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1323.0s)]
*  started dating older guys. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1325.0s)]
*  So when [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1327.0s)]
*  the jobs went away and everything [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1329.0s)]
*  went south, they shacked up with some dudes [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1331.0s)]
*  with money. All right. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1333.0s)]
*  Probably. That's fair. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1335.0s)]
*  I mean, wouldn't that make sense? Look at 18 to 29 [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1337.0s)]
*  for men. 63% [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1339.0s)]
*  are single. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1341.0s)]
*  That's pretty wild. But age 65 plus. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1343.0s)]
*  18 to 29? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1345.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you look at 65 plus, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1347.0s)]
*  25% are single. 50 to 64, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1349.0s)]
*  28% are single. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1351.0s)]
*  30 to 49, 25% [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1353.0s)]
*  are single. So that's what it is. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1355.0s)]
*  It's the 18 to 29 guys. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1357.0s)]
*  20 at 65 plus. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1359.0s)]
*  There's more women because all the men are dead. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1361.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1363.0s)]

*  It is a tough time. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1461.0s)]
*  You don't think they're going to be alright? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1463.0s)]
*  No, it's going to lead people [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1465.0s)]

*  Yeah. I think you're going to go over [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1471.0s)]
*  a dude's house and he's going to have a robot lead. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1473.0s)]
*  You're going to leave it out, you're going to go, oh. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1475.0s)]
*  My buddy left his flashlight [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1477.0s)]
*  in the shower when we lived together. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1479.0s)]
*  It was tough. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1481.0s)]
*  I was like, dude, clean that up. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1483.0s)]
*  And he came out [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1485.0s)]
*  with it dripping on the floor. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1487.0s)]
*  No, he didn't. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1489.0s)]
*  After he washed it? What? This? I was like, dude. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1491.0s)]
*  After he washed it or after he did it? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1493.0s)]
*  It was water dripping, but still. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1495.0s)]
*  That was our first sponsor. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1497.0s)]
*  Flashlights? Yeah. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1499.0s)]
*  You ever use one? Oh, yeah. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1501.0s)]
*  It's too powerful. They're pretty good. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1503.0s)]
*  I had to throw mine out. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1505.0s)]
*  In a dumpster. You don't want that in your life. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1507.0s)]
*  It's too good. I know how to fish it out. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1509.0s)]
*  If you can't get laid though, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1511.0s)]
*  it's as close to the physical [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1513.0s)]
*  feeling of a warm [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1515.0s)]
*  vagina touching your dick. I think it's better. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1517.0s)]
*  Some guys would soak them in hot water. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1519.0s)]
*  They'd warm them up. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1521.0s)]
*  Fire it up, dude. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1523.0s)]
*  Get it to like 95 degrees. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1525.0s)]
*  Feels like human contact. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1527.0s)]
*  Especially when I had mine. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1531.0s)]
*  I was in a rough spot. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1533.0s)]
*  In my life, yeah. I was in West Philly. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1535.0s)]
*  I was in a... [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1537.0s)]
*  The room I had in my apartment was like [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1539.0s)]
*  it jutted out of the back of the apartment. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1541.0s)]
*  So it was freezing cold. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1543.0s)]
*  It was the coldest room pot. I had a mattress on the floor. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1545.0s)]
*  It was like a homeless person's room. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1547.0s)]
*  Well, I guess that's not... You know what I mean. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1551.0s)]
*  Like a crack head. It's pretty close to a homeless person. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1553.0s)]
*  And I was fucking a fleshlight in there. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1555.0s)]
*  Wow. It was a low point. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1557.0s)]
*  Yeah, but look at you now. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1559.0s)]
*  Ten million views on YouTube. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1561.0s)]
*  That's the only difference. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1563.0s)]
*  Just for YouTube views. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1565.0s)]
*  Killing it on the road. Come on, man. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1567.0s)]
*  That's the... [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1569.0s)]
*  That's the beauty of it. You gonna get one? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1571.0s)]
*  For the road? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1573.0s)]
*  For the road would be nice. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1575.0s)]
*  Get one of those ones that looks like a beer can. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1577.0s)]
*  They make them like beer. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1579.0s)]
*  Oh, you mean like to disguise it? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1581.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1583.0s)]
*  We had a bunch of them. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1585.0s)]
*  They were our first sponsor. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1587.0s)]
*  That's how we started Onnit. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1589.0s)]
*  We started Onnit. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1591.0s)]
*  Do you know that? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1593.0s)]
*  Got that fleshlight money? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1595.0s)]
*  No, Onnit was started with Aubrey, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1597.0s)]
*  who was the CEO of the fleshlight, and me. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1599.0s)]
*  Maybe he wasn't the CEO of the fleshlight. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1605.0s)]
*  Maybe he was like marketing director or something. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1607.0s)]
*  So it's like his family owned the company. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1609.0s)]
*  The fleshlight company. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1613.0s)]
*  So he reached out and said, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1615.0s)]
*  do you guys want to have a sponsor on your podcast? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1617.0s)]
*  We didn't have any sponsors. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1619.0s)]
*  The podcast in the beginning, the idea that this is a big business [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1621.0s)]
*  is so hilarious. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1623.0s)]
*  Because in the beginning, it was just so ridiculous [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1625.0s)]
*  like how it was run. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1627.0s)]
*  We just fucked around. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1629.0s)]
*  We just would go online and fuck around. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1631.0s)]
*  But as it started to grow, he was the first guy that said, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1633.0s)]
*  hey, you guys should have a sponsor. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1635.0s)]
*  So we had a meeting with us, and he told us about the fleshlight. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1637.0s)]
*  I'm like, that's hilarious. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1639.0s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1641.0s)]
*  Did you get a free sample? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1643.0s)]
*  Oh, we got boxes of them. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1645.0s)]
*  Those are the ones that look like beer. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1647.0s)]
*  Yeah, it looks like a craft beer or something. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1651.0s)]
*  A Doyle's is a butthole? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1653.0s)]
*  Well, I think you can get whatever you want, neither can. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1655.0s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1657.0s)]
*  So that was our first sponsor. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1659.0s)]
*  And then Aubrey and I started talking [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1661.0s)]
*  about doing other stuff. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1663.0s)]
*  And he said, if you were into supplements, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1665.0s)]
*  what are you into? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1667.0s)]
*  And I told him that I got really into Neutropics [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1669.0s)]
*  because of this product called Neuro One [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1671.0s)]
*  that Bill Romanowski came up with, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1673.0s)]
*  a nice football player. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1675.0s)]
*  His issues were with memory [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1677.0s)]
*  after all those fucking concussions. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1679.0s)]
*  Spitting in dudes' faces. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1681.0s)]
*  He was wild. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1683.0s)]
*  I had Derek Wolf on. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1685.0s)]
*  Did you see what he's talking about? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1687.0s)]
*  When he walked into the arena, what he wanted to do to everyone that he saw? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1689.0s)]
*  No, I didn't get to that. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1691.0s)]
*  He goes, I want to fucking murder all of you. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1693.0s)]
*  I just want to smash you and kill you. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1695.0s)]
*  He's walking through the crowd [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1697.0s)]
*  thinking that he just really [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1699.0s)]
*  wanted to just run into the crowd [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1701.0s)]
*  and start smashing people. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1703.0s)]
*  He's a monster. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1705.0s)]
*  He didn't do anything. He's a nice guy. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1707.0s)]
*  But those Viking instincts [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1709.0s)]
*  run deep, son. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1711.0s)]
*  There's a dude who plays for the Bills. I was hanging out with a bunch of those guys. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1713.0s)]
*  I did a show on Buffalo and then we went out. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1715.0s)]
*  His name is Spencer Brown. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1717.0s)]
*  He's a right tackle. I was on mushrooms. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1719.0s)]
*  Did I tell you this? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1721.0s)]
*  Dude, this was like the greatest night of my life. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1723.0s)]
*  This was the best night I've ever had. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1725.0s)]
*  So I did a show [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1727.0s)]
*  on Buffalo. Then the next night, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1729.0s)]
*  it was Sunday. On Sunday, we went to the game. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1731.0s)]
*  Oh, I told you this. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1733.0s)]
*  Gabe Davis gave me his jersey. I looked like a Down Syndrome guy. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1735.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1737.0s)]
*  But that night we went out to [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1739.0s)]
*  fucking Dave and Buster's. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1741.0s)]
*  I took a ton of mushrooms. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1743.0s)]
*  Way more than I thought I took. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1745.0s)]
*  I was fucked up. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1747.0s)]
*  But then, all the cool black dudes [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1749.0s)]
*  on the team were hanging out, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1751.0s)]
*  being cool. Then it was just me and [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1753.0s)]
*  a white O'Limon. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1755.0s)]
*  Spencer Brown was like 6'9". [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1757.0s)]
*  I was just so high. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1759.0s)]
*  I was like, dude, this is a Viking. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1761.0s)]
*  This is an actual Viking. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1763.0s)]
*  Thank God we live today. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1765.0s)]
*  I'm watching them play fucking [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1767.0s)]
*  video games and arcade games. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1769.0s)]
*  You gotta give people like that [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1771.0s)]
*  some kind of distraction. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1773.0s)]
*  If that guy got into a town, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1775.0s)]
*  it would just be over. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1777.0s)]
*  That's what it was, man. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1779.0s)]
*  If you look at those guys in Iceland, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1781.0s)]
*  all those strongman dudes that come from Iceland, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1783.0s)]
*  where do you think that comes from? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1785.0s)]
*  Those are the freaks that were dominating [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1787.0s)]
*  the world back when people just had axes. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1789.0s)]
*  A boat of those guys. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1791.0s)]
*  Until people figured out guns, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1793.0s)]
*  thank God they figured out guns. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1795.0s)]
*  Just a boat of those dudes. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1797.0s)]
*  Can you imagine how rough the world would be? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1799.0s)]
*  Spencer Brown, beasts. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1801.0s)]
*  6'8", 3'11". [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1803.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1805.0s)]
*  Fucking ridiculous. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1807.0s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1809.0s)]
*  All the mushrooms watching a 6'8", dude, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1811.0s)]
*  playing. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1813.0s)]
*  That gene line [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1815.0s)]
*  of those strongmen, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1817.0s)]
*  of those guys like Derek Wolf, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1819.0s)]
*  like Thor, the Game of Thrones guy, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1821.0s)]
*  the mountain from Game of Thrones, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1823.0s)]
*  that's a gene line of [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1825.0s)]
*  the people who conquered the world [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1827.0s)]
*  with axes. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1829.0s)]
*  That's what that is. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1831.0s)]
*  It's so nuts that that wasn't that long ago. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1833.0s)]
*  That's what's really crazy. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1835.0s)]
*  At any point in time in the world, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1837.0s)]
*  in any one moment, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1839.0s)]
*  things can break out that are real [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1841.0s)]
*  and similar to the way life was during the Viking days. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1843.0s)]
*  It just doesn't happen very often. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1845.0s)]
*  It breaks off less and less over time. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1847.0s)]
*  It breaks off less and less over time. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1849.0s)]
*  It breaks off less and less over time. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1851.0s)]
*  But it's still there in us. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1853.0s)]
*  But it's still there in us. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1855.0s)]
*  If it wasn't for football, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1857.0s)]
*  and the UFC, and pro boxing, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1859.0s)]
*  and all those sports are like [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1861.0s)]
*  It's like a bridge to civility. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1863.0s)]
*  It's like a bridge to [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1865.0s)]
*  a peaceful civilization. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1867.0s)]
*  A peaceful civilization. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1869.0s)]
*  Especially martial arts. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1871.0s)]
*  A bridge to a peaceful civilization. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1873.0s)]
*  A bridge to a peaceful civilization. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1875.0s)]
*  Because you allow these people that have [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1877.0s)]
*  this fucking thing inside them [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1879.0s)]
*  to express themselves in a legal way [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1881.0s)]
*  to express themselves in a legal way [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1883.0s)]
*  and they're rewarded for it hugely. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1885.0s)]
*  And you get to scream. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1887.0s)]

*  Fuck, they kill him. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1891.0s)]
*  You think of some of the shit that Hamzat Shamiyov says after his fights. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1893.0s)]
*  I fucking kill them all. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1895.0s)]

*  Chael Sonnen would put on a show. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1931.0s)]
*  It's in my algorithm. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1933.0s)]

*  He's a smart dude, man. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1937.0s)]
*  And back in the day, when he was the first guy to really figure out pro wrestling style promotion with legit fight skills. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1939.0s)]
*  I mean, he almost beat Anderson Silva. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1949.0s)]
*  He almost won that fight. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1953.0s)]
*  If he didn't get caught in that triangle in the last round, he would have won that fight. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1955.0s)]
*  And it was a grueling fucking fight. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1957.0s)]
*  And he just kept taking Anderson down. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1959.0s)]
*  He beat the shit out of Nate Marquardt when Nate Marquardt was in his prime. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1961.0s)]
*  He was a real fighter. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1963.0s)]
*  He just was not John Jones. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1965.0s)]
*  There's like levels even to savages. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1967.0s)]

*  Chael was like a little smaller too. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1971.0s)]
*  He really shouldn't have been fighting the guys that were, that John Jones. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1973.0s)]
*  John Jones. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=1975.0s)]

*  I don't know. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2001.0s)]
*  When Anderson and him fought, it was a mauling. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2003.0s)]
*  It was a horrific mauling. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2005.0s)]
*  He fought Chael Sonner? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2007.0s)]
*  Yeah, John beat him up so bad that he broke his own toe. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2009.0s)]
*  Pushing off the ground. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2011.0s)]
*  Smashing him. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2013.0s)]
*  There was that, was that, how much? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2015.0s)]
*  Pretty sure that's how he broke his toe. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2017.0s)]
*  He broke his toe for sure in that fight. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2019.0s)]
*  There was that crossover in the UFC where like, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2021.0s)]
*  dudes started like being athletes. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2023.0s)]
*  Not saying Chael Sonner wasn't an athlete. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2025.0s)]
*  But you know what I mean? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2027.0s)]
*  There was that like switchover phase. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2029.0s)]
*  There was a switchover phase. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2031.0s)]
*  But I think with Chael, I really would attribute it more to [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2033.0s)]
*  he's been around during the greatest of the greats at 85. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2037.0s)]
*  Like Anderson Silva in his prime was one of the greatest of the greats. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2041.0s)]
*  Anderson Silva, for like, he gets left out of the goat competition [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2045.0s)]
*  because after the Chris Weidman fight where he broke his leg, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2049.0s)]
*  he had a bunch of fights where he didn't perform like the Anderson of old. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2053.0s)]
*  So I think people forgot how good he was when he was in his prime. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2057.0s)]
*  Who is in the goat conversation? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2060.0s)]
*  Obviously John Jones. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2062.0s)]
*  John Jones is number one now. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2063.0s)]
*  Is Khabib? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2064.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah he's in there. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2065.0s)]
*  Undefeated, you know, barely lost a round in his entire career. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2066.0s)]
*  You know, he had one controversial fight with Glace and Tebow back in the day. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2070.0s)]
*  But I think it was a fair decision. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2076.0s)]
*  But he dominated everybody at the top. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2078.0s)]
*  Dominated everybody. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2081.0s)]
*  And he did it with fucking just a ruthless intensity, fantastic wrestling. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2082.0s)]
*  They couldn't stop him. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2087.0s)]
*  Usman was. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2088.0s)]
*  Usman was. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2089.0s)]
*  Yeah, up until the Leon Edwards fight I was telling everybody. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2090.0s)]
*  Up until one kick. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2092.0s)]
*  I think Usman is the greatest welterweight of all time. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2093.0s)]
*  If you look at like what he's done and who he did it to, you know, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2096.0s)]
*  like the way he knocked out Jorge Masvidal, he started out as a wrestler. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2100.0s)]
*  He started out as a wrestler. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2105.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden he's flatlining people on the feet. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2106.0s)]
*  And you're flatlining a skilled striker in Masvidal. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2108.0s)]
*  Like Masvidal is a, he's a slick guy on the feet. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2112.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2116.0s)]
*  That was a tough one too. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2117.0s)]
*  He was all sweaty, that fucking mist off that punch when he hit him. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2118.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2122.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2123.0s)]
*  I mean when you think about the way Masvidal knocked out Ben Askren, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2124.0s)]
*  Masvidal knocked out Darren Till, like Masvidal's a scary guy. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2127.0s)]
*  I wish that didn't happen with Askren. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2130.0s)]
*  That was a rough one. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2133.0s)]
*  I wish Ben got a chance to wrestle. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2135.0s)]
*  That was a rough one. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2136.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2137.0s)]
*  That was a rough one. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2138.0s)]
*  But that's how smart he is. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2139.0s)]
*  Like he knew Ben's instincts were going to be there. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2140.0s)]
*  He just fucked. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2143.0s)]
*  You ever see the video of him training that very move? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2144.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2146.0s)]
*  That's a bummer. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2147.0s)]
*  That's a bummer. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2148.0s)]
*  When you look online you'll be like, fuck, he knew he was going to do that. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2149.0s)]
*  Bro, his knockout of Darren Till was brutal. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2153.0s)]
*  Fucking brutal. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2157.0s)]
*  He's knocked out a lot of really good guys, man. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2159.0s)]
*  It's, so when Usman destroyed him, I'm like, wow. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2161.0s)]
*  He might have felt the highest level of competition because he beats Tyron Woodley, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2167.0s)]
*  who was one of the best welterweights ever. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2175.0s)]
*  He destroys Tyron, right? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2177.0s)]
*  Like runs right through him. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2179.0s)]
*  He's dominant fashion, wins a five round decision. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2180.0s)]
*  There's no question at all he's the new champion. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2184.0s)]
*  Then he beats Colby Covington, who is about as good as it gets in that division other than Usman. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2187.0s)]
*  Colby's a fucking animal. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2195.0s)]
*  Unbelievable cardio. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2197.0s)]
*  Tough as fuck. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2199.0s)]
*  Even though Kamaru broke his jaw, he was still there in the last round. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2201.0s)]
*  He was upset when they stopped it. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2207.0s)]
*  Did he break his jaw? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2209.0s)]
*  I think he did. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2211.0s)]
*  I want to be sure of that, though. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2212.0s)]
*  He definitely fucked his mouth up. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2214.0s)]
*  He dropped him and he hit everyone some really good shots. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2218.0s)]
*  But Colby was saying even at the end, hey, I could have made it through that. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2221.0s)]
*  That's how tough that dude is. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2225.0s)]
*  He's undeniably tough. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2229.0s)]
*  So Kamaru beats him and he beats him twice. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2230.0s)]
*  He hurt him pretty fucking bad in the second fight. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2233.0s)]
*  And Colby got there. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2237.0s)]
*  So you got to like how good Colby is. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2238.0s)]
*  If Kamaru was beating him like that and then Kamaru was beating Leon Edwards for the most part. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2241.0s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2248.0s)]
*  He dropped him. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2249.0s)]
*  You got to remember he stopped Gilbert Burns. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2251.0s)]
*  Gilbert Burns is a fucking animal. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2254.0s)]
*  You saw the Gilbert Burns, Hamza Chamayah's fight. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2256.0s)]
*  So Kamaru stopped him. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2259.0s)]
*  I feel like you look at the caliber of the opponents that he's faced as a champion and how he's beaten them. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2262.0s)]
*  I kind of put him up into the Leon Edwards fight. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2270.0s)]
*  I kind of put him up there with everybody. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2272.0s)]
*  God, that Leon kick. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2274.0s)]
*  He might have been the best welterweight ever, but that Leon kick, man, that changed the world. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2275.0s)]
*  And then this weekend they're fighting again, which is so crazy, dude. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2280.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2284.0s)]
*  That fight's so intense. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2285.0s)]
*  Where are they fighting? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2286.0s)]
*  In England. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2287.0s)]
*  Oh, Leon. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2288.0s)]
*  This is Leon's hometown, son. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2290.0s)]
*  Yeah, he can sleep in his own bed and defend the world title in England. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2292.0s)]
*  I, well, I don't want to make any predictions. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2297.0s)]
*  I'm 0 for 1. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2300.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2301.0s)]
*  I said Cyril Gonn, John Jones. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2302.0s)]
*  I was like, I think Cyril's going to win this thing, dude. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2304.0s)]
*  Ten seconds in, I was like, whoops. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2306.0s)]
*  That wasn't a good bet. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2309.0s)]
*  Here it is, man. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2310.0s)]
*  One of the craziest. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2312.0s)]
*  Look how beautiful that kick is, too. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2317.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2324.0s)]
*  Bro, just the sound of that shin to chin. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2327.0s)]
*  Play that sound again. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2332.0s)]
*  The sound of shin to chin. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2334.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2342.0s)]
*  There it is. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2346.0s)]
*  Bro. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2347.0s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2349.0s)]
*  Bro. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2351.0s)]
*  I don't think he knew that was coming. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2352.0s)]
*  I don't think Leon knew that was coming. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2354.0s)]
*  He set it up. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2356.0s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2357.0s)]
*  No, I mean the whole time I saw the, but I think when he landed it he was like, oh shit. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2358.0s)]
*  Well, it just, it was perfect. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2363.0s)]
*  And it was because he ducked to his right. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2365.0s)]
*  You see the way he throws the left. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2367.0s)]
*  I saw him set it up a couple times. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2369.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2370.0s)]
*  I watched that fucking, there's a video of his trainer. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2371.0s)]
*  You see that, he's like, come on. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2373.0s)]
*  Come on, Leon. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2375.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like a rock movie. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2376.0s)]
*  You gotta pull it out of the fire, Leon. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2377.0s)]
*  It's literally like a rock music. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2379.0s)]
*  You ever seen it where they put the rock music behind it? [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2381.0s)]
*  He's screaming at him and then Leon goes up there and lands that kick. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2386.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think he's in trouble. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2391.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2393.0s)]
*  Yeah, when he nice and low, look at him. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2401.0s)]
*  Come on, don't make him bully you, Leon. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2404.0s)]
*  Don't let him bully you, son. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2407.0s)]
*  Don't let him bully you, son. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2408.0s)]
*  Oh, it's so nice, dude. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2410.0s)]
*  Right here, this is where he's... [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2412.0s)]
*  One more kick. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2414.0s)]
*  Listen, stop feeling sorry for your fucking son. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2420.0s)]
*  Well, come on, man. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2422.0s)]
*  What's wrong with you? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2423.0s)]
*  You're too fucking down. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2424.0s)]
*  You gotta pull the fucking out of the fire. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2426.0s)]
*  Come on, Leon, man. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2428.0s)]
*  You got it, man. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2429.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2430.0s)]
*  You got this. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2431.0s)]
*  Shots, shoots, and the pressure's gone. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2432.0s)]
*  Come on, Leon. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2434.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2436.0s)]
*  That's great. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2439.0s)]
*  This weekend's gonna be wild. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2441.0s)]
*  Kamaru Usman seems very intense. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2444.0s)]
*  Yeah, no shit. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2447.0s)]
*  I'm watching all the UFC shows that they do. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2448.0s)]
*  You know, they do all the violence and stuff. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2454.0s)]
*  It's like, fuck, man. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2457.0s)]
*  He's intense. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2458.0s)]
*  He's intense. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2459.0s)]
*  He's gonna want this. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2460.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's intense. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2461.0s)]
*  This is gonna be a wild one. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2462.0s)]
*  I think this is gonna be a wild one. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2464.0s)]
*  I think Kamaru is gonna be very aggressive. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2465.0s)]
*  I think in his eyes, he won 24 minutes of that fight. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2468.0s)]
*  He did? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2472.0s)]
*  He's not really. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2473.0s)]
*  No. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2474.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2475.0s)]
*  No, he got taken down in the first round, and he got mounted. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2476.0s)]
*  And he got his back taken. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2478.0s)]
*  Leon was the first guy to ever take him down. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2480.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2482.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2483.0s)]
*  I don't remember that. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2484.0s)]
*  Leon took him down. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2485.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2486.0s)]
*  Leon took him down in the first round. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2487.0s)]
*  I remember beating Leon. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2488.0s)]
*  Even while, like, with the bias of cheering for him, I was like, fuck, there's no chance [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2489.0s)]
*  he wins this. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2492.5s)]
*  Well, when they first fought, Leon was not really much into grappling. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2493.5s)]
*  He's like an expert striker. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2498.0s)]
*  And Kamaru's such a good wrestler. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2500.0s)]
*  He just kept taking him down, beat him by decision. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2502.0s)]
*  But in this fight, it definitely showed a big leap in Leon's grappling ability. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2504.0s)]
*  So, Leon got him with a trip here. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2511.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2513.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2514.0s)]
*  And got on top of him, full mount. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2515.0s)]
*  Round one? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2517.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2518.0s)]
*  Round one. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2519.0s)]
*  And if you watch that, Kamaru has a bad knee. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2520.0s)]
*  He has bad knees, period. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2522.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2523.0s)]
*  But if you watch that, the way he goes down. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2524.0s)]
*  Yeah, it looked bad. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2526.0s)]
*  Watch the way he goes down. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2527.0s)]
*  It's very bad. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2528.0s)]
*  Watch his right knee. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2529.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2530.0s)]
*  Yeah, not good at all. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2531.0s)]
*  Not good. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2532.0s)]
*  Like, that, the pressure that's on that thing as he's going down, like, from there, like, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2533.0s)]
*  watch it from there. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2540.0s)]
*  Look at that right there. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2541.0s)]
*  I mean, that is a lot of pressure on that knee. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2542.0s)]
*  The way his foot is planted. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2545.0s)]
*  A lot of pressure. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2546.0s)]
*  Do you see that John, from that Chael Sonnen fight, he always has to tape his toes? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2547.0s)]
*  No. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2552.0s)]
*  Because his toe broke and flipped around. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2553.0s)]
*  It was his toe, the bottom of his toe was facing upward. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2555.0s)]
*  And we didn't realize it until I was talking to him. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2559.0s)]
*  We were in the octagon, and I'm interviewing him after he beat Chael Sonnen. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2563.0s)]
*  And he looked down, he's like, oh my God, my toe. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2567.0s)]
*  And then we looked, and we're like, oh, okay. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2570.0s)]
*  And so John's toe completely... [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2573.0s)]
*  Yo, dude. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2576.0s)]
*  So that was just from him. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2578.0s)]
*  That's the strength of him pushing off while he's smashing. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2580.0s)]
*  Just smashing. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2586.0s)]
*  It was a brutal fight, man. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2589.0s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2591.0s)]
*  It was a brutal fight. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2592.0s)]
*  I mean, John beat the ever-loving shit out of Chael Sonnen in this fight. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2593.0s)]
*  It was absolutely brutal. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2597.0s)]
*  I know, isn't that nasty? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2600.0s)]
*  Of course, and the snake. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2602.0s)]
*  So now to this day, he has to tape his toes up. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2603.0s)]
*  There was actually a controversy at the last fight. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2606.0s)]
*  Yeah, foot stomp him. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2608.0s)]
*  Well, I think when you rip it and flip it over like that, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2609.0s)]
*  I don't know what they would have to do to get it to be stable again. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2613.0s)]
*  I think it's probably a little... [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2616.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2619.0s)]
*  It's a little weak. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2620.0s)]
*  Because it's such a catastrophic injury. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2621.0s)]
*  If your toe flip all the way around like that. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2624.0s)]
*  I was going to ask you who he's going to kill next, but it's Stipe. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2626.0s)]
*  Yeah, Stipe and him are going to fight. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2629.0s)]
*  That's going to be a different fight. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2631.0s)]
*  Stipe has way better wrestling than Cyril Gaunt. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2634.0s)]
*  Stipe's got a shit ton of experience. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2637.0s)]
*  I remember thinking Stipe was going to die when he fought in Ghana the first time. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2639.0s)]
*  When he beat in Ghana. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2643.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was pretty wild. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2645.0s)]
*  I mean, that showed how durable he is. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2646.0s)]
*  He just survived that. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2648.0s)]
*  Yeah, that showed how durable he is. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2649.0s)]
*  But there's other fights that show you can't sleep on Stipe's stand-up skills. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2651.0s)]
*  Stipe's a very good boxer, very good striker. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2656.0s)]
*  Remember when he fought DC and he kept ripping him with that left hook to the body? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2660.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2663.0s)]
*  He hit him with a couple of those and then DC was fucked. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2664.0s)]
*  That was one of those where I was watching it. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2666.0s)]
*  It's like when you're playing a video game and you don't know how to block the body. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2668.0s)]
*  He doesn't know. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2671.0s)]
*  He just keeps doing it. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2673.0s)]
*  He can't stop it. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2674.0s)]
*  Well, he just did it very skillfully, man. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2675.0s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2677.0s)]
*  He would show you the jab and then dig under. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2678.0s)]
*  And he did it multiple times. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2683.0s)]
*  He just keeps it. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2685.0s)]
*  That's also the side of the liver. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2686.0s)]
*  When you get hit on the liver, dude, it is a horrible feeling. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2689.0s)]
*  Your whole body, it's like you get electrically shocked. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2692.0s)]
*  It's like eee. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2696.0s)]
*  Yeah, we hit that over and over again. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2698.0s)]
*  I just kept digging to his body. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2701.0s)]
*  So the thing is, it's like Stipe is not zero gone. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2705.0s)]
*  Stipe is the most successful UFC heavyweight champion ever. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2710.0s)]
*  He defended the title more than anybody. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2715.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2717.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2718.0s)]
*  I know that Francis knocked him out in his last fight. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2719.0s)]
*  So people just will dismiss. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2721.0s)]
*  They'll say, oh, it's maybe he's washed up or maybe these guys are better or maybe. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2724.0s)]
*  But that fucking guy has been counted out from the beginning. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2729.0s)]
*  He fought Fabricio Verduim in Brazil and flatlined him. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2733.0s)]
*  That was when Fabricio was the fucking man. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2736.0s)]
*  But Fabricio chased after Stipe and Stipe just cracked him with the right hand and dropped him. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2739.0s)]
*  It's like an amazing. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2744.0s)]
*  You ever see that fight? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2745.0s)]
*  No. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2746.0s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2747.0s)]
*  Stipe Miocic knocking out Fabricio Verduim. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2748.0s)]
*  So Fabricio Verduim, this is like in Brazil. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2752.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it was in Brazil. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2755.0s)]
*  But it was when Fabricio was the heavyweight champion. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2757.0s)]
*  So Fabricio had submitted Cain Velasquez. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2759.0s)]
*  He became the UFC heavyweight champion. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2762.0s)]
*  I got to show you some football highlights. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2764.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2766.0s)]
*  I'll get you some. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2767.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2768.0s)]
*  So watch this. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2769.0s)]
*  Watch this fight. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2770.0s)]
*  Fabricio Verduim just got real aggressive and started coming after him. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2771.0s)]
*  Boom. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2779.0s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2782.0s)]
*  What is he doing? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2783.0s)]
*  Bro, how good is that? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2784.0s)]
*  Why was he doing that? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2786.0s)]
*  Because he thought he could get to him. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2787.0s)]
*  He thought he could get to him. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2789.0s)]
*  And he also, he got stung there. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2790.0s)]
*  Oh, he thought he was hurt. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2791.0s)]
*  He's just being very aggressive. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2792.0s)]
*  But do you know how beautiful that is? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2793.0s)]
*  You know how skillful that is? [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2796.0s)]
*  Like just watch that one more time. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2797.0s)]
*  Just the slide back and then the punch. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2799.0s)]
*  That's so hard to do, man. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2801.0s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2803.0s)]
*  Boom. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2804.0s)]
*  While he's moving away in full throttle, he uncorks a perfect right hand. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2805.0s)]
*  That motherfucker is an athlete. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2812.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2814.0s)]
*  So you can't sleep on that dude. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2815.0s)]
*  Yeah, but he looks like a guy who's drunk at the beach. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2818.0s)]
*  Well, he's probably drunk at the beach sometimes. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2820.0s)]
*  He's got the shorts. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2822.0s)]
*  He's got that back tattoo. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2823.0s)]
*  Guy's a fucking animal. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2824.0s)]
*  Underrated. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2826.0s)]
*  Hugely underrated. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2827.0s)]
*  And also one of the things I'm interested in is it seems like he put on some weight. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2828.0s)]
*  He put on some mass, which I think will probably be a good thing with these bigger heavyweights. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2834.0s)]
*  You know, I think he tried to have more endurance and come in lighter for Francis and try to tire Francis out. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2839.0s)]
*  But in the second Francis fight, Francis fought like this very patient style. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2845.0s)]
*  Which is so he gassed. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2850.0s)]
*  He did it on the first one though. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2851.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2852.0s)]
*  Well, the first one he just tried to knock him out. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2853.0s)]
*  And the second one he took his time, which was terrifying. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2855.0s)]
*  Because all those shots that land, everyone that lands, like your power bar is just like. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2857.0s)]
*  And Garner's another one, dude. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2862.0s)]
*  Can you imagine that guy? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2866.0s)]
*  Getting wild on you. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2867.0s)]
*  Running through a town. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2870.0s)]
*  I'm so bummed that he left the UFC. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2872.0s)]
*  I mean, I want that. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2874.0s)]
*  I want that dude to make all the money. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2875.0s)]
*  I want him to make all the money. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2877.0s)]
*  Go make all that money in boxing. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2878.0s)]
*  I'm happy for him. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2880.0s)]
*  But I really wish that Jones and him fought because, God damn, that would be crazy. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2882.0s)]
*  That'd be fun. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2887.0s)]
*  You can't zig when you should have zag with Francis and Garner. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2890.0s)]
*  You can't make any mistakes, man. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2894.0s)]
*  That guy touches your chin. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2897.0s)]
*  You're in a world of shit. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2899.0s)]
*  Tomorrow. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2901.0s)]
*  You're in a world of shit. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2902.0s)]
*  He's a totally different thing. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2903.0s)]
*  His power makes it a totally different thing that you're doing. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2905.0s)]
*  Because with some guys, you can make little mistakes. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2908.0s)]
*  You get hit. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2912.0s)]
*  You get shit. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2913.0s)]
*  You move around. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2914.0s)]
*  You get rocked a little. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2915.0s)]
*  With him, it's just sleep. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2916.0s)]
*  It's just, bink. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2918.0s)]
*  It's like, oh no. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2920.0s)]
*  So that's in a lot of people's eyes. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2921.0s)]
*  Your wife is holding your head. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2923.0s)]
*  You're like, oh no. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2924.0s)]
*  Like when a guy will fight someone that doesn't have dangerous striking, there's a noticeable [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2926.0s)]
*  relaxed sort of, in the interactions. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2932.0s)]
*  You know you don't have to be too scared. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2937.0s)]
*  So you can get closer to them. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2940.0s)]
*  You could avoid some shots. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2942.0s)]
*  But when someone has nuclear power like Francis, there's not a thing you can do that doesn't [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2944.0s)]
*  put you in range of getting flatlined. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2949.0s)]
*  And so you're always thinking about it. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2952.0s)]
*  That fucking uppercut, bro. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2955.0s)]
*  Dude. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2957.0s)]
*  What's your problem? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2959.0s)]
*  That fucking power is so preposterous. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2960.0s)]
*  That fucking over-eating punch. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2963.0s)]
*  The over-eating punch was insane. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2965.0s)]
*  But I mean, he knocked out Cain Velasquez in the first round. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2967.0s)]
*  I mean, I just, I fucking think he can knock out anybody, man. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2970.0s)]
*  I think it's just a matter of whether or not he hits your chin. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2974.0s)]
*  I just think that power is just too extraordinary. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2977.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2979.0s)]
*  And he's become so skillful. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2981.0s)]
*  That was the thing that was really remarkable about the Stipe fight. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2983.0s)]
*  Like he fought very skillful. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2987.0s)]
*  It wasn't just that he's explosive and powerful. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2989.0s)]
*  He was patient and just, you know, being very tactical. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2993.0s)]
*  Was attacking with leg kicks and that fucking power. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=2998.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3001.0s)]
*  Look, if we're talking UFC, I'm excited for Adesanya. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3002.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, the rematch. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3006.0s)]
*  It's going to be fun, dude. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3007.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's very, very interesting. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3008.0s)]
*  Very, very interesting. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3010.0s)]
*  Here's the interesting thing. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3012.0s)]
*  Like what if Izzy's leg wasn't fucked up? [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3014.0s)]
*  Izzy was winning. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3017.0s)]
*  What if Izzy, he was winning. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3019.0s)]
*  He was winning on the scorecards. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3021.0s)]
*  But what if Izzy prepared more to avoid that low calf kick? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3022.0s)]
*  Like what if it became a more crucial part of his training? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3027.0s)]
*  Which is what we're going to probably see. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3032.0s)]
*  Because the calf kick was a giant issue. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3034.0s)]
*  He was saying that the foot got really fucked up and he couldn't move right. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3036.0s)]
*  And you could see it when I rewatched it. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3040.0s)]
*  I was like, yeah, you could see it. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3042.0s)]
*  And Paheda lands a bunch of like ruthless calf kicks in the first round. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3044.0s)]
*  That guy's a motherfucker, dude. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3048.0s)]
*  He's a motherfucker, dude. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3050.0s)]
*  He's the scariest motherfucker in that division. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3051.0s)]
*  You know what the meanest thing UFC's done? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3053.0s)]
*  What? [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3055.0s)]
*  Is Izzy was on the cover of the video game. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3056.0s)]
*  They changed it. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3058.0s)]
*  For Arizona. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3059.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3061.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3062.0s)]
*  That's rude. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3063.0s)]
*  It's fucked up. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3064.0s)]
*  That's rude. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3065.0s)]
*  Izzy's still the man. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3066.0s)]
*  Yeah, obviously. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3067.0s)]
*  Listen, Izzy almost had him out in the first round. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3068.0s)]
*  The first round, the first round, with seconds to go, he lands that right hand. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3070.0s)]
*  Ba-bink. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3075.0s)]
*  Like right on the chin. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3076.0s)]

*  Well, you don't have to do it because there's guys who don't do it. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3157.0s)]
*  You don't have to do it. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3162.0s)]
*  I mean, Paheta doesn't do it. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3163.0s)]
*  You don't have to do it. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3165.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you can be a freak. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3166.0s)]
*  You can be a scary freak and not talk. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3167.0s)]
*  That's one method. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3169.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3172.0s)]
*  It's like everybody has their own way of approaching it. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3173.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3177.0s)]

*  I forget who it was. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3182.0s)]
*  Who the fuck is that guy? [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3184.0s)]

*  I mean, he's so good on the mic. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3194.0s)]
*  Connor's so good on the mic. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3196.0s)]
*  But Chael Sonnen was the original. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3198.0s)]
*  That's what I was saying about that before. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3199.0s)]
*  He was the first guy that brought a pro-wrestling heel character to MMA with legit fighting skills. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3201.0s)]
*  He wasn't really a 205er. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3211.0s)]
*  His shit talk is hilarious. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3215.0s)]
*  He was an elite 85er, though. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3216.0s)]
*  He was an elite 85er. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3217.0s)]
*  And he was fucking great. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3219.0s)]
*  Anderson Silva, you absolutely suck! [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3221.0s)]
*  That was back. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3225.0s)]
*  That was early, too. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3229.0s)]
*  That was amazing. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3230.0s)]
*  That dude's drinking Mickey's. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3231.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3233.0s)]
*  Get him. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3235.0s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3236.0s)]
*  I got a good one, a good highlight. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3238.0s)]
*  Sean Taylor versus punter, Pro Bowl. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3241.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3244.0s)]
*  This is a fun one. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3245.0s)]
*  You want to see what happens when a normal human tries to run the ball in the NFL? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3246.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3249.0s)]
*  It's pretty great. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3250.0s)]
*  It's also the Pro Bowl, where you're not supposed to kill people. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3251.0s)]
*  So you're not supposed to kill people in the Pro Bowl? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3253.0s)]
*  It's like a touch. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3257.0s)]
*  Look at this normal human trying to run. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3258.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3264.0s)]
*  Bro, that's like a car accident. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3266.0s)]
*  Look at him celebrating. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3268.0s)]
*  Like, yeah, fuck you. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3270.0s)]
*  Bro, he used himself as a human missile. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3271.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3275.0s)]
*  He's like a human missile. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3276.0s)]
*  Dude, Sean Taylor was... [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3278.0s)]
*  You know, that's one of the things that John Jones says about his brother Chandler. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3281.0s)]
*  He goes, I fucked around with him. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3285.0s)]
*  He goes, I was grabbing his wrists while he was sitting down. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3288.0s)]
*  And he said, and Chandler basically lifted him up with his wrists. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3293.0s)]
*  And he goes, I've never felt strength like that in my life. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3298.0s)]
*  He's like, we're just lucky that guy's not fighting. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3300.0s)]
*  Those football guys are terrifying. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3302.0s)]
*  Terrifying. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3304.0s)]
*  There's dudes that can hit. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3305.0s)]
*  Even Mike Allstout highlights. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3307.0s)]
*  We were just watching. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3309.0s)]
*  Do you know Mike Allstout? [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3310.0s)]
*  No. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3311.0s)]
*  Dude, he's a white man running the football, dude. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3312.0s)]
*  It's our last great. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3314.0s)]
*  Well, obviously, Christian McCaffrey, dude. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3315.0s)]
*  Christian McCaffrey runs the ball. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3317.0s)]
*  No, Mike Allstout was just jacked. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3319.0s)]
*  He just ran straight. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3322.0s)]
*  My problem is I know too much about MMA, so I don't have any room for anything else. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3324.0s)]
*  It's very... [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3329.0s)]
*  I'm sure I'd love football. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3330.0s)]
*  Football is so fucking cool. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3331.0s)]
*  I'm sure I'd love football. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3332.0s)]
*  Obviously, yeah. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3334.0s)]
*  But my brain is like... [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3336.0s)]
*  UFC's pretty awesome, dude. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3337.0s)]
*  Yeah, for me, that's enough. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3338.0s)]
*  I hear you. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3340.0s)]
*  I can't only watch so much sports, but for me, that's... [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3341.0s)]
*  This is what I always say. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3344.0s)]
*  If two guys are playing basketball and there becomes a dispute, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3347.0s)]
*  and one guy beats the other guy in basketball, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3350.0s)]
*  the other guy can say, yeah, but I can still beat your ass. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3352.0s)]
*  But if somebody beats your ass, you can't say, yeah, but I can beat you in basketball, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3355.0s)]
*  because nobody cares. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3360.0s)]
*  That's the difference. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3362.0s)]
*  What if you cared about basketball? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3364.0s)]
*  Well, listen, basketball is an awesome sport. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3366.0s)]
*  What if two stand-ups, one guy's an open micer that does jujitsu, one guy's Louis CK, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3368.0s)]
*  he whoops his ass, and Louis can be like, yeah, at least I can do... [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3373.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's different, though, because now you're comparing... [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3377.0s)]
*  No, now, like, his art, his art is undeniable. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3381.0s)]
*  Like, no one cares if Louis can do jujitsu. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3384.0s)]
*  He's like, fucking amazing stand-up. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3386.0s)]
*  But I'm saying in terms of, like, physical competition, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3389.0s)]
*  we're only talking about physical competition. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3393.0s)]
*  It's just like a thing that what all sports are, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3396.0s)]
*  it's like this expression of male dominance or female dominance. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3400.0s)]
*  It's like this expression of becoming, like, whatever it is, [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3403.0s)]
*  whether it's basketball or soccer, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3408.0s)]
*  it's like being the ultimate dominator through a game. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3410.0s)]
*  You ever see soccer? You ever see soccer fights? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3413.0s)]

*  What happened to COVID? [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3716.0s)]
*  The first stripper that was with me was like, opened her mouth. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3718.0s)]
*  Ew! [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3721.0s)]
*  And I was like... [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3722.0s)]
*  What? [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3723.0s)]
*  I was like, I don't want to put money, you don't want money in your mouth. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3724.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3726.0s)]
*  I'm like, given a stripper health advice, I'm like, you don't want to... [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3727.0s)]
*  I don't want to do that. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3730.0s)]
*  Put it in your thing. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3731.0s)]
*  But dudes would put money in their mouth and lay on stage on their back. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3733.0s)]
*  And the stripper would come and take it with her butt. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3739.0s)]
*  It's pretty fun. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3743.0s)]
*  But anyway, the point of the story... [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3744.0s)]
*  Dude, the money in your mouth seems very unsanitary. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3746.0s)]
*  Definitely. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3748.0s)]
*  For sure, right? [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3749.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're going to get a fucked up disease. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3750.0s)]
*  And doesn't most money, there's at least a really good percentage of money that has cocaine on it? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3753.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3760.0s)]
*  Right? [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3761.0s)]
*  Hundreds, I believe, has the highest percentage, but yes. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3762.0s)]
*  So if you're one of those people that gets... [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3764.0s)]
*  Yeah, you reduce coke with a one. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3766.0s)]
*  Jesus, that's a bomber. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3767.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3768.0s)]
*  That's a bomber. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3770.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a bomber. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3772.0s)]
*  That's a sad line. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3774.0s)]
*  God damn, all I got is a one. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3775.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3777.0s)]
*  But no, this lady was dancing. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3780.0s)]
*  She was fucking dudes up. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3782.0s)]
*  My buddy went on stage and she tried to take his belt and whip him, and he was like, no. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3784.0s)]
*  He was like, stop whipping. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3789.0s)]
*  But then she was doing that and she was dominating this guy. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3792.0s)]
*  And I was like, something's going on. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3794.0s)]
*  And then she lifted her arm and she had armpit hair. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3797.0s)]
*  And I was like, what the fuck? [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3800.0s)]
*  It just ruined it, dude. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3802.0s)]
*  Immediately. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3804.0s)]
*  I was into it. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3805.0s)]
*  I was all in. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3806.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3807.0s)]
*  Armpit hair got me. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3808.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3809.0s)]
*  Armpit hair doesn't bother me at all. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3810.0s)]
*  No. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3812.0s)]
*  Does it bother you? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3813.0s)]
*  So wait, you like jacked ladies with armpit hair? [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3814.0s)]
*  Yeah, a little bit. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3816.0s)]
*  You're getting close, dude. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3817.0s)]
*  You're so close. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3819.0s)]
*  That's as close as it gets. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3822.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3828.0s)]
*  I like a good buzz cut. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3829.0s)]
*  I like them bald. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3832.0s)]
*  I like a bald lady. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3833.0s)]
*  She can wear a wig. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3835.0s)]
*  You can be of different hairstyles every night. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3836.0s)]
*  Get some khakis. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3838.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3841.0s)]
*  Damn, that fisherman might have got you, dude. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3843.0s)]
*  Might have set you off. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3845.0s)]
*  Imagine. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3846.0s)]
*  I could have got you. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3847.0s)]
*  I never had a priest. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3849.0s)]
*  What if I did stab him? [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3850.0s)]
*  What if he killed me because I stabbed him? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3851.0s)]
*  There's so many things that could have happened there. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3853.0s)]
*  I don't know what that guy got fired for, but he was a teacher. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3856.0s)]
*  I bet he got fired for fucking kids. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3860.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can't do this shit like that. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3862.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3864.0s)]
*  You weren't Catholic, were you? [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3865.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was Catholic. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3867.0s)]
*  You were a priest? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3868.0s)]
*  I dodged the priests. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3869.0s)]
*  I never had a priest really go for it, but I remember one time I was in confession, and [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3870.0s)]
*  it was right when we were all starting to whack off. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3874.0s)]
*  So the priest, he asked, in the middle of confession, and he was like, do you spill seed? [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3876.0s)]
*  He said, do you spill seed? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3883.0s)]
*  And I thought it was like a biblical reference, like some type of proverb where like, you [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3885.0s)]
*  know, so I was like, yes. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3890.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3892.0s)]
*  I thought it was like a saying for sinning. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3893.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3895.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know, some story where the guy dropped seeds. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3896.0s)]
*  And then I started to slowly realize that he was asking me about coming. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3900.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3904.0s)]
*  He wasn't, I don't know. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3905.0s)]
*  That's a weird job. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3906.0s)]
*  Being a priest, asking fucking eighth graders if they're whacking off. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3908.0s)]
*  It's not appropriate. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3912.0s)]
*  And it's also the problem with the job where you have to be celibate. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3915.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3920.0s)]
*  Any job where you have to be celibate. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3921.0s)]
*  Like, who's going to sign up for that? [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3922.0s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3924.0s)]
*  It's not like they get better seats in heaven. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3925.0s)]
*  No. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3926.0s)]
*  Why are you doing that? [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3927.0s)]
*  Like, you're doing that because you're called to that duty? [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3928.0s)]
*  A good priest, that is cool. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3931.0s)]
*  I do think that is cool. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3933.0s)]
*  A good priest is cool, but the idea that they should be celibate, you're going to eliminate [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3934.0s)]
*  a lot of people that don't want that job. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3938.0s)]
*  The dudes that are like, fuck it, I'll just be a priest. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3940.0s)]
*  Like, if you're thinking about what job you want to have, you're like, I'll just be a priest. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3942.0s)]
*  Some people do do that because they're raised Catholic. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3947.0s)]
*  And they're like, look, if I do it, I'm 100% guaranteed in. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3951.0s)]
*  All you have to do is like- [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3955.0s)]
*  You got to go to school. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3957.0s)]
*  You don't have to go to school. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3958.0s)]
*  You're in there. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3959.0s)]
*  You're a priest now. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3960.0s)]
*  You got to go to seminary for fucking seven years. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3961.0s)]
*  And people treat you well if you're a priest. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3964.0s)]
*  It's a respected part of the community. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3966.0s)]
*  It's funny how much they're kind of- oh, dude, my friend Matt, you met Matt McCusker. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3968.0s)]
*  We were laughing so hard about- like, priests, you got a fucking pretty easy job. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3975.0s)]
*  You're set up. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3980.0s)]
*  You live next to the church. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3981.0s)]
*  You go do this. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3982.0s)]
*  But then every once in a while, you got to get hit with a dude at confession that's just [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3983.0s)]
*  like, I sucked my friend's dick at golf. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3987.0s)]
*  Like, what? [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3991.0s)]
*  Like, dude's hitting you with confessions. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3992.0s)]
*  And then you look out and see him in church. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3994.0s)]
*  Like, while you're performing Mass, you look out, there's a guy like- you see you, like, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=3996.0s)]
*  oh, that's a guy who blows his friends. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4000.0s)]
*  You know? [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4002.0s)]
*  You know the whole congregation's secrets. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4003.0s)]
*  That was a thing that they invented purely so that they could, like, spy on people. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4005.0s)]
*  It's blackmail. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4012.0s)]
*  Well, not blackmail. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4013.0s)]
*  They wanted to know who was doing what. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4014.0s)]
*  And if you could give people an out that allows you to go to heaven, but you have to tell. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4016.0s)]
*  You got to tell yourself. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4022.0s)]
*  You got to tell yourself. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4023.0s)]
*  If you tell us, yeah. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4024.0s)]
*  But then I'll tell you, you're going to do a bunch of Hail Marys, and it's going to be [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4025.0s)]
*  good. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4028.0s)]
*  You're still going to go to heaven. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4029.0s)]
*  Like, a completely human-created loophole. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4030.0s)]
*  Just to acquire data. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4033.0s)]
*  Just like, that's what it is. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4035.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was pre-Google. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4037.0s)]
*  Yeah, they were just acquiring data on the people. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4038.0s)]
*  It's fucked up. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4041.0s)]
*  I just had a revelation. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4042.0s)]
*  I think that's- I tell on myself. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4043.0s)]
*  Do you? [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4044.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was raised Catholic my whole life. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4045.0s)]
*  I constantly tell- when I was a kid, I would tell on myself. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4049.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's probably- [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4052.0s)]
*  I still tell on myself. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4053.0s)]
*  It's built into the system. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4054.0s)]
*  I felt like when I was a young kid, I remember I went to Catholic school for one year, and [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4056.0s)]
*  I had this nun that was teaching the class. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4064.0s)]
*  I didn't have a priest. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4068.0s)]
*  We had a nun. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4069.0s)]
*  And her name was Sister Mary Josephine, and she was so mean. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4070.0s)]
*  It was always two. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4073.0s)]
*  Yeah, we had Sister Michael Anne. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4074.0s)]
*  We all had wild names. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4076.0s)]
*  She was so mean, dude. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4077.0s)]
*  She was so mean. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4079.0s)]
*  She would tell you that she's going to make you sit on a nail in the closet, and you better [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4080.0s)]
*  bring your pajamas because you're staying here tonight. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4085.0s)]
*  Kids would cry. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4088.0s)]
*  Yeah, fuck you up. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4089.0s)]
*  They would cry. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4090.0s)]
*  We'd be so scared. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4091.0s)]
*  Because I went from being with my mom, who's like this sweet lady. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4092.0s)]
*  This is the lady that I'm used to. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4096.0s)]
*  My mom's nice to me. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4098.0s)]
*  She loves me. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4099.0s)]
*  She's a nasty lady. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4100.0s)]
*  To all of a sudden this crazy bitch that doesn't even get to fuck. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4101.0s)]
*  The fucking mustache. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4104.0s)]
*  You're dressed in this weird costume, and she was so mean. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4106.0s)]
*  What it did to me at an early age was like, oh, OK, that's bullshit. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4113.0s)]
*  Because you have to see things that are so stunningly obvious. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4118.0s)]
*  This had nothing to do with God. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4123.0s)]
*  This is like a mean person who's just torturing kids. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4124.0s)]
*  And since I hadn't been around that, it was very unusual for me. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4127.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, this is all horse shit. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4131.0s)]
*  And then I think there was a period after that where I was fucking kind of [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4134.0s)]
*  really weirded out. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4140.0s)]
*  Because then I was thinking, well, if this is bullshit, does this mean that [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4141.0s)]
*  nobody knows? [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4145.0s)]
*  Nobody knows? [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4146.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4147.0s)]
*  Do you remember that the first time you realized that nobody knows what [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4148.0s)]
*  happens when you die? [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4152.0s)]
*  I can tell you exactly what it was. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4153.0s)]
*  It was sixth grade. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4155.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4157.0s)]
*  Maybe fifth. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4158.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4159.0s)]
*  And then I get it wrong. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4160.0s)]
*  We were at my friend's. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4161.0s)]
*  We had built a fort at my friend's house. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4163.0s)]
*  We were all back there. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4165.0s)]
*  And we were like, I don't know if God's real. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4166.0s)]
*  And everyone at the same time was like, yeah, dude, I know. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4169.0s)]
*  We're not allowed to talk about it. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4172.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4173.0s)]
*  That's the thing, right? [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4174.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4175.0s)]
*  Especially if you have a religious family. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4176.0s)]
*  You're not allowed to talk about it. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4179.0s)]
*  People get very upset if you even just want to breach a subject. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4180.0s)]
*  I think, I mean, I was, if I told my dad, I mean, here in a fifth [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4185.0s)]
*  grader saying, I don't know if God's real, fuck you up. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4189.0s)]
*  My dad's just drinking, watching sports. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4192.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4194.0s)]
*  Kids do worry about that, man. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4195.0s)]
*  You know, when I was younger, I used to really think that religion is just a [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4199.0s)]
*  panacea for the masses and it's not necessary and it's really outdated. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4203.0s)]
*  And, you know, you should know better than to believe that. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4208.0s)]
*  But as I've gotten older, I realized that it acts as like a scaffolding for [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4210.0s)]
*  behavior. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4214.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4215.0s)]
*  And it also gives people a sense of being, of like being a part of something [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4216.0s)]
*  that means something to them. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4221.0s)]
*  To say that that's not valuable is crazy. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4223.0s)]
*  That's what's cool if you talk to like a good priest. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4226.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4228.0s)]
*  Like if you talk to a good one, they'll tell you that. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4229.0s)]
*  They'll go, yeah, no one knows. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4231.0s)]
*  But it's good. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4233.0s)]
*  And a good philosopher will say the same thing. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4234.0s)]
*  That's why I always question people that say that they they know what's going to [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4236.0s)]
*  happen when they die. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4240.0s)]
*  There'll be just blankness. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4241.0s)]
*  People love to say that. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4243.0s)]
*  It's a very common thing, right? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4244.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4247.0s)]
*  People love to say that when it's over, you just die and that you go black. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4248.0s)]
*  But we don't know that. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4251.0s)]
*  We don't know that. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4253.0s)]
*  This whole thing is weird enough that I think we should entertain every [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4254.0s)]
*  possibility. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4258.0s)]
*  You got to feel real weird. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4259.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4261.0s)]
*  Your life's fucking crazy. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4262.0s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4264.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's very weird. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4265.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4267.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4268.0s)]
*  Me and my buddy O'Connor, who you met last night, we were talking about on the way. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4269.0s)]
*  It was like, guys, it's the perfect setup. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4272.0s)]
*  It's pretty sweet. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4276.0s)]
*  UFC podcast stand up. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4277.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4279.0s)]
*  Stuff I like. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4280.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4281.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4282.0s)]
*  That's cool. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4283.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4284.0s)]
*  That's a good club. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4285.0s)]
*  You can do that too, bro. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4286.0s)]
*  I'm trying. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4287.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4288.0s)]
*  That club? [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4289.0s)]
*  You murdered last night. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4290.0s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4291.0s)]
*  That was fun. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4292.0s)]
*  I get uncomfortable doing well like that. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4293.0s)]
*  It was too well. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4296.0s)]
*  I get a standing ovation when I walked out. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4297.0s)]
*  I was like, all right, you see me? [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4300.0s)]
*  I looked up at you. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4302.0s)]
*  Well, that fucking crowd is magic. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4303.0s)]
*  It's like magic right away, right from the jump. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4305.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4307.0s)]
*  That was a lot of people on the show too. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4308.0s)]
*  It was a long ass show last night. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4311.0s)]
*  A long show. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4313.0s)]
*  And then Dave goes up in the little room for the first time last night. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4314.0s)]
*  I was sweating. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4317.0s)]
*  Yeah, the place is pretty sick. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4318.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4320.0s)]
*  That was cool. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4321.0s)]
*  Bringing up Dave was cool. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4322.0s)]
*  I wish he would have been ready. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4323.0s)]
*  Instead I had to be like, ladies and gentlemen, Dave Chappelle. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4325.0s)]
*  He just wasn't there. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4328.0s)]
*  It was okay. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4329.0s)]
*  He was like, he's coming. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4330.0s)]
*  He's coming. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4331.0s)]
*  It was perfect because it wasn't smooth. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4332.0s)]
*  So it set up the conversational style of stand up that he was doing and fucking around. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4335.0s)]
*  And he also didn't know where the stage was. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4340.0s)]
*  So he was like, how do I get up here? [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4342.0s)]
*  And he went to the middle and then they're like, no, you got to go that way. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4343.0s)]
*  Dave. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4346.0s)]
*  His was funny when he does that where he's doing the conversational thing. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4347.0s)]
*  It's almost like I think he knows what the joke's going to be because he'll keep talking. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4351.0s)]
*  And you're like, oh, man, all he's doing is making a point right now. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4357.0s)]
*  And then right at the very end, he hits a fucking. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4360.0s)]
*  Hits a zinger. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4363.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4364.0s)]
*  Well, he practices. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4365.0s)]
*  That's what he wanted to do last night. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4367.0s)]
*  That was like a practice set, which is really interesting. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4369.0s)]
*  It's like he gives him an opportunity to fuck around. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4372.0s)]
*  And in that fucking around, he'll come up with an idea and then he'll pursue that idea. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4375.0s)]
*  They'll watch the film. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4380.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4487.0s)]
*  It's also good that we're doing these shows where there's so many killers on. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4488.0s)]
*  That's what we missed. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4491.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4492.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4497.0s)]
*  Well, that's what we were missing. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4498.0s)]
*  That's what we had at the store. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4501.0s)]
*  The store was always just killer after killer after killer and it's just really good for [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4503.0s)]
*  you. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4507.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4508.0s)]
*  And when you take that away, it's like you kind of like, as a good comedy gem, that's [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4510.0s)]
*  what you really want to reproduce. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4518.0s)]
*  You want to recreate the environment of a bunch of people that are sort of feeding off [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4520.0s)]
*  of each other. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4525.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4526.0s)]
*  Where they're like, this guy's killing. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4527.0s)]
*  It's like, God, I got to pick my game up. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4528.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4529.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4531.0s)]
*  It's very important. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4532.0s)]
*  And people don't want to, for some reason, some comics don't want to think about that. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4533.0s)]
*  They don't want to address that. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4537.0s)]
*  They like to think that they're completely self-made. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4538.0s)]
*  But we are so heavily influenced by our friends. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4541.0s)]
*  We're so heavily influenced by just the hang. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4545.0s)]
*  Just the way we're always hanging out and talking shit and having a good time together, [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4548.0s)]
*  but then also heavily influenced by our sets. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4553.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4555.0s)]
*  I don't want to sound corny, but yeah, that's the thing you want. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4556.0s)]
*  You want your other comics' respect is the most important thing. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4559.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4563.0s)]

*  No. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4642.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4643.0s)]
*  And then Jamie, I've never seen you on the prowl like that, dude. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4644.0s)]
*  Talking to the mic, dude. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4648.0s)]
*  Have fun. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4650.0s)]
*  He was trying to have fun, dude. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4651.0s)]
*  Jamie's usually not. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4653.0s)]
*  Wednesday night. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4654.0s)]
*  He's ready to get rowdy. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4655.0s)]
*  Thank God we didn't go back to the club and drink. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4656.0s)]
*  Tony was like, let's just leave and go back to the club. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4659.0s)]
*  I was like, dude, if we drink, it's 2. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4661.0s)]
*  It's 2 o'clock right now. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4663.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4665.0s)]
*  If we go back to the club, we're there until 4. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4666.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4667.0s)]
*  Go to bed. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4668.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4669.0s)]
*  Bedtime. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4670.0s)]
*  I'm decent. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4671.0s)]
*  I'm getting good at bedtime. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4672.0s)]
*  The problem if you don't do bedtime is you wake up too late and then you miss a big part of the day. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4673.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4678.0s)]
*  It's not good. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4679.0s)]
*  I do that. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4680.0s)]
*  Yeah, but if you have some shit you've got to do, these late nights, Dave wants to stay up to 3, 4, 30 in the morning. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4681.0s)]
*  He just wants to keep going. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4690.0s)]
*  He goes. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4691.0s)]
*  He just keeps going. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4692.0s)]
*  He's the DJ. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4693.0s)]
*  He was the DJ in the bar. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4694.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4696.0s)]
*  I'll do that. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4697.0s)]
*  I won't fucking hit the DJ. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4698.0s)]
*  Bargazzi has a funny bit about it, being a comic, and you wake up at 11. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4700.0s)]
*  So you wake up and the day is you've got 40 missed phone calls. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4704.0s)]
*  Every day he wakes up, the day is already done. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4708.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4710.0s)]
*  He's like, oh shit. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4711.0s)]
*  But you have to get good sleep too. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4713.0s)]
*  So if you do go to bed at 3 o'clock in the morning, you really should sleep till 11. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4715.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4718.0s)]
*  You really should. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4719.0s)]
*  But then you've got to get going. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4720.0s)]
*  Stop. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4723.0s)]
*  Stop. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4724.0s)]
*  It's hard. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4726.0s)]
*  The thing that gets you for real is drinking. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4727.0s)]
*  That's what gets you. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4730.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4731.0s)]
*  You're drinking clubs a lot. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4732.0s)]
*  You're wearing yourself out. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4734.0s)]
*  I've been going to the fucking, I've been doing The Cellar totally sober. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4735.0s)]

*  That's tough, man. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4739.0s)]

*  Five spots sober. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4741.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4742.0s)]
*  You just got to sit there for four hours. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4743.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4745.0s)]
*  What do you do? [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4746.0s)]
*  Get bored. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4747.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4748.0s)]
*  Find someone to talk to. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4749.0s)]
*  You've got to make small talk with another comedian sober. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4750.0s)]
*  Yeah, you've got to get into marijuana, son. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4752.0s)]
*  It's so bad. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4755.0s)]
*  I don't have the brain for it. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4758.0s)]
*  What about microdosing mushrooms? [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4759.0s)]
*  I can fucking crush mushrooms. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4761.0s)]
*  Maybe a little bit. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4762.0s)]
*  Just a little bit. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4763.0s)]
*  What about just coke? [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4764.0s)]

*  Maybe I'm fighting it for all this time and I'm going to become a coke advocate. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4767.0s)]
*  I'm going to do coke. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4768.0s)]

*  Now that's another problem. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4771.0s)]

*  I saw Joe Rogan screaming. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4807.96s)]
*  Well, that was because I was talking to radio and radio was going to go meet Dave and we [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4809.6s)]
*  were talking, we were getting hyped up for the show. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4815.04s)]
*  I go, radio, let's fucking go. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4817.24s)]
*  Yeah, it was fun. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4819.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4820.48s)]
*  How about radio? [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4821.48s)]
*  Oh, he's awesome. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4822.48s)]
*  The I love you? [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4823.48s)]
*  What's that? [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4824.48s)]
*  Oh, that was hilarious. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4825.48s)]
*  I love you. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4826.48s)]
*  I love you too. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4827.48s)]
*  When he was explaining, I was like, oh shit, that's you, dude. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4828.48s)]
*  That was hilarious. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4831.48s)]
*  We were eating dinner and there's a thing that radio did when he was interviewing Logan [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4832.48s)]
*  Paul where Logan Paul was, he was talking about talking to his brother, saying to his [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4837.679999999999s)]
*  brother, I love you and radio thought he was telling him he loved him and he's like, I [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4842.2s)]
*  love you too. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4847.92s)]
*  But the reason why radio said that is because Logan says, I love you to him all the time. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4849.04s)]
*  He's like a very friendly, gregarious guy. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4852.36s)]
*  So it was natural for him to say, I love you too. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4855.24s)]
*  And he's like, oh no, what have I done? [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4857.84s)]
*  So Shane realizes in the middle of the conversation while we're eating dinner that that's who [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4862.4400000000005s)]
*  he is. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4867.88s)]
*  When you go, oh shit, that's you. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4868.88s)]
*  I kept saying it the rest of the night. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4871.84s)]
*  I'd see him. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4873.36s)]
*  I go, I love you, dude. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4874.36s)]
*  He was like, all right, man. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4875.36s)]
*  I was like, there's nothing to be ashamed of, dude. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4878.799999999999s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4880.799999999999s)]
*  Oh, I love you too. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4881.799999999999s)]
*  I love you too. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4883.48s)]
*  That was hilarious. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4884.48s)]
*  Oh, it's a bad one. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4885.48s)]
*  That's so funny. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4888.48s)]
*  Dude, that is the actual worst version of, you know, doesn't Brian have a bit of, Brian [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4889.48s)]

*  I just hope that the Usyk fight happens. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4991.12s)]
*  Tyson Fury is in my opinion, he's like one of the hardest puzzles to solve in the history [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4993.52s)]
*  of the heavyweight division. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=4998.120000000001s)]

*  Hard to read pops you knocked out Wilder twice. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5010.96s)]
*  I mean, come on, man. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5014.240000000001s)]
*  Wilder nukes everybody. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5017.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5018.92s)]
*  It wasn't for Tyson Fury. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5019.92s)]
*  Like who knows? [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5021.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5022.4800000000005s)]
*  He would have. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5024.44s)]
*  He might nuke them all. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5025.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5026.44s)]
*  Tyson Fury just got his number, man. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5027.44s)]
*  That's a bummer. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5029.679999999999s)]
*  That sucks, dude. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5030.679999999999s)]

*  Especially because he all. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5036.24s)]
*  That first fight. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5038.16s)]
*  Wilder almost got him. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5039.16s)]
*  Had him. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5040.16s)]
*  I mean, it looked like he was out. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5041.16s)]
*  He had him. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5042.32s)]
*  Lying flat on his back. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5043.32s)]
*  Full Undertaker, dude. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5044.32s)]
*  Just got up. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5045.32s)]
*  Nuts. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5046.32s)]
*  Dude, those gypsies are just not the same. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5047.32s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5050.32s)]
*  Those are not regular white people. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5051.32s)]
*  Those are fucked up freaks, dude. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5053.76s)]
*  That guy's a freak. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5056.76s)]

*  It's awesome. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5059.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5060.96s)]
*  It's awesome, dude. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5061.96s)]
*  It is awesome. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5062.96s)]
*  His fucking back fat. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5063.96s)]
*  He's going up against a chiseled brach dude. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5064.96s)]
*  You're like, oh yes, dude. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5066.96s)]
*  So he's flat on his back. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5068.76s)]
*  Here comes a complete freak. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5070.96s)]
*  And now watch this. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5073.5199999999995s)]
*  Just gets right up to his feet. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5074.5199999999995s)]
*  Now he says he's fine. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5082.0s)]
*  He walks over there jiggling. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5084.4800000000005s)]
*  All that fat jiggling. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5085.4800000000005s)]
*  So now here's what's crazy though. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5088.16s)]
*  He thought, Deontay thought the fight was over. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5090.12s)]
*  Right? [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5092.96s)]
*  That's a very embarrassing clip for Deontay. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5093.96s)]
*  Yeah, he thought he had him. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5096.4400000000005s)]
*  You see him get up and you're like, oh shit. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5097.76s)]
*  Yeah, there's a look when he sees him get up. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5099.76s)]
*  Watch. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5102.72s)]
*  Right now he realizes he got up. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5104.12s)]
*  And he's like, oh shit. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5105.68s)]
*  He's back up. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5108.320000000001s)]
*  And so then from that round on, Tyson Fury beat him. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5109.98s)]
*  And Tyson Fury figured out that if you get Deontay to back up, he's not as effective. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5115.259999999999s)]
*  Was that a draw? [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5119.74s)]
*  Like that thing that you saw Stipe do where he ran and knocked out Fabricio Verdun. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5120.74s)]
*  That's so hard to do. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5125.86s)]
*  And some guys just can't do that. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5127.9s)]
*  And Deontay is much better going forward. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5129.74s)]
*  So in all the fights after that, Tyson Fury just controlled the pace, controlled the distance, [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5132.0599999999995s)]
*  kept him backing up and was super aggressive. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5138.26s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5141.34s)]
*  Tyson's the funniest man. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5144.18s)]
*  He's the best. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5145.46s)]
*  He's fucking funny, dude. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5146.46s)]
*  Bitch. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5147.46s)]
*  Oosik. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5148.46s)]
*  He calls everybody bitches. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5149.46s)]
*  Yeah, nothing. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5151.46s)]
*  Yeah, I can't even describe. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5152.46s)]
*  A tosser. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5154.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5155.46s)]
*  Absolute tosser. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5156.46s)]
*  Scared to fight me. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5157.46s)]
*  When he's singing, his singing. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5162.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5163.1s)]
*  He's like, walking in Vegas. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5164.1s)]
*  A long, long time ago, I can still remember. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5167.700000000001s)]
*  He just knocked a guy out. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5171.700000000001s)]
*  He's a fucking insane person. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5173.700000000001s)]
*  He's just singing. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5176.700000000001s)]
*  That has to hurt losing to him. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5179.700000000001s)]
*  And you hear it while you're walking back to the tunnel. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5181.700000000001s)]
*  You hear this fucking guy. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5183.700000000001s)]
*  I can still remember how that music used to make me smile. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5185.700000000001s)]
*  That doesn't even make sense. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5192.700000000001s)]
*  You just want to fight. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5195.7s)]
*  I can make those people dance. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5197.7s)]
*  And maybe they'd be happy for a while. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5200.7s)]
*  Look at all those people sitting there. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5206.7s)]
*  What the fuck is happening? [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5208.7s)]
*  It's the longest song you can think. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5210.7s)]

*  I can't remember if I cried when I read about his widowed wife. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5221.7s)]
*  Something touched me deep inside. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5228.7s)]
*  The day the music started. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5232.7s)]
*  He's trying so hard to sing, dude. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5236.7s)]

*  Just getting fucked up and singing together. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5267.7s)]
*  You and your boys come up with a song. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5269.7s)]
*  That's fun. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5271.7s)]
*  Our American chants suck. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5272.7s)]
*  We're not even close. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5274.7s)]
*  Those songs that they sing back in the war days. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5276.7s)]
*  They would go on campaigns and sing war songs. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5280.7s)]
*  In a trench. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5284.7s)]

*  It's like that George Washington thing. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5347.7s)]
*  I don't want to say anything. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5350.7s)]

*  It's fucking fun. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5358.7s)]
*  It's fun because it's engaging me and it's entertaining me. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5360.7s)]
*  It's engaging me, it's interesting, and it's also very funny. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5364.7s)]
*  It never worked. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5368.7s)]
*  I remember in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, one of the open mics where I started Amish Country, [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5370.7s)]
*  there was a joke I always used to try. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5376.7s)]
*  The guy who was running the mic would always be like, do it. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5379.7s)]
*  Do the Civil War joke. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5381.7s)]
*  It never worked. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5383.7s)]
*  It was like two dudes walking to shoot each other. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5385.7s)]
*  You had to walk. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5389.7s)]
*  It was something about how racist you had to be to be in the south and wake up one day [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5391.7s)]
*  and be like, wait, they freed who? [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5396.7s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5398.7s)]
*  I'm going up there and walking the whole way. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5400.7s)]
*  You had to sleep at night and wake up and go, son of a bitch. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5403.7s)]
*  They walked from Alabama to Maryland and you got shot in the head right away. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5407.7s)]
*  There's a great joke about that where they'll tell you the Civil War wasn't about slavery. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5412.7s)]
*  It was about economics. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5418.7s)]
*  Like, yeah, you didn't want to pay the help. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5420.7s)]
*  Whose joke is that? [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5423.7s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5425.7s)]
*  Somebody has that joke. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5427.7s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5429.7s)]
*  People try to act like the Civil War wasn't about slavery. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5431.7s)]
*  Is it Bill Maher? [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5433.7s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5435.7s)]
*  It might be Bill Maher. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5437.7s)]
*  It's someone good. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5439.7s)]
*  Your division or fucking your brigade would be from your town. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5441.7s)]
*  You never left your town. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5445.7s)]
*  Your brigade back then was everybody you grew up with. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5447.7s)]
*  Every dude. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5450.7s)]
*  Your son, your brother, your uncle, and your dad. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5452.7s)]
*  You're all fucking together. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5454.7s)]
*  You're marching shoulder to shoulder. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5456.7s)]
*  You watch your fucking dad get his head ripped off by a cannonball. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5459.7s)]
*  You just got to keep being like, oh fuck. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5463.7s)]
*  Oh fuck. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5466.7s)]
*  You knew who was getting shot. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5468.7s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5472.7s)]
*  Dude. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5474.7s)]
*  I don't know why that's funny. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5476.7s)]
*  Imagine. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5478.7s)]
*  How about the trench warfare of World War I? [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5480.7s)]
*  Started in the Civil War. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5482.7s)]
*  Siege of Vicksburg, I think. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5484.7s)]
*  That's when they started trench warfare? [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5486.7s)]
*  They say the Civil War in America was like the first modern war. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5488.7s)]
*  This is revolutionary. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5492.7s)]
*  It's just getting pumped. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5494.7s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5496.7s)]
*  Walking towards each other. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5498.7s)]
*  The stupidest way to do it ever. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5500.7s)]
*  Can you imagine that people did this for some... [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5502.7s)]
*  Oh god. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5504.7s)]
*  Oh god. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5506.7s)]
*  Hitting the face with a cannonball. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5508.7s)]
*  The Patriots are roughly based off of... [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5510.7s)]
*  I think his name is Francis Marion, the swamp fox. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5512.7s)]
*  He was kind of an originator of guerrilla warfare. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5516.7s)]
*  Because they were like, we can't stand and fight the British. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5520.7s)]
*  We're going to have to shoot them and run. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5524.7s)]
*  Which is pretty funny. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5526.7s)]
*  How crazy are the British? [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5528.7s)]
*  Just going to come over here and start marching. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5532.7s)]
*  With a big white stripe on your chest. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5534.7s)]
*  Red jackets. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5536.7s)]
*  It's 100% a target. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5538.7s)]
*  Red and white is what you use for archery targets. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5540.7s)]
*  They had to change. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5542.7s)]
*  It's so dumb. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5544.7s)]
*  Once Reichling took over they had to be like, we've got to switch our uniforms. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5546.7s)]
*  Isn't that amazing though? [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5550.7s)]
*  You had to think of how much the British army conquered in the world. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5552.7s)]
*  Everybody. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5556.7s)]
*  Everybody. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5558.7s)]
*  Imagine that their decision to fight was this way. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5560.7s)]
*  How? [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5564.7s)]
*  How did you get from the Mongols to that? [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5566.7s)]
*  How does that happen in a thousand years? [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5570.7s)]
*  The Mongols had all these crazy tactics. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5574.7s)]
*  They would starve people out. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5576.7s)]
*  Lock them in their cities. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5578.7s)]
*  They would wait them out slowly. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5580.7s)]
*  You get artillery and guns. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5582.7s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5584.7s)]
*  That's just running it down your throat. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5586.7s)]
*  We're going to walk at you. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5588.7s)]
*  I just can't imagine that someone wouldn't say, isn't there a fucking better way to fight these people? [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5590.7s)]
*  What are we doing? [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5596.7s)]
*  Let's get behind a tree and then shoot them. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5598.7s)]
*  I can't even watch this. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5600.7s)]
*  I can't believe people did that. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5602.7s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5604.7s)]
*  How did they survive to become that silly? [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5606.7s)]
*  That's a silly way to fight a war. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5608.7s)]
*  How did they survive with those strategies? [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5610.7s)]
*  How were they dominant with those strategies? [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5612.7s)]
*  Most of them are colonies. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5614.7s)]
*  Where the other guys have cow hide shields and spears like the Zulu. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5616.7s)]
*  So they were the only ones with mustards? [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5620.7s)]
*  You have fucking guns. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5622.7s)]
*  You're going to win. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5624.7s)]
*  You're the only ones with guns. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5626.7s)]
*  So the British were the only ones with guns? [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5628.7s)]
*  When it came to their colonies. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5630.7s)]
*  In a land war they were the only ones with guns. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5632.7s)]
*  When it came to their colonies. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5634.7s)]
*  In a land war they would lose a lot to France, Prussia. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5636.7s)]
*  Those major continental powers. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5640.7s)]
*  But England always had a navy. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5642.7s)]
*  They always dominated through naval warfare. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5644.7s)]
*  And then they had to team up with everyone to stop Napoleon. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5646.7s)]
*  Dude, once they started shooting cannonballs off boats. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5650.7s)]
*  That must have been a game changer. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5654.7s)]
*  When did they start doing that? [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5656.7s)]
*  When did they start doing cannonballs from boats? [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5658.7s)]
*  Because that's what they're doing. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5660.7s)]
*  Cannonballs from boats. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5662.7s)]
*  Bro, that is a motherfucker. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5664.7s)]
*  You got a cannon on a boat? [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5666.7s)]
*  Shooting people without cannons? [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5668.7s)]
*  Boom! [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5670.7s)]
*  You just do this all day. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5672.7s)]
*  How many times did they have to shoot that cannon before they figured out how hard they had to bolt it into the floor? [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5674.7s)]
*  A lot. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5678.7s)]
*  They shot out the other side of the boat. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5680.7s)]
*  You got a floating wooden thing with this giant iron tube on it. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5682.7s)]
*  That has explosions go off on it. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5688.7s)]
*  And just four poor guys from Manchester operating it. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5690.7s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5696.7s)]
*  Boom! [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5698.7s)]
*  You ever see Master and Commander with Russell Crowe? [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5700.7s)]
*  I think I have. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5702.7s)]
*  Oh, Jamie, back me up, dude. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5704.7s)]
*  I don't remember it. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5706.7s)]
*  It's way more popular now than it was when it came out. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5708.7s)]
*  I read an article about that. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5712.7s)]
*  Why are so many men into Master and Commander? [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5714.7s)]
*  I thought it was a good idea. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5716.7s)]
*  I thought it was a video. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5718.7s)]
*  What did they say? [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5720.7s)]
*  Is this guy was gay? [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5722.7s)]
*  I don't read articles. I read headlines. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5724.7s)]
*  That's what I read. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5726.7s)]
*  And then I form my own opinions. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5728.7s)]
*  There's a study out, bro. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5730.7s)]
*  You don't even know about that study. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5732.7s)]
*  It says more men like Master and Commander than like anime. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5734.7s)]
*  That's good. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5738.7s)]
*  That would be good. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5740.7s)]
*  But it's why they like it. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5742.7s)]
*  Master and Commander is good. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5744.7s)]
*  Look at this, dude. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5746.7s)]
*  That's fun. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5748.7s)]
*  Guys on boats. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5750.7s)]
*  Boys on boats. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5752.7s)]
*  You get to grab the boys when they're sleeping. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5754.7s)]
*  Don't tell anyone about this, mate. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5756.7s)]
*  How weird is it they're using a sextant in a cloudy day? [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5758.7s)]
*  How are they doing that? [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5762.7s)]
*  Isn't a sextant based off the stars? [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5764.7s)]
*  Isn't that what it works? [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5766.7s)]
*  I have no idea. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5768.7s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck they did. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5770.7s)]
*  Those things those kids are looking through, which this is really wild, [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5772.7s)]
*  that was how they would navigate. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5776.7s)]
*  Imagine the crude tool that they were using to float around in the fucking ocean. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5778.7s)]
*  And they would do it somehow or another through the stars. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5784.7s)]
*  That book, the first thing I ever talked to you about was Kabeisa De Vaca. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5788.7s)]
*  And they were like, the guy they hired to do the navigating like fucked up. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5792.7s)]
*  They had no idea. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5798.7s)]
*  He had to be like, no, I know where we're going. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5800.7s)]
*  How accurate are those sextants? [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5802.7s)]
*  I think if you're off, especially going from Spain, if you're off like a little, you're fucked. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5804.7s)]
*  It looks like we have an updated version now. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5810.7s)]
*  Does it have like computers on it and shit? [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5813.7s)]
*  Same thing? [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5815.7s)]
*  Better scope maybe. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5816.7s)]
*  It looks dope. That looks way better. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5817.7s)]
*  So how does it work? [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5819.7s)]
*  There's a description. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5821.7s)]
*  The estimation of, okay, a sextant is a doubly reflecting navigation instrument [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5824.7s)]
*  that measures the angular distance between two visible objects. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5832.7s)]
*  The primary use of a sextant is to measure the angle between an astronomical object [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5836.7s)]
*  and the horizon for the purpose of celestial navigation. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5841.7s)]
*  So the estimation of this angle, the altitude, is known as sighting or shooting the object or taking a sight. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5845.7s)]
*  The angle and the time when it was measured can be used to calculate a position line on a nautical or aeronautical chart. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5852.7s)]
*  For example, sighting the sun at noon or Polaris at night in the Northern Hemisphere. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5860.7s)]
*  To estimate latitude with sight reduction, sighting the height of the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5865.7s)]
*  I don't understand any of it. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5872.7s)]
*  It seems like they're using dots in the sky. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5874.7s)]
*  So like one of them would be the sun, one of them would be the moon. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5877.7s)]
*  And because they're calculating the angles of how far the things are away from each other and where the stars are, [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5881.7s)]
*  you can kind of figure out where you are in the ocean. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5889.7s)]
*  Somehow. I'm not sure I understand it. But now they just use GPS, which is way better. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5892.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5897.7s)]
*  Imagine back then when they just didn't know where they were and they thought they were in India. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5898.7s)]
*  You know? [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5903.7s)]
*  Sort of. It's a moving GIF. I can't control it, but it's showing how it works. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5905.7s)]
*  You read the angle. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5910.7s)]
*  I'm not going to figure this out right now. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5911.7s)]
*  Yeah, we're too dumb for this. We're too dumb. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5913.7s)]
*  But it's amazing that they use those to travel all around the world. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5915.7s)]
*  Like they trusted those things and the way you would figure it out. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5920.7s)]
*  Yeah, if you were off, you're dead. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5923.7s)]
*  Yeah, not good. And you might have scurvy anyways. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5924.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5927.7s)]
*  What, are you eating beef jerky every day? [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5928.7s)]
*  Yeah. You hit no wind. You're just on flat sea. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5929.7s)]
*  They're all sick. They would get sick. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5933.7s)]
*  Yeah, there's mutinies constantly. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5936.7s)]
*  You'd be like, this guy's going to fucking get us killed. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5937.7s)]
*  And then storms were completely unpredictable. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5941.7s)]
*  You had no idea when a storm was coming. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5944.7s)]
*  That is a DeVaca story. I kind of forget it, but... [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5946.7s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5949.7s)]
*  So I think they were in Cuba, Hispaniola, and they left and they landed in like Tampa. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5951.7s)]
*  And they were like, half of the party go get on a sailboat or meet us at the harbor. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5958.7s)]
*  There's a harbor up this coastline. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5963.7s)]
*  And they're like, all right, we'll just half the party is going to walk. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5964.7s)]
*  Half the party is going to take the boat. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5966.7s)]
*  And there was no harbor. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5968.7s)]
*  Then they just got, they had to walk from Tampa to Mexico City. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5970.7s)]
*  Three of them made it. They all got killed. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5975.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5978.7s)]
*  Yeah. Pretty fun. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5979.7s)]
*  They had to survive waves like this back then too. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5980.7s)]
*  Yep. 100%. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5982.7s)]
*  But they could not. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5983.7s)]
*  But they didn't. They went under. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5985.7s)]
*  I mean, that's why those boats sank. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5986.7s)]
*  There's so many of those pirate ships. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5988.7s)]
*  And how about the Roman ships they find that sank with like a fucking billion dollars and a gold in them? [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5990.7s)]
*  Yeah. Spanish. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5996.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5997.7s)]
*  Spanish coming back from the New World. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=5998.7s)]
*  There's probably a bunch of those out there. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6000.7s)]
*  Those guys that find like hidden treasure or sunken treasure. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6002.7s)]
*  Pretty cool. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6006.7s)]
*  That's a wild thing, man. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6007.7s)]
*  Can you imagine if you're a guy who's invested all this money, got all this stress, you got a team of divers. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6008.7s)]
*  It's basically like a CBS drama show. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6014.7s)]
*  You got a team of divers and they finally find it. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6017.7s)]
*  And now you got to protect it from pirates. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6020.7s)]
*  You got to kill those guys that were on the dive with you. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6022.7s)]
*  We just found a trillion dollars. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6026.7s)]
*  I bet that happens a lot, right? [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6028.7s)]
*  I bet guys kill each other. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6030.7s)]
*  Probably. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6031.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6032.7s)]
*  There's a story I know. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6033.7s)]
*  I think I told you about it one time before. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6034.7s)]
*  This guy, he's known as, he did exactly what you're talking about. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6036.7s)]
*  He found the gold. He got an investment. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6039.7s)]
*  His name is Tommy Thompson. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6041.7s)]
*  I think there's a documentary about him. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6043.7s)]
*  He lost the gold, in quotes. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6044.7s)]
*  Lost it. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6049.7s)]
*  Didn't know where he put it. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6050.7s)]
*  He's been in jail. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6051.7s)]
*  Pirate, dude. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6052.7s)]
*  Held under contempt because he owes the people who invested in him the money. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6053.7s)]
*  He's just like, I don't know where it is. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6056.7s)]
*  I can't remember where I put it. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6057.7s)]
*  And so the judge is just holding him. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6059.7s)]
*  How long can he hold him? [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6061.7s)]
*  He's been in jail for like 20 years, I think. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6063.7s)]
*  Really? [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6065.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6066.7s)]
*  For four million? [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6067.7s)]
*  It's at least four million, I think is the problem. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6068.7s)]
*  He might have found a lot and he just didn't tell everybody he found. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6069.7s)]
*  And so he's been in jail for how long? [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6072.7s)]
*  Let me see if I can... [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6074.7s)]
*  Yeah, let's find out. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6078.7s)]
*  I believe it's a long... [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6079.7s)]
*  It's more than 10 years. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6080.7s)]
*  I think it's been going on for a while. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6081.7s)]
*  Well, he looks so much older than he did when he got arrested. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6082.7s)]
*  That's pretty neat. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6085.7s)]
*  Yes, it started back in like the 90s. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6086.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6091.7s)]
*  He discovered it in like 89 and then went back. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6093.7s)]
*  People have been talking about it for a while, but I think he's, as far as I know, [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6096.7s)]
*  still being held. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6100.7s)]
*  What a fucking idiot. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6101.7s)]
*  Well, not only that, where's the gold and how does he know it's going to be there when [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6104.7s)]
*  he gets out? [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6108.7s)]
*  You've been in jail for 20 years. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6109.7s)]
*  Could be some other treasure hunters. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6110.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6111.7s)]
*  I think his kids may have known about it, but they're like, we don't know where it is [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6112.7s)]
*  either. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6116.7s)]
*  The story went on forever. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6117.7s)]
*  It's pretty neat. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6118.7s)]
*  I think it's from Columbus, Ohio. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6119.7s)]
*  That's kind of why I know about it. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6120.7s)]
*  And I think someone I know knew him or knows the family or something. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6123.7s)]
*  Columbus, Ohio treasure hunters? [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6126.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6128.7s)]
*  I don't, that's the, I don't, it's just from there. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6129.7s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6132.7s)]
*  Anyway, let's, let's take a look at this shit hoarder. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6133.7s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6136.7s)]
*  You ready? [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6137.7s)]
*  Am I ready? [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6138.7s)]
*  No one's ready. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6139.7s)]
*  Never. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6140.7s)]
*  I'm the only one I think who thinks this is hilarious. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6141.7s)]
*  Okay. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6146.7s)]
*  How will we blur this out? [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6147.7s)]
*  I think I'm just going to not show it because it's known as like the worst story on hoards. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6148.7s)]
*  Don't show it. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6152.7s)]
*  Don't show it. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6153.7s)]
*  Just show Shane's face. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6154.7s)]
*  This lady's shitting in bottles. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6156.7s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6159.7s)]
*  For a decade. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6160.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6161.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6162.7s)]

*  Oh my God. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6164.7s)]
*  That's her? [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6165.7s)]
*  Is that her? [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6166.7s)]
*  That's the lady? [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6167.7s)]
*  Oh my God, there's shit everywhere. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6168.7s)]
*  That's her shit bucket. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6169.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6170.7s)]
*  Yeah, wait, watch, watch, watch, watch, watch. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6171.7s)]
*  Watch. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6172.7s)]
*  That's her shit bucket. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6173.7s)]
*  And then she's like, sometimes it gets too heavy, so I have to transfer buckets. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6174.7s)]
*  Christ, bro. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6177.7s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to have to transfer buckets. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6178.7s)]
*  I can't do this. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6182.7s)]

*  Bro, you have to look. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6195.7s)]
*  Look at her eating soup, dude. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6196.7s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6197.7s)]
*  She's eating the grass out of soup on a pile of shit. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6198.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6199.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6200.7s)]

*  Oh my God. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6207.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6208.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6209.7s)]
*  On a pile of shit. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6210.7s)]
*  What the fuck, man? [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6211.7s)]
*  So this is the interview here. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6212.7s)]
*  She goes, she goes, I can't be the worst hoarder you've ever seen. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6213.7s)]
*  And they're like, shit, you are. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6214.7s)]
*  Look at this sign. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6215.7s)]
*  It says, I am okay. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6216.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6217.7s)]
*  What are you? [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6218.7s)]
*  Does any woman have something to do with smell? [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6219.7s)]
*  Yeah, this is the problem when you let kids think that they're okay. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6224.7s)]
*  I guess so, because I thought it was due to the mold and dust. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6227.7s)]
*  You have to tell me this, because I, I. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6230.7s)]
*  You don't have to. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6232.7s)]
*  I mean, some people would argue, how do you not know that feces in the house is bad? [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6233.7s)]
*  But wait, I don't smell it anymore. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6237.7s)]
*  It's extremely dangerous. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6239.7s)]
*  Okay, okay, stop, stop, stop, stop. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6240.7s)]
*  I will fucking throw up. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6243.7s)]
*  Dude, she's so matter of fact, the entire time, like the entire time people are like, [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6244.7s)]
*  she's like, yeah, there's mold in the walls. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6248.7s)]
*  That's why it smells like that. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6250.7s)]
*  And they're like, are you sure it's not the feces, the bottles of feces and urine everywhere? [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6251.7s)]
*  And she's like, what? [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6255.7s)]
*  No, that can't be it. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6256.7s)]
*  Like, no, that's definitely it. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6258.7s)]
*  She's like, well, that's news to me. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6260.7s)]
*  Imagine if this was fake. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6262.7s)]
*  And then they conned us. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6264.7s)]
*  And that's like chocolate milk and fucking toilet paper. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6265.7s)]
*  They didn't fake this. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6268.7s)]
*  You can tell this lady's gone. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6269.7s)]
*  Maybe she's like a really good actress. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6271.7s)]
*  If I used to put poop in a jug. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6274.7s)]
*  Okay. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6276.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6277.7s)]
*  Okay. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6278.7s)]
*  Dude, so at the very end, this is the best part. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6279.7s)]
*  So at the very end, they're like, we're going to have to, we got to go in there and clear out all the stuff in there. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6284.7s)]
*  So all her food is contaminated. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6291.7s)]
*  She doesn't have a refrigerator. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6293.7s)]
*  She says bread on the ground that's covered in mold. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6295.7s)]
*  At one point, they're like, you can't eat that moldy bread. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6297.7s)]
*  She's like, I'm going to take the fucking mold off. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6299.7s)]
*  Obviously. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6301.7s)]
*  All right. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6303.7s)]
*  At the very end, they're like poop everywhere. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6304.7s)]
*  Shit everywhere. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6306.7s)]
*  What do you think her like digestive tract is like? [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6307.7s)]
*  She's eating progressive soup. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6309.7s)]
*  Shit in it. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6311.7s)]
*  She's eating nothing but soup. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6312.7s)]
*  Because you get a certain amount of shit on your hands anyway. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6313.7s)]
*  Bottles. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6317.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6318.7s)]
*  You know, when they swab things, they find like human fecal matter on things all the time, like doorknobs and stuff. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6319.7s)]
*  So if you eat a chip after you touch a doorknob, there's some fecal matter probably that gets in there. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6324.7s)]
*  This lady's eating. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6331.7s)]
*  All right. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6332.7s)]
*  So at the very end, they're like, we got to go in there. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6333.7s)]
*  And she's like, hold on. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6335.7s)]
*  Let me get one more night. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6337.7s)]
*  I'm going to go ahead back in there and eat some contaminated food. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6338.7s)]
*  And then she goes, and then the party's over. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6341.7s)]
*  They're like, you mean a party? [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6344.7s)]
*  You think it's a party to eat contaminated food? [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6347.7s)]
*  She's like, what do you guys fucking care? [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6350.7s)]
*  I've been in there eating poop for 12 years. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6352.7s)]
*  They're like, what the fuck? [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6355.7s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6357.7s)]
*  When you get to that part at the very end, the dude, the dude, like she says it, she goes, what do you care? [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6358.7s)]
*  I've been eating poop for 12 years. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6363.7s)]
*  As soon as he says it, he goes, oh. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6364.7s)]
*  Like, just watching a dude get defeated by a lady. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6367.7s)]
*  I'm trying to explain this properly. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6370.7s)]
*  The music, they play dramatic music. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6372.7s)]
*  She goes, what do you guys fucking care? [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6375.7s)]
*  And he goes, he looks at her, she goes, I've been in there eating poop for 12 years. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6377.7s)]
*  And he goes, oh. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6380.7s)]
*  She takes the guy's soul, dude. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6383.7s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6385.7s)]
*  I'm trying to find it. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6386.7s)]
*  It's right, it's towards the very end. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6387.7s)]
*  They're giving her basically the intervention. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6388.7s)]
*  It's two people outside. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6390.7s)]
*  It's a lady and a guy. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6391.7s)]
*  Imagine, imagine your brain. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6392.7s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6394.7s)]
*  I'm going to go ahead back in there. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6395.7s)]
*  Watch. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6397.7s)]
*  It's going to be hard, but I'm going to give up some stuff. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6399.7s)]
*  This guy. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6402.7s)]
*  And I'm going to go ahead and eat some of the contaminated food. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6403.7s)]
*  And then the party's over. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6407.7s)]
*  Because I have to get it. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6408.7s)]
*  Because when somebody goes on intervention, they want to get high one last time. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6410.7s)]
*  The party ends for me tomorrow. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6416.7s)]
*  How is eating contaminated food a party? [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6419.7s)]
*  I'm. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6421.7s)]
*  Why the fuck does it matter? [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6422.7s)]
*  I've been eating poop for 12 years. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6424.7s)]
*  See, no one else thinks it's funny. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6432.7s)]
*  Dude, dude. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6434.7s)]
*  No one else thinks it's funny. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6435.7s)]
*  No one else thinks it's funny. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6436.7s)]
*  That's so beyond reality. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6437.7s)]
*  Dude, I don't think it's fake. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6440.7s)]
*  But I've been fooled before. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6443.7s)]
*  True. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6446.7s)]
*  That's how it works. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6447.7s)]
*  It seems like if you're, unless she's wearing prosthetics, it seems like there's, [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6449.7s)]
*  it seems like she's suffering the effects of her poor diet. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6453.7s)]
*  Like the inflammation in her face from poop eating. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6457.7s)]
*  At the end, dude, at the end they bulldoze the house and put her in an assisted living home. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6461.7s)]
*  It sounds like a happy ending of Hoarders. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6465.7s)]
*  They said the house was beyond contaminated. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6467.7s)]
*  The city had to get involved and destroy the land. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6469.7s)]
*  They just salt the earth. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6472.7s)]
*  That's so insane. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6474.7s)]
*  It's pretty fun though. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6475.7s)]
*  Just a lady and her mom shitting in a bucket. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6476.7s)]
*  Before that, what was the worst one? [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6478.7s)]
*  The lady who eats toilet paper. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6480.7s)]
*  Remember that lady? [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6481.7s)]
*  Did you see the lady who eats toilet paper? [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6482.7s)]
*  That was my sick addiction or whatever. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6484.7s)]
*  Was that what it was? [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6487.7s)]
*  It's one of those. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6488.7s)]
*  I didn't even, I never even watched it. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6489.7s)]
*  I watched this Hoarders episode. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6491.7s)]
*  I never watched Hoarders. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6492.7s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6493.7s)]
*  You watched Hoarders? [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6494.7s)]
*  Yeah, she was just chewing up toilet paper and she said it was addictive. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6495.7s)]
*  No, there was a lady, the worst, the second worst Hoarders is a lady who had like 90 dead cats in her house. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6498.7s)]
*  Oh God. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6503.7s)]
*  And she was saving them. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6504.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6505.7s)]
*  She was putting them in the fridge. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6506.7s)]
*  She was like, I don't want to say goodbye to these guys. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6507.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6509.7s)]
*  She takes them out. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6510.7s)]
*  She takes them out for the camera. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6511.7s)]
*  Their eyes are deteriorated. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6513.7s)]
*  She's got a, it's so fucking funny. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6515.7s)]

*  He goes, oh boy. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6526.7s)]
*  He's like, yeah, people try to talk about it, but until you tried it for yourself or something like that. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6528.7s)]
*  What? [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6532.7s)]
*  Don't knock until you try it. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6533.7s)]
*  He has a million rats. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6534.7s)]

*  Wow. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6538.7s)]
*  Well, you know, there's like a temple in India where rats are. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6539.7s)]
*  Have you ever seen that rat temple in India? [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6543.7s)]
*  No. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6545.7s)]
*  Oh dude, this is wild. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6546.7s)]
*  This is a temple in India and these rats all hang out with everyone. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6547.7s)]
*  They eat with you. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6553.7s)]
*  They, they like leave the rats. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6555.7s)]
*  They put milk out for them. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6556.7s)]
*  The rats are all drinking milk. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6557.7s)]
*  They'll, they all like share. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6559.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6561.7s)]
*  It's the weirdest thing. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6562.7s)]
*  It's like a temple filled with rats. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6563.7s)]
*  So as these people are all praying, like dude, rats are everywhere, everywhere, but they're not treated poorly. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6565.7s)]
*  Well, they got this wrong. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6573.7s)]
*  But it's really weird, man, because this is like, look, the rats just like eat their food and it's this beautiful temple. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6575.7s)]
*  Let's see what this guy does. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6582.7s)]
*  He got to have an explanation. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6583.7s)]
*  No, let's see what he says. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6585.7s)]
*  When they die, they're born as rats. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6588.7s)]
*  When a rat dies, it's born as us humans. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6590.7s)]
*  That might seem preposterous to many in the West. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6596.7s)]
*  So they're just chilling. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6599.7s)]
*  People here think that they die and become a rat. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6600.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6602.7s)]
*  But they've managed to create an environment where they live with rats. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6604.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6608.7s)]
*  Well, there's going to be a new fucking plague if these guys keep doing this. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6609.7s)]
*  Or not. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6612.7s)]
*  They better knock it off. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6613.7s)]

*  Crows are better. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6799.7s)]
*  I like crows. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6800.7s)]

*  And they figure out that they drop- [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6808.7s)]
*  They figure it out right away. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6809.7s)]
*  If they can't drink the water, they can drop rocks in there until the water level rises. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6810.7s)]
*  That's very intelligent. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6811.7s)]
*  And that story of those students that captured a bunch of crows. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6812.7s)]
*  You ready for that one? [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6813.7s)]

*  of crows. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6816.7s)]
*  And then any time for the rest of the year, they would, like, they would go to the [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6817.7s)]
*  the crows would bother them. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6829.2s)]
*  Like, other crows knew about it and would bother these people. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6834.2s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6838.8s)]
*  All day. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6839.8s)]

*  Wow. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6843.639999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6848.639999999999s)]
*  And I think, I could be wrong, but I think they went back for a reunion and the crows [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6849.639999999999s)]
*  were still bothering them. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6854.4s)]

*  How is that? [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6858.2s)]
*  I could just be wrong. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6859.2s)]
*  So there's that. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6861.2s)]
*  There's definitely that. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6862.2s)]
*  There's the real possibility. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6863.2s)]
*  But I was thinking about it, like, how could they possibly, because how long do they live? [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6864.2s)]
*  So if they went back for the reunion, how many years are we talking about? [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6872.44s)]
*  I couldn't even guess how old a fucking crow gets. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6874.639999999999s)]

*  I bet crows get to 20. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6880.679999999999s)]
*  You think so? [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6882.679999999999s)]
*  That's strong. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6884.679999999999s)]
*  A wild crow? [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6885.68s)]

*  a caveman face, for example, while the birds were caged nearby crows circled the site and [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6914.44s)]
*  sounded alarm calls. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6920.24s)]
*  The team then tested the crows' reactions to the masks. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6922.16s)]
*  Over the first two weeks, about 26% of the crows that the researchers encountered scolded [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6925.339999999999s)]

*  Groups of crows would sometimes mob the researchers as well, squawking and dive bombing them. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6938.24s)]
*  When the researchers wore different neutral masks, the crows normally did not react, suggesting [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=6942.8s)]

*  I heard that recently. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7660.6s)]
*  I was confused, but our balls are shrinking and our taints are shrinking. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7661.6s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7665.52s)]
*  I can't believe that, but that's like conflicting information whether or not the dick got bigger. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7666.52s)]
*  If the dick's getting bigger, I think men will go, deal. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7670.0s)]
*  Speaking of dick getting bigger, I gotta piss again. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7673.12s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7692.88s)]
*  It's like the universe wanted that club to be made. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7693.88s)]
*  It made itself. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7698.08s)]
*  All the pieces just sort of fell into place in terms of getting the right employees, in [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7699.4800000000005s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7728.88s)]
*  People have a famine mentality. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7729.88s)]
*  It's very, very dangerous. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7730.88s)]
*  It's bad for everybody because that shit comes true too if you have a famine mentality. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7731.88s)]
*  You can just decide there's a limited amount of spots. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7735.96s)]

*  It happens a lot with like narcissists and, you know, every comedian is a narcissist in [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7742.4800000000005s)]
*  some way. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7748.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7749.68s)]
*  But it happens a lot with people. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7750.68s)]
*  There's people amongst us that like really don't care about anyone but themselves. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7752.28s)]
*  You know who's an insane narcissist that's actually very helpful is fucking Burt. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7756.44s)]
*  Burt was hitting us. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7762.6s)]
*  I was talking to him. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7763.68s)]
*  He was like, when I, I don't, he's like, when I die, I want the world to end. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7764.68s)]
*  I was like, dude, that's crazy. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7767.280000000001s)]
*  He was like, I don't think I'm ever going to die. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7770.280000000001s)]
*  He says he doesn't think he's going to die. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7772.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, but you got to understand that Burt is also kind of doing a Theo Vaughn. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7774.0s)]
*  Yeah, I do understand that. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7777.96s)]
*  He does a Burt, Kreischer, Theo Vaughn type thing. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7779.76s)]
*  But Burt's also one of the most helpful people in comedy. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7783.360000000001s)]
*  I should explain to people what I mean by that. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7786.84s)]
*  A Burt Kreischer, like Theo Vaughn, when he says ridiculous shit, you don't know if it's [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7788.64s)]
*  because he believes it or whether or not he's just joking. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7795.52s)]
*  That's why it's so funny. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7801.56s)]
*  It's like uniquely funny because of that, because you're not really sure. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7802.56s)]
*  He was on our podcast this week and he said that. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7807.400000000001s)]
*  He was like, he kept saying dumb shit like that. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7809.320000000001s)]
*  And I was like, wait, for real. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7812.4400000000005s)]
*  Like the Anne Frank Helen Keller story. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7815.52s)]
*  I believe it, dude. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7819.0s)]
*  I've seen him. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7820.08s)]
*  You know him more than me, but on the road, I've seen that guy operate. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7821.08s)]
*  He does some dumb shit. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7825.24s)]
*  Where you're like, no. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7827.4s)]
*  Oh, he does. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7829.08s)]
*  But I think he's leaning into it. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7830.08s)]
*  He does a lot more of that now than when I first met him. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7832.16s)]
*  I think he's like when Dice Clay started putting on the leather gloves. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7834.88s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7838.4s)]
*  He's feeling his power. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7839.4s)]
*  He's coming into his own. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7842.04s)]
*  But man, what a fucking guy. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7845.28s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7848.76s)]
*  You guys all, that LA scene. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7849.76s)]

*  Now I'm with you. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7858.68s)]
*  Why, these guys aren't that bad? [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7859.68s)]
*  Why did you think fuck these guys? [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7861.24s)]
*  Because I was fucking a flashlight on a mattress. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7862.64s)]
*  So yeah, fuck everybody. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7867.88s)]

*  That sucked. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7875.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7877.84s)]
*  It's normal. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7878.84s)]
*  It's normal. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7879.84s)]
*  And I get it. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7880.84s)]

*  I would do it. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7883.84s)]
*  If I was back on that mattress, I would say, fuck this. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7884.84s)]
*  100%. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7886.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7887.400000000001s)]
*  Especially when you're young. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7888.400000000001s)]
*  When you're young, you're not exactly sure how to think about things. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7889.400000000001s)]
*  How do I feel about someone else's success? [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7893.12s)]
*  But the thing about what the store had was a really good community. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7896.76s)]
*  A lot of really funny people supporting each other and hanging out with each other and [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7902.92s)]
*  making each other laugh and having a good time together. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7908.0s)]
*  And so you'd look forward to going on the road. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7911.04s)]
*  You do your gigs on the road on the weekend. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7913.32s)]
*  Then you come in on Tuesday night. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7915.6s)]
*  It was one of the best nights at the store. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7917.0s)]
*  You'd go in there on Tuesday night and it would just be wall to wall killers. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7918.84s)]
*  It was like a gangster's convention of comedians. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7922.32s)]
*  Just getting together. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7927.76s)]

*  Which club? [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7931.76s)]
*  Talking shit, having fun. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7933.64s)]
*  Let's go out back and have a drink. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7935.24s)]
*  It's funny when you describe it as killers. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7937.2s)]
*  Normal people are like, shut up. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7940.52s)]
*  But you don't understand the feeling of being backstage and the guy going before you is [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7942.16s)]
*  literally killing you. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7946.280000000001s)]

*  I told you that's why I started taking Joey Diaz on the road with me. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7951.76s)]
*  Because I couldn't follow him. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7956.280000000001s)]
*  And so I said, okay, I got to figure out how to follow this guy. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7958.04s)]
*  That's crazy, dude. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7961.360000000001s)]
*  He was killing so hard. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7962.96s)]
*  No, that's crazy mentality. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7963.96s)]
*  No, no, that's the only way you'd learn how to do it. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7964.96s)]
*  But that's what I learned from Mitzi. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7970.2s)]
*  I learned that from Mitzi Shore. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7971.92s)]
*  Mitzi Shore, when I was coming up at the Comedy Store, always put me on after the best comedians. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7973.719999999999s)]
*  Always. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7979.679999999999s)]
*  She's just like, if you think you can do this, you think you're good? [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7980.679999999999s)]
*  Okay, well you're going to go after Martin Lawrence in 1995. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7984.4s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7987.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7988.839999999999s)]
*  That's tough. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7990.32s)]
*  I hate dick. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7991.32s)]
*  I hate dick. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7992.32s)]
*  But it teaches you how to tighten your act up. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7995.4s)]
*  It teaches you what parts of your act seem clunky. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=7998.12s)]
*  Because sometimes you're just saying things, you're not totally attached to them anymore. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8002.24s)]
*  It seems clunky in front of these people who just saw Martin Lawrence. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8007.719999999999s)]
*  It's like all that, that's what she wanted to do. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8013.16s)]
*  Mitzi always did that with people. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8015.36s)]
*  She would just throw you on after some fucking assassin. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8017.0s)]
*  Sink or swim, bitch. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8020.8s)]
*  That's funny. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8021.8s)]
*  Yeah, she was crazy. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8022.8s)]
*  In the best way possible. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8023.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8024.8s)]
*  Like the fact that she even wanted to run a comedy club, but she wasn't even a comedian. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8025.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8029.400000000001s)]
*  She's the most important figure in the history of comedy that is in a comedian, for sure. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8030.400000000001s)]
*  It's Mitzi Shore. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8036.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was never, you guys were all gone from this before I even was able to perform [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8037.0s)]
*  in LA. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8045.68s)]
*  So I'd never, by the time I saw the story it was a shadow of what that was. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8046.68s)]
*  And then it's the same thing, yeah. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8053.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8056.68s)]
*  Well, we got this. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8057.68s)]
*  We got this. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8063.360000000001s)]
*  This is pretty fucking cool. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8064.360000000001s)]
*  And we got this and it's all ours. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8066.08s)]
*  It's all just the comedians and the audience and Adam. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8068.84s)]
*  People having fun. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8076.2s)]
*  And that's the intent behind it. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8077.2s)]
*  And so far that's all it's been. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8079.679999999999s)]
*  And this fucking one week anniversary just passed. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8081.879999999999s)]
*  Like it's been open a week. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8087.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8089.04s)]
*  I wanted to be down there the first week. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8090.04s)]
*  I was jealous. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8091.5199999999995s)]
*  It's going to be seven nights a week now. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8092.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8095.04s)]
*  So you're going to be doing shows both rooms, seven nights a week? [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8096.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8101.44s)]
*  It's going to be wild, dude. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8102.44s)]
*  Wild. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8103.44s)]
*  It's going to be a lot of people. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8104.44s)]
*  It's a lot of people. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8105.44s)]
*  They're going to be there. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8106.44s)]
*  A lot of people there. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8107.44s)]
*  Every show sells out in fucking 10 seconds. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8108.44s)]
*  But it's a fun fucking show, dude. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8110.2s)]
*  It's like we're giving them something really good. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8112.639999999999s)]
*  These fucking shows have been amazing. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8115.24s)]
*  Last night was insane. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8118.12s)]
*  Last night was insane. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8119.12s)]
*  Last night. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8120.12s)]
*  So put the tickets up for Dave Chappelle. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8121.12s)]
*  I put them up. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8123.12s)]
*  I don't even say it's Dave. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8124.12s)]
*  You didn't even say it was Dave. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8125.12s)]
*  You were like, secret show. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8126.12s)]
*  Yeah, I said intimate show in the small room. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8127.12s)]
*  They get to see you and then Chappelle. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8129.24s)]
*  Yeah, it was a lot of pressure. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8131.5599999999995s)]
*  And no one knew who was going to be. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8133.92s)]
*  That was a lot of pressure. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8134.92s)]
*  So when you said Dave Chappelle, they went nuts. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8135.92s)]
*  They went nuts. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8138.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8139.24s)]
*  That was fun, dude. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8140.24s)]
*  But you were the first guy to ever be on stage in that small room. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8141.24s)]
*  And that small room was a different animal. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8144.72s)]
*  Yeah, it certainly was. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8146.32s)]
*  Different animal. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8147.32s)]
*  Yeah, I felt it pretty quick. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8148.32s)]
*  The numbers, man. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8149.32s)]
*  It's like that's a thing about like 100 people. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8150.32s)]
*  It's like fucking odd. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8153.32s)]
*  There's maybe a buck 20 in that room. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8155.12s)]
*  A lot of people were standing in the back, but that's not a lot of people. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8158.04s)]
*  No. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8161.72s)]
*  The guys that are in the front, they're so close to you that it's like you're doing a [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8162.72s)]
*  joke to their face, which is real weird. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8166.280000000001s)]
*  You're making eye contact with a weird dude. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8169.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8171.76s)]
*  There was just a guy with long hair and a goatee staring at me. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8172.76s)]
*  I was like, oh fuck. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8176.08s)]
*  But comedy like that is real weird anyway. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8177.08s)]
*  Like it's almost too intimate. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8179.6s)]
*  Like say if someone was going to, like if you wanted to watch Joey Diaz do stand up [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8180.96s)]
*  in front of you, you wouldn't just like sit right in front of them and say do stand up. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8185.4400000000005s)]
*  I'd want to be like in the third row. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8190.0s)]
*  Those people are uncomfortable. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8192.68s)]
*  Those people are uncomfortable. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8194.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8195.32s)]
*  And then when you make eye contact with them, they go. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8196.32s)]
*  They're weirded out. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8198.32s)]
*  You're right there. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8199.32s)]
*  I can just grab you. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8200.32s)]
*  I'll just grab you. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8201.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8202.32s)]
*  It's weird. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8203.32s)]
*  Especially like I saw where like Chappelle was like sitting on the stool. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8204.32s)]
*  His feet were basically on the front row's table. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8206.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8209.12s)]
*  And there's just a dude sitting there like staring directly up at Dave Chappelle. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8210.12s)]
*  And if you just touch Dave's feet. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8214.0s)]
*  Yeah, you could grab him. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8215.0s)]
*  You could rush to the stage and tackle him. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8216.0s)]
*  And then get stomped by Buster Rhymes. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8219.080000000002s)]
*  Chappelle, the way he does like the fucking. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8222.12s)]
*  I'm gay motherfucker. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8225.800000000001s)]
*  Like his voice. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8226.800000000001s)]
*  He was talking about it last night about a dude being able to tackle him. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8227.800000000001s)]
*  He's like I'm trans, I'm gay. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8231.800000000001s)]
*  Everything he does, man. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8234.800000000001s)]
*  It's the way he talks. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8238.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8240.240000000002s)]
*  He's up there. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8241.240000000002s)]
*  You think he's just fucking. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8242.240000000002s)]
*  You're like oh man, he's rambling. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8243.240000000002s)]
*  He's telling a story. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8244.240000000002s)]
*  And then right the fucking last second. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8245.240000000002s)]
*  He finds it. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8246.640000000001s)]
*  It's a callback. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8247.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8249.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8250.24s)]
*  I try not to get. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8251.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8252.24s)]
*  I try not to talk too philosophically about stand up. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8253.24s)]

*  Dude, I almost threw up. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8297.32s)]
*  That was the only thing I had to promote. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8298.92s)]
*  I hosted Fear Factor for six years and I almost threw up. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8300.44s)]
*  I mean yeah, there's a fucking freak living in a hovel shitting in a bucket. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8303.28s)]

*  Severe mental disability and then you end up, you watch your mom shit in a bucket. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8326.84s)]
*  I guess we shit in buckets. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8331.359999999999s)]

*  You're talking about it as funny. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8364.36s)]
*  It itself wouldn't make me laugh as much as make me vomit. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8366.0s)]

*  It's probably his sister's. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8508.439999999999s)]
*  I shouldn't have done that. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8509.439999999999s)]
*  That's okay. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8510.439999999999s)]

*  I've been proven right. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8512.439999999999s)]
*  Nobody thinks it's funny. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8513.8s)]
*  That? [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8514.8s)]
*  You think that's funny. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8515.96s)]
*  Dude CCR playing? [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8516.96s)]
*  Why? [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8517.96s)]
*  Why? [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8518.96s)]
*  Is that guy shitting? [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8519.96s)]
*  And the dude executes a guinea pig while he's shitting? [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8520.96s)]
*  I don't think that guy's shitting because it seems like he has his pants on. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8526.679999999998s)]
*  It seems like he's just filming the kid with the gun. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8529.28s)]
*  Yeah but he seems genuinely shamed. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8531.720000000001s)]
*  He goes oh my god. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8533.880000000001s)]
*  Riley! [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8534.880000000001s)]
*  I think he just fell back because this fucking idiot shot a rifle into a stone floor. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8535.880000000001s)]
*  Here's a better question. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8541.92s)]
*  It's ricocheted. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8542.92s)]
*  Why is he filming before the kid opens the door? [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8543.92s)]
*  Because they've worked it out to do it. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8545.92s)]
*  Well then is it even real? [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8548.480000000001s)]
*  Obviously yes. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8550.76s)]
*  Is it even real? [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8551.76s)]
*  It seems pretty fucking real. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8553.560000000001s)]
*  It seems legit. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8554.560000000001s)]
*  Because that thing does fly. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8555.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah dude that is legit. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8557.44s)]
*  And it looks like his dad fell over or whoever is filming it fell over and that's why his [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8559.76s)]
*  legs are like that. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8564.84s)]
*  It's a brutal film. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=8565.84s)]

*  I was trying to see how much heroin has been used over time. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=9416.92s)]
*  And this government website says it hasn't changed much since like 2000. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=9419.92s)]
*  Well it's between 2002 and 2013 but the numbers didn't change a ton. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=9423.92s)]
*  Kind of stayed the same. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=9427.92s)]
*  So like hmm are poppy seeds used in other opiates. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=9428.92s)]
*  Which of course it is. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=9432.92s)]
*  Hydrocodone for instance. [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=9434.92s)]
*  Yeah that's true right. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=9436.92s)]
*  They probably use it in pharmaceuticals. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=9438.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah I bet that's a big part of the market as well. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=9440.960000000001s)]
*  But also if they're using it for pharmaceuticals are they taking like poppy seeds and converting directly to like opiate pills? [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=9442.960000000001s)]
*  I just was thinking of the last season of Ozark and how they had to get involved with the cartels to keep the fucking business going. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=9448.960000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=9457.960000000001s)]
*  Unrealistic. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=9458.960000000001s)]
*  Probably not unrealistic. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=9459.960000000001s)]
*  If we had a big corporation that had like a nice shell company that they can negotiate with and not have to talk directly to the cartel. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=9460.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah you just got to talk to the fucking Taliban. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=9467.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=9469.0s)]

*  So much fucking money in heroin. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=9473.0s)]
*  Heroin and heroin pills. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=9475.0s)]
*  But the United States definitely had no involvement whatsoever in the heroin trade. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=9477.0s)]
*  It's only two countries coincidentally that had a large heroin market that we also had wars there. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=9481.0s)]
*  But whatever. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=9489.0s)]

*  I don't know. [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10019.76s)]
*  It's tough because there's a party, like you want to, like I recognize, I have no idea [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10020.76s)]
*  what's going on. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10024.76s)]
*  So there's a party that wants to just be like, fuck it, I'll just live my life. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10025.76s)]
*  There's nothing I can do about it. [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10028.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10029.76s)]
*  And then there's a party where you're like, well, if you can help, I'll do it. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10030.76s)]
*  I'll do it. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10033.76s)]
*  I'll do it. [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10034.76s)]

*  I'll do it. [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10036.76s)]
*  If you can help, try it. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10037.800000000001s)]
*  But I guess I'd have to do the research to get involved. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10039.800000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10043.800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10045.800000000001s)]
*  If the prospect of nuclear war is out there. [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10046.800000000001s)]
*  I just, I don't think we're really going to be able to help that. [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10048.800000000001s)]
*  You're right. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10051.800000000001s)]
*  But I think that's also the attitude that people have that allows them to get away with [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10052.800000000001s)]
*  things for as long as they have. [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10057.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10058.800000000001s)]
*  Everyone just goes, fuck it, I can't do it. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10059.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10060.800000000001s)]
*  Everyone goes, fuck it, I can't do anything about that. [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10061.800000000001s)]
*  It's very sketchy. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10063.800000000001s)]
*  I mean, if it wasn't for world leaders, no one would have any conflict with large groups. [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10064.84s)]
*  Like these large groups of people, they're led by people and they have conflicts with [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10069.84s)]
*  other people and they try to steal resources and money and fucking. [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10072.92s)]
*  Yeah, we definitely wouldn't be trying to fight Vietnam. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10075.92s)]
*  No, no. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10078.92s)]
*  We wouldn't go. [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10079.92s)]
*  Well, we're not. [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10080.92s)]
*  The proof is in the fact that we don't fight with each other state to state. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10081.92s)]
*  There's no difference between state to state and there is country to country except for [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10085.039999999999s)]
*  constitutions and laws and this and that. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10088.64s)]
*  But as long as the people can communicate, like if you're going to a place that also [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10090.84s)]
*  speaks the language that you speak, who gives a shit? [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10094.46s)]
*  In America, you can go anywhere, right? [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10097.94s)]
*  You can go to New Mexico, you can go to Florida. [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10099.46s)]
*  Nobody treats you like you're an invader, right? [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10102.5s)]
*  And everybody kind of gets along. [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10105.36s)]
*  But it's country to country that shit gets weird. [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10107.38s)]
*  Now why? [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10110.9s)]
*  Doesn't make any sense. [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10111.9s)]
*  Why would it? [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10112.9s)]
*  If everything was like the states. [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10114.06s)]
*  Yeah, it's just a little shit talking. [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10115.38s)]
*  But imagine, because in continents, right, inside the United States, it doesn't happen [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10117.26s)]
*  what happened during the Civil War, right? [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10121.78s)]
*  Sure. [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10123.58s)]
*  But it's rare. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10124.58s)]
*  For the most part, it works out. [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10125.58s)]
*  Happen once. [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10126.58s)]
*  And you can go around and do whatever the fuck you want. [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10127.58s)]
*  Why can't that be the case for the whole goddamn world? [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10128.86s)]
*  Well, of course it can. [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10131.5s)]
*  If you don't have like leaders that want to steal resources and leaders that want to push [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10133.300000000001s)]
*  arms closer to borders and leaders that want to violate treaties and leaders that want [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10141.5s)]
*  to push things and come up with better weapons and have them pointed towards your city and [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10146.66s)]
*  yeah. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10151.78s)]
*  It's so exhausting. [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10152.78s)]
*  Yeah, but I get it though. [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10155.78s)]
*  As soon as I leave this country, like I was in Canada last week, I was like, fuck, America [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10159.78s)]
*  is number one, dude. [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10164.460000000001s)]
*  Fuck your country. [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10165.9s)]
*  The country is ridiculous. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10166.9s)]
*  Especially during COVID. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10167.9s)]
*  You got to see how ridiculous it is. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10168.9s)]
*  Anytime I go to another country, I'm like, dude, America is fucking number one. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10171.18s)]
*  Do you think Trump's going to win? [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10174.06s)]
*  If they run Biden, either DeSantis or Trump will win. [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10177.06s)]
*  They can't run Biden. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10181.06s)]
*  Even though he was the most popular president of all time. [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10183.06s)]
*  How about that? [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10185.06s)]
*  Most votes ever? [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10186.06s)]
*  Well, he is the best. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10187.06s)]
*  What? [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10188.06s)]
*  He's the best. [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10189.06s)]
*  So if you... [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10190.06s)]
*  There's nothing there. [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10191.06s)]
*  What would you do? [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10192.06s)]
*  Is it Gavin Newsom? [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10195.619999999999s)]
*  What would you do? [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10196.619999999999s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren? [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10197.619999999999s)]
*  Like who? [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10198.619999999999s)]
*  Michelle. [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10199.619999999999s)]
*  Michelle Obama. [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10200.619999999999s)]
*  If she wants to do it. [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10201.619999999999s)]
*  Obama. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10203.619999999999s)]
*  She would win. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10204.619999999999s)]
*  She would win off just... [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10206.18s)]
*  She would fuck those dudes up. [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10207.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10209.18s)]
*  Unless so many people have been red-pilled because of this administration and all the [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10210.18s)]
*  wackiness. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10217.18s)]
*  That, like, the bubble people... [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10218.18s)]
*  Because it was always kind of 50-50 anyway. [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10220.18s)]
*  The bubble people might go towards that because there's so much insanity on the left. [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10223.18s)]
*  Here's the bummer. [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10228.18s)]
*  I was talking with... [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10229.18s)]
*  I was with Norman and Liss and Ari and we were doing a show and we were talking afterwards [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10230.18s)]
*  about the classic fucking... [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10235.74s)]
*  Things seemed to be relaxing a little as far as the woke... [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10237.74s)]
*  Like all that shit. [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10242.74s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10243.74s)]
*  But I was like, it's going to get worse. [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10244.74s)]
*  The second this election starts ramping up, we're going to go right back into it. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10246.74s)]
*  Especially if it's Trump. [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10250.86s)]
*  It's going to go right back to where we just were. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10252.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10254.66s)]
*  Especially when people think there's a real threat of him winning. [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10255.66s)]
*  They'll get very hysterical. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10257.74s)]
*  If you don't think that's the case... [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10259.74s)]
*  We're going to go right back. [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10260.74s)]
*  My favorite GIF in all of the internet is that lady with the sock hat and the glasses [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10262.3s)]

*  I didn't vote for Trump, but man, when that guy won, I was like... [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10274.14s)]
*  Dude, immediately I was like, yo. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10277.3s)]
*  Dude, if he wins again, do you know... [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10280.3s)]
*  First of all, he's all fat and everything and he's 78, right? [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10282.9s)]
*  But he's so alert. [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10287.34s)]
*  I know, he's giving speeches and I'm like, damn, that guy's got the juice again. [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10289.980000000001s)]

*  He sounds great. [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10294.74s)]
*  I want to see if DeSantis swings at him. [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10295.74s)]
*  That'll be interesting. [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10298.380000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10303.380000000001s)]
*  Ron. [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10304.380000000001s)]

*  and picking Biden, because he was the most likely to win, they put themselves in a terrible [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10393.46s)]

*  But doing Obama the difference is people don't like Gavin Newsom in his own state [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10449.14s)]
*  They just take him over a Republican. Yeah, and people love DeSantis people love DeSantis in Florida [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10454.779999999999s)]

*  I mean got busted wearing a mask no mask in a restaurant when everyone's supposed to be masked and I think [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10470.92s)]
*  With DeSantis, I don't know enough about him [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10476.76s)]
*  I think people love the idea of DeSantis where they're like Florida fucking said fuck kovat [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10478.800000000001s)]

*  And when you do you go off fuck this guy's a dork [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10490.480000000001s)]

*  I'm sure he's doing fine and approval but nobody's seen him [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10501.04s)]
*  And when he talks, especially if he starts trying to talk shit back and forth with Trump. Yeah, that's gonna get ugly [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10504.04s)]

*  I wonder if that's gonna ramp up again or if that's run its cycle. I did that that shit worked tremendously [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyEcoElh244&t=10566.560000000001s)]
