*  Like, we just looked at each other. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=52.0s)]
*  He's like, what are you doing here? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=53.0s)]
*  And we sat down. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=54.0s)]
*  Me and Duncan are gonna corner you [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=55.0s)]
*  and try to get you to move here. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=57.0s)]
*  Nah, we're gonna figure that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=58.0s)]
*  Yeah, you belong here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=60.0s)]
*  Every time I come down here, I see something else. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=62.0s)]
*  Like, I had a great time last night. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=64.0s)]
*  Joe DeRosa's here now, too. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=66.0s)]
*  That's what I heard. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=67.0s)]
*  Yeah, he just moved here. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=68.0s)]
*  Is he gonna bring the sandwich shop down here? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=69.0s)]
*  Yes, he is. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=70.0s)]
*  We're gonna open up a sandwich shop out here. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=71.0s)]
*  He is, rather. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=72.0s)]
*  That's a good fucking idea. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=73.0s)]
*  I say we because I'm gonna be eating here. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=74.0s)]
*  Yeah, he makes good sandwiches out here. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=76.0s)]
*  He makes a very good sandwich. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=78.0s)]
*  Very good sandwich, yeah. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=79.0s)]
*  He brought a bunch of... [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=80.0s)]
*  What did he do? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=81.0s)]
*  Was it Moon Tower last year that he brought him? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=82.0s)]
*  It might have been. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=83.0s)]
*  It was Moon Tower or South by Southwest. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=84.0s)]
*  One of the two last year, he brought like a ton of sandwiches. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=86.0s)]
*  He had a pop-up. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=89.0s)]
*  So his restaurant did a pop-up somewhere in Austin. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=90.0s)]
*  I was like, bro, you gotta open this up here. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=94.0s)]
*  You'd be killing it, especially if it's you. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=96.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=98.0s)]
*  And people know it's your business. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=99.0s)]
*  Because I've heard somebody else was telling me about the sandwiches. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=100.0s)]
*  Very legit. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=103.0s)]
*  I gotta go up there. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=104.0s)]
*  Very legit. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=105.0s)]
*  I just don't even know where it is. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=106.0s)]
*  I don't know if it's in Brooklyn. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=107.0s)]
*  Bro, I wanna kidnap my man Giovanni in White Plains. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=108.0s)]
*  Bring him out here. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=110.0s)]
*  Bring him out here, yeah. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=111.0s)]
*  He can't survive outside of Italian neighborhoods, though. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=112.0s)]
*  That guy's the most Italian guy that's ever lived. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=115.0s)]
*  And you know, they get their stuff up there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=117.0s)]
*  Yeah, they get everything. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=119.0s)]
*  And it's all coming in right from Italy. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=120.0s)]
*  You know, because a lot of it's imported. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=122.0s)]
*  They use a lot of imported stuff. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=124.0s)]
*  Imported mortadella, imported peppers, all that stuff that they have. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=126.0s)]
*  You know, sun-dried peppers, sun-dried tomatoes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=131.0s)]
*  They import all that shit. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=133.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=134.0s)]
*  They gotta get that shit. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=135.0s)]
*  You know, because if it goes there, then it's got a ship from the boat all the way to Texas. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=136.0s)]
*  It's a little bit of a pain in the ass. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=141.0s)]
*  But remember fucking Greasy Tony? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=143.0s)]
*  He used to drive once a month to New Jersey. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=145.0s)]
*  Oh, Greasy Tony. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=147.0s)]
*  And get coke cuts and fucking chicken cutlets. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=148.0s)]
*  Poor Greasy Tony. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=150.0s)]
*  I miss him. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=151.0s)]
*  We used to visit him every time we went to Tempe. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=152.0s)]
*  He was our guy. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=155.0s)]
*  Remember you said not to drink his Mountain Dew because he made it himself. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=156.0s)]
*  He was up for two days. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=159.0s)]
*  He used to make it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=160.0s)]
*  That was the strongest Mountain Fucking Dew you could ever taste in your life. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=161.0s)]
*  You were up for a darker day. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=165.0s)]
*  Greasy Tony was such a character. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=167.0s)]
*  He was such a character. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=170.0s)]
*  And he became our friend. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=171.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was a good dude. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=172.0s)]
*  When we first started going there, we were visiting for like 10 fucking years. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=173.0s)]
*  Every time we would do shows in town, we'd go visit Greasy Tony. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=177.0s)]
*  He had a $20 chicken cutlet sandwich. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=181.0s)]
*  Phenomenal. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=184.0s)]
*  15 years ago. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=185.0s)]
*  Which weighed, like I was 400 pounds and I would bring it home and try to finish it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=186.0s)]
*  Do you remember that steak sub that he would make? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=192.0s)]
*  What did you call it? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=195.0s)]
*  Trash can? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=196.0s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=197.0s)]
*  The trash can. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=198.0s)]
*  The trash can. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=199.0s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=200.0s)]
*  Peppers and onions and cheese and fucking everything was in that thing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=201.0s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=206.0s)]
*  It was that thick. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=207.0s)]
*  You know what's real? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=208.0s)]
*  When I drove in yesterday, I'm like, this is how things change. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=209.0s)]
*  We've been coming here since 95. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=213.0s)]
*  I know I have. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=214.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think 99 was the first time. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=215.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would do Houston and drive down here and do the lobby in the fucking Cap City when [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=217.0s)]
*  they had to stand up in the lobby. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=223.0s)]
*  I still remember that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=225.0s)]
*  Driving fucking Houston down here, not having any money, having to drive back because we [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=226.0s)]
*  couldn't get a hotel room, drive back to Houston at the end of the night. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=230.0s)]
*  And I was looking at this yesterday. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=235.0s)]
*  When I landed, it was four o'clock traffic. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=237.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh my God, this is how, we're watching how past civilizations just changed. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=239.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=247.0s)]
*  Something happened here and everybody moved here. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=248.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=250.0s)]
*  And I'm not talking about four or five people, everybody. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=251.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=254.0s)]
*  And that's how civilizations changed. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=255.0s)]
*  We just witnessed it after the pandemic. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=256.0s)]
*  It's been fucking surreal. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=259.0s)]
*  Yeah, it has been surreal. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=260.0s)]
*  Surreal. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=261.0s)]
*  Surreal. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=262.0s)]
*  Surreal. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=263.0s)]
*  To see things change. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=264.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=265.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=266.0s)]
*  It's also, there's places that sort of rest on their laurels too much. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=267.0s)]
*  And whenever that happens, it's easy for another place to rise up that offers something more [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=272.0s)]
*  interesting. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=278.0s)]
*  So like Los Angeles was always Los Angeles. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=279.0s)]
*  And like when Gavin Newsom talks about California, he's like, you know, I'm very big on California, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=282.0s)]
*  very bullish on California. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=287.0s)]
*  California has all this industry. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=288.0s)]
*  Hey, fucko. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=290.0s)]
*  They're all thinking about moving. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=291.0s)]
*  The only reason why they don't move is because it's too difficult to move. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=294.0s)]
*  If it was like every business could instantly pull up roots and replace everything and have [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=299.0s)]
*  everything running in a week at the other place, they'd all be gone. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=305.0s)]
*  They'd all be gone. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=309.0s)]
*  They just, it's too expensive. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=310.0s)]
*  It's too expensive to leave versus what you would save and the regulations that you wouldn't [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=311.0s)]
*  have to go through and all the bullshit with all the permits and all that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=316.0s)]
*  What California does is over-regulate everything. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=320.0s)]
*  They get as much government involved as possible. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=324.0s)]
*  They suck as much tax money out of you as possible. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=327.0s)]
*  And then they still leave the place a mess. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=331.0s)]
*  They still have homeless people everywhere. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=333.0s)]
*  It's still a fucking disaster. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=335.0s)]
*  It's still a woke shit show of virtue signaling at every level of the government. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=337.0s)]
*  Still, like no course correction at all. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=343.0s)]
*  They're going further and further into la la land. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=346.0s)]
*  And you're like, Jesus Christ, you guys. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=349.0s)]
*  And so then a place like Austin becomes attractive, you know, because like it's not like that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=352.0s)]
*  here. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=356.0s)]
*  And people are very reasonable. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=357.0s)]
*  And Austin, the best thing about Austin is it's a blue city in a red state. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=358.0s)]
*  So it's like balanced. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=364.0s)]
*  Like this is a saying they have out here. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=366.0s)]
*  Keep Austin weird and surrounded. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=368.0s)]
*  So Austin is surrounded by rednecks with guns. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=371.0s)]
*  And like it keeps the tone more medium. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=376.0s)]
*  Like the Austin liberals, they're much more just left of center people like we are. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=380.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=386.0s)]
*  Like in some parts of the country, we're considered like far right. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=388.0s)]
*  You and I, far right. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=391.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=393.0s)]
*  It's fucking ridiculous. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=395.0s)]
*  But it's because everybody went nuts and everyone demanded a whole series of things [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=397.0s)]
*  that you have to agree to in order to be a good person. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=402.0s)]
*  Fuck off. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=405.0s)]
*  You know what the real problem is out there? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=407.0s)]
*  Let me tell you what the real problem is. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=409.0s)]
*  I didn't realize it until I fucking left that everybody's too busy tapping themselves on the back. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=411.0s)]
*  There's a lot of that. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=416.0s)]
*  When the fires happened, those three women or whatever the fuck, the chief and whatever, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=417.0s)]
*  I'm looking at them and I'm like, look at them. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=422.0s)]
*  You all got gel in their hair. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=424.0s)]
*  You all got a tattoo on their neck. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=426.0s)]
*  God forbid. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=428.0s)]
*  God forbid they can't be cool for just one fucking minute. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=429.0s)]
*  God forbid. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=432.0s)]
*  And that's the problem you have out there. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=434.0s)]
*  It's too many people. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=436.0s)]
*  I'm so great. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=437.0s)]
*  This is my idea and it's great. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=438.0s)]
*  And it's going to work. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=440.0s)]
*  It's not working. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=441.0s)]
*  You're right. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=442.0s)]
*  But I too stupid to say, you know what? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=443.0s)]
*  This ain't working. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=445.0s)]
*  Their egos are so big. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=446.0s)]
*  They don't have the heart to go, this ain't working. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=448.0s)]
*  You're right. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=450.0s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=451.0s)]
*  But I don't think it's entirely their fault. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=453.0s)]
*  It is their fault, but the culture rewards that kind of behavior. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=455.0s)]
*  This is the problem with having protected classes of people, whether it's gay, lesbian, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=458.0s)]
*  whatever it is, whether it's your nationality. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=465.0s)]
*  If you have a protected class of people where you're not allowed to criticize the protected [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=468.0s)]
*  class of people, then they become, you know, Vivek Ramaswamy talked about this in a very [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=473.0s)]
*  interesting way. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=479.0s)]
*  He was like, it's the tyranny of the underprivileged. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=480.0s)]
*  Did you know what he called it? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=485.0s)]
*  The tyranny of the marginalized or something along those lines. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=487.0s)]
*  But the idea is that this group of people, whether they're trans people or gay people, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=491.0s)]
*  they get, oh, above everything. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=495.0s)]
*  Everything you do is amazing. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=498.0s)]
*  Oh my God, you're so fabulous. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=499.0s)]
*  Because no one wants to be thought of as homophobic or transphobic. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=501.0s)]
*  So you pretend that everything they do is incredible. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=506.0s)]
*  And so you're going to be the best firefighter ever. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=508.0s)]
*  Like, can you carry a burning man out of a building? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=510.0s)]
*  Girl, you don't have to. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=512.0s)]
*  If he was in that building, he shouldn't have been in that building in the first place. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=513.0s)]
*  If I have to carry him out, we got other problems. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=516.0s)]
*  A literal firefighter said that in response to could she carry her husband out of the building? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=518.0s)]
*  Like, no, you can't. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=525.0s)]
*  And so you shouldn't be a firefighter. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=526.0s)]
*  Just like you shouldn't be a bouncer if you can't fight. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=528.0s)]
*  You shouldn't be a firefighter. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=531.0s)]
*  You shouldn't be a firefighter if you can't carry someone out of a building. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=533.0s)]
*  If you can't run up a flight of stairs because you're 260 pounds and five foot seven and a woman, no. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=536.0s)]
*  No, you shouldn't be a firefighter. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=542.0s)]
*  You shouldn't be in like really good shape. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=544.0s)]
*  Now, if you're some fucking CrossFit game lady who's some beast, I'm like, yeah, that lady could be a firefighter. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=546.0s)]
*  Yeah. But it's like even guys. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=552.0s)]
*  Like if you're a guy and you're fucking scrawny and you never work out and all you do is smoke cigarettes, maybe you shouldn't be a firefighter. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=554.0s)]
*  You know, maybe you can't get up that fucking flight of stairs either. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=562.0s)]
*  It should be like it's a physical job where you're rescuing people. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=566.0s)]
*  You have to be able to physically carry people. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=570.0s)]
*  You have to rescue them. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=572.0s)]
*  Firefighters when I was a kid were the fucking big, brutal men. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=574.0s)]
*  Beast. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=578.0s)]
*  Big fucking houses. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=579.0s)]
*  They looked like former football players. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=581.0s)]
*  There's this guy I used to play pool with, Ray the Fireman, because everybody in the pool hall, I was Joe the comedian. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=583.0s)]
*  Everybody had a nickname based on what you did. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=588.0s)]
*  Ray the Fireman was a fucking house. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=590.0s)]
*  He's just a big fucking like big Irish guy. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=592.0s)]
*  You know, like, of course, he's a fireman. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=596.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=598.0s)]
*  That guy is going to kick down a door, carry your fucking husband, throw him over his shoulder, run through the flames, throw him on the lawn. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=599.0s)]
*  He does it all the time. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=607.0s)]
*  He's an animal like Vito's lover in The Sopranos. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=608.0s)]
*  Remember, he was a fireman. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=611.0s)]
*  He was right. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=613.0s)]
*  I forgot about that scene that he killed those real. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=614.0s)]
*  Oh, did he really? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=617.0s)]
*  After that show because they thought he was gay? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=618.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=620.0s)]
*  I read so many. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=621.0s)]
*  It wasn't that. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=622.0s)]
*  I hope they didn't taunt him for being gay. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=623.0s)]
*  You imagine you get your shot. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=625.0s)]
*  Hey, Joey, I got good news and bad news. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=626.0s)]
*  Good news is you're going to be on The Sopranos. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=630.0s)]
*  Bad news is you got to fuck a guy. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=632.0s)]
*  And you got to swap spit with him. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=635.0s)]
*  You got to swap spit on camera. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=637.0s)]
*  On camera. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=638.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=639.0s)]
*  But you're on The Sopranos. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=640.0s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=641.0s)]
*  Depends on what you want to do. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=642.0s)]
*  If you're a regular guy and that's your first acting gig, I suggest you pass. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=644.0s)]
*  I suggest you pass. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=648.0s)]
*  I couldn't swap spit with him. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=650.0s)]
*  You have to be like a Jared Leto type dude to pull that off. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=651.0s)]
*  Died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound December 16, 2008, at the age of 47. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=655.0s)]
*  And he was a firefighter, a former firefighter. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=661.0s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=664.0s)]
*  I mean, when did he die? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=667.0s)]
*  How long after the show? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=669.0s)]
*  Go pull it back up again. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=671.0s)]
*  Because it just said. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=674.0s)]
*  So he died in 2008. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=677.0s)]
*  So the show was running in 2008. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=679.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=683.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=685.0s)]
*  Was Sopranos still on in 2008? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=686.0s)]
*  No. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=687.0s)]
*  No, it was off by then? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=688.0s)]
*  2007, I think. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=689.0s)]
*  No, 2009 maybe. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=690.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=692.0s)]
*  Let's find that out and then we'll have an answer. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=693.0s)]
*  But I would imagine if you're a guy, an Italian guy or whatever, and you go back to the neighborhood and you've been playing. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=695.0s)]
*  It ended June 10, 2007. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=703.0s)]
*  So right after it ended, I guess. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=705.0s)]
*  Right after it ended, he waxed himself. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=706.0s)]
*  That's so unfortunate. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=708.0s)]
*  There's another beautiful thing about the comedy community. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=712.0s)]
*  Like nobody gives a fuck if you're gay. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=715.0s)]
*  Nobody. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=717.0s)]
*  Like Tim Dillon. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=718.0s)]
*  Tim Dillon, he's just one of us. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=719.0s)]
*  It's just we're all like the lesbians that come there and hang out. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=723.0s)]
*  They're just one of us. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=727.0s)]
*  No one gives a flying fuck. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=729.0s)]
*  It's just if you're not funny, nobody wants to hang out with you. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=732.0s)]
*  If you're not funny, like get out of the green room. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=734.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=736.0s)]
*  But if you're funny, who cares? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=737.0s)]
*  No one cares. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=738.0s)]
*  Do you remember the kid from Houston? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=740.0s)]
*  Which one? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=741.0s)]
*  The guy that used to always wear football shirts. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=742.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=744.0s)]
*  Did he die? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=745.0s)]
*  He passed away. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=746.0s)]
*  He passed. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=747.0s)]
*  That was my brother. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=748.0s)]
*  What was his name? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=749.0s)]
*  God damn it. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=750.0s)]
*  I loved him. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=751.0s)]
*  I loved him. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=752.0s)]
*  It's fucking escaping my mind. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=753.0s)]
*  With the little hat on. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=754.0s)]
*  You're going to remember his name. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=755.0s)]
*  And he come up to you and give you a hug all the time. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=756.0s)]
*  I haven't seen him in so long. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=758.0s)]
*  When did he die? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=759.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=760.0s)]
*  Maybe 10 years ago. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=761.0s)]
*  Did he talk about being gay on stage? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=762.0s)]
*  No, but he told me he was gay. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=764.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, well he was gay as fuck. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=766.0s)]
*  He would go to those army things just to fuck men. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=768.0s)]
*  Well he just looked like a football player. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=770.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=772.0s)]
*  Like a big, it looked like a Shane Gillis type dude. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=773.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=775.0s)]
*  Like a big, former football player, but he was gay. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=776.0s)]
*  But he was gay. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=778.0s)]
*  He always wore football jerseys. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=779.0s)]
*  Always football jerseys. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=780.0s)]
*  That's how we trick him. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=781.0s)]
*  Sweetheart of a guy. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=782.0s)]
*  But again, same situation Joey. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=783.0s)]
*  That guy was one of us. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=784.0s)]
*  He just hung out with us. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=785.0s)]
*  No, I loved him to death. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=786.0s)]
*  He just hung out with us. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=787.0s)]
*  I loved that dude to death. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=788.0s)]
*  It didn't even matter to me that he was. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=789.0s)]
*  Listen, that's never mattered to me. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=790.0s)]
*  You got to remember, I was a Judas Priest fan in high school. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=791.0s)]
*  That dude was just gay as hell. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=792.0s)]
*  First time I saw him. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=793.0s)]
*  Nobody knew. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=794.0s)]
*  Isn't that funny? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=795.0s)]
*  I fucking knew him. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=796.0s)]
*  79. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=797.0s)]
*  Nobody comes out with a little hat with a whip. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=798.0s)]
*  You know, I saw him at the Palladium. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=799.0s)]

*  Is it crazy? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=808.0s)]
*  I'll just tell you one story. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=809.0s)]
*  There was a guy in Chicago, a stylist that used to tell him he wanted dick. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=810.0s)]
*  Always bust. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=811.0s)]

*  It's never going to happen. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=816.0s)]
*  And he said finally, he got pissed off one day. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=817.0s)]
*  And he took the guy up on his offer. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=818.0s)]

*  Well, you got to think what Rob Halford did. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=845.0s)]
*  When he was the head of Judas Priest, he got all these straight guys to dress like they're [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=846.68s)]
*  in a gay biker gang because they wanted to be cool like Judas Priest. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=850.94s)]
*  He changed the style of a kind of music. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=854.52s)]
*  I loved him. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=858.64s)]
*  I loved him. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=859.64s)]
*  Dressed like gay bikers not even knowing what they were doing [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=860.64s)]
*  They just thought you know this is how you dress for this kind of music, but it was because of Rob Alford [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=863.96s)]
*  Fucking Rob and he's still out. You know I had him on a show once there. He has that bad motherfucker [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=869.16s)]
*  You've got another thing coming. I [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=874.28s)]
*  had a buddy mine in high school who loved that song and he used like a quote of it in his [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=877.28s)]
*  In his yearbook, and I've always remember thinking wow that's a coolest quote [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=883.48s)]
*  Like if you think you're gonna sit around let you chip away, but where my brain listen [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=888.6s)]

*  No, and here's the weirdest thing about Judas Priest what his writing? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=906.12s)]
*  That's what I fucking died about his writing because he would write and you're thinking he's writing about a woman [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=912.16s)]
*  He's right about a man, and he has a song called burning up [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=918.64s)]
*  That is so [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=923.52s)]

*  Burning you up. It's called breaking you down [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=934.52s)]
*  Breaking you out in the cold sweat, but when you lose control of your very soul your desire takes over [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=937.72s)]
*  You'll feel the heat wave your answer my way and suddenly you know that you're burning up [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=945.72s)]

*  We'll have to edit this out of YouTube for the folks at home. Please seek it online [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=958.2s)]
*  Here we go [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=963.5600000000001s)]
*  Listen to the way it starts [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=965.16s)]
*  It's like a satellite [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=972.6s)]

*  Wasn't he a 47 [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=2885.16s)]

*  Yeah, but Pino Cuevas versus Tommy Hearns one of the most [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=2895.44s)]
*  memorable moments of the early days of [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=2900.04s)]
*  Tommy Hearns is like when he was like at the peak of his powers Tommy Hearns was nuking people man [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=2903.64s)]
*  Just nuking people [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=2910.36s)]
*  He had such a reach and such width for 45 [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=2912.96s)]
*  He was such a physical freak and he was big but he had I mean long and skinny but crazy power [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=2918.7200000000003s)]
*  It's like generally like thin guys don't have the same kind of power is like the muscular guys [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=2925.8s)]
*  But Tommy Hearns was kind of like Deontay Wilder [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=2931.48s)]
*  He was both thin and muscular at the same time and so, you know real skinny legs man [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=2934.4s)]
*  My god the fucking torque that guy had in his punches you gotta think of the leverage cuz his shoulders are so wide [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=2939.7599999999998s)]

*  Oh [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3016.96s)]
*  What a crazy fight stop and roll it back keep rolling it back the crazy thing about that fight is they did it not box at all [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3018.96s)]
*  They went to war and there was no boxing slipping. There was no fainting [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3026.2s)]
*  Marvin Hagler just said fuck you and ran at him [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3032.32s)]
*  He just ran at him and just fucking just started smashing it was non-stop. Yeah [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3037.92s)]

*  So in the first round when they first come out of the game this round the boxing look at this shit [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3051.24s)]
*  Yeah, God Hagler was good [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3056.4399999999996s)]

*  I mean high profile two world champions completely throwing it all out the window just wailing on each other [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3082.52s)]
*  Holy shit, Joe boom left hand boom boom [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3093.08s)]
*  The thing about Hagler was his discipline was fucking supreme that never got that guy never got out of shape [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3100.04s)]
*  He always could break guys break their will boom boom boom so that by this time [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3107.84s)]
*  Tommy probably already has a broken hand so he broke it on Hagler's head somewhere in the first so now [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3113.68s)]
*  He's throwing the jab so I bet his hands already broken see it's all left hands now [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3119.96s)]
*  He threw that right hand, but he was weak. You know he didn't really hurt him with the right hand [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3124.44s)]
*  He's like pulling it back as he's throwing it [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3128.76s)]
*  See he's just trying to touch him with that right hand that that left hand has always got left his right hand is cooked [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3132.32s)]
*  And Hearns has decided to start moving and boxing which is not like his style [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3141.0s)]
*  See like even when he's landing that right hand he's got no power behind it now [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3148.6000000000004s)]
*  And sugar ray letters talking shit in the commentary both fighters [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3152.96s)]
*  Hagler could take a shot to better than anybody [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3168.28s)]
*  He only has one knockdown a credit to him his entire career, but it wasn't a knockdown [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3171.6s)]
*  he fought Ron rolled in and [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3175.92s)]
*  Ron wand rolled in like kind of cuffed him in the back of the neck and like pushed him forward and Hagler fell forward and [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3178.12s)]
*  Touched the ground the referee mistakenly called it a knockdown the only times ever been down took bombs from the greatest punchers in the division [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3184.96s)]
*  Beat everybody except sugar ray, and I think the only reason why he lost the sugar ray was I think the fix was in that fight [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3192.44s)]
*  Son I watched that fight many times anytime yeah, there's something about it [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3199.52s)]
*  Something about it, and then Hagler leaves and goes to become a movie star in Italy [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3204.16s)]
*  Come on his trainers are the Petronelli brothers in Brockton, Massachusetts come on [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3210.76s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. You know how much money was on Hagler to win probably [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3216.32s)]
*  You know it's probably some sort of a deal like look the odds are very favorable in Hagler's direction [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3221.08s)]
*  And we can get a bet on Leonard we can clean up here. We can get Marvin to just like you know [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3227.12s)]
*  Don't put him away [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3233.2000000000003s)]
*  Just touch him a little bit touch him. He never has him hurt never has him hurt in the whole fight [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3235.0s)]
*  Just he was so good. I just he didn't seem right it seemed like almost he was like sparring sometimes [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3240.48s)]
*  Hard to say though sugar. It was so good, too [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3247.52s)]
*  The guy could come back after all those years off [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3250.92s)]
*  You know I had one fight got dropped said he was retired and then comes back and [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3254.04s)]
*  Decides he's gonna fight Hagler and then he wins and then Hagler's like I'm done. I'm done [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3259.7999999999997s)]

*  It's like everything seems fishy and the fight seemed fishy to me the decision seemed fishy to me [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3292.04s)]
*  And then Hagler goes off and becomes a movie star and I go okay in Italy. How does that happen? How do you get connected? [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=3298.36s)]

*  Why would they do that? [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4627.84s)]
*  That's what sense [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4629.88s)]
*  Netflix is off the you know, they don't know they just Netflix has so much fucking shit on there [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4631.68s)]

*  They got if you watch like a murder thing one time forget it, you know, they're talking about doing the UFC on Netflix. Yeah. Yeah [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4642.12s)]
*  Apparently, I think the UFC's [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4650.4400000000005s)]
*  Negotiation [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4653.780000000001s)]
*  Period with ESPN and ended. Yeah [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4655.820000000001s)]
*  So what that means is they could talk to other people that fucking thing that night when everything fell apart [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4659.18s)]
*  That was the bad night what which night with when the ball dropped not this card [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4664.7s)]
*  But the one before that when the pay-per-views when all the disasters started [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4669.900000000001s)]
*  It was about pay-per-views one night that nobody was getting the pay-per-view [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4673.26s)]
*  Oh, you were a fighter fucking the app fail. Yeah [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4677.14s)]
*  It was too overwhelming for the UFC [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4682.34s)]
*  I think the shit happens, but I mean this must have been bad because what fight what fight card was that Jamie where there was a failure? [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4684.34s)]
*  I don't was I working that how do I not know that that happened? I don't think you were working that one [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4695.34s)]
*  I [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4701.62s)]
*  313 so two events ago may March. Where was that? Where was it? [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4707.38s)]
*  Was that a Adesanya or uncle of decision over prayer Oh [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4715.38s)]
*  Okay, so I was working that one you did work it [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4721.34s)]
*  Yeah [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4723.86s)]
*  I was working that one for sure was uncle live when he won the title over prayer [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4724.099999999999s)]
*  So the the pay-per-view what happened it went down or it was partially went down it partially went down [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4728.04s)]
*  I couldn't order the car. Oh, it was a bunch of shit going on [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4733.72s)]
*  Then I went on Twitter and I saw Frankie I get a bunch of other guys [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4736.84s)]
*  Fighters saying what the fuck is wrong with my I'm like, okay [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4740.320000000001s)]
*  It's not just me and then I've heard the riffraff that night and then the next day they were talking about and then Monday day [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4742.92s)]
*  That was hot. I know he did something said something about it [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4749.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, I think in general the pay-per-view numbers are down as well because the casuals aren't buying it as much because you don't [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4752.44s)]
*  First of all, the UFC is not like boxing like a boxing pay-per-view is like [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4758.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh Canelo's fighting in four months and then you get gear up and you buy the can have all Canelo Alvarez pay-per-view [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4763.48s)]
*  If you're a big boxing fan [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4770.719999999999s)]
*  You might buy one once every couple months if you're like hardcore you you're watching all of them [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4772.839999999999s)]
*  You're on Dazon and you're on ESPN plus you're watching every boxing match there is but there's not a lot of pay-per-views [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4778.5199999999995s)]
*  the UFC has a pay-per-view every week or [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4784.5199999999995s)]
*  Excuse me every month and then they have a fight every week [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4787.32s)]
*  So it's like getting people to shell out 70 bucks for this card [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4791.0s)]
*  and [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4795.639999999999s)]
*  Also, like some of the great fights are on the undercard and you already before the pay-per-view starts [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4796.719999999999s)]
*  You already have you know three and a half hours of great fights [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4801.5199999999995s)]
*  You can watch for free and some of them they're trying to lure you into buying the pay-per-view [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4805.86s)]
*  So some of the best fights are really on the undercard [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4810.339999999999s)]
*  Sometimes like guys who you don't know their names [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4813.62s)]
*  Yeah, there's always one good fight that I want to watch on the other call [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4815.9s)]
*  I'm gonna watch the other car always fights or something always you guys [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4818.78s)]
*  Oh, what's about the fights and then you get you know, and then you order it? Yeah [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4822.86s)]
*  I mean the big fight clearly this last weekend was Volkanovsky versus Lopez [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4827.0199999999995s)]
*  That was the fight I really wanted to see because I really want to see if Volkanovsky could pull it off all-time great [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4831.16s)]
*  featherweight champion one of the [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4837.44s)]
*  For sure greatest fighters of all time [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4839.88s)]
*  Shoo-in for the Hall of Fame, but he's 36 and he got knocked out two times in a row [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4842.8s)]
*  He's fighting this fucking animal and Diego Lopez [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4846.88s)]
*  It was a great fight though and Volk pulled it off [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4849.68s)]
*  But the fight that I really wanted to see was Bryce Mitchell versus John Silva, right? [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4852.12s)]
*  Because John Silva is a [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4857.46s)]
*  Motherfucker dude that guy looks like a world champion. He looks like he's [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4860.46s)]
*  yeah, well he took them like a ninja choke, okay and [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4866.7s)]
*  Was like no no arm in with the Darcy of the arm in and you cinch it up [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4870.46s)]
*  That was just all neck and put him to sleep [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4874.7s)]
*  he tapped and then he went out and [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4878.18s)]
*  Did do and you just beat him? [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4880.74s)]
*  From [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4883.0599999999995s)]
*  Pillar to post the entire fight and was smiling and laughing and looked like he was never threatened and never in danger [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4884.66s)]
*  Just like he was on another level like way above Bryce like looked like a world champion [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4891.86s)]
*  Like even guys that have beat him before [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4898.44s)]
*  That beat Bryce Mitchell before except Josh Emmett who just KO'd him with one punch [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4901.259999999999s)]
*  But like even Ilya Toporia like he got to get a hold of him first like John Silva looked like he was never a fight [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4906.099999999999s)]
*  Like it almost like he was having fun. He was trying to get him to touch hands the beginning of every round [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4912.86s)]
*  He wouldn't do is like [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4917.219999999999s)]
*  He tried he's like touch hands. He wouldn't touch hands [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4919.74s)]
*  And then finally just put him to sleep [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4923.82s)]
*  He's an animal man. That guy is that whole team apparently the fighting nerds. I was talking to John Anik about this [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=4926.54s)]

*  I was always very impressed with how every fight he showed up with something different [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5033.08s)]
*  Yeah, but his opponent was still like yeah GSP's got skills, but I still got this right hand. Okay [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5038.5199999999995s)]

*  Remember when he fought I think it was Josh [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5061.599999999999s)]
*  Kaczak and he was jabbing. Is that the fight? Yeah, he fucking broke the jab out and he had trained that wild card [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5064.0s)]

*  He comes down to train and then he'll go somewhere else to train and he'll go somewhere else to train no desire to fight [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5116.04s)]
*  He doesn't want to fight anymore at all. He's just a martial artist. He's so happy and content [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5120.8s)]
*  He's like the best example of a guy who retired with millions in the bank and is living like his best life [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5125.32s)]
*  He's a real martial artist really is he just wants to learn and grow like why would he come here and train with Gordon Ryan? [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5131.5599999999995s)]
*  Why would train that fucking animal if you're if you're not actually thinking about competing? [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5138.28s)]

*  Would you ever consider going back to take one down now? No [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5244.259999999999s)]
*  No, just going to a school once a week and just going in there with a bunch of guys and throwing some kicks and shit [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5248.299999999999s)]
*  I thought of my own I am no no, you're not feeling me. What do you mean? Anybody can work on their own? [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5253.98s)]
*  Could you imagine now what you're like? I've been thinking about it. There's a purple belt at my jujitsu school. He's 68 [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5258.9s)]
*  Oh, wow came from a fucking shot of con karate background and he goes I teach in the Bronx every Wednesday night [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5265.66s)]
*  He goes this was my school. I sold it, but I still go up down to Wednesdays come with me some time [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5272.219999999999s)]
*  I'm like, wow, how cool would that be? It would be cool to take class [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5277.299999999999s)]
*  I'm saying one time a week like something that you what's the long didn't have to spar? No, no, no [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5281.14s)]
*  No, but you do those [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5286.860000000001s)]
*  You know like when you do taekwondo [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5288.18s)]
*  They have one steps one step like little yeah, it was a chic day run. I think they call where they [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5291.22s)]
*  And that that's what you need. You're not gonna go you're not gonna fucking [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5297.9400000000005s)]
*  You're not gonna fucking spa and go crazy. But it drills are really important [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5301.62s)]
*  They're really important people don't like to do them because sparring is so fun [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5306.46s)]
*  Same with jujitsu like Eddie Bravo always say that like drills are terrible. They're so boring [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5309.46s)]
*  But if you can do them, it'll make you jujitsu way better [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5314.14s)]
*  Like the biggest leap that I ever got in my like when the beginning of my jujitsu journey [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5317.18s)]
*  Was when I became friends with Eddie we were training my garage. I had mats in my garage and we would just [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5321.58s)]
*  Drill for like an hour and a half. Go would you drink? [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5326.62s)]
*  He was showing me a lot of his rubber guard stuff like the early stuff [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5329.78s)]
*  But we would just drill like different positions had escape certain positions [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5333.62s)]
*  How to finish from certain positions what to be careful of and then we just go through paths like path was you know [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5338.94s)]
*  Pass into half guard push on the knee move into side control side control head and arm [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5345.82s)]
*  Secure the arm finish the arm triangle and what would do is like if he was doing it to me [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5352.54s)]
*  I would resist like 40% maybe you know [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5356.94s)]
*  You just kind of like sort of resist and they secure it and you kind of just and they finish it off [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5359.8s)]
*  So it's like basically you just you're doing it as if that you're doing the same pathway with the same [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5363.94s)]
*  Things that a person would do to resist but then they're not trying to really stop you they want you to tap them [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5370.42s)]
*  Like this is the idea of the drill [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5375.9s)]
*  So I'm just I'll get my hand in but it's just so that you could push my hand down and then right then lock it over [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5377.32s)]
*  So that's big now. Yeah, drilling is everything people are flow rolling [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5382.759999999999s)]
*  People are selling it more even Tom. De Blas is like don't listen. It's a way to get better [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5388.38s)]
*  It's really the way to get better [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5394.299999999999s)]
*  So the problem is you got to keep them with a fucker flown and that's the problem that after a while you like [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5395.58s)]
*  And also next thing you know, it's not a flown. Right now you're going to try to go and that's a problem [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5400.54s)]
*  It always starts off with a flow for a minute and a half and then it goes off the fucking reservation [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5405.139999999999s)]
*  That's always the same with kickboxing sparring too when I was training at the Jet Center [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5410.5599999999995s)]
*  There was this one dude that I used to love to train with he was an older guy. So I was probably [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5414.86s)]
*  26 back then 27 maybe and he was maybe like closer to [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5419.06s)]
*  3540 like had some fights just like to stay in shape and we would spar and [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5426.780000000001s)]
*  He knew I was an actor or comedian whatever I was on a TV show and I don't want to get hit too much [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5432.5s)]
*  And he knew what he so we would spar we just touch each other [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5437.46s)]
*  Yeah, and I knew he wasn't gonna try to knock me out [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5440.14s)]
*  But other guys I knew like we're fighting like we're sparring this is a fight [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5442.46s)]
*  But with him I knew when I got so sharp because of that because he and I would work out a couple times a week [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5447.219999999999s)]
*  And I noticed like my timing and everything was like much sharper because I was going through those pathways and not tense [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5453.179999999999s)]
*  You know, I was going through those pathways so sharpening those lanes [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5460.54s)]
*  So like punch come slip counter all these things were like flowing in my head because we weren't hurting each other [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5463.78s)]
*  But it's so hard for young guys to understand that to get better is to like be playful with it [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5469.82s)]
*  You want to like the tie guys they just because they fight every week when they spar they don't hurt each other at all [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5476.32s)]
*  They touch and they they laugh like oh [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5482.12s)]
*  They like playing a little game with each other. You're seeing tie guys. Have a good time [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5485.96s)]
*  but you watch like one of the [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5489.88s)]
*  The best things to watch is like two elite high-level [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5492.22s)]
*  Tie guys just spar with each other just just spar [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5495.96s)]
*  Playful light because they're joking around and laughing and they're touching each other, but they're really working on that timing [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5500.04s)]
*  They're really working on those moves working on like seeing what's coming how to stop it how to get in on them [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5506.56s)]
*  But they're not hurting each other at all [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5512.28s)]
*  You know, it's weird that I'm older and I love doing crazy shit. I love it. I don't have much in the daytime no more [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5515.24s)]
*  So I'll try to catch a boxing class or jiu-jitsu and all that shit [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5521.88s)]
*  And jiu-jitsu is the toughest one for me. Like I haven't been to jiu-jitsu since November [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5526.2s)]
*  I've been sick, you know, I had a bunch of problems and I was on antibiotics. I was having a hard time fucking breathing [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5530.08s)]
*  But I can't wait to go back but now I'm gonna go back and do it a little bit differently flow flow [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5536.2s)]
*  yeah, I'm off loan there's one guy that'll flow with me as a cop and [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5542.28s)]
*  Drilling more. Yeah, they have a blue belt class. It's basically a lot of drilling [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5547.68s)]
*  You can burn a lot of calories in that drilling is so important [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5552.06s)]
*  But you have to go in the daytime they roll a little bit more at night [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5556.64s)]
*  The classes are so shut that you don't have time to roll that long [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5560.12s)]
*  I would rather drill a long time and then roll once and get the fuck out of that perfect for me [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5564.400000000001s)]
*  You know, so even with boxing, I don't when I go box. I don't fucking go crazy [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5569.8s)]
*  I had the speed bag a little bit two rounds and I had the bag that moves around that burns a ton of calories [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5574.72s)]
*  Then I hit the hard bag and I'm out of it seven three seven eight three minute rounds and I'm good [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5580.18s)]
*  You know what I like to do I like to put on the Wu Tang clan and just fuck that heavy bag [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5585.099999999999s)]
*  I love it. I love your phones. I love all and I'll tell you what else I got into now [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5589.44s)]
*  I'm older because when I went to that hospital taught me a lot Joe [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5593.54s)]
*  It reminded me that I wasn't a kid no more [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5596.879999999999s)]
*  like we fuck around and we have a good time and we think we're bad motherfuckers, but [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5599.78s)]
*  You want to stay healthy? Yeah, ever since I come out of the hospital a month ago. Everything's fucking changed [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=5604.86s)]

*  That would be like us going to visit that of course we would visit that [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6321.5199999999995s)]
*  Of course like if you had a chance to see what it would like to see Christopher Columbus [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6325.24s)]
*  Land in the Bahamas to see what that must have been like, of course [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6330.76s)]
*  You would want to see it if you could go literally back in time and see primitive humans [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6335.2s)]
*  Well, if they're just like us, but they're like us millions of years from now, of course, they would want to visit us [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6340.24s)]
*  It would be so interesting you imagine if there was a planet where we could go where we could see cavemen [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6345.799999999999s)]
*  We go, would you imagine fucking what's gonna say now? Yeah [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6352.28s)]
*  We can see guys making fucking arrowheads with with Flint for the first time and [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6358.08s)]
*  Strapping them to sticks giant fucking heads and big teeth. Yeah covered in hair just figuring out tools [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6363.36s)]
*  Oh my god, we would be fascinated by those people the way I think about it is listen since I'm a kid [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6369.2s)]
*  We're talking about Martians and aliens, right? So some fucking yeah six seven [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6374.26s)]
*  I've been hearing about this the moon landing what's in 69. Mm-hmm [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6379.820000000001s)]
*  So I was six so it started after that like I heard it more and more about it [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6383.780000000001s)]
*  So what you mean to tell me is in 55 years, we haven't found that more information about it. We know [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6387.5s)]
*  We know what's going on. We know NASA's not stupid. They know something's out there [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6393.42s)]
*  They play with us a little bit from time to time, but there's something out there my friend. I think so, too [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6398.5s)]
*  Something I think the other problem with the president knowing, you know, can they keep things from the president? [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6403.38s)]
*  Of course again, the president is only there for four years [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6409.46s)]
*  Then he has to get in there again [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6411.62s)]
*  And if he wins, he's only there for four more years [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6413.26s)]
*  These fucking people have 30 year careers 50 year careers and the intelligence agencies [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6415.3s)]
*  If they know something and they've known something since you know fucking Gerald Ford. Why why would they tell you? [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6419.900000000001s)]
*  Why do you need to know? [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6427.3s)]
*  Hiding us from the population for so long and those old-timers didn't need a what's that we have to sign something NDA NDA [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6429.3s)]
*  There's no NDAs back then so [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6438.42s)]
*  There was something to it. Yeah, there was something to it [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6440.58s)]
*  You know, you got that place in New Mexico [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6443.78s)]
*  You got Hudson County what I discussed before when the Martians land you have all these places that have a higher volume [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6447.14s)]
*  I wonder what's number two in UFO sightings. I [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6453.82s)]
*  Wonder what's number one? What's number one is a Justin Valley? Yeah [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6457.900000000001s)]
*  George Washington Bridge that whole thing that's crazy. That's number one [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6462.860000000001s)]
*  I wonder what number two number three and number four is it's interesting that a lot of them are over near where the ocean is [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6466.42s)]
*  Because that's that's one of the big theories that they have bases in the ocean [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6473.66s)]
*  Because the reality of the ocean is no one's looking [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6477.820000000001s)]
*  You know, if you have something on earth [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6481.62s)]
*  Satellites can see it like if you have something that's in the middle of Nevada in some deserted area and you have buildings [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6484.700000000001s)]
*  Satellites can see that they can see the structures. So you have to hide them [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6491.9400000000005s)]
*  But if you have something in the ocean, nobody sees anything [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6495.34s)]
*  We've only explored what is the percentage of the ocean floor that we have to explored? [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6498.34s)]
*  I think it's like 10% I think it's somewhere around 10 maybe 20% [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6503.88s)]
*  So that means that 80% of the ocean floor is undiscovered we have no idea what's down there and it's you know [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6508.700000000001s)]
*  a mile two miles deep in some spots if you're from a [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6515.780000000001s)]
*  super sophisticated civilization that's [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6520.740000000001s)]
*  Millions of light-years away and you can come here instantaneously and you have the ability to traverse [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6523.18s)]
*  In these what they call transmedium craft, which means they can go through air and go through water [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6528.1s)]
*  It creates a gravity bubble around it and go through everything that's what they think these things are doing [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6533.46s)]
*  that's what they can go 500 knots underwater just [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6538.42s)]
*  like nothing we have could do that and [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6542.1s)]
*  If they have bases under the ocean it makes sense that these sightings are all near the ocean. It just totally makes sense [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6544.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I love going to a beach [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6555.06s)]
*  And just sitting on the beach [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6557.06s)]
*  Watching the ocean [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6559.06s)]
*  Seabed 2030 what they've mapped out. They've gotten 30% mapped. They're trying to get the whole thing done by [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6561.46s)]
*  2030. Oh really? Oh interesting. Oh, what if they find a base? [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6567.02s)]
*  What if they get down there and they find bases? What is all that stuff? What are those lines? [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6571.38s)]
*  I'm guessing that's where they probably sent their drones [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6575.780000000001s)]
*  Probably. Whoa [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6578.240000000001s)]
*  Six looks a pool scrubber, you know, oh, that's crazy [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6579.740000000001s)]
*  Easy shit, so they're scouring the ocean floor to try to get a met. That's why the aliens are gonna come out. Wow, that's Hawaii [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6582.94s)]
*  Whoa [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6591.179999999999s)]
*  It is what's that one of those islands in the middle is that Catalina? Oh, I see. Oh you were zoomed in. Yeah. Oh, okay [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6593.379999999999s)]
*  I see what this stuff is. I think these little like color brown spots are what's sticking up and the rest of its underneath [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6600.419999999999s)]
*  Wow [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6607.54s)]
*  We'll pause yeah, we'll be right back folks whoa and we're back what we just talking about [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6610.1s)]
*  Aliens and whatnot and whatnot. Yeah, you know, I feel that we know we just not gonna you know, it's like everything else man [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6617.62s)]
*  We know who shot Kennedy. We're not gonna release it, you know, we're gonna play with us. That's what they do [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6624.06s)]
*  I think that they would be a I think even after all the [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6628.74s)]
*  Alien talk and everything. I think Americans couldn't really handle it. Well, there was actually a discussion [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6633.54s)]
*  This guy how put off who was a physicist that worked with the US government told me that during the Bush administration [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6639.54s)]
*  They actually wanted to talk [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6646.14s)]
*  About the potential of disclosure to the American people will be the pros and the cons and so they listed what could be disrupted [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6648.94s)]
*  Well, the economy could be disrupted religion could be disrupt disrupted government could be disrupted [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6656.7s)]
*  What would be the positive aspects and they started looking at the positive aspects like scientific development the understanding that we're not alone [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6662.14s)]
*  You know and then they weighed it all out and the cons outweighed the pros [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6669.78s)]
*  By a significant number and so they decided not to disclose it. This is what how put off says [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6675.38s)]
*  so he is a scientist that's worked with the government for [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6680.22s)]
*  Decades and he you know [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6684.62s)]
*  I had dinner with him and Jacques Vallee Jacques Vallee is the guy who the character in close encounters of the third kind was [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6686.82s)]
*  Based on the French guy the scientist Jacques Vallee has been studying UFOs since like I think the 50s [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6691.9s)]
*  Brilliant brilliant guys written tons of books on on the subject and the stories that he knows that he's aware of the historical stories [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6697.72s)]
*  Which really gets crazy is when they get into like the 1700s in the 1800s and the early 19th [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6705.72s)]
*  There's the same stories the people have seen the same things the same kind of things are happening [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6710.88s)]
*  These people the people that are encountering the crafts and encountering the beings they're reporting the same stories [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6715.24s)]
*  They're real similar to the point where you're like what's going on and if it's real unique in like [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6721.54s)]
*  You know, I haven't been I haven't seen UFO. I haven't seen aliens [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6728.02s)]
*  You haven't Jamie hasn't but what if one of us did like if there's millions and millions and millions of people and one guy [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6731.54s)]
*  Is fucking walking his dog in the middle of a field and all of a sudden this thing just lands right in front of them [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6737.58s)]
*  and no one's around and [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6743.68s)]
*  Then these things get out and they look at you and they're talking to you with their mind and then they get back in [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6746.0s)]
*  Their ship and they fucking disappear. They zoom off so fast [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6751.92s)]
*  You can't even follow with your eyes and then you're sitting there going what the fuck do I tell anybody? [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6754.92s)]
*  Who's gonna believe me? [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6760.56s)]
*  Who's gonna believe this? [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6762.52s)]
*  I should probably not tell anybody and then you're lying in bed at night [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6763.76s)]
*  You're all freaked out because you can't believe you know something that other people don't know [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6766.58s)]
*  You know the most incredible thing that not only are they real? [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6770.200000000001s)]
*  But they can do things that we can't possibly do they cannot be us there's something different [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6774.28s)]
*  It's a different life form. I think when they came here, maybe somebody painted them as green or whatever me [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6780.6s)]
*  I feel that if they're here they walk around [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6785.84s)]
*  Looking like us there are there are more [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6789.04s)]
*  Intelligent life source like the movie cocoon, right? [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6792.96s)]
*  That's in my mind and and to just I'm the type of guy I'll talk to invasion of the body snatchers [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6797.24s)]
*  Yeah invasion of body snatchers. I'm the type of guy I'll talk to you about but just talking to you just now about [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6803.08s)]
*  Somebody the government telling me the aliens exist [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6809.5199999999995s)]
*  I would it would knock me down because I know they do right but not really but not really but not really [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6812.0s)]
*  I know they do but not really and that's I think with everything [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6817.36s)]
*  Yeah, so it would even shock me a little bit to find out but I think that yeah cocoon type people Jacques [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6820.2s)]
*  L.a. Is of that opinion too like what's interesting about him is he really maintains? [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6826.28s)]
*  scientific credibility after all these years despite [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6832.84s)]
*  Like studying UFOs at a back in the time where if you studied UFOs, you were a crackpot [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6836.5199999999995s)]
*  But everything he looked at was just based on logic. This is what we know and this is what we don't know [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6841.96s)]
*  This is what we can prove [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6848.0s)]
*  This is what we can't prove and we estimate that there's a certain percentage of these experiences [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6849.12s)]
*  Whether it's five percent or what that are legitimate [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6854.24s)]
*  There's a great number the vast majority of things that people see in the sky are not UFOs [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6856.639999999999s)]
*  No, I guarantee we do see things. Yeah that we think is something else and it's a UFO. Yeah, I could see that [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6862.62s)]
*  Oh, yeah, people see the Saturn they think Saturn's a UFO [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6870.44s)]
*  They think you know, they people see things too, you know, and then there's also weird phenomenon. That's real like ball lightning [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6874.44s)]
*  Ball lightning is a type of lightning that like juts around like a ball like a fucking like a giant softball of lightning [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=6881.719999999999s)]

*  Is more beneficial to the American people? [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7286.919999999999s)]
*  State your case that should be the only thing we do these people should be able to state their case [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7290.0s)]

*  No one should be pro-crime no one should be letting people off the hook for violent crimes [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7305.92s)]
*  No one should be like letting gang members live in some sanctuary city from another country that come over here just to cause havoc [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7310.48s)]
*  And create crime because if we have weak policing and because we let them in like no one that we know [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7317.5599999999995s)]
*  No side should want that no shot side should want the country to be more dangerous [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7323.44s)]
*  You know and no side should want people deported to El Salvador prisons that aren't really gang members either [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7327.44s)]
*  No shot no side should want no due process [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7332.36s)]
*  No side should want the ability to the government to like imagine like you're a person who's over here illegally [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7335.76s)]
*  But you're not a criminal [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7341.5599999999995s)]
*  You're just a guy who doesn't have paperwork and then they send you to prison somewhere someone decides because of your tattoos that you're in a gang [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7342.5599999999995s)]
*  So now all of a sudden you're in a prison in another country, and you haven't even been to trial [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7348.88s)]
*  We can't let that happen either [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7352.2s)]
*  You know did you see that fucking prison where they took them in Nicaragua? [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7354.32s)]
*  El Salvador [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7358.879999999999s)]
*  Apparently they have unmarked graves they you know people die they get strangled whatever taken the back unmarked grave [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7366.48s)]
*  you know, it's it's complete dehumanizing of people as a [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7372.5599999999995s)]
*  Over correction to having too much crime and gang violence [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7377.4s)]
*  So too much crime and gang violence then you throw all due process out the window round everybody up throw them all in jail [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7380.919999999999s)]
*  And if you're gonna do that a certain percentage of them are pro, I mean, it's gonna be effective [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7387.16s)]
*  You're definitely gonna curb crime [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7391.72s)]
*  But you're also gonna victimize a few innocent people a certain percentage of innocent people like undoubtedly especially if you have no due process [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7393.4s)]
*  No, listen, man. We know that like this is this can't come to America [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7402.44s)]
*  You know and if we're sending our prisoners over there [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7407.36s)]
*  How much different is that than the other stuff that we hate like sending jobs? [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7411.48s)]
*  Overseas where people work for a dollar a day and don't get health care. We would never allow that in America, right? [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7416.639999999999s)]
*  Well, we would never allow this kind of a prison in America either [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7423.5599999999995s)]
*  So should we really be involved in sending people to this kind of a prison if they're from another country? [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7427.12s)]
*  You know, it's a it's a it's an interesting question. I think [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7433.4s)]
*  I think it's there's something there is a bit of a problem [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7437.32s)]
*  Right if you come from one country and then they put you in a prison in another one without a trial [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7441.4s)]
*  If they say you're a gang member and you're in MS 13 you come from Mexico you make your way into American [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7447.88s)]
*  Also, they put you in El Salvador prison. You're like yo what happened here [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7452.5199999999995s)]
*  Now that's a lot of they took a handful of people that had weird tattoos and stuff like that [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7456.679999999999s)]
*  That's what I've heard. But I don't really know the truth [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7462.5599999999995s)]
*  No, you don't know the truth because you know, they were saying that they keep talking about this guy in the mainstream media [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7465.5199999999995s)]
*  Saying he's a Maryland father in this name, but then that Tom Homan guy says no, he's a member of MS 13 [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7471.24s)]

*  But the only way to know if someone's a criminal is to have due process [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7554.92s)]
*  But it's not over a fucking tattoo no, it's due process [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7558.639999999999s)]
*  It's the process I want because there's a lot of kids get stupid tattoos. Yeah, and then you have them fucking though [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=7562.84s)]

*  You know you hear too much about kids being abducted and weird things happening to kids [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9157.48s)]
*  It's not like they could free range like when we were kids [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9162.119999999999s)]
*  It's like there's that that narrative's out there everywhere and then some neighborhoods just aren't fucking safe [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9165.72s)]
*  Your kid shouldn't be out [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9170.599999999999s)]
*  No, there's a lot of safe neighborhoods. Yeah kids don't play [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9172.279999999999s)]
*  Our neighborhood wasn't that safe, but in unity there was strength. There's a real problem with uh video games [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9175.72s)]
*  Video games are so good. The kids don't want to go outside cell phone [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9182.439999999999s)]
*  That too that cell phone the computer that too [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9186.199999999999s)]
*  It's so many things but i'm not I don't have a problem with it no more [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9189.48s)]
*  That's what i'm trying to say to you. It's who they are now [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9192.92s)]
*  It's who they are, you know, I was reading something. I just put this together. It's the truth remember a couple weeks [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9196.44s)]
*  Maybe a year ago. They were talking about how low testosterone in these people. Yeah [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9201.08s)]
*  Kids don't play no more. Well, they don't play they don't go outside. They don't run. They don't jump [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9205.64s)]
*  They don't jump and then they're eating garbage. So what do you think testosterone level is going to be and they they have plastic in their brain [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9210.68s)]
*  They said that they studied a bunch of people to see micro how much micro plastic they had in their brain [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9217.96s)]
*  And some people had as much as a plastic spoon [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9222.6s)]
*  What imagine that [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9228.44s)]
*  You have so many micro plastics in your brain that if they extracted it all you can make a plastic spoon [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9230.6s)]
*  So, of course that's going to wreck your fucking testosterone too [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9238.28s)]
*  And then I saw this thing about call of duty [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9241.48s)]
*  Some fucking insane statistic about the amount of time [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9245.24s)]
*  That in total that's been played in call of duty is like more than human civilization [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9249.32s)]
*  Like the amount of minutes that people have logged like millions of people playing call of duty is like if you put it all together [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9257.08s)]
*  It's longer than human civilization [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9263.24s)]
*  And i've never played a video game joe good is that the craziest you'd love it [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9268.12s)]

*  And shoot at people. I'd rather shoot at people for real. I'd rather steal a car for real or roll a fucking drug dealer [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9279.64s)]
*  Well, it's definitely more fun to shoot at things for real, but video games are very fun [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9285.0s)]

*  So 10 years ago was that much there's you could probably pick a video game though and say the same thing right great grand theft auto [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9303.48s)]
*  Right. Yeah, any really popular game, right? Yeah, how about subway servers? This is 25 billion hours played [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9310.119999999999s)]

*  That's so crazy [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9321.48s)]

*  That was a good whack. That was good. That was a very good one that affected something [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9491.56s)]
*  Yeah, please out. I've never tried it before lifting weights, but that's what it's for. That's what they do those power lift [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9495.24s)]
*  So this is for strength lifters. Yeah, the real power lifter guys [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9501.32s)]
*  They like to take a jolt of that shit right before they fucking yeah [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9504.6s)]

*  Strength of the stuff they used to put in your nose. It's the same stuff. It's exactly [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9520.2s)]
*  It's it's smelling salts. It's just a whole jar of them [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9524.039999999999s)]
*  It's ammonia, right? Jamie now if you get knocked out you put that on them [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9527.8s)]
*  What they used to be able to do that to boxers in between rounds. They stopped allowing them to do it, you know [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9531.8s)]
*  Because I guess it'll wake you up if you got a concussion a little bit just enough for you to get more of a concussion [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9538.519999999999s)]

*  He tricks him. He pretends he sucks at pool and then slowly but surely paul newman realizes he's getting hustled [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9581.24s)]
*  I'll throw this away and there's a scene where he gets angry and he asks him are you a hustler? [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9589.88s)]
*  He's like you you can quit if you want to quit [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9595.64s)]
*  It's one of the best scenes a great scene. It's one of the best it's one of the best scenes in the movie [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9599.08s)]

*  Potentially you get airway injury you could potentially die [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9616.58s)]
*  But breathing this stuff in a few times over a few hours isn't really going to lead to any significant complications [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9619.96s)]
*  Yeah, the the fda warning is mostly a regulatory issue about misbranding and mislabeling. Okay, so we have to worry [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9626.039999999999s)]
*  There's no way we could worry because those powerlifter guys they've been doing it forever [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9633.48s)]
*  It's like that hicks joke about you know, when you smoke cigarettes, they're on the side of the label. Oh, yeah low birth weight [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLi_Vr8hm9s&t=9637.32s)]
