# Joe Rogan Experience #2224 - Tim Dillon
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXaYH-owS50)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by Dave, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  It's the end of the world as we know it.
*  How are you feeling?
*  I'm feeling good.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  I heard you were having a problem getting big guests and things were not going good
*  and I said, hey, I'll fly in and I'll help.
*  I'm always here to help.
*  We were talking about doing a live show at the Mothership but then somebody told a Puerto
*  Rican joke and we were like, maybe that's not a good idea.
*  Yeah.
*  It was, you know, it might have been.
*  We don't know.
*  It could have been interesting.
*  It would have been fun.
*  It could have been fine.
*  Whatever.
*  What are you going to do?
*  Yeah.
*  It's election day.
*  If Trump loses, he's on suicide watch.
*  If Trump loses, we're going to have to hide him.
*  We're going to have to pay a cartel to shelter him for a period of months or years.
*  They'll take him in Canada.
*  He could just move up to Canada.
*  Yeah.
*  Sort of change his rhetoric a little bit.
*  Yeah.
*  No, if Trump loses, he definitely will have to.
*  Kind of tone it down.
*  You know, he might have to move it around a little bit.
*  Survey the scene.
*  Yeah.
*  You know?
*  Probably not a lot of Puerto Ricans in Canada.
*  He could be a hero on the other side though.
*  That's true.
*  He could.
*  He could just emerge as the, you know.
*  Left wing.
*  I could just completely do like a 180.
*  Total.
*  I've seen the light.
*  Flip the script.
*  Inclusivity is super important.
*  Say, I did this.
*  Yeah.
*  Kamala, it was me.
*  I knew that was going to happen.
*  Right.
*  That's why I told those jokes.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, the funniest thing is that people are going, that he's a Hollywood plant.
*  Oh, god.
*  Like those people, they're like, he was a Hollywood plant, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  Those people are fucking hilarious.
*  Every now and then I'll come across a comment.
*  People think there's some fucking grand conspiracy.
*  Like we're all being puppet mastered.
*  It's manipulated.
*  It's always Jews.
*  They think the Jews are...
*  It always gets to the Jews.
*  It'll start somewhere and then goes to the Jews.
*  I forget who told me this, but it's like one of the symptoms of a collapsing civilization.
*  They start blaming things on Jews.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like one of them is they get very obsessed with gender.
*  And then the other one is they start blaming Jews.
*  The other thing is...
*  We're in both of those right now.
*  They make celebrities out of chefs.
*  Like they get very decadent.
*  This happened in Rome.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  People that provide you these comforts become celebrities.
*  Because you're just living a...
*  So much comfort.
*  Living a decadent lifestyle.
*  I never considered that.
*  That's one of the things that people say is like a harbinger of the apocalypse.
*  Celebrity chefs?
*  People just focusing way too much on artisanal donuts or whatever.
*  My wife likes going to those places where they serve you like 13 different things.
*  Each one is the size of a quarter.
*  I need a steak.
*  I need to bring it all at once.
*  I'm a glutton.
*  I need my food in a large plate.
*  I need just a giant fucking hunk of meat.
*  Well it's also so much time.
*  It's like three hours.
*  I can't do it.
*  And the waiters tell you about every single thing.
*  And it feels very like indulgent to sit somewhere for three hours
*  and then get educated about where a raspberry came from.
*  Right.
*  You know?
*  I can take it with the omakase sushi like Philip Franklin's Lee's place.
*  Sure.
*  That's kind of fun.
*  You watch them do it.
*  You watch them slice it up and put it together.
*  It's kind of cool.
*  It's fun.
*  Just know what you're in for when you get there.
*  You have conversations.
*  There's a small amount of people.
*  So you can get to know folks.
*  And a sushi bar is good because you don't have to talk that much.
*  Right.
*  When you're directly across somebody for three hours, that's intense.
*  And the worst is, someone could be in the middle of some fucking horrible story.
*  And then my mother came back and it was stage four.
*  This is a peanut from Australia.
*  And the glaze is a demi-glaze with a South France bourbon.
*  And then you have to say thank you.
*  Thank you so much.
*  Hey you fuckhead.
*  Yeah.
*  Her mom died.
*  You piece of shit.
*  I hate people that ruin meals with real discussions about anything.
*  That's depressing.
*  That is a problem.
*  Anybody who comes out and if there's money being spent, keep it to yourself.
*  Talk about things that we can all get on board.
*  Nobody cares.
*  My dad's going to beat it.
*  He's a fighter.
*  Hey, hey, hey.
*  Not now.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the emotion dump.
*  What am I supposed to do with all this?
*  I have all your emotions in a pile of my lawn.
*  People talk too much about personal things.
*  And then they expect you to offer them some degree of comfort.
*  Right.
*  What can you do?
*  You can't do anything.
*  There's nothing you can do.
*  I'm sorry your sister has borderline personality disorder.
*  What is that exactly?
*  It's...
*  Is that real?
*  No.
*  And it's people that just go around ruining all the relationships in their life.
*  So it just means you're a piece of shit.
*  Right.
*  Which is fine.
*  And then there's... so they just say it's borderline.
*  Right.
*  Because there's a lot of mental things like that that are just sort of patterns that people
*  fall into.
*  Yeah.
*  Like if you're rude.
*  You can't medicate a pattern.
*  Can you medicate rudeness?
*  Like some people are just rude.
*  They're just not nice.
*  They're not nice to waiters.
*  They don't invent a way... the pharmaceutical industry is such a profitable thing.
*  They will... everything eventually will be a disease.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm more and more convinced that ADHD is not real.
*  I think a lot of kids just have a lot of fucking energy and they're supposed to be doing other
*  stuff.
*  They're not supposed to be sitting at a desk all day.
*  Put them in the military.
*  Yeah.
*  Let them... you know what I mean?
*  Or let them play video games professionally.
*  They seem to sit real fucking still when they're doing that.
*  How come they're fully engaged when they play video games?
*  There are people you meet...
*  I have grown friends in my life that are... you know, I'm 39 and they're in their late
*  30s.
*  And I'm like the best version of you is dying in the Ukraine.
*  You should be a flag on a mantle and we should point to you and go, this... he made the ultimate
*  sacrifice for freedom.
*  And that's the best version of them.
*  And we don't have enough wars.
*  We don't have enough dead people.
*  So...
*  Well, if we had...
*  We're going to change that.
*  We are.
*  If there were more wars, one thing that people would appreciate is the whole concept of America.
*  Like, if we got attacked...
*  Like after 9-11.
*  After 9-11, I don't know where you were, but I was in LA and the fucking... well, you're
*  a lot younger than me.
*  But the flags on people's cars were everywhere in Los Angeles.
*  Right.
*  Which is crazy.
*  It's like everyone was super patriotic.
*  I was in New York.
*  And it felt...
*  You know, people get mad when you say this.
*  It was the best time ever to live in America.
*  Yeah.
*  After 9-11.
*  It was the warmest time you felt...
*  I never felt better about the country.
*  United.
*  We felt united.
*  We were compassionate.
*  We truly loved each other.
*  I think that's how people in Israel feel every day.
*  Really?
*  Yep.
*  Isn't it so... they go through it so much that they're desensitized to it at this point?
*  I had a kickboxing coach, my friend Shuki, and he was from Israel.
*  And he was always telling me...
*  I went over to his house for dinner once, and him and his wife, they're playing the bongos
*  and dancing and shit.
*  Yeah.
*  We had a great time.
*  He goes like this.
*  And he goes, in Israel, you're always...
*  Where are you going to die?
*  So every day is party, party.
*  Right.
*  They might have had a drug problem.
*  I don't think they were...
*  They weren't even drinking.
*  They were just having a good time.
*  They were happy people.
*  But it was like you have an appreciation for life if you live in a war zone.
*  And I think in America, we are so removed from that, that it doesn't seem real to us.
*  Right.
*  We might have an appreciation for life.
*  We're not in a fucking war zone.
*  No.
*  So it's not the only way to have an appreciation for life.
*  Absolutely.
*  I think you can have an appreciation for life in a myriad of ways.
*  But I think one of the downsides of being so relatively safe is that when we talk about
*  war, it's not real.
*  Right.
*  Unless you've been there.
*  Unless you've been there.
*  I have no idea.
*  I have friends that have been there.
*  We talk about conflicts all over the world without the intimate knowledge of how hellish
*  they are and how much pain is associated with someone going and fighting and dying.
*  Or killing people.
*  Or killing people and being scarred.
*  So one of the things that I think people are waking up to now is that we can't be everywhere
*  in every war, fighting everybody, and then just not recognizing that that has consequences.
*  You say that, but if Kamala Harris wins and Liz Cheney takes over the CIA, we might have
*  a chance at putting it all together.
*  What time is it right now?

*  They just called it for Kamala.
*  And I'm excited about it because many of us will be in jail.
*  If you don't get excited right now, many of us will go right to jail.
*  Right.
*  It's like when Deer Leader died and you had to cry for six months.
*  If you didn't cry, they put you in jail.
*  I don't think we should get nuts with the counting.
*  If it feels good, let's just do it.
*  To me, the numbers and the columns and the tabulation kind of is a waste of time.
*  I think we just go with whatever Joy Reid thinks.
*  Whatever they want.
*  Did you see Rachel Maddow calling for Elon Musk contracts to be taken away?
*  I didn't, but that kind of makes sense, I guess, if you're Rachel Maddow, right?
*  But it's the most bananas thing ever.
*  You have literally one of the greatest geniuses in human history, a guy who is simultaneously
*  landing rockets, not just shooting them, but landing them and having them getting
*  caught by robots in the sky.
*  Then you have Tesla, then you have Starlink, then you have the boring company.
*  That guy is simultaneously running all these different fucking things.
*  But I bet Rachel Maddow is pretty bright.
*  But I have to send you this.
*  But they only care about their political opponents, I think.
*  I think that's where we're at now, where it's like somebody might have a great talent,
*  but if they disagree with you, you have to.
*  I'll send it to you, Jamie.
*  You got to see her say it because it's so unhinged.
*  She's like, she used to be reasonable.
*  At one point in time, she was reasonable.
*  Matt Taibbi wrote a book called Hate, Inc.
*  I don't know if you've ever read it.
*  It's a great book.
*  But he basically makes the argument that Rachel Maddow is essentially Bill O'Reilly.
*  Yeah.
*  They're the same person.
*  They are.
*  She was good friends with Roger Ailes.
*  They had dinner all the time.
*  Give me some volume and go full screen.
*  What is that?
*  What do we know?
*  That he endorsed President Trump.
*  That he's a fucking genius?
*  They're very good at making enemies.
*  And then when the enemies they've made treat them poorly, they are shocked.
*  This is what they do.
*  They kind of bully people and they intimidate people and they threaten people.
*  And then when those people then go back at them or try to assert themselves in any way,
*  they're like stunned that that person has autonomy and is acting in their own interest.
*  This is happening over and over again.
*  But this idea is crazy because it's literally one of the most unique talents in terms of
*  engineering.
*  But she doesn't understand that.
*  So that's the thing.
*  She doesn't know that.
*  Right.
*  There's 20 people doing it.
*  That's what's crazy.
*  But SpaceX has done things that have never happened before.
*  These Falcon rockets landing, the catching the rockets, all the plans they have for all
*  these different things, the trips to Mars.
*  No one's doing that.
*  And this idea that you have a different political philosophy or ideology or you support a different
*  And the solution is get rid of the guy who's the most genius inventor perhaps of all time.
*  I recall I was just reading and said it has to do with his supposed conversations with
*  Putin.
*  He had a conversation?
*  Oh no.
*  As of 2022.
*  So did Tucker Carlson take him off Twitter?
*  And here's the other thing.
*  I think that from what I understand and I've read a little bit about this.
*  Elon refused to provide Starlink to the Ukraine because they were going to use it to attack
*  Russia and there was going to be a dramatic escalation in the war.
*  And I think he was trying to avoid that.
*  I think he was trying to avoid a dramatic escalation in that war.
*  So the people that want a dramatic escalation in that war, the people that think that's
*  a good idea, he's an enemy.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking Christ.
*  That's something I think people should be voting on.
*  Imagine if you put it up to vote for people like, hey, do you guys think we should fund
*  Ukraine to the tune of 190 billion and maybe have someone else come along and say, this
*  is an alternative of what we could do with that money.
*  There's no vote on that.
*  There's no vote on a lot of the things that we're told to live with.
*  There's never been a vote on immigration.
*  There's votes for candidates to support it or don't support it.
*  But there's never been a vote on should we secure the southern border would unanimously
*  be voted on and people would unanimously pretty much say absolutely.
*  Well, how about the voter ID laws?
*  Yeah.
*  84% of America think we should have voter ID.
*  Right.
*  I showed my ID today.
*  Jamie, what's the total so far?
*  What's the latest results?
*  We'll know for a few hours.
*  So here's what I will say.
*  We don't know anything?
*  The polls don't close.
*  Can we just be lied to?
*  Early voting in Pennsylvania is down.
*  You could check this out.
*  Early voting in Pennsylvania is down for Democrats.
*  2020 you had 1.6 million registered Democrats vote early.
*  Now you had 821,000.
*  Whereas Republicans, early voters, I think 2020 was like 547,521,000 this time meaning
*  that the Republican early vote in PA, which is the most important state and Michigan and
*  Georgia is around the same as it has been.
*  The Democratic early vote is somewhat depressed.
*  It is not as strong as it's been.
*  Now I don't know if that's a pattern.
*  I don't know if that's in-dict.
*  That just, listen, how many people have kind of quiet quit the Democratic Party?
*  There's tons of people.
*  There's a lot of hidden votes.
*  So there's people that are sick of Trump that are going to vote for her.
*  There's people that are sick of the Democratic Party that are going to vote for him.
*  And then there's probably people that are motivated by Roe, Roe v. Wade.
*  Women potentially might vote some.
*  I think that's the Republicans biggest fuck up.
*  It's a huge fuck up.
*  I think suburban women are certainly a big demographic that swings elections.
*  How about urban women?
*  Urban women, all women.
*  No, women don't want men telling them what the fuck to do with their bodies.
*  That's right.
*  Especially when men can't get pregnant.
*  It's too fucking convenient.
*  Well, wait a minute, psychopath.
*  Hold on.
*  What?
*  Wait a minute.
*  I walked into that.
*  Do you know that they found out that that boxers?
*  Abortion affects men as much as it does women.
*  Of course.
*  Right.
*  Sure.
*  You know, they found out that that boxer that won a gold medal in the Olympics is actually
*  a man.
*  No.
*  That's not shocking.
*  The one that everyone was complaining was a biological male.
*  Like, you piece of shit.
*  They have a medical condition.
*  No.
*  Has a micro penis.
*  Internal testicles.
*  Went through male puberty.
*  Biological male.
*  XY chromosome.
*  Whole deal.
*  Won a gold medal in the women's Olympics in boxing.
*  It's so crazy to me.
*  And I think the biggest problem is the donor class because the donor class of the Democratic
*  Party and like Republican Party, you either have people that are business owners that
*  are donating because of business interests or you have radicals that are donating because
*  they are a radical activist that wants something that the American public thinks is crazy.
*  And biological men competing in women's sports is something most people think is crazy.
*  And 13 year olds getting puberty blocking hormones.
*  11 year old.
*  You know, all that stuff.
*  It's crazy.
*  But they have to just kowtow to this donor base that is maniacal.
*  Maniacal and insane.
*  Yeah.
*  It's all about money, right?
*  It's all about money.
*  And it's the money guys are at least like, at least the billionaires will go, I want
*  to build a casino or I want to do this.
*  I want to do that.
*  I want to pollute a lake.
*  This isn't good.
*  But you know where they're coming from.
*  When you're these radical activists, they're kind of motivated by this ideology that nobody
*  It's a very small group of people.
*  Like if you went to most people and said, do you think an 11 year old should have a gender
*  reassignment surgery or should take hormones to block their puberty?
*  The vast majority of people would say no.
*  No they shouldn't.
*  That's a crazy idea.
*  But the thing is most people will say something different than they actually feel privately
*  because they don't want to be attacked.
*  Right.
*  That's a weird one.
*  The people that will attack you are almost always the people that are pro that shit happening.
*  And those are the nuttiest fucking crazy people.
*  Those are the people that will misrepresent you.
*  And I have a friend who's, you know, they have very young children.
*  They live in Long Island.
*  And they, you know, there's like a, now there's a book being read about gender identity to
*  like five and six year olds.
*  Crazy.
*  And they're, and I'm texting with them and they're going, we're very like liberal people,
*  we're really confused as to why this is happening.
*  Well they don't let activists get into schools.
*  That's right.
*  That's what it is.
*  A lot of these teachers are just activists and a lot of them don't have fucking kids
*  and a lot of them are gay or queer or trans or this or that.
*  Or they're a part of the posse.
*  Well a lot of them are women too.
*  Here's the other thing.
*  A lot of them are women, not to blame women, but it's like most of this stuff isn't being
*  pushed.
*  It's not like it's being pushed because a lot of people go all their groomers or pedophiles.
*  Some of them might be, but a lot of them are just these do-gooder types that want to have
*  metals pinned on them and ribbons pinned on them as to how great they are as people.
*  So they're going, so it's not all these female teachers, they're not all trying to have sex
*  with your kids.
*  They're just trying to get accolades from their peers and they want to talk about what
*  a great person they are.
*  So they're just like falling for anything.
*  And they're out there distributing, you know, whatever it is, books or, you know, telling
*  kids because they want to be a good person.
*  They want to feel like they're a good person.
*  They want to be on the right side.
*  They want to be on the right side of things.
*  That's a good point.
*  And they're just not, you know, I don't think they're, nobody's pushing back in a way, like
*  there's a lot of elitism and condescension that comes from the Democratic Party.
*  The Democratic Party used to be a party of unions, of workers, of workers' rights, and
*  it was a party that people like my grandmother was in for years because she believed that
*  people should be able to have health care, they should be able to have sick leave or
*  they should be able to have maternity care, whatever it is.
*  But then it became a party dominated by kind of corporate elites, very wealthy donors,
*  Wall Street people, finance people, and also very radical fringe elements that are advocating
*  policies that most Americans don't agree with.
*  And then you cobble together that coalition of interest groups.
*  And the only way that works is if you condescend because you can't have these debates because
*  they lose them.
*  They lose the debates.
*  Right.
*  You can't have them.
*  So the way to shut down a debate is to tell people, if you don't agree with me, you're
*  racist, you're homophobic, transphobic, you're an idiot, you're stupid.
*  You're not worthy of having this discussion because they don't want to have the discussion.
*  Because if they wanted to have a debate about health care, that's a debate.
*  People understand that.
*  If they wanted to have a debate about like, debate about early childhood education, people
*  understand that.
*  But the things they're choosing to focus on, like having a wide open southern border, for
*  example, benefits nobody.
*  Right.
*  Truly.
*  Unless you are a billionaire, multimillionaire who wants to hire people and pay them less
*  money.
*  It doesn't really even benefit the people that are coming into the country because they're
*  working for wages that are far less.
*  And it certainly doesn't benefit Americans.
*  But like, they don't want to have that argument.
*  Well, it benefits the people that are coming into the country because they're coming from
*  a place where they have fucking zero.
*  Yeah.
*  So if they work for very little, they're happy, they have 10 people in a house, they're not
*  getting shot at every day.
*  But they're also much more likely to be taken advantage of than somebody who's a citizen.
*  So they're not going to unionize or they're not going to be able to assert themselves
*  at all.
*  Well, that's the argument for offering these people amnesty.
*  But the thing is, you've got to vet them.
*  You've got to figure out who's a fucking criminal.
*  I'm all for letting poor people in that want a better life.
*  But I'm not for illegal workers.
*  I think those people should be paid what Americans are paid.
*  I think there should be a standard on this soil.
*  If you live in this fucking country, you should have a working wage.
*  If you're going to work 40 hours a fucking week, you should be able to live on it.
*  You should have health care.
*  You should have all the things that people deserve.
*  And I think if you think about the amount of fucking money we spend doing other stuff,
*  we could do that for everybody.
*  That could be done.
*  And it would fix a lot of the fucking problems we have with money in this country in the
*  first place.
*  Fucking the amount of influence that pharmaceutical drug companies have on us is bizarre.
*  It doesn't exist anywhere else but here.
*  I spoke to a woman who is from Chicago and she worked for very wealthy Democrat donors
*  in Chicago when Sanders was winning.
*  You know, he had won that primary.
*  And they were very threatened by Sanders.
*  So she was working with all of them and they all went to D.C. and they all met candidates
*  one time they were back in Buttigieg and then they met Biden and they decided even then
*  he was like, they go, he's not with it.
*  This was even then.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And then there was a decision made that the best candidate to play ball, to unite the
*  party and to get rid of Bernie Sanders was Joe Biden.
*  So all of the Democratic power brokers, all these big wealthy families decided to line
*  up and destroy Sanders and elevate Biden.
*  And that's when she said she left politics because she said she was so disillusioned
*  because she thought her job was to help wealthy people make political decisions and helped
*  people get health care or whatever.
*  Right.
*  But then when she realized that the job is actually to get rid of people who want to
*  change the status quo, she became disillusioned.
*  She left politics.
*  But that was her job.
*  When somebody talks like that in the Democratic Party, Bernie Sanders was doing it.
*  They get rid of him.
*  Yeah, 100 percent.
*  Yeah.
*  It's you thought he was interesting.
*  You endorsed him.
*  He said he would be a very interesting candidate.
*  Well, I liked his idea of making things easier for poor people.
*  That's right.
*  I think giving people a path to get out of abject poverty is a good idea.
*  And his idea of taking and funding all these social programs based on a small percentage,
*  a fraction of a penny of all these speculative gambles that the stock market's doing.
*  Maybe that would work.
*  But it was like, and then he came off your podcast and they go, he went on a transphobic
*  podcast.
*  The attacks started immediately.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  No, CNN was the first.
*  Yeah, they called the podcast racist and homophobic and all kinds of different things.
*  I found out about it because I got a text message from a buddy saying, you okay?
*  I'm like, I want.
*  Right.
*  CNN wrote a hit piece on you today.
*  I go, for what?
*  They go, for Bernie Sanders.
*  Like what?
*  So this is that you come out, you endorse a left-wing candidate.
*  By the way, I didn't even endorse him.
*  You said you liked him.
*  I said, I'll probably vote for Bernie.
*  He's anti-corporate.
*  He's from outside of the system.
*  And then immediately you're attacked.
*  They attacked the podcast.
*  And then Kamala Harris, God bless, but this woman is running on a platform of joy.
*  Joy is important.
*  Joy is the policy.
*  The policy is joy.
*  I want to take what she's taking when you're laughing all the time.
*  That sounds like fun.
*  The platform is joy.
*  And there's people right now that can't feed their kids that are immiserated for whatever
*  reason.
*  They're not doing well and they don't have health care.
*  And she goes, be joyful.
*  And our joy is our worry.
*  It's like crazy.
*  It's like fully insane.
*  And I don't understand who that connects with.
*  Well, it's completely manufactured.
*  The whole thing is manufactured by the media and by whoever is running the country.
*  Whoever is running the country, by the way, you're doing a great job considering there's
*  no president.
*  Right.
*  We've had no president for months.
*  That's right.
*  Four months, maybe years.
*  Sure.
*  But Kamala Harris has been campaigning.
*  She has no time to be president.
*  That's right.
*  Somehow or another, they let him wander over to a microphone.
*  And he says wild shit like, I like to take these Republicans and smack them in the ass.
*  And then he puts a MAGA hat on.
*  He's getting fun.
*  By the way, I voted for him today.
*  I still support him.
*  And because he's fun now, he clearly wants Trump to win.
*  He hates her.
*  And he never liked the Obamas.
*  This is well known.
*  Well, Jack Posobik posted on Twitter that there was a physical altercation.
*  Between Jill Biden and someone from Kamala's staff.
*  I don't know if it's true, but it's fun.
*  Well, listen, Jill Biden, we know, is a psychopath.
*  And we know that because she's very supportive.
*  She's encouraged her husband, who should be on a porch, to run for president.
*  It's disgusting.
*  Jill Biden is one of the most...
*  Yeah.
*  I think sometimes he's not...
*  Sure.
*  I think he doesn't do good in the bright lights.
*  But behind closed doors, he's sharp as a tack.
*  She's a woman who claims to be a doctor.
*  She's not a doctor.
*  You know that.
*  Why?
*  Is she a chiropractor?
*  No, no, no.
*  You know, Jill Biden just has a doctorate.
*  She's not a doctor of anything.
*  That's interesting.
*  And she makes people call her Dr. Jill Biden.
*  So already she's mentally unwell.
*  Like Bill Cosby.
*  She's not even like a professor.
*  Like if you're a professor and you have a doctorate, somebody might say Dr. Rogan or
*  whatever.
*  But this idea that she's the first lady, not a medical doctor, not a professor, and still
*  making people call her doctor while she's doing the least doctorly thing ever, which
*  is letting an elderly man be paraded around to try to win the presidency again is crazy.
*  Well, I think she was enjoying the power.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  And I think that ring is very hard.
*  My precious.
*  They don't want to let it go.
*  She's enjoying the power.
*  She's enjoying not going, you know, maybe members of her family not being in jail.
*  That would help that she's enjoying that.
*  Do you think he pardons his son?
*  Because his son just got hit with a bunch of tax evasion charges.
*  I mean, I don't know.
*  I hope Trump pardons him and invites him into the administration.
*  That's the ultimate win.
*  Hunter goes in.
*  I had a chance to have him on the podcast.
*  No, Joe.
*  And he didn't.
*  I fucked up.
*  I thought it was early, early on when he was writing a book.
*  Remember when he wrote a book?
*  I remember.
*  Yeah.
*  They reached out to get press and then the laptop story kind of blew up.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And then I was like, get him on.
*  And then they were like, no, no, we don't.
*  You don't want a pre laptop.
*  You want a post laptop.
*  This was post laptop, but they thought they had squashed it.
*  So this is before Elon had purchased Twitter.
*  Gotcha.
*  Once Elon purchased Twitter and then they understood that there was a coordinated effort
*  by 51 former intelligence agents to say that the laptop was Russian disinformation.
*  That's right.
*  And then the fucking cat's out of the bag and then everybody knows what's going on.
*  Well, this is also the problem of saying that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy
*  when you have literally like credible documented examples of intelligence officials lying to
*  the public and facing zero consequences and trying to manipulate an election.
*  I mean, that's a huge problem.
*  Well, Google's doing that right now.
*  You know, have you ever seen Robert Epstein work, Robert Epstein's work?
*  Robert Epstein has compiled like all of the different Epstein's work.
*  Yeah, different one.
*  Ephemeral interactions with Google, like Google search engine results and what you're
*  what you're shown on your home page of Google News and how it influences people.
*  Right.
*  And how you can sway undecideds like in a significant way.
*  Right.
*  Towards one candidate or the other, depending upon the search results.
*  But one thing that people point out on Twitter today, Jamie, let's see if we could replicate it.
*  Why don't you Google where can I vote for Trump?
*  Now, if you Google where can I vote for Trump?
*  Let's see what it says, because people I'll show you what I saw people posting.
*  It's mostly Harris stuff.
*  Where can I vote for Trump?
*  OK, so here it is.
*  Where can I vote for Harris?
*  By the way, the first article is Esquire.
*  There's only one reason anyone votes for Trump.
*  It's just hilarious.
*  So you don't see this Google.
*  Hold on.
*  Slow down. Slow down.
*  The Google admits Trump Harris search for discrepancy says fix is coming.
*  I don't know what the fuck that means.
*  But look at the bottom.
*  So you Google where to vote for Trump.
*  Scroll down a little bit.
*  Scroll down a little bit more.
*  Where can I Google search?
*  Where can I vote for Harris shows?
*  Right.
*  New conspiracy theories taking root election day.
*  Click on that variety thing.
*  So this is it.
*  Where can I vote?
*  Where can I vote for Harris showed a map while similar Trump search didn't.
*  So you've Googled where can I vote for Trump?
*  It didn't show the map.
*  Now it's Google. Where can I vote for Harris?
*  Let's see what happens.
*  You just you just voted for her vote centers, by the way, that's counted as a vote.
*  You just that's counted as one vote.
*  Let's go back to the top, please, to see whether Google.
*  OK, same thing in the New York Post says fix is coming.
*  Voting for Kamala Harris.
*  Donald Trump will harm people.
*  So it's negative things about Trump where you get negative things about Trump.
*  If you Google where can I vote for Trump?
*  You get negative things about Trump.
*  If you Google where can I vote for Harris?
*  And then right away, it says vote centers.
*  First search result is vote centers after you get past the news.
*  Fascinating. So it's true.
*  So look, so there's you don't see vote centers.
*  You see all these stories.
*  You don't see vote centers right away.
*  When you Google where can I vote for Harris?
*  You see vote centers right away.
*  So it's not a conspiracy theory if you could just reproduce it.
*  Fuckers. Yeah.
*  Well, there's there's there's clearly there's a clearly a slant
*  with with with what, you know, the media.
*  And that's the other thing with a map popped up.
*  I think Trump's, you know, the advantage is also running against the media
*  and the media is terrible.
*  And I think his one of his big advantages has been,
*  you know, he's been able to kind of call them out
*  successfully multiple times.
*  Yeah. And so it's not just he's running against Kamala Harris.
*  He's running against a hostile media that does a terrible job
*  at reporting facts when it comes to him.
*  Well, Donald Trump says wild shit and some of it's
*  a lot of it stands on its own is wild and crazy.
*  Yeah. But when they manipulate it, you know, Piers Morgan the other night
*  when he goes, there'll be a bloodbath in the auto industry if I'm not elected.
*  And then they just say, oh, there's Trump.
*  If he's not elected, there's going to be a bloodbath.
*  One of the reasons why I was willing to endorse him was watching Obama
*  repeat the lie that he said that white supremacists,
*  that there's very fine people on both sides. Right. Yeah.
*  That's a terrible lie.
*  He literally says, I'm not talking about white supremacists in the KKK.
*  Those people should be condemned. That's right.
*  That's what he says. Yeah.
*  Well, and that's what he's talking about was the people that were coming to protest
*  the fact that a statue is being taken.
*  What's interesting about Trump was that what it was, he was the first guy.
*  Yes, he was the first guy in Palm Beach.
*  Whatever you think of Trump, there's reasons to not like him.
*  There's very legitimate reasons not to like him.
*  But he was the first guy in Palm Beach that opened Mar-a-Lago to Jewish people,
*  to gay people, to people of color.
*  People were allowed.
*  There was all these country clubs in Palm Beach that prevented those people.
*  And now, obviously, people go, well, he just did that for money.
*  And it's like, sure, fine, whatever.
*  But like he was the guy who did it. Right.
*  He was short of members. Yeah.
*  They did it for money. Yeah.
*  He opened the door.
*  And, you know, so to me, it's like
*  his one of the his biggest advantages has always been
*  that the press cannot help themselves when it comes to him.
*  They are rage addicts and they like hating him.
*  And he feeds them and they get more popular and they get bigger
*  when he is around.
*  Well, when he lost the election, CNN dropped 40 percent.
*  That's right. So right away, they're addicted to being in a,
*  you know, hostile, contentious relationship with him.
*  And they misrepresent a lot of what he says.
*  Just flat out lies.
*  And that's a huge problem.
*  And they can't help themselves if they got out of the way.
*  It would hurt him because like any politician,
*  then you're just going to be dealing with other politicians
*  or your supporters or your detractors or whoever.
*  But you have this media that's lying about you
*  and you can constantly call it out. It helps him.
*  I think the cat's out of the bag, though, with the media.
*  I don't know. It's over. It's over. It's big time.
*  I mean, the the video that I did with Trump is well over 100 million views.
*  Yeah. Between Twitter and YouTube and Spotify, well over 100 million.
*  The one I did with Elon just yesterday was this morning.
*  It had 65 million views just on Twitter.
*  I don't want to upstage you.
*  The video that I did with JD Vance got three billion views.
*  It got three billion views. Nice.
*  So I don't want to upset you.
*  But no, I mean, do you do you think?
*  It's going because I mean, you talked about this.
*  I think it will be decided tonight, but you think maybe not.
*  No, not if it's close. Interesting.
*  I think that's when shenanigans take place.
*  Shenanigans, if shenanigans are real.
*  OK, is the really there's manipulation.
*  Manipulation will take place at four o'clock in the morning.
*  Interesting. Don't you think?
*  Well, don't you think that's when ballots show up?
*  I mean, if you're going to cheat.
*  Here's the deal. My grandmother, my grandmother died in 2017.
*  She was a big Democrat.
*  She'd been voting lately and she voted six times for Kamala Harris.
*  And if you think that's wrong, that's disgusting.
*  I don't know what to tell you.
*  That's who she would have voted for.
*  She probably would have. Yeah.
*  And her honor. Yeah.
*  In her honor. I don't know how much fucker is going on down at the ballot box.
*  Probably some for sure.
*  So my friend who's actually outside, but I'm not going to say his name.
*  I don't want to hurt him.
*  Andrew Vickers is a Boston comedian.
*  Someone sent him a thing where
*  there were like duplicate ballots in Georgia in 2020, like weird stuff.
*  Oh, this weird stuff. Like really weird.
*  Now, I was a guy who was like, I bought the idea that I was like Trump lost
*  and people wanted Biden and whatever.
*  And maybe that is a kid. I don't know.
*  But like, there's there seems to be more evidence
*  of fuckery than
*  I was willing to.
*  But that doesn't mean it's there's probably fuckery in every election.
*  There's not zero. There's not zero. Right.
*  So in every election, there's something.
*  When I asked Trump, like, do you say you lost the 2020 election?
*  Can you prove it?
*  So you show tell me I gave right.
*  I gave him all the room.
*  I would have given him an hour. Yeah. Like, tell me. Yeah.
*  He's like, there's plenty of information.
*  They wrote a book. It's coming out like, OK, put it out.
*  I have digestible form.
*  You've had four years.
*  Maybe it's out and I don't know.
*  I haven't seen it. No one sent my way.
*  I'm willing to believe and not willing to believe.
*  We know that the tech companies and the Intel agencies
*  all coordinated to suppress certain stories and like they all admitted that.
*  No question.
*  You know, I haven't seen the direct evidence of that selection interference.
*  That is hugely election interference.
*  I haven't said that would have affected millions of people's decisions.
*  Yeah. Well, then that's a huge problem.
*  That's a giant problem.
*  You have 300 million people.
*  The elections in the counties where Biden won was by like how many votes total?
*  I think it was like eighty three thousand in P.A.
*  It was very easy. That's crazy.
*  It was crazy.
*  And if you imagine if eighty three of those thousand people,
*  if just half of them got a hold of that laptop story.
*  Yeah. And listen, I think a huge problem is
*  that the intelligence agencies are completely unaccountable.
*  Yeah. Meaning that there's been no accountability at all for anyone who
*  suppressed the laptop story.
*  I mean, where is this Kim Cheadle woman who is the head of the Secret Service?
*  The craziest thing in the world.
*  The slope roof lady, the slope roof.
*  I've taken gravity bung hits on acid on roofs that have more of a pitch than that.
*  And I didn't fall off.
*  I'm not exactly a Navy SEAL.
*  And I was able to do it.
*  They had snipers on a similar roof that had more of a pitch.
*  The whole thing is as shady as humanly possible.
*  He was cremated. The house was eleven days.
*  The house was professionally scrubbed, professionally scrubbed.
*  And then nobody talks about it.
*  Well, did you see the cell phone data that shows that someone was meeting up with him
*  and meeting up with them or close to close to the FBI offices,
*  was meeting up with them on a regular basis?
*  Where is this woman?
*  He's in a Black Rock commercial.
*  The whole thing is weird.
*  And then beyond, it's beyond strange.
*  It's Lee Harvey Oswell, 2024.
*  It's fucking crazy.
*  He has no digital footprint.
*  Crazy.
*  There's not one part.
*  There's very few people that age that have no digital footprint.
*  Right.
*  And then if you talk about any of this or you say anything,
*  people write it off as sort of a QAnon, whatever.
*  But it isn't. It's valid, legit.
*  And people, normies, people that don't think like this are even going,
*  that was fucking weird.
*  It's just weird that they never had a press conference.
*  They never had a toxicology exam that was released.
*  Yeah.
*  Someone wants to shoot the president.
*  Wouldn't you assume that person's out of their fucking mind?
*  Maybe they're on meth.
*  Maybe we can find some sort of a reason while we feel a little bit better.
*  And then the next guy was a guy who, like the three stooges,
*  a barrel of a gun is going through the bushes on a golf course.
*  Like something out of the Marx Brothers.
*  And that guy was a guy that like CNN or MSI, I forget which one,
*  had been speaking to about like the Ukraine.
*  He wrote like a song about the Ukraine and how important it was to support the Ukraine.
*  And he's being like interviewed by the news, like a cable news.
*  And they had a relationship with him.
*  And imagine if Fox News had a relationship with somebody who tried to assassinate
*  Obama, Biden, Harris.
*  Right.
*  That never, you would have never heard the end of it.
*  Right.
*  Most people hearing this, maybe you're hearing this for the first time,
*  but like he was, this was like a source or this guy that they kind of profiled.
*  And you know, it came out that he was, and then his kid got busted for child porn.
*  Wild.
*  Just like Stephen Paddock's brother.
*  Yes.
*  That's what's wild.
*  I'm just saying.
*  Hey, how much do you know about the Vegas thing?
*  Is it true that there's three women that were checked into the room with him?
*  I was reading this thing the other day about how there's three unaccounted for women that
*  apparently checked into the room with him.
*  Interesting.
*  I don't know that, but.
*  What's that, Jamie?
*  I've never heard that.
*  You never heard that?
*  I've researched a lot.
*  I mean, there is cell phones, I think, that were found that were unaccounted for.
*  He had a girlfriend that wasn't there that I think he sent to the Philippines or something
*  like that, but.
*  That's right.
*  Mary Lou Danly was a girlfriend who went to the Philippines.
*  Jamie's controlled opposition.
*  He is.
*  You know, you can't really.
*  He's a Reddit mod.
*  I mean, he's a guy.
*  He does it.
*  Who knows where he's getting text from Netanyahu.
*  The Comma Harris on speed dial.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  It feels it's an interesting day because everybody has a weird tension.
*  Yeah, not here.
*  People are friendly here.
*  But I was just in a car accident.
*  Everyone was friendly.
*  And the cops were everyone's kind of friendly.
*  But did anybody recognize you?
*  No.
*  Did you wear the glasses?
*  Yeah, it was a nice Mexican guy.
*  And it was like nobody.
*  My friend, you from the team Dylan show?
*  Yeah, no, it was it was all very nice.
*  And it was that and that's the thing about car accidents.
*  It can be nice.
*  And it wasn't my car was, you know, it was kind of a rental.
*  And it was just kind of nice to meet people and be out.
*  But, you know, it is a weird there is an interesting.
*  I think people just want this to be over 100 percent.
*  They need to move on.
*  Yeah, it would be nice no matter who wins if we could all.
*  Just take a breath.
*  Let's imagine she wins.
*  And one of the things that she has been very good about
*  during the whole campaign is changing her opinions.
*  That's right.
*  On what people think.
*  Well, we can if we can influence the president based on popular opinion.
*  Isn't that a good thing?
*  Joe, I'm great at lying.
*  Get ready. I hate ice cream.
*  Like what she's been able to do, which I respect,
*  is look at the American people in line with them.
*  And that's good.
*  Or at least adjust her opinion.
*  She's adjusting.
*  Let's like be, you know, I agree.
*  Listen, I'm for it.
*  I'm charitable with her.
*  I'm very charitable.
*  I don't think she's like the worst.
*  I like her. I think she's fun.
*  I think she'd be fun to sit and have a drink with.
*  I was really hoping I was going to get to talk to her.
*  I was wishing that you would, too.
*  I mean, it's just the options were fly to her and meet for 45 minutes.
*  And I was like, that's not what you do.
*  It's you know, Elon said it best yesterday.
*  He goes, you really find out about people in our two and three.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  You could bullshit people for 45 minutes, an hour, two or three.
*  Something's going to come up.
*  Well, the great thing about your show is that it's not scripted talking points
*  where people don't come on with an agenda and go, here, I want to say this.
*  And the other thing, you sit there for hours, you talk to them,
*  you have a real conversation.
*  And what they really think will come out.
*  And but here's the thing.
*  I'm going to be nice to you.
*  I'm going to be nice to Kamala Harris.
*  I would be so friendly to her.
*  I wouldn't try to gotcha bullshit.
*  I'm not interested in doing that.
*  I genuinely wanted to know who she is as a person.
*  Sure. Let's go shoot.
*  I'll take her to the range.
*  If she was on this show getting high,
*  smoking weed and then waving a gun around.
*  Well, she didn't have to wave the gun.
*  Then I vote.
*  That's, you know, that's bad gun handling.
*  Of course. But I understand.
*  Gun safety is important. Don't point guns.
*  Sure. But it's fun.
*  Even when I unloaded Tim Dillon.
*  Yeah, but it's fun.
*  It would be fun. But here's the thing.
*  If she did come on and just had a little cocktail.
*  Yeah.
*  Her and I have a couple of whiskeys, talk a little shit.
*  I bet she's fun.
*  She's not much older than me.
*  Yeah. No, she's probably fun.
*  She probably is surprised.
*  But when she was younger.
*  Yeah, I'm sure she's listen, attractive lady.
*  She's probably surprised that she's running for president
*  because they told her, you know, she probably wanted to.
*  There's there's reports that she was like, you're not going to pass me over
*  because they wanted to.
*  She said, yeah, they didn't want her.
*  And she really have that kind of say, though.
*  Yes, because she because she would have thrown a fit and said they they they
*  overlooked a woman of color or had a press conference.
*  Yes.
*  Exposed a lot of shit about how the machine works.
*  Whatever she could have done.
*  They didn't want to deal with that.
*  And she's been a careerist her whole life and she wanted the job.
*  And what I heard was that Joe Biden kind of forced her in.
*  No way. What I heard was that they were going to have a primary,
*  but the Joe Biden said that he endorsed her.
*  He endorsed her.
*  And then it was this weird situation where they got to kind of like run her.
*  Interesting. By the way, I'm hearing this.
*  We're all hearing it from random ways.
*  We're all hearing it.
*  I think she's she's a very motivated strategic person.
*  Is there any evidence of that, Jamie?
*  Find out how Joe Biden endorsed her and whether or not I think he was made
*  to endorse her, you know, he doesn't.
*  I'll check that. But there is three women supposedly with.
*  Oh, oh, good. I just checked this in.
*  Oh, there was. Yes, sir.
*  Stephen Paddock's hotel records show.
*  Oh, you control the opposition.
*  And it's a fucking fact check by community notes.
*  Six years old.
*  Well, still the whole story. Six years old.
*  Stephen Paddock's hotel records show three women registered in his room.
*  Interesting. But they could have been hoes.
*  Yeah, probably.
*  This guy was a crazy riverboat gambler.
*  Do you register a hooker to the room?
*  Fuck yeah. If you're really man, if you're wild, man, you give them a card,
*  especially if you don't want those ladies stealing your role.
*  That's a good point. You got to trust and show them trust.
*  Ask Hans Kim. That's wild.
*  Oh, really? Somebody took his Rolex.
*  Well, you know, you got to be lady and she she drugged him.
*  He was probably showing in the Rolex.
*  He probably was that dumbass.
*  Yeah, show the Rolex. It's probably not.
*  This is my dick. Right.
*  Hans is probably not so slick.
*  It's it's a but if you wanted to make sure they weren't stealing from you,
*  you like you have to have ID to get in.
*  You have to have ID to get into the room.
*  That would be like, yeah, because this guy's a riverboat gambler.
*  This guy's a wild dude, right?
*  He was a professional gambler, professional gamblers.
*  I think hookers and professional gamblers.
*  Yeah, they just fucking.
*  And also he had no track record.
*  That's the other thing that Paddock was interesting.
*  He just kind of is that he's emerged.
*  Right. That's interesting about these people.
*  He might have been a gambler,
*  but they gave him credit for being like a video poker.
*  That's where he made all this money.
*  If you ask people that are really into gambling,
*  like no one makes a lot of money video poker gambling. Really?
*  Well, there's all kinds of reports about that, that it was some weird Saudi coup
*  that they locked down the country in the days after.
*  I don't really know enough about it, but it was a very strange thing
*  that just doesn't make any sense.
*  Has never been fully.
*  I mean, he's just shooting at a concert like what?
*  Supposedly he lost his mind and then he just wanted to kill everybody.
*  And here's the thing, though, that's real, too.
*  That's real, too. That's real, too.
*  And if you really wanted to make a splash
*  and you knew you're going to kill yourself and you are some fucking psycho
*  and you just wanted to gun down a bunch of people, bang.
*  Let's see what's next.
*  You know, it's one of those things where it disappears.
*  And then the thing about all of this is the news moves so quickly.
*  And so much is going on.
*  You can't.
*  It gets hazy.
*  The recollection of it, like the Trump shooting even the relection,
*  the recollection will get hazy in a few months from now.
*  Forget a few years.
*  Even in a few months, the idea of it being a slope roof, people don't remember.
*  Right. People just remember a guy climbed on a roof.
*  They don't remember. It was 120 yards away.
*  The Secret Service didn't clear the roof.
*  He was walking around.
*  People were telling them there's a guy walking around. He's creepy.
*  He flew a drone over the area.
*  He had a rangefinder.
*  Yeah. All of those details that are very important.
*  But the rangefinder is nuts.
*  Like anybody with a rangefinder should be arrested. Right.
*  If you have a rangefinder and you're walking around an area
*  with the president or a president candidate is going to be, you should be arrested.
*  Yeah. Someone should find out what you're doing, what you're up to.
*  And didn't you have explosives in the car? Yeah.
*  He had explosives and they're sophisticated with radio controlled devices.
*  He had remote controlled explosives.
*  Like, how is he getting that? He's 20 years old.
*  Yeah. Like what what where you what Google search do you have?
*  Like where are you ordering these things?
*  How are you putting them together? Yeah.
*  Someone manufactured for you.
*  Who would you buy it from?
*  Where's the investigation?
*  Nothing, nothing.
*  There's one thing where his father is leaving a Costco.
*  There's one like video, Jamie, maybe you could pull it up,
*  where there's like one reporter and his dad
*  and someone in like a mask are leaving a Costco or BJs or something like that.
*  And he's like, no comment.
*  And he just gets into his car.
*  That's kind of the only time I've ever seen.
*  The parent.
*  This is the only I think they released a statement like we're terribly blah, blah, blah.
*  It's also interesting. It's like some people.
*  Here it is. This is the dad.
*  Well, this is Trump's dad blows off questions.
*  Well, I got a piece, but he's there's another one where he's leaving a Costco.
*  Let me hear him talking.
*  I was trying to find out that was the correct video.
*  Yeah, that's him talking. Let's hear what he says.
*  There any statement you'd be willing to share with us right now, Mr.
*  Crooks?
*  I got a piece, I got a piece, says Forrest Gump quote.
*  The interesting.
*  Yeah. I mean, that guy's a little casual for the fact that his son just tried to kill
*  the fucking president. He was at Costco.
*  Well, the week after the he was he looked very calm leaving Costco
*  and he has a full cart of food leaving cut.
*  Like it's insane.
*  Well, not only not imagine your son is forget about the fact they tried to kill Trump.
*  He did kill someone and he shot killed two other people.
*  He killed a guy who was trying to shield his wife.
*  Look, can you stop this for a minute?
*  Who is getting that much food two weeks after your son tried to kill the president?
*  Well, look at the size of that fellow.
*  He has a lot of food.
*  I get it. But he has a full cart.
*  And by the way, he can't get anyone to go to Costco for him.
*  He's walking around buying mini taquitos.
*  We probably doesn't have any money.
*  I mean, he's not a wealthy guy.
*  Right. I mean, you got to have a friend that go to Costco for you.
*  That's pretty nice car. What is that?
*  You got to have a friend that will go to Costco.
*  This guy's got a full cart.
*  What is that car? That looks like a pretty nice car.
*  This is just a weird to me.
*  It's an interesting like right after your son does this, you're at Costco buying the store
*  with the Unabomber.
*  Yeah, with someone with some fed in a mask with sunglasses on.
*  The CIA goes, we'll take you to Costco.
*  Keep your mouth shut.
*  Yeah. Look at this guy with the glasses.
*  Who's this? The hat, the hood.
*  Who's this? He's got gloves on, dude.
*  He's got gloves on, so he doesn't leave fingerprints.
*  It's crazy. The guy has gloves on.
*  It's insane. What does he have gloves on for?
*  It's not cold out. Don't show me this guy dying.
*  Jamie, can you please stop with your algorithm?
*  Jamie, enough.
*  Jamie was he was raised on LiveLeak.
*  He was. Remember that?
*  Yes, he was raised on beheading videos on LiveLeak.
*  That was back before Instagram.
*  Yeah. Now, good old days.
*  I've seen more people murdered over the last three years on Instagram
*  than I have my entire life of people, psychos sending me things.
*  It's crazy.
*  Did you see that video where the kid jumps off the cruise ship
*  and the shark gets them?
*  It's tough out there.
*  But you can't do dumb shit.
*  Sometimes you do the summer between high school and college.
*  We all know one person who did a really dumb thing, and that was it.
*  Yeah. And sometimes you're that guy.
*  Nobody wants to be that guy, but sometimes you're that cautionary tale.
*  You know, and that kid will be immortalized every time
*  someone someone will go out to dinner or something.
*  They'll go. When I was 18, we took a cruise for our high school graduation
*  and a kid jumped off the boat and a tiger shark got him.
*  That was it. Jesus Christ.
*  What a way to go.
*  And people will talk about that and tell their kids that.
*  And it's a terrible thing.
*  In a moment, you hit the water, you fucking feel those teeth on your rib cage.
*  Well, I think he's treading for a minute.
*  And then you just see him kind of go under and they don't know what it is,
*  but it's probably a shark.
*  And he voted for Kamala.
*  So if you're.
*  Telling me he's not even racist.
*  Well, Oprah, last night I'm watching a rally and I'm watching Oprah's after
*  and she was if you cast, if you don't cast about for Kamala,
*  you may never be able to cast a ballot again, which seems extreme.
*  That's so crazy.
*  Can you get up the rally?
*  I want you to watch this. Will.
*  I am is on the rally and he's doing this crazy Kamala rap.
*  And then there are these two white kids like college kids,
*  like awkwardly dancing to this music.
*  And then there's Doug Emhoff and then Tim Walsh.
*  And I'm like, these are the whitest people.
*  Kamala's just surrounded by this circle of like white nerds and weird people.
*  And they're all like kind of trying to dance.
*  And it's like a really sad words.
*  Michelle Obama is just a much better speaker like Michelle Obama.
*  And she run. I don't know why.
*  She would have won. She is in a landslide.
*  When you watch her talk, you go, she's political talent.
*  It's raw. It's amazing.
*  I can deliver. She can deliver.
*  She didn't want to.
*  She went with it through her husband.
*  Yeah. Fuck doing that.
*  I think she's like, fuck this.
*  It's a shitty job.
*  Not only that, you don't make as much money as you do being an ex president.
*  Yeah, I think if Trump didn't have the rallies, he might not want to even do it
*  because it probably sucks once you're in there.
*  But it's probably fun to be able to go on the road.
*  Like he goes on the road like a comedian. Right.
*  And he's able to kind of, you know, I bet once you get in there and you realize,
*  oh, this is how it all works and this is how many deals everybody has that are
*  preexisting. And if I touch this, this happens.
*  If I touch that, that happens.
*  I bet it's probably not that fun.
*  Well, I bet it's probably fun.
*  Well, first of all, Trump is almost 80 years old, right?
*  He's been famous most of his life.
*  Yeah, most of his adult life.
*  And at this point in time, you know, he's not on The Apprentice anymore.
*  How does he get his jollies? Right.
*  You got to that. He's performing when he goes out and he does those.
*  He kills, kills his bits.
*  He kills. People love it. Yeah. Yeah.
*  He's this funny shit man.
*  And here's the thing in Andrew Sullivan, who's a writer from the UK,
*  who's again not even he's a he's a he's voting for Kamala.
*  But he lives in America.
*  But he said the thing about Trump is like you can't say the rallies are not
*  democratic. They're the most democratic thing.
*  It might be he goes, it's America in its foulest glory.
*  Like, like, listen, it might be crass and it might be certain parts of it
*  might feel, you know, what a vulgar or whatever.
*  But it is democratic to have people come out to speak directly to them
*  and then have them vote for you. That is in essence, democratic.
*  Well, you have the same thing on both sides.
*  You have low information, tribal voters. Right.
*  You have low information, tribal voters on the left who really do think Trump said
*  there's very fine people on both sides and really do believe in the Russia hoax.
*  Really do believe in all that stuff.
*  And then you have people on the other side that are like ready to fucking shoot
*  liberals. That's right. And they have their their signs, their Trump signs
*  electrocuted in their front yard to make sure people don't steal them.
*  And there's people that are off the rails, tribally.
*  When you have a group and this is what I try to.
*  If you make a group and anybody could join that group,
*  it's going to be infiltrated by idiots, right, 100 percent of the time.
*  And then those people are going to do radical things in the name of your group.
*  And then you have the Proud Boys. Yes. And then you have the extremes.
*  You have people that that that just drift towards the extremes.
*  And the whole premise of political life in America
*  should be to keep people from drifting to those crazy extremes.
*  One hundred percent. And the more you meet people in the middle,
*  the less they're going to do that.
*  The more you're reasonable instead of attacking people in this fucking crazy way
*  where we know it's not true.
*  I can't like I used to think Obama was the best president ever because Obama,
*  I think still to this day, the best statesman,
*  he was the best example that you could take this guy who is from a single family.
*  It's not like he didn't go a single mom.
*  He didn't grow up with great privilege.
*  Obviously a brilliant guy, obviously very smart, great orator.
*  And hey, we elected a black president.
*  Maybe racial tensions can relax a little bit in this country.
*  I realize anybody could rise based on the merit of what they can do
*  and who they are and what they stand for.
*  I was like, he's the best. Right.
*  Finally, I felt really good about America when Obama was the president.
*  Obviously, I wasn't paying attention to politics back then,
*  because I didn't understand about he was one of the worst presidents ever
*  in terms of going after whistleblowers.
*  Like that was a part of the hope and change website
*  was that they were going to provide safety to whistleblowers.
*  That's not the case at all. It was one of the worst.
*  No, Obama was an extension in many ways of the national security
*  policies of George W.
*  Bush, which was a, you know,
*  kind of zero tolerance policy for whistleblowers.
*  And it was a, you know, the government has proprietary information.
*  And, you know, if there's two things that were passed during his administration
*  that should terrify people, one of them, I think NDAA was passed
*  during his administration.
*  And the other one was the CIA's ability to use propaganda,
*  that the intelligence agencies are now legally allowed to lie
*  and use propaganda and fake stories in the interest of national security.
*  Yeah. The problem really is.
*  You're taking on when you take on this
*  behemoth, this thing that we've built.
*  Yeah, it's very difficult to make inroads.
*  And I wish Trump luck.
*  I wish anyone luck that is trying to take this
*  blob on this also unruly, unelected, unaccountable.
*  You don't know how to do the job.
*  You've never done it before.
*  And they don't tell you how to do the job until you get in there.
*  No one explains to you what the fuck really goes on
*  until you're behind the closed doors.
*  Yeah. That's why you got a guy like Putin.
*  He knows how to run Russia.
*  He's been running Russia for 25 fucking years.
*  Yeah. This guy knows how to do that job.
*  He's really good at it. Like, he's very good.
*  If you take a comic on the road with you and he's got to do an arena,
*  he's only been doing comedy for 10 months.
*  Like, hey, buddy. Well, Putin's job is to just mediate conflicts between oligarchs,
*  which is what he does very well.
*  And I think that's that's what people misunderstand about Russia.
*  I've read a lot about Russia and poison rivals.
*  He's really good. He's got well, who?
*  You know, people get sick, Joe.
*  They do. I was so mad they all got Russian money.
*  They gave Tim Pool and all these people Russian money.
*  I've been defending Russia for free for two years on my show.
*  Not a dollar.
*  How did they get that money?
*  What is the actual story behind the Russian money?
*  I don't know. But it was it was it was a front group that was, I guess,
*  Russia was giving this group money and they were sponsoring
*  these media entities that were I don't think they even knew.
*  I don't think the people knew. Right.
*  That they were getting Russian money.
*  But some of them might have been able to sniff it out.
*  I don't really know. Here's my question.
*  Yeah. Isn't that a way that they could compromise you without compromising you?
*  Sure. Just say you're connected to Russian money.
*  It doesn't matter what your opinion is.
*  Like, say if your opinion is counter to the narrative, but they sponsor you.
*  Yeah. And they give you the money and then it leaks.
*  Thousand percent. That could have been it.
*  It could have also been Russia doing it.
*  It could have been us doing that.
*  They could have killed Navalny.
*  We could have killed Navalny.
*  There was no reason for them to kill Navalny.
*  He was in a Siberian prison.
*  We had a very but he was an enemy of Putin. Right.
*  Would you be in a more logical that Navalny just want to get him back?
*  No, because Navalny was never widely popular in Russia.
*  This is a lie.
*  Navalny was an anti a very, you know, kind of, you know, anti-Jewish,
*  like kind of really right wing character.
*  And a lot of his early writings were about that.
*  Then he took a trip to Germany.
*  And then he came back incredibly progressive and very enlightened.
*  Talk about Western values. Really?
*  So he met someone somewhere that said, actually, this is better.
*  And he came and said, OK, they're like tamp down the juice stuff.
*  So then he goes back to Russia.
*  You know, it does all the things he makes these documentaries
*  that all the Putin's oligarch friends have big houses.
*  Can you imagine that people that are working with the government
*  get really rich and have big houses? This is crazy.
*  This is only in Russia.
*  So Navalny does this whole thing and he shows all the corruption in Russia.
*  And then our good government people go, look how corrupt Russia is.
*  Putin's cronies get all these big houses.
*  And Americans go, oh, my God, so corrupt over there.
*  And then, you know, listen, they try to poison him.
*  I'm not defending you saying Putin's a great guy.
*  But this idea that, you know,
*  we like to look at other places and identify things
*  that we are also doing here.
*  Well, that was one of the things that Trump said that people get very upset about.
*  Remember that? We kill people here, too.
*  So I don't want to live in Russia.
*  I don't think Russia is a better place to live.
*  And I think that the childish admiration for Putin amongst some people on the right
*  is a little silly because they wouldn't want to live there either.
*  And they wouldn't do it.
*  It wouldn't be good to do a podcast in Russia.
*  That being said, why are we spending billions and billions of dollars
*  to try to drain the Russian military over a land border with the Ukraine?
*  We have zero.
*  And the reason is BlackRock and all these companies are being
*  promised a lot of land in the Ukraine.
*  They're being promised all, you know, Ukraine's a breadbasket of Europe.
*  There's tons of agricultural land.
*  A lot of it has a ton of there's minerals. Yeah.
*  Lindsey Graham.
*  I mean, Jamie probably has that that quote where Lindsey Graham
*  literally said the quiet part out loud where he said they've got all these minerals.
*  We can't let Putin get that money.
*  Says Lindsey Graham, we can't let Putin get that money.
*  And he says it is my favorite.
*  And he says it and he's saying it out loud.
*  And so a lot of people are just like, listen.
*  And the Navalny thing happened when we had a bill
*  that was I think it was a 60 billion dollar bill
*  for the Russian-Ukraine war that wasn't incredibly popular.
*  People were getting sick of it.
*  And then when Navalny died, again, I don't know who did it.
*  But when he died, there was a renewed you see, look how bad
*  don't you see why we need this money?
*  Look how terrible this person is.
*  So it would have been a weird time for Putin to kill him.
*  It wouldn't have made any sense. Right.
*  Putin's aware that we have a bill on deck.
*  There's something crazy about Putin killing him exactly at that time.
*  Let me hear Lindsey Graham talk.
*  Let me hear him talk.
*  Ukraine, I am for Ukraine support.
*  We can't pull the plug on Ukraine.
*  Let Putin get away with this.
*  We need to be all in with the goal of allowing Ukraine to evict the Russians.
*  Pause for a second. Pause for a second.
*  Tell me you couldn't picture that guy with a ball gag and like a leather type bikini on.
*  That's the least of what he has.
*  But Jamie, there's another thing where he literally talks about the minerals,
*  the rare earth minerals that are in the Ukraine, which is the entire reason.
*  It's like I put it on my Instagram.
*  It's like it's one of the craziest things I've ever seen.
*  Yeah, this one right here.
*  Ukraine sits on, go back up to the top where it's at.
*  They're sitting on trillion dollars.
*  There it is.
*  It could be good to our economy.
*  So I want to keep helping our friends in Ukraine.
*  They're sitting on 10 to 12 trillion dollars of critical minerals in Ukraine.
*  They could be the richest country in all of Europe.
*  I don't want to give that money and those assets to Putin to share with China.
*  If we help Ukraine now, they can become the best business partner we ever dreamed of.
*  There we go. Pause.
*  How crazy is that guy?
*  And how crazy is his job?
*  Yeah.
*  International fuckery.
*  Yeah.
*  Money and minerals.
*  I would imagine something I should have been is he's a kind of a closeted gay super villain,
*  which seems like a fun thing to be.
*  Why would we let Putin get that money?
*  Is he supposed to be married?
*  Isn't he married?
*  Find out.
*  But I mean, it's a fun thing.
*  And there's something funny about like a feminine male warmonger.
*  Super villain, which is great.
*  Let Putin get that money.
*  That'd be the best business partners we've ever had.
*  Trillions and trillions of dollars in minerals.
*  I love pussy.
*  Yeah, it's the best.
*  Trillions of minerals in that Ukraine's wet pussy.
*  Ukrainian pussy, something.
*  It's crazy.
*  But then you think about it and there's all these young Ukrainian men and Russian men who
*  are dying in this war because we've consistently told them not to make peace.
*  And that's the dark part of it.
*  He's never been married, has no children.
*  Interesting.
*  Oh, interesting.
*  He was close friends with John McCain.
*  What's that supposed to mean?
*  Well, why throw him a cane under the bus?
*  He's dead. He can't defend himself.
*  Lindsey Graham is a fun gay super villain.
*  And you need that.
*  You need it because.
*  And it just made his way up the ladder.
*  He just made his way up the ladder.
*  Like those guys are just like different kinds of people.
*  And I think that's what most normal people who live normal lives have a hard time
*  understanding, because if you are a guy who works at a fucking auto repair shop,
*  you have no relationships at all with people like Lindsey Graham.
*  You don't even think they exist.
*  You know, it's like, you know what it's like when.
*  Well, let me tell you, you don't have kids.
*  But if when you have kids, one thing that happens is you you go to these things
*  where you have to hang out with parents.
*  And the only things that you and the parents have in common is that you both have kids.
*  And so you have these fucking agonizing conversations.
*  And then you realize, oh, these people don't know any fun people.
*  They don't have anyone in their life that lives a fun life.
*  And they start asking questions like, how do you come up with your jokes?
*  Like when you how do you make your podcast? Who are you talking to?
*  How do you get these people to come on?
*  Like, what do you do? How do you get into the UFC?
*  Like all that stupid shit.
*  But it's like they don't know anybody who's living a weird life. Right.
*  We don't know anybody who's living that weird life, that weird Lindsey Graham
*  life where you're all huddled up together wearing fucking suits and ties.
*  And you're in these like these halls of justice.
*  These important you're in the Senate room.
*  You're in this room where everybody stands up and claps
*  when the president says the most mundane shit.
*  Well, it's also that political that that that political the survival instinct.
*  It seems like somebody has, you know, decades of being in that position.
*  I'm thinking about running. Oh, it's a lot of fun.
*  We think there's a better congressperson.
*  That probably can't. You got to go governor. Governor.
*  Executive. What state? Let me get up fucked up.
*  Is this where we live in it? No, I would never run against Abbott.
*  I love that guy. How about right then and there?
*  You can't. You're not cut out for it.
*  Yeah, I got to move. Not cut out.
*  Now I am. I am. I'll do it a different way.
*  I got to move somewhere. Utah, Utah.
*  You could become a city.
*  I'll become a Mormon. And I would have a lot of fun.
*  I think about it because I like D.C.
*  and I think it might be fun for a few weeks to be like a press secretary.
*  That would be great.
*  I bet those people party.
*  They of course they party. I bet they party hard.
*  They party in ways that are probably too hard.
*  You know, did I tell you the one night where I went out?
*  I think there's documentaries about how hard they party.
*  Did I tell you one night that I went out with Dave Chappelle in Denver?
*  Did I ever tell you this story?
*  Yeah, it was like it was like the wildest thing ever.
*  Well, it's like he knew these after hours places.
*  Yeah, it was like a scene in John Wick. Right.
*  We went through an alleyway.
*  We went through this big door into some like fucking warehouse.
*  And then there was this bar, this beautifully appointed bar
*  where the guy was wearing like a fucking a tuxedo shirt with a vest on.
*  Right. And the woman was beautiful.
*  And there was no one in the bar. Right.
*  It was me and Dave Chappelle and a few other people.
*  And they kicked us out because Dave sparked up a joint.
*  Oh, that's so funny.
*  And then he took me to another place. It was crazy.
*  But it's like he knows places where you can go and be private
*  because he's stupid famous. Of course.
*  So when you're a fucking politician and you're a part of an industry
*  that has existed in these shadows for decades,
*  doing things outside of the public's knowledge,
*  the full integration of the intelligence agencies in the deep state
*  and everybody's got dirt on everybody and there's madams and fucking
*  all kinds of hookers and crazy shit going on.
*  You know, so many people make it through that are like the Andrew,
*  the Anthony Wiener guy, absolute freaks.
*  Yeah. And they're in there. They're in there deep.
*  So this is not just one of those.
*  There's probably a fucking shitload of them.
*  It's an economy. They keep each other's secrets
*  and they probably get together and they put on masks and fuck each other.
*  Yeah. Like eyes wide shut.
*  Yeah. That's it's probably real.
*  It's probably otherwise. What are they doing it for?
*  That's a good point. What is the point?
*  How do you let your hair down?
*  Well, that's all the thing with the Obama chef.
*  People go, oh, the chef.
*  And I go, if you can't drown your lover in Martha's Vineyard,
*  why do anything? Right.
*  If you're the president, what the fuck is the point?
*  I mean, truly think about leaders throughout history.
*  What is the point of not being able to kill your lover
*  in two feet of water when he's a great swimmer?
*  He's a great swimmer and very fit.
*  And none of it made any sense.
*  But it's like that's the whole point.
*  It's like, what happened to that investigation?
*  There will never be one.
*  Weird. There's never going to be one because
*  at the end of the day, I don't think America really wants to know.
*  I don't think they want to know.
*  I think Tucker Carlson wants to know.
*  Tucker might.
*  He's maybe one guy that wants to know.
*  But even him, does he really want to know?
*  It's that's the whole thing.
*  It's like a guy on that claims he sucked Obama's dick.
*  I know that they talk for an hour.
*  But that's the thing.
*  It's like I think that there's a deep,
*  deep misunderstanding of what this place is.
*  And it's not only
*  it's not only like crazy, like odds of sex parties and stuff like that.
*  But we've we're doing a lot of things all over the world
*  that people don't really know about.
*  Nobody's nobody's abreast of what we're doing.
*  Right. We're doing things in Africa.
*  We're doing things here. We're doing things there.
*  Right. We've got a lot of we got a footprint everywhere.
*  And we're backing people that sometimes are people.
*  We align with our values.
*  A lot of times they're not right.
*  Like the whole Israel Gaza thing is a big
*  problem for Harris.
*  It's a major issue for her in Michigan.
*  And if is she saying, yeah, it's big.
*  Did you see the reports that she was running to separate messages
*  to two separate places?
*  She was running a pro-Israel message to one place.
*  And CNN called her out on. Yeah.
*  And wanting a pro-Palestine message to another place.
*  A lot of them do.
*  That's crazy that we're not going to check.
*  And it's crazy that CNN called her out.
*  Yeah. Do I have hope for CNN?
*  Like, I think I do. Yeah.
*  I think CNN probably recognizes, hey, we have to actually just say
*  the fucking news, except for pharmaceutical drugs.
*  Yeah. But everything else. Right.
*  Just say the news.
*  And I don't know what Trump will do in that situation with the Israelis.
*  I hope you don't buy CNN.
*  I hope that we don't invade Iran.
*  I should have asked him yesterday if he was going to buy CNN.
*  That would be amazing.
*  Imagine if he bought CNN.
*  You think he'll buy CNN?
*  Does CNN make any money?
*  It's worth a lot of money.
*  Is it? Yeah, because you think about the money that they generate
*  through advertising.
*  But it's all the pharmaceutical ad. That's the problem.
*  So if he buys CNN. That's not all, but it's a large chunk.
*  But the thing is, like, that money is real money.
*  That's how that's what keeps them afloat.
*  Like, if their numbers, if they had exists on YouTube,
*  like if CNN's numbers existed on YouTube, there's no way they'd be able
*  to support a giant fucking building filled with employees.
*  Wouldn't he be beholden to the same corporate advertisers that hold
*  everybody hostage?
*  How so? Meaning like the made the biggest advertiser
*  in all of these cable networks is pharmaceutical companies
*  because they're all the demographic is geriatric people watching them.
*  Well, the problem is that you can advertise a pharmaceutical drug companies
*  in this country and only two countries in the world allow us in New Zealand.
*  And New Zealand's more restrictive than the United States.
*  Like, have you ever watched the ads on Fox News?
*  It's all like life alert.
*  It's like fall down in the shower.
*  It's all pharmaceuticals. Fox News, if you think about it,
*  you the demographics, older, scared white people.
*  That's what I think about when I think of Fox News.
*  Yes. I guess you just got to find a way to make it profitable without
*  those types of ads or or those companies have to let you.
*  This is my point. I think it's a Ponzi scheme.
*  I don't think it is profitable without those kinds of ads.
*  No, it won't be because it's not profitable based on the viewership.
*  So you can get major advertisers who are willing to spend a lot of money
*  for the prestige of being on CNN.
*  There's something to that.
*  You know, like an ad on CNN maybe means more than an ad on YouTube.
*  But the reality is, if you look at the actual numbers,
*  like how much revenue you're generating for your company,
*  unless you are engaged purely in propaganda.
*  And this is the argument.
*  So like what what was the quote that someone said to us the other day about
*  how it was Callie Means said how much the pharmaceutical pharmaceutical
*  drug companies spend on advertising every year.
*  And it's billions of dollars just on ads, billions and billions of dollars.
*  I think it's was it eight or 80?
*  What did he say it was?
*  Jamie will find it, but it's got to be crazy.
*  It's an insane amount of money.
*  But that money is not making them money in terms of so many people
*  are seeing those ads are going out and buying drugs.
*  What that is doing is it's ensuring that there's no criticism.
*  It's ensuring that you don't question any narratives.
*  That's right. That all the Robert F.
*  Kennedy Jr. types, they all get demonized.
*  They all get called kooks.
*  They all get called dangerous anti-science people.
*  By the way, I'm excited.
*  You know, if Trump wins, I'm excited to see if RFK really gets to like start.
*  Look at that. Look at that number.
*  Twenty twenty three pharmaceutical industry spent around fifteen point
*  five, eight billion in advertising.
*  Fifteen billion dollars in ads.
*  That is crazy.
*  That's so much fucking money, man.
*  Well, how are people going to know about the drugs?
*  It's not that, man. I don't think that I think it's a little bit of that
*  because it normalizes it. It gets the words out.
*  You know, what we also don't have.
*  We don't have a functioning health care system. Right.
*  So it's not supposed to be like a grocery store where you pick the drug.
*  If you have a good doctor, right, you can have a functioning health care system.
*  Yeah, you got to have some cash.
*  You know, that's the problem.
*  It's like we have everything's for profit.
*  Everything's like there's a million.
*  You ever go to a pharmacy in like a Scandinavian country?
*  There's like 12 things. Yes.
*  They don't have like our pharmacies are there's aisles and it's like a grocery
*  store of all kinds of different shit.
*  It's just a real problem when you allow people to profit
*  wildly off of people being sick, then they have a vested interest
*  in people staying sick.
*  Well, that's whether it's mental illness, physical or whatever it is.
*  What about RFK?
*  Do you think I would it would be interesting to see him
*  try because, you know, he's, you know, for a long time,
*  you know, he's been an advocate on behalf of not only, you know,
*  obviously environmental stuff that's well known, but like public health.
*  Yes. So be interesting to see like what 100 percent.
*  First of all, why do we have fluoride in our fucking water?
*  That's one of the things that they're talking about that are.
*  Well, the British people's teeth are gross.
*  Yeah. Brush your fucking teeth.
*  Is that why? Yeah. But they have fucked up teeth.
*  I think part of the reason why they have fucked up teeth,
*  they ate a lot of soft foods for generations after generation.
*  Isn't that the fluoride, though, that doesn't matter?
*  Well, fluoride does have a reaction to your teeth.
*  But I mean, you're swallowing it.
*  So how much of an effect is it? And also, it's really bad.
*  It's bad for IQs.
*  There's a direct correlation between high levels of fluoride
*  and drinking water and low IQs in children.
*  You can there's a corresponding number depending upon the amount
*  of fluoride in the water.
*  But this is I think the whole way they found this out about fluoride and teeth.
*  I think it had to do with natural fluoride.
*  And I think it all began in Texas.
*  What is fluoride? Fluoride is a mineral.
*  And fluoride is also a neurotoxin, like at certain levels,
*  like depending on how much.
*  But the point is,
*  the corresponding increase in sugar consumption is not taken into consideration
*  when people are looking at when they started.
*  People started getting tooth decay. Right.
*  And like whether or not they had fluoride in the water, like we went.
*  There's a time in our history where all the sudden
*  massive amounts of processed food and sugar are introduced into our diet.
*  Like whatever it is, 70s, 80s, whatever year it was,
*  where sugary cereals and fucking cookies and candy bars just became everywhere.
*  That's when people started getting more cavities.
*  That's also when people start experiencing all these health problems.
*  Right. All that stuff is together.
*  Chronic diseases and autoimmune conditions.
*  It's not put fucking fluoride in the water.
*  That's like saying, oh, some people get skin cancer.
*  Look, put sunscreen in the apples.
*  No. Hey, you fucking idiot.
*  First of all, you can have to you can have toothpaste with fluoride in it
*  if you so choose.
*  Mine doesn't have fluoride in it.
*  I haven't had fluoride toothpaste for fucking years.
*  I don't have any cavities. You know why?
*  I brush my teeth.
*  Where is all this non fluoride toothpick?
*  Can you share it with some of us?
*  Tom's of Maine. Oh, Tom's of Maine.
*  Yeah, it's good stuff.
*  There's a lot of companies that sell.
*  And Eddie Bravo had a really good point, believe it or not.
*  Eddie Bravo had a really good point that wasn't crazy.
*  He said, why would they say
*  fluoride free in a toothpaste
*  if if fluoride wasn't potentially bad for you?
*  Why would anybody want fluoride free toothpaste?
*  If fluoride was really the active ingredient
*  that was preventing you from having tooth decay?
*  Well, it's also when I saw like Doug Amhoff at Wada Burger or Trump at McDonald's.
*  I was like, we shouldn't have these politicians be in these like
*  they're kind of like poison factories.
*  We should have politicians.
*  That's like kind of showing up to a Marlboro factory and lighting up.
*  Like there's something weird to me about.
*  Yes. But yeah.
*  Yes. But I eat McDonald's.
*  I know I'm on the road.
*  I like a year ago.
*  I had a quarter pound of cheese.
*  Stop comparing yourself to like other people because like
*  you have a tremendous amount of discipline.
*  And it's like the nine year old getting fat at McDonald's is not going to be.
*  So I'm just like this celebration of fast food.
*  And I love fast food.
*  And I was raised on it. My family raised me on it. Thanks.
*  But like when you see politicians going in there, it is a weird feeling.
*  It is weird. It's like odd to see that.
*  Yeah. But I liken it to being at a Coca-Cola factory.
*  I don't have a problem. That's bad, too.
*  I know. But I think again, I do have discipline.
*  R.F.K. has got to send the military into these places.
*  Taco Bell, Denny's.
*  They fucked us all up.
*  I say Taco Bell now has the Mexi Melt is back.
*  Did you know that? I don't know what the Mexi Melt is.
*  It's well, it's it's on the decades menu.
*  Taco Bell is bringing back things from previous decades.
*  And they've brought the Mexi Melt back.
*  They they're fucking because it was all this shit here.
*  And now fast food's doubling down because fast food's going fuck me.
*  Fuck you. They're going to start to bring back shit.
*  This is now coming back.
*  Those look good.
*  That is the least of all Mexican foods.
*  Yeah, no, it is nothing to do with Mexico.
*  But fast food will not go away quietly.
*  They think they're going to all we're going to bring in these drugs.
*  Fast food is like you'll see what we'll do.
*  Yeah, that's fine. Let them do it.
*  I'm fine with that. No one's going to mandate Taco Bell.
*  That's the thing. But there is you know, there is something.
*  You go to Australia and it's a nanny state.
*  Nobody's allowed to do anything.
*  But you know what? They all they're kind of hot.
*  All of them not only that, they have grass fed beef in their burgers.
*  I know my buddy, Adam, came over here and he had a he always gets a quarter
*  pounder with cheese in Australia, whatever the fuck they call it.
*  And he said he goes, dude, I had one over here.
*  It tastes like cardboard. It was fucking terrible.
*  Right. He goes back home.
*  It's like fresh grass fed beef.
*  Well, also, they'll pay you over if you're driving in Australia.
*  They just have T.V.
*  checkpoints, no matter who you are.
*  And you'll just go through them and blow.
*  And obviously, I'm against that because I think it's you know,
*  it's like an infringing on your freedom.
*  But they love it there. Well, they don't have guns.
*  They go. We love it. And they go. We feel safe.
*  But it's also they've just accepted it.
*  Well, they've got a custom to it.
*  But they've got a custom to it.
*  It's literally a prison colony.
*  Yeah, but they don't care.
*  That's the thing. But they do.
*  Do they? They do.
*  They're very Australian.
*  And they're like happy with it.
*  My buddy wants to move here.
*  Of course he does, because he's your buddy.
*  But most of them are like not that bothered by it.
*  They don't care.
*  I wonder if that's true.
*  Yeah, I just don't know.
*  Their reality.
*  It's the reality that they live in and you because they look at us
*  and they go, you guys have school shootings.
*  You have poison food and you great.
*  You get to work and drop dead and all that stuff.
*  We are. Yes, we are nanny, which I would never want to live there.
*  But I don't know. I talk to people there.
*  They go, yeah, they're nanny.
*  They don't let us do things like they regulate the food or they have the
*  D.V. checkpoints, but they kind of they kind of accept it.
*  Interesting. There's probably a trade off if it doesn't get out of line.
*  Sure. You know, like you don't want people driving drunk.
*  And if you just had D.V. checkpoints everywhere and they all drink, they're all drunk.
*  Yeah, that's the difference.
*  But if you had those D.V. checkpoints all over the place and people just accept it
*  as a part of life, how much of D.V. would drop a ton?
*  A ton. But I still hate the idea of it because I'm an American and we're Americans.
*  Well, especially if you're not.
*  Here's the thing. Like you can piss or blow hot for like a drink and a half.
*  Right. What's the tolerance?
*  I've gotten in more accidents, car accidents, sober than I did drunk.
*  I drove drunk for many years, never hurt anyone.
*  I got in an accident today, completely sober, rushing to get here.
*  Was it your fault, though?
*  Yeah, it was. I kind of crossed into a lane I shouldn't have.
*  But but it was just tires. It was a quick thing.
*  It was a lovely man. Everybody was fine.
*  And he'll sue me later. I'll sue him back.
*  Who cares? You know what? Nothing matters.
*  Everyone's fine. That's the thing about America.
*  It doesn't matter. You can just sue people and they'll sue you back.
*  And then lawyers figure it out.
*  Bro, if you go to court in those sunglasses, you're going to lose.
*  I may lose. Doesn't matter. I'll just make more money.
*  Where'd you get these? I got them at Louis Vuitton.
*  I was fucking great. They're sick.
*  I figured I'd show up with a good time. If I could pull these off. Absolutely.
*  You did it. What do you think?
*  You should have endorsed Trump in those.
*  They are sick. They're sick.
*  Austin, shout out to the domain.
*  I'm going to have a ton of the domain.
*  Can you send me a link? They're great.
*  Send me a link before I forget. Send them a link.
*  I'm going to get a pair of those.
*  How do you think it does?
*  Anyone concede tonight?
*  Does anyone have a victory speech? No, I think it takes days.
*  North Carolina is the first to call, they say.
*  What was the longest one was the dangling Chad.
*  Yeah, that was two months. It was hilarious.
*  SNL was doing really funny stuff.
*  That was when Will Farrell was Bush.
*  Did you hear what happened with SNL with her?
*  So SNL violated. They should have given him equal time.
*  So they have to run ads for him now.
*  That is really funny. They had to run like some 90 second ad.
*  Is that true? Find out if that's true.
*  Is it true? Yeah.
*  I read it on Twitter, but, you know, could be some Chinese bot
*  planting stuff in my feed.
*  So I say stupid things.
*  They're watching our election. 100 percent.
*  He's watching like this, like, ah, imagine voting. Right.
*  Imagine just let these fucking dumbasses pick who gets to run the military.
*  I want to go there so bad. Have you ever gone there? No.
*  No, I went to Taiwan once, but it was a stopover on the way to Thailand.
*  Do you like the idea of China?
*  Like, I don't mean do you like the idea of China, but like visiting it?
*  Yeah, I would love to. It's fascinating, right?
*  I would love to see the Great Wall.
*  Well, that's you're into that. Yeah.
*  Ancient cultures. And I'd love to go to Mongolia.
*  The elk hunting in Mongolia is a big thing.
*  Like, yeah, there's a lot of like elk hunters go to Mongolia.
*  Mongolia has like a large elk population and a lot of people aren't voting.
*  What is this? Someone's in trouble here, right?
*  Well, not quite.
*  In a statement to Hollywood,
*  FCC reportably claimed that Brendan's statement does not reflect their views
*  on the appearance. Oh, who's Brendan?
*  He's the guy who was tweeting.
*  He's one of the five members of the FCC.
*  OK, so the agency added they had not made any determination
*  regarding political programming rules, nor have we received a complaint
*  from any interested parties. Here's my take on it.
*  If you can't do a sketch on Saturday Night Live,
*  if that's promoting a candidate like
*  it, you have to have equal time.
*  Like, why do they have to do that?
*  But we don't. Why is that?
*  Like if I just governed by the FCC, right?
*  Crazy is that? Yeah.
*  Think about that. If I just decided, you know what?
*  I don't want to interview Kamala.
*  I only want to hear one side of the story. Yeah.
*  You know, I don't want to hear Tim Walls.
*  I only want to hear JD Vance.
*  If I just decided to do that, I could do that. Right.
*  Which is kind of weird. Right.
*  If it's the number one podcast on Earth, like why?
*  Why am I? Why am I even allowed to do that?
*  Because you're you're not on government regulated airwaves.
*  That's my point. Why is the government?
*  We don't want that. Let's not. Let's not ask why.
*  But we don't want them coming in.
*  Well, they shouldn't be doing anywhere.
*  They shouldn't be anywhere.
*  You should be looking for whatever the fuck you want.
*  I'm more for that. But here's the thing.
*  Coming into this space.
*  But why is it OK to do?
*  Why is it OK to regulate in that regard?
*  But you're not regulating the percentage of positive
*  versus negative news stories.
*  Like, you're you're choosing. Sure.
*  Choosing. I thought the regulation was just like no tits until 9 p.m.
*  But it's like the rules of equal airtime.
*  Remember when Sipowicz showed his ass on NYPD Blue?
*  Like, that was a big deal.
*  It was a big deal. It was a big deal.
*  Dennis France. Like, I thought it was.
*  They say bullshit once, too. That was a big deal.
*  That was a big deal. Like I didn't bullshit.
*  Yeah, I didn't realize it was like like it was equal time.
*  But I mean, that makes a lot of sense.
*  Well, I think Stan Hope had an issue with that when he was fake running for president.
*  Oh, because Stan Hope said, I'm going to have to stop doing shows
*  because shows almost count as like a campaign speech.
*  And you have to offer the opposing side equal time.
*  Or something. That's crazy.
*  Yeah, like I think there's laws and we should call them.
*  Call them. Call them right now.
*  Call Stan Hope. That's crazy.
*  Yeah, that's interesting.
*  All right. Let's see.
*  See what he has to say.
*  Because he actually. Oh, shit.
*  Stan Hope, what are you doing?
*  He oh, he's got a different number. Hold on a second.
*  Stan Hope.
*  Call Stan Hope Batphone.
*  That's the real one.
*  He's got a bat phone.
*  I love a good bat phone.
*  God, I hope he picks up.
*  He's probably drinking, staring at the TV right now, yelling things,
*  smoking cigarettes.
*  Come on, Douglas. Fuck.
*  My callback.
*  I'll text him.
*  But that's interesting, because there are all these rules that we're kind of,
*  you know, somewhat familiar with that govern the whole thing.
*  Yeah. That you're allowed to do this.
*  Douglas, I'm live on the air with Tim Dillon.
*  Call me as soon as you see this.
*  I have a question about when you ran for president.
*  Jamie, what about the exit polls?
*  Is there an exit poll?
*  They don't release those until the things closes.
*  Are you are you anxiety ridden?
*  No, I don't think so.
*  Are you worried at all about this?
*  I mean, about the election, not in general.
*  Not really.
*  Not really. I have more anxiety about other things in the election.
*  What's the big? Well, me, we all Google weird diseases and shit.
*  Yeah, I don't do that.
*  You know. Well, I mean, come on, Tim, let me get you healthy.
*  It has nothing to do with that.
*  Weird diseases attack healthy people all the time.
*  Oh, you mean like Ebola type stuff?
*  Well, that stuff that you people just get stuff.
*  Oh, nobody can do sit ups to the brain.
*  So a brain tumor doesn't happen.
*  You might be able to. No, you can't think I'm that's you think so.
*  And that makes you feel good. But that's great. Great.
*  That's great.
*  You want to live for 300 years for what?
*  That's all I'm enjoying myself.
*  No, I'm enjoying myself, too.
*  But you want to live through the Jake Paul administration?
*  Like, I'm going to be a VP.
*  It's 82 degrees in New York City.
*  Jake Paul running. Yeah.
*  It's 82 degrees in New York City right now.
*  It's I don't know what matters who wins the election.
*  You know, it's worse than 82 degrees.
*  Yeah. Minus 82 degrees.
*  Everybody wants everybody scared of global warming.
*  Listen, you don't want the fucking ice age.
*  Nobody wants the ice.
*  Yeah, but these fucking eggheads want to spray shit in the sky to protect.
*  No, no. Well, nobody wants that.
*  But it just feels like eventually the planet will expel us.
*  You don't think so? No.
*  No, we're going to get rid of us.
*  The only thing that's going to happen to us.
*  Look, the planet could fuck us up if the planet hits us with the big one
*  that could get us for sure.
*  Oh, I'm on do not disturb. Hold on a second here.
*  The big one that could get us for sure is an asteroid.
*  Yeah. Or supervolcano.
*  Either one of those could really, really fuck us up.
*  Yeah. Because those are real and those happen all the fucking time.
*  So that that's that's our number one problem is a natural disaster.
*  A supernova in a nearby galaxy would kill us.
*  Any sort of like real blast from the sun would wipe out
*  all our communication system and our grid.
*  There's there's things that have definitely happened in the past
*  that if they happen today, we'd be fucked.
*  But I think our biggest threat is us.
*  I think our biggest threat is these crazy motherfuckers
*  that are making all sorts of money off a war and they keep pushing
*  these agendas in these countries and they're they're pushing
*  international conflict that we're all involved in. Absolutely.
*  And it's nuts.
*  And I don't think it's going to last much longer.
*  I think that's where they're getting hyper focused on getting things done right now.
*  I don't think you're going to be able to do this
*  when you have sentient artificial intelligence.
*  I think that is the end of all that.
*  That's the end of all this global thermonuclear war.
*  That shit's all going to go away.
*  I think what they're doing right now is this mad dash to control
*  as much resources and power and money as possible
*  before the entire fucking world changes.
*  You know, you have robot aliens living amongst us.
*  Elon said yesterday that he thinks that what year did he say?
*  How many years? 20 years from now, there'll be more robots in Earth
*  than there will be people or in America.
*  Wait a minute. Hold on. In 20 years?
*  What was the year? What was the timeline he gave us?
*  10 to 20 years.
*  There will be more robots like Tesla robots.
*  These robots he's making.
*  I said and I was like, imagine if you just robot bodyguards.
*  You walk down the street, you got two terminators with you.
*  Yeah. Is this good, though?
*  Him doing all the robot like let's bring all the better than a lot of other people doing it.
*  Yeah, he's moral and ethical about these ideas.
*  He's one of the first people to sound the alarm about artificial intelligence.
*  That's good. That's important.
*  He was like, you're you're you're going to make our successor.
*  Like in these fucking people are just running towards this cliff.
*  But no one knows where we got to merge. Right.
*  Well, he believes now because he's running his own
*  AI, the large language model that they use for Twitter grok.
*  And he's got he's got another startup is involved with with Nvidia.
*  Like there's he's I think he feels like he got it.
*  It was an early investor in open AI.
*  And I think he's suing them right now because it's not it's not open AI anymore.
*  Now it's a private company.
*  And it's the whole situation with whether or not they've achieved artificial sentience came up.
*  Yeah. Remember when they kicked out Sam Altman for a little bit and they brought him right back in.
*  Like what the fuck? Everyone's like, what the fuck are you doing?
*  I don't know what was going on there.
*  What explanation?
*  But he's he's worried that there's a race going on if the wrong people win that race.
*  It's terrifying.
*  We're fucked if China wins that race in China, apparently, whether it's open AI or one of these companies,
*  there was some sort of a leak or some sort of break in or they believe that someone had access to their information.
*  Yeah. See if you can find what that is, whether it's China that they think.
*  It's scary to imagine the wrong people having that power.
*  Exactly. Exactly.
*  Yeah. It's it's for any group of people having any group of people, not just the wrong people,
*  because the right people will be they'll be can fuck up.
*  And they're also it's absolute power.
*  A hacker stole open AI secrets, raising fears that China could, too.
*  Security Beach, the maker of Chachi BT last year, revealed internal discussions among researchers
*  and other employees, but not the code behind open AI systems.
*  OK, so they didn't get the code, but they got internal discussions.
*  But those internal discussions may have had clues as to like what direction the technology is headed
*  and maybe solve some puzzles that they didn't know yet without, you know, and then you could have who knows
*  if that's all they got because there was speculation that they got other things.
*  There's you know, China's done a wonderful job of like infiltrating stuff.
*  One of the things that Mike Baker pointed out is that there's like a nuclear facility,
*  like or rather a military facility that is in, I think, Wyoming and all around the area.
*  The cell phone towers were all sold to America by the Chinese that they they just make deals with.
*  Jenny said that.
*  Selling you cheaper stuff.
*  There was a surveillance apparatus built in America that the Chinese backed toward.
*  And now they are using some of it.
*  So let me tell you what happened in Austin.
*  Let me tell you what happened in Austin at Formula One.
*  My buddy Bobby owns that racetrack.
*  So I was there with him and he shows me this picture, says, you know what this is?
*  I go, what is it?
*  He goes, someone attached a device to our broadband, to our Wi-Fi, where it was siphoning up people's data.
*  Like someone had attacked. They found it and they got it.
*  And they called whoever it is, Homeland Security or whatever the fuck it is.
*  But so if you go to like a big event and you're using the open Wi-Fi,
*  there's a real chance that someone has set up a thing where they're going to siphon up all that data.
*  And who knows what the fuck they're going to use it for, whether they're getting your passwords to your credit card account
*  or whether they're getting this or that or passwords to social media sites, emails, whatever the fuck they're getting.
*  But if you're just willy nilly using a VPN or not using a VPN and going and getting on Wi-Fi in some place,
*  like you you run the real risk of actually being compromised.
*  Yeah.
*  And like, what are they getting? Like, what are they doing with all that stuff?
*  I don't know. But if you sell if you're a hostile government and you sell cell phone towers to your enemy.
*  Yeah, no, it's crazy.
*  And you just got these dudes who just contractors who are working for the government.
*  They're not like the most sophisticated of investigative reporters.
*  It's just a guy who has a job. He has to buy a certain amount of these cell phone towers.
*  China will sell them to us for this while we can buy from these other companies for a lot more.
*  Let's just get it from China. Right.
*  Look, it's right. Yeah.
*  And next thing you know, they can drop in on any kind of information that they want.
*  Who knows? There could be a third party access that no one is available.
*  No one is aware of until they activate it.
*  Yeah. They could just decide to shut all these things down.
*  They might have a kill switch in them.
*  But you're buying like that's why they ban Huawei.
*  They ban Huawei because they found compromises in their networks.
*  Yeah. And then they they knew that the company was aligned with the Chinese government.
*  They're like, hey, you got to get out of here.
*  They're very good at it. It's corporate espionage.
*  They're incredibly good at it. They've been good at it for decades.
*  And they're the best at it. But we do it, too.
*  That's the thing. Trump was right. Like, we do it, too.
*  What did Huawei get popped for, Jamie?
*  Because I was mad because this is back when I was using Android and I wanted a Huawei phone.
*  Because while we should just give it to them, they made the best phone.
*  Let's just give it to them.
*  And what meaning like, you know, it's like all this data they're trying to just give it to them.
*  What are they going to do?
*  Well, I mean, they're stealing. They're stealing stuff.
*  Let's just give them the patents.
*  They've been banned or restricted in multiple countries due to the security concerns.
*  Huawei was added to the U.S.
*  export administration's regulations entity list, which made it harder for the company
*  to obtain parts from U.S. suppliers in 2022.
*  The U.S. banned the sale and import of new Huawei communications equipment
*  due to national security concerns.
*  So what were the concerns, though?
*  I think that like they have to report back to like.
*  TikTok is a problem, but it makes so much money that we'll just constantly.
*  We make money from TikTok, too, right?
*  No, of course.
*  But that's the thing that China realizes that if you can make if Americans make money,
*  they're never going to care.
*  Some lady was heckling me at a show here.
*  She said she worked for TikTok. Oh, yeah.
*  It was it was hilarious.
*  U.S. banned the sale and import of new communications equipment from five Chinese companies,
*  including Huawei and ZTE amid concerns over national security.
*  What did they do, though?
*  What did they do?
*  I think there was something to do with routers.
*  Huawei and others have previously denied supplying data to the Chinese government.
*  Yeah, there was something about
*  Wi-Fi routers and different things that they thought could be spied upon.
*  It's like 5G networks.
*  And you have for 5G in other countries.
*  I don't know, but they used to make dope.
*  Well, they probably still do. They made dope phones.
*  There was this Porsche design collaborated with Huawei and made like the best cell phone.
*  I was trying to buy it.
*  And then I found out you can't buy it in America anymore.
*  I was like, what?
*  And that's that's when I started looking into it.
*  So it's like twenty twenty one or something like that.
*  Whenever it was, what was the year the ban was put in place?
*  I don't know. They have a sweet one I wanted to get right now.
*  It's trifold. Yeah, it's bad ass.
*  That's what I'm saying. Just get it.
*  We're getting it. Just can't use it.
*  Why want to?
*  You could use it on Wi-Fi here, but like you couldn't.
*  It won't do all the stuff.
*  Well, they can't. It doesn't even use Google.
*  They don't use the Android operating system because they want a Chinese phone.
*  Do you know that? Like China got they they stopped using that because Huawei got banned from Google.
*  Find out if that's true.
*  Huawei, they weren't allowed to use the Android operating system anymore either.
*  Isn't it a version of TikTok that is different in China?
*  Yes. Yes. Yeah, very different.
*  Oh, wait, it says it still runs Android 10, but doesn't support Google apps and services.
*  Right. Why did they do that? Why did they ban them from Google apps and services?
*  There must have been some sneaky shit they have. Of course.
*  Yeah, it's just hilarious. But there's other Chinese companies like One makes great phones.
*  Yeah, I believe that's a Chinese company.
*  You know, there's like there's a bunch of phone you man.
*  We're just in this globalized world now where you just this is inevitable.
*  Well, we have to globalized world where China is making some things better than we are.
*  Yeah, same reason. Yeah. Spying concerns.
*  You just have to keep you stay stay as vigilant as you can to try to prevent this from happening.
*  But they're very good at it. It seems like that's not going to stop.
*  Well, China's making some insane cars.
*  I'm worried about all kinds of things that they're doing.
*  They're buying up the real estate all over America.
*  They own large swaths of some of our biggest cities.
*  I mean, it's like they're they're aggressive on a few fronts.
*  It's kind of crazy. They're allowed to buy land around military bases.
*  It's unreal. That's unreal.
*  Like what? Imagine trying to pull that off in China.
*  And that's the difference between having a guy who's been in power for fucking decades.
*  Yeah. Really knows how to run the country versus some person who got elected in a popularity contest.
*  It's also a difference of when people see the country as it going out of business sale.
*  I mean, you're selling farms, selling everything from out from under everybody.
*  And it's a yard sale.
*  It's what the way people are treating America right now is just a fucking throw a sign on it.
*  Make your best offer. Come in and loot.
*  Isn't it funny that if you said you have to be American to buy American property, people would be up in arms.
*  They'd be up in arms and they'd say it's racist.
*  And the real estate lobby would come out and go, it's racist because they want that rushing money.
*  They want that fucking oligarch dollar.
*  You're the one that told me first about these apartment buildings in New York City.
*  Yeah. They're like ghost cities. This is another thing we all go.
*  And I just read these things. They go, look at these Chinese ghost cities.
*  They built all these cities and nobody lives in them.
*  And I go, if you go to any of these buildings by Central Park, there's like 20 percent of it occupied, 30 percent of it.
*  70 percent of it is straight up money laundering, where it's people that have purchased multiple apartments under the name of an LLC, a limited liability corporation.
*  And by the way, they've got a lot of them. There's not just one.
*  There's so many of them shell corps that you can barely find who owns it.
*  And it causes the price of everything to go up. And they're not living in the city.
*  They're not contributing. They're not tipping at restaurants. They're not buying tickets to Yankee games.
*  They're doing it to move their money out of Russia, China, the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, India, wherever.
*  They're stashing it in these buildings. And it's causing the prices of all of the real estate around it to skyrocket.
*  Yeah. The real estate in New York is bananas.
*  Well, it's L.A. It's even in cities like Austin.
*  Obviously, there's not as much of that. But, you know, but there are foreign buyers in this market.
*  100 percent. Everywhere.
*  Sold for a whopping two. Oh, my God. Yeah.
*  This apartment sold for two hundred thirty eight million dollars, the highest recorded price for a residential property.
*  Billionaires rose a home to eight ultra luxury skyscrapers, each equipped with luxurious amenities ranging from cinema rooms to saunas.
*  Look at that. The average sale price, nine point eight million dollars.
*  And that's in that part of the city. That is the part of the city that is the favorite of foreign money.
*  Look at it says here, as of 2022, there are seven hundred and seventy two un-purchased units because they've built these buildings specifically for money laundering.
*  Money laundering. Wow. This is not built for regular rich people.
*  Most regular wealthy people cannot afford to live in a 50 million dollar apartment or in two hundred and thirty eight million dollars.
*  It's a thirty eight million dollar apartment.
*  So the whole thing is incredibly, you know, it's completely manipulated.
*  So it's not a real market that has anything to do with supply and demand.
*  It's artificially manipulated by a lot of wealthy people.
*  And then the real estate lobby loves it. They want it.
*  And the developers like it. Sure. And so those big money people love it.
*  And so what's the money? How's the money laundering part of it work?
*  Because they take money out of whatever country and then they stash it in America in real estate.
*  So they'll come in and buy something cash under an LLC and that however much money that would have been in their home country,
*  because some of those countries are volatile and the governments of those countries could decide, OK, you will have money.
*  It's 20 percent of it's now ours. Right. Here's the new tax. Right.
*  Give me I mean, there's people who try to do it here. Yeah.
*  They propose wealth taxes, things like that all the time.
*  Right. Some of them are some of them are make some sense.
*  Some of them are ludicrous. But those people are a bit paranoid.
*  There's also political instability in a lot of those countries.
*  And then there's people that just don't like taxes.
*  And there's people that have made money.
*  Narco trafficking, human trafficking, doing all kinds of things. Right.
*  So these people that go, I have a lot of illicit capital that needs to go to real estate in London.
*  There's an area in London called Mayfair. It's all Russian oligarchs.
*  There's areas, you know, and London is even more than New York.
*  London is the most is the home for international money laundering.
*  It's the shadiest city in the world. It's really cool. It's a lot of fun.
*  It really is. I mean, that's the thing about these people.
*  They are fun. And London is a financial capital halfway between New York and Asia.
*  You have the biggest money in the world in London,
*  because historically it has been, you know, New York's amazing.
*  And New York's the greatest city in the world in the sense that I think it's the most representative.
*  But London has always been the home of international finance since, I mean, you know,
*  I mean, we're talking about, you know, it goes like this is a part of London called the City of London.
*  This is a small little part of it. And it's an area called Knightsbridge.
*  And that's where they have like one Hyde Park.
*  And one Hyde Park is this building with like one hundred and fifty million dollar apartments.
*  And all these Saudi kids are driving like Bugatti's and Lamborghini's there and everything.
*  And if Harrods is there, the famous store. And it's just a signal to the ultra wealthy.
*  This is where you come. You want your kids to be raised as, you know, British gentlemen and learn the ways of.
*  But it's a home of like international finance. And it's been that's a cool place.
*  But you don't I don't know how you unwind all of this. You don't. You don't really unwind it.
*  Now, I mean, also, most people don't understand it. So they don't understand it.
*  Where's all the money going to go?
*  I can't. It's hard to fight these people because they that's the problem.
*  It's like everyone kind of wants to be them.
*  And then the people that don't want to be them, you know, they will kill you.
*  That's the prop. They will blackmail you. And if that doesn't work, they will kill you.
*  This is the thing, because they are the top of the food chain.
*  And when you are at the top of the food chain, you're not going to give that power up without a tremendous fight.
*  And I think that's really where a lot of a lot of it comes down to is they're preserving their position on the top of the hierarchy.
*  Imagine if the United States made a law where you couldn't buy real estate unless you're an American citizen.
*  New York City apartment buildings would it would be a bloodbath.
*  But by the way, not only would it be a bloodbath there, it would be a bloodbath everywhere.
*  And then people would look at their 401Ks and go, all these the shit I'm invested in is tanked.
*  That's the other problem, because all of the stuff they're invested in is based on a lot of investments being made by those companies like BlackRock and Vanguard and State Street and Citadel or Goldman.
*  So it's just one of the creepiest things they're doing is buying residential homes and leasing them to people.
*  Yeah, because they don't want people to own their homes.
*  They don't want people to have the power of homeownership or the dignity of homeownership.
*  Is that what it is? Or is it is profitable to buy homes and lease them?
*  It's profitable because they but they.
*  That's why they're doing it.
*  Do you think there's like some insidious like thing like they don't want people to have homes?
*  Like, really? Yes, because I think they go that I think they look at it and say Americans will be happy renting.
*  I mean, that's the famous article.
*  By 2030, you'll own nothing and you'll be happy.
*  But that's just those W.E.F. dorks.
*  Yeah, but those W.E.F. dorks are incredibly powerful amongst a crew of people.
*  They all get together. They all these conferences.
*  Whether they meet and it's again, it's not like always nefarious, but they go to like Davos or Bilderberg or whatever.
*  And this idea that five.
*  That's the thing people talk about. Why should you preserve culture?
*  Is it racist to preserve culture?
*  And I don't mean the specific culture of any one race, but this idea that like you want to preserve culture and people go, well, why is it good to preserve traditional culture?
*  And because there will always be a culture.
*  So if it's not Italian culture, Irish culture, Mexican culture, black culture, whatever it is, it's going to be soulless global corporate culture.
*  That's why every hotel looks the same.
*  That's why every fucking apartment looks the same, because the same people are choosing the same fucking 10 shades of marble and shades of wood.
*  And they're putting up all of these different condos and all these office building.
*  That's why all these cities are starting to look the same.
*  Everything looks like a weird Airbnb.
*  It looks like they 3D printed everything.
*  That's why all these restaurants are starting to look the same, because it's soulless corporate culture.
*  Americans, just like people all over the world, have less and less financial power and more and more of it is being consolidated on the higher end.
*  And they're going to say you're going to rent your house.
*  You're going to take Ubers everywhere.
*  You don't need to own a car.
*  You're going to take whatever vaccine we think is good.
*  You'll drive your car on Thursday or you'll be able to Uber on Thursdays because of climate.
*  You're not going to be able to Uber whenever you want.
*  Or you won't be able to use this amount of water or this amount of heat or this amount of energy.
*  And all of this are going to be edicts delivered to you from the government.
*  But also by these corporate oligarchs that just own everything.
*  And it's going to be a very bland and soulless world.
*  It'll be Times Square.
*  It'll be Times Square.
*  What Times Square used to be.
*  But somehow worse.
*  Versus what Times Square is a giant Applebee's now.
*  That's right. It's a giant Applebee's.
*  And it'll be that serene, cold, corporate feeling that you get now when you walk into like a St. Regis.
*  And all these hotels are all owned by Marriott, the Ritz or any of these hotels.
*  You walk into these hotels and it's all gray.
*  It's all gray.
*  And it all looks like a conference room.
*  And everything, nobody's, nothing's loud.
*  And hello.
*  And how are you?
*  And no one can do anything.
*  Oh, we're sorry about.
*  Yeah, we were not able to do that.
*  We don't have that.
*  We can't do that.
*  And everybody's rule followed.
*  And everybody's cameras trained on everybody.
*  So God forbid somebody does anything like you try to tip people sometimes they go, thank you.
*  I can't. I mean, we're not allowed to.
*  And you're just loopy because everybody's terrified of losing their job.
*  Everybody's terrified of upsetting these people.
*  Everybody's on camera.
*  And, you know, it's like it sucks.
*  The whole thing is turning into that.
*  And I think as much as, you know, there's a lot of conspiracies about the World Economic Forum and all that stuff.
*  Some of them are probably based in reality.
*  Some of them are just crackpots.
*  But one thing that I think is very real is all of those people, those organizations, they exist to create a consensus amongst the wealthiest and powerful people that it is better to favor this set of policies over that one.
*  And all of those policies inevitably take power and ownership away from people and and reappropriate that and redistribute it to wealthier people, the government and big corporations.
*  100 percent. Well said.
*  That's a great way to put it. Yeah.
*  And those people, you don't know anybody like that.
*  Like, you know, you don't know anybody like Lindsey Graham.
*  So you don't know the game they're playing.
*  Well, speak for yourself. I have a lot of friends.
*  And I'll be taking I'll be taking Kurt very well.
*  No, I don't. You don't.
*  You know what I'm saying? You're not in that group.
*  You meet the kids of them sometimes and they all believe they're doing the right thing.
*  They think it's great. And they're.
*  You know, I met I was in an environment where I met some of these Harvard kids and Yale kids and they're all nice people, they're good people, they're fun people.
*  But again, they just they have these beliefs.
*  Well, they're all they're in a cult.
*  They're drilled into them since they're young.
*  And this is the problem with the Democratic Party.
*  It's maybe why they lose this election. Maybe they won't.
*  Maybe they will. It's condescension.
*  And they're condescending and they're dismissive of people.
*  And it's a kind of elitism that seeks to convince you that it is for your own good that they are in charge.
*  Yes. Yeah. Yeah. They're your mama.
*  They're your dad. They know better than you.
*  Yeah. And that's the like the thing when they talk about misinformation, disinformation.
*  Don't you know? You know the difference, right?
*  If you know the difference, why do you assume other people won't know it?
*  That's right. Like you want to say that other people are stupid and they're not capable of making these decisions or discerning what's true and what's false by themselves.
*  So you want to eliminate anything that you disagree with and just call it misinformation.
*  Yeah. And not only that, but it's to demonize people, the demonization of podcasts, the demonization of people that, you know, are willing to have conversations with people they disagree with.
*  It's all done to discredit anything that runs counter to that narrative.
*  It's the same reason they don't want people to have social engagements that have any value or a lot of times the reason that if somebody says something mildly pro-family, they flip the fuck out.
*  Yeah. Because they don't want people to have a strong community with a family or a social arrangement that's fulfilling to them where they aren't dependent on not only services from the government,
*  but also they're not dependent on the government to tell them what is valuable and meaningful in life.
*  Right. And if the government tells you that it is meaningful and valuable in life to support the things that they support and you internalize that,
*  then you're just going to be led around by people and you'll be doing the things they want you to do.
*  And that's why they get very threatened when people say things that are even mildly suggest that people are happy having children or, you know, whatever the case may be.
*  They flip out and they go, well, you can't tell me what to do.
*  And it's like, well, he's telling you what to do.
*  But the idea that, you know, people having families is controversial or saying that it's a fulfilling way to live or, you know, to me, it's very strange when people kind of prey on your loneliness
*  and they prey on your vulnerability to shove a bunch of stuff down your throat that would be harder to sell you if you had a family and or a business or a house or a stake in your community.
*  I don't think they want you to have a stake in any of those things.
*  Right. And so logically, as they achieve more power, they will have to get people to go along with these things.
*  That's right.
*  And the way they do that is through forming these narratives.
*  They have the counter those narratives is the popularity of podcasts because the narratives, like if they only had the mainstream media, they would be so much further ahead.
*  That's right.
*  Imagine if they only if like there was never anything on the Internet other than websites and email.
*  Nobody ever figured out social media.
*  Yeah.
*  So nobody ever figured out like we'd have a news on the ground in the Ukraine right now.
*  I'm not even kidding.
*  We probably would.
*  If they was just the mainstream media, we would have boots on the ground in the Ukraine currently.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  A thousand percent.
*  I'm telling you, I'm as sure of anything as that fact.
*  Tell me it wasn't one of the wildest things, the campaign when Dick Cheney endorsed Kamala Harris and the left was like, yay.
*  Well, it proves it proves that it is now a raw power grab and that no one cares about anything.
*  Right.
*  And, you know, I've seen I've lived long enough now to see the left.
*  Admonish the CIA and the FBI and now cheerlead for the CIA and the FBI.
*  I mean, you know, in 2003, you would you would you would see seething op eds about the power of Dick Cheney Halliburton, the military, the defense contractors, Iraq, the quagmire.
*  You know, remember that word that no one uses anymore to describe a foreign entanglement thing.
*  All of those people that supported the Iraq war all reinvented themselves as Democrats and now have jobs at MSNBC.
*  Some of them have jobs in the Biden administration.
*  Some of them have jobs in center right or center left think tanks in Washington, D.C.
*  And all of those people, they cared.
*  Dick Cheney has a lot more in common with a lot of the people that are running the Democratic Party, obviously than he does with their voters.
*  Their voters loathe Dick Cheney.
*  The people who run that party don't hate him as much as you'd think.
*  Yeah, that's that's a scary thought.
*  Very.
*  Did you see Liz Cheney on The View and Whoopi Goldberg?
*  What was she saying?
*  She should be the head of the CIA.
*  Yeah, no, I mean, it's it's it's hilarious.
*  Can you imagine?
*  She said something crazy like that.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, what are you doing?
*  I thought you guys didn't like that stuff.
*  I thought you guys were the anti-Iraq war people.
*  I thought you guys were the anti Weapons of Mass Destruction people.
*  Liz Cheney for Kamala Harris's attorney general.
*  Attorney general.
*  Wow.
*  Whoopi Goldberg begs for it.
*  That's what it is.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, this is a weaponization of the justice system.
*  It's crazy.
*  The whole thing is so weird.
*  It's so weird.
*  People abandon what it used to be to be a leftist.
*  It used to be uncomfortable discussions are good.
*  It's good to be able to have communication with people you disagree with.
*  Free speech is imperative.
*  Right.
*  It used to be that education should be objective and it's very important.
*  And you counter bad ideas with good ideas.
*  Well, it just became untenable, I think.
*  I think leftism was driven out of the sphere.
*  Well, it just went so far left.
*  It became a different thing.
*  Yeah, but it became left in a way that wasn't about workers' rights or economic
*  justice.
*  It became left in a way about like aesthetic identity politics that prevented any
*  discussions about CEO pay or health care or anything like that.
*  It just became.
*  I think they're really enthusiastic people about that ideology.
*  Things are pretty good.
*  Yeah.
*  I think there's a lot of people where things are good enough in their lives to worry
*  about whether we have a trans Batman.
*  100%.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think that's the thing.
*  I think a lot of the enthusiastic proponents of that stuff believe things are great and
*  they're only getting better.
*  Yeah.
*  And to sell a campaign.
*  And listen, she may win.
*  It's early in the day.
*  But to sell a campaign on the word joy is utterly insane.
*  It's also kind of a revenge of the nerds thing too, because it's a complete polar
*  shift of identity hierarchies.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, the people that were like the weirdos and the freaks, the trans people and
*  the, you know, all of a sudden those people are at the top of this hierarchy of oppression
*  and celebrated above all.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's also used to be those are the ones that are cast out of society.
*  But it's also like this idea that you need to keep identifying ways to divide people.
*  Right.
*  And there's no other there's no better way to do it than to claim that everybody
*  threatens everyone else.
*  I agree with you.
*  But here's the question.
*  Is this a natural thing?
*  Is this like a natural thing that humans do when they find a vulnerability in a social
*  system?
*  They attach themselves to it, whether it's white guys pretending to be black, you know,
*  a couple of those, you know, those kind of situations.
*  We have like, there's there seems to be people attach themselves to something and then
*  they sort of subvert it.
*  But do you think it would have existed anyway?
*  Do you think that someone has a vested interest in keeping us divided?
*  And so that these these social issues, like whatever it is that comes up, like whether
*  it's BLM, like any kind of social movement that creates disruption.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you think that those are engineered and those are injected into the system to make
*  people have things to fight over?
*  I think there's a balance.
*  I think that there's organic rifts and fissures in society that allow certain
*  sentiments to bubble to the surface like BLM, like the war in Gaza and the problems
*  and the protests that are happening there.
*  But the minute that stuff happens, I believe people seize on the opportunity and exploit
*  it and fund those things and bust people into those protests and exacerbate that moment.
*  Because it is, I think, a defining, you know, when Rahm Emanuel said never let a good
*  crisis go to waste.
*  You know what I mean?
*  That's such a crazy thing to say out loud.
*  When he said never let a good crisis go to waste, they are telling you, it's like when
*  Lindsey Graham says, I want that money.
*  Like, give me that money.
*  I don't want Putin having that money.
*  When they're saying it in front of your face.
*  When Rahm Emanuel says never let a good crisis go to waste, the whole ethos of that
*  statement is to seize on organic problems and exacerbate them and then inject whatever
*  agenda you have so that, you know, you can you can then wrestle more power away from
*  human beings.
*  100 percent. 100 percent.
*  That's well said.
*  It's like it's crazy to watch because when I grew up, I grew up in the 90s.
*  It was a time of like Doc Martens and fucking people drinking fish bowl sized cappuccinos
*  and fucking coffee houses and fucking everybody was weird.
*  And it was there was a individualism in the 90s.
*  Kurt Cobain and fucking people in Seattle killing themselves and making great music
*  and rap and all this shit and flannel.
*  And you remember it and fucking but there was an individualism in the 90s that was kind
*  of like I remember, you know, my parents saying me once, like a friend of mine did something
*  stupid and they go, well, if you jumped off a bridge, are you going to do it?
*  It's like there was just this idea that you didn't have to go along with everybody else
*  standing apart from the crowd made you unique and an individual and good.
*  And it meant that you had value.
*  Yeah. Nirvana killed hair bands because of that.
*  Yeah. Hair bands became silly.
*  Right. Right.
*  There's no idea that I've seen attacked more than that.
*  Being a free thinking individual is coming under fire and has over the last few decades,
*  like I've never seen the coordinated attempt to make you think not only do you have to
*  agree with everyone, that you're responsible for everybody, that what's good for you is
*  good for them or what's good for them is good for you and that we're all in it together.
*  And all of these things and none of it is from a place of like, let's feed the poor.
*  None of it's from a place of like, let's help.
*  All of it's from a very weird, nefarious place of like we move as a block.
*  We are one consciousness.
*  And again, not in the Bill Hicks good way, in the way of like, we're going to condemn
*  the people we dislike, we're going to expel them and cast them out.
*  And then we're going to reward the people who will come along with us.
*  Because again, we are this, you know, blob of shit that is just picking people up as
*  we go. But I miss those days of kind of being like, yeah, man, who cares?
*  Like you think one way, I think another way.
*  And it's not the end of the world.
*  Now it's the end of the world.
*  There was less influences.
*  You think about the influences like I grew up in the I was in high school in the 80s.
*  So in the 80s, what we had was whatever was on the radio, whatever was on MTV when that
*  came out, was like, oh, my God, MTV.
*  Yeah. And what you saw on television at night, when usually watching TV with your family
*  after dinner or something, you have very little access to the rest of the world.
*  And now you're inundated constantly 24 7.
*  And there's a bunch of people that you wish you were.
*  But people that you wish.
*  I wish I looked like her.
*  I wish I was tall as him.
*  I wish I had the money that she has.
*  Everyone will look at that car he's got.
*  It's the same shit.
*  And everybody gets locked into this.
*  This fucking weird voyeurism.
*  Yeah. Voyeurism, narcissism beyond.
*  It's probably more like habitual narcissist today than probably ever before.
*  How many people that cannot afford houses are watching people buy mansions on TV?
*  There's 20 shows about, you know, people buying houses.
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, you know, famous real estate channels on Instagram that are just showing
*  you houses you could never fucking afford.
*  And half of them suck anyway.
*  If you saw them in person, just like the people on Instagram, but like this weird voyeuristic
*  thing. Again, it's part of the flattening of everybody with technology where people
*  individualism has been likened to being heartless or soulless or uncaring and that you
*  are not invested in the welfare and well-being of others, which is not true, by the way.
*  Thinking freely does not mean you don't care about people.
*  It means you're not going to swallow narratives that the Defense Department has handed to
*  MSNBC. That doesn't mean you want people to live in the street.
*  Exactly. But this is, you know, people just don't like that idea.
*  We're just a collectivist mindset now.
*  We're like people. You have to be on the same page with everybody.
*  Well, I think it's inevitable.
*  And I think it's moving us towards a very uncomfortable reality that most people are
*  not willing to even look at.
*  But we're becoming a different species.
*  We're becoming a different thing.
*  That's interesting. I think that's true.
*  Yeah. I mean, I think that's one of the side effects of plastics and all the hormonal
*  effects that people are having because of this.
*  All the phthalates and people's bloodstreams.
*  I think it's an effect of staring at screens all the time, becoming accustomed to staring
*  at screens, preferring interactions online to people in person because they make you
*  anxious.
*  Well, that's why people, you know, this is that's such a great point.
*  People now talk about all the time like, why doesn't anything feel the same?
*  Right.
*  No city feels the way it did five years ago.
*  And I think one of the reasons is because we live so much of our life now digitally.
*  There's that. But then there's the veil of a controlled society that completely collapsed
*  during covid. That's right.
*  The veil of there's someone who understands how the system works and they're running it
*  efficiently. That's why the subway is on time.
*  That's why the streets are clean.
*  It's because someone's running it and they're doing a good job.
*  And then also something happens and these people tell you everything has to shut down
*  for a year and a half in L.A.
*  And you're like, what are you talking about?
*  Like how why are we poor now?
*  Why is everybody broke? Why is it dangerous?
*  Why are cars on fire?
*  Why are they smashing into these stores?
*  No one's doing anything about it.
*  Like the veil got completely removed.
*  So L.A. seems vulnerable now.
*  Like when I go through L.A., it seems vulnerable.
*  It seems like a beaten kid.
*  Like there's something about it.
*  There's a real dark. There was always a darkness there.
*  Now I spend so much less time there because there's just this foreboding hellish reality
*  that just I don't know what it is, but it's like everyone's on edge.
*  It's a dissolving of an illusion.
*  It's dissolving of an illusion.
*  The illusion is a sophisticated functional society.
*  Well, it was also a place that think about this.
*  Los Angeles was built on the manufacturing reality.
*  Yes, for a long time.
*  Yes. Yes.
*  And the ability to do that now has been greatly diminished.
*  And the magic of the movies and this idea that you can fully suspend disbelief and all these things.
*  I think a lot of that is has had a real impact on that place because the inability,
*  you know, they used to be able to make a movie that would convince you about an event.
*  They would do a drive home a narrative through a movie.
*  They've done this a million times.
*  Yeah. Now, by the time they do that, there's 10 documentaries on YouTube.
*  There's been a million podcasts.
*  There's been. Yeah.
*  So they've lost control.
*  And Hollywood was really this myth making institution that and it was all built on very.
*  And listen, they made a lot of great stuff, a lot of movies we all love.
*  But a lot of it was built on like the exploitation of women, of children, all these horrible things.
*  That have now been unearthed. Right.
*  Every documentary is crazy to watch.
*  Now, it's like, remember that 90s show you watched and you go, Jesus, no.
*  And they're like, those kids were kept in a cage and fed like dogs.
*  You're like, God damn it.
*  Like nothing you enjoy.
*  Like the Nickelodeon stuff. It's crazy.
*  It's bananas. You know, it makes sense.
*  It makes sense. Yeah.
*  Because you have vulnerable people without a lot.
*  There's nobody who cares about people in that town.
*  And the only people that have credibility in that town are people that have made other people a lot of money.
*  Right. And those are the people that were able to get away with it and do whatever the hell they wanted.
*  So that town's just in deep trouble.
*  Well, it's just dark. It's dark.
*  It's darker now also.
*  And one of the things that happened during Covid was when you shut down production for a year and a half
*  and then no one goes to the movies for a year and a half.
*  Habit is broken. Habit's broken.
*  Habit's broken. Date nights not go to the movies anymore.
*  I was in Joker 2, which just came out.
*  It's the worst film that's ever been made.
*  It's the worst film. It's actually not so bad.
*  It's the worst film ever made.
*  Why?
*  Well, you think they did it on purpose?
*  No, it's a I think what happened after the first Joker was there was a lot of like talk like,
*  oh, this was loved by incels.
*  This was loved by the wrong kinds of people.
*  And they sent the wrong kinds of mail rage, nihilism, you know, all these think pieces.
*  Right.
*  And then I think what if we went the other way?
*  And now they have Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga tap dancing to a point where it's insane.
*  But is it possible that he didn't want to make a sequel?
*  And then he said, no, I know Tarantino said that.
*  I mean, it's a quarter.
*  It's a quarter billion.
*  They did that with if that's true.
*  It's the most immoral thing I've ever seen in my life or brilliant, brilliant protest.
*  I don't think it's a brilliant protest.
*  Would it be fun, though?
*  I don't know. It's a waste of everybody's time.
*  Just make a good movie.
*  You could have done it.
*  You know, just get out the foot. Stop dancing.
*  What do you think?
*  What would motivate them to make a movie that's that because they wanted?
*  Because it's hubris.
*  Number one, the idea that you could that people love it so much to accept it in any version of it.
*  Do you think you would like it if it wasn't connected to the original joke?
*  No, no, it has no plot.
*  It has no plot.
*  We would sit on state.
*  We would sit there.
*  Me and these other guys were all dressed in these fucking security outfits because we're working at the Arkham Asylum.
*  And I would turn to one of them and we'd hear this crap.
*  And I'd go, what the fuck is this?
*  And they go, this is going to bomb, man.
*  They go, this is the worst thing.
*  We would talk about it at lunch.
*  We go, what is the plot?
*  Is there a plot?
*  I don't know.
*  I think he falls in love with her in the prison.
*  Is it worth going to see because it's bad?
*  It's not even hate watchable.
*  That's how terrible it is.
*  But is it one of those things like showgirls?
*  No.
*  It's so bad you could watch it?
*  No, because it's like you're sitting there and there's these people, you know, in the theater and they're all confused.
*  And I'm watching their reactions and they're all like staring and everything.
*  And like it starts like, oh, it's raining and it's Arkham Asylum.
*  And you're like, OK, cool.
*  And then there's a moment where Joaquin Phoenix just goes, for once in my life, I have someone who needs me.
*  And then you just and he starts, he just becomes a fucking musical.
*  But hold on. Let me back this up.
*  Yeah. Let me back this up.
*  Don't you remember when Joaquin Phoenix went on Letterman and he had like this?
*  Yes.
*  He had some crazy fake persona.
*  Yes.
*  Like he did something where he pretended to lose his mind.
*  Yes. A rapper or something.
*  Right. Yes.
*  What was he doing?
*  I don't know. He was like.
*  What did he do for a while, Jamie?
*  Yeah, he did. This is better than Joker.
*  He was going to pursue a music career.
*  This was 2009.
*  You've got a nice beard going.
*  Oh, yeah. Thank you.
*  How is that, the beard?
*  In my way.
*  Well, is it comfortable? Is it itchy?
*  Is it are you pleased with it?
*  I'm OK with it and I make me feel weird about it.
*  I'm sorry.
*  That's a long interview.
*  That's OK, man. Letterman was a he was a wizard.
*  He was great.
*  He was so good. He's the best, in my opinion, of those guys.
*  Thousand percent.
*  He's just so good at.
*  It's a lovely film, really.
*  Now, go back before that, because he's wrapping it up.
*  So but Joaquin Phoenix was acting weird.
*  And so people decided, oh, Joaquin Phoenix has lost his mind.
*  Right. Like the interview.
*  And they kind of people went cool on him.
*  And then he did like a documentary showing that he was like playing a character for a while.
*  Right. Is that what he was doing?
*  I think so. Yeah. So it's just like an art piece.
*  He was. Yes.
*  This could have been a two hundred and fifty million dollar practical joke.
*  That's what I'm saying. Maybe it was the same guy.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Maybe it's a fun quarter billion dollar practical joke.
*  If you're Joaquin Phoenix, you're the fucking king of the hill. Right.
*  You're like one of the biggest movie stars in the country.
*  You're the guy from Gladion. Sure.
*  It's like he can kind of trick Hollywood dummies.
*  I think they thought that this would be received differently.
*  I don't. I think they thought I think they're maybe in a little bit of a bubble.
*  I think Joaquin Phoenix is alone in his house right now laughing that he pulled that off.
*  I don't think he even knows he did it.
*  But it's the same guy that did this thing.
*  I know. He's like. He's crazy.
*  I think he's an actor, so I don't think he exists.
*  I think it's just like what the new part is. He becomes that.
*  Joaquin Phoenix tells Letterman, I hope spoof didn't offend you.
*  Actor apologize, the late show host for awkward interview that features in new film.
*  I'm still here.
*  So he was doing that as a part of the film.
*  That's the idea.
*  So the film is that he was acting like he was a crazy person.
*  Yeah, it was like a documentary about him making music.
*  All they had to do.
*  All they had to do was blow some shit up, have them escape from prison.
*  Have them do something.
*  Get a get a couple of scenes in the courthouse or something.
*  Look at this here.
*  It says throughout Phoenix was trailed by actor Casey Affleck,
*  who is his brother in law and a film crew.
*  The result, I'm still here, was released this month as an ostensible documentary
*  about the corrosive effects of celebrity and wealth
*  on a now drug addled actor in the profession since he was a child.
*  So the idea is that they're they did a documentary on how fucked up he was.
*  And so he went on Letterman to act fucked up.
*  Right. But I think it was a goof.
*  No, it was a goof. Right.
*  OK, elaborate spoof.
*  It was all an elaborate.
*  OK, it was Affleck who confirmed what many suspected,
*  that it was all an elaborate spoof last week, telling New York Times
*  that Phoenix had given a terrific performance as the performance of his career.
*  So he just acted like he was drugged out and out of his fucking mind for a spoof.
*  Yeah. Like this is the kind of guy that would trick those Hollywood dumbasses
*  into making a musical sequel to the Joker.
*  If he did that, then that's great. I don't know.
*  I know that he was raised in a cult when he was a little kid and his name was Leaf.
*  So whatever he does, God bless him. He's a brilliant actor.
*  He changed it from Leaf to Joaquin.
*  Yeah, it's going the other way.
*  You know, I mean, the guy's brilliant.
*  But the movie was just I mean, God, was it rough?
*  It's crazy because the first one was so good.
*  He was so believable.
*  The first one was really great.
*  And then the second one just went.
*  And if you were a fan of the first one, the second one was like
*  kind of, I think, insane to a fan of the first one.
*  Well, it wouldn't be the first time.
*  Yeah. You know, it would be like if Godfather 2
*  was about like the Corleone family going legit.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Right. Right. No one like an apologizing for the mafia.
*  Right. You're like they were like, hey, I'm sorry we did all this shit.
*  Yeah, we now have a bakery.
*  It just it went completely the other way. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Well, I didn't see it, but I heard it sucked.
*  Anything does. Has anyone won?
*  I get something.
*  I got one minute before the first polls close.
*  One minute. Oh, five.
*  I mean, I think there's definitely got to be some.
*  I'm waiting. I'm checking every website.
*  Definitely stop.
*  Someone like exit polls and all that.
*  There's got to be. That's what we're waiting for.
*  I mean, there's only like three or four states that close.
*  Then North Carolina is early, right?
*  The only discussions I can see is what's going on in Pennsylvania.
*  What's going on? So what's going on?
*  I don't know. Trump said that there's some cheating going on.
*  Well, he's certainly going to say that.
*  If there is, then there is.
*  When he was on the podcast, I wish he could just rattle off.
*  I'm open to it, too. Just tell me what it is.
*  Tell me what it is. I hear you.
*  It's like there's so much evidence, so much evidence.
*  We have so much evidence of cheating.
*  But a lot of people close to him say there isn't.
*  Who's those people?
*  And how many of those people are covering their ass?
*  I don't know. But Mike Pence, probably.
*  See, that's what I'm talking about.
*  That guy is he covering his ass.
*  Yeah. He just endorsed Kamala Harris, too.
*  Yeah, they wanted to kill him.
*  There was people that went to on January 6th.
*  They were looking for him, allegedly and supposedly.
*  No, no, no, for sure. But I'm wondering, like,
*  I'm open to the idea that there was fraud, but like a lot of top people,
*  like people that were in his orbit don't talk about like he talks about it.
*  Right. But OK, so let's take Pence out of the equation
*  because he's probably salty.
*  They're probably well, for sure.
*  But I'm saying like Pence didn't if there was evidence, wouldn't he?
*  Like Pence have said, all right, let's not certify it. No.
*  That is a crazy thing to do. Right.
*  For the vice president stand up and say, I mean, you're set.
*  That's essentially like you're you're getting ready for a fucking major conflict.
*  Gotcha. You know, I'm saying, don't you think?
*  Like, no, for sure. I just we just need someone.
*  That guy doesn't want that kind of heat. That's not Trump.
*  For sure. We need someone outside of Trump to verify it.
*  Yeah. Like, who would that be that you would trust implicitly?
*  Well, you would just need to see evidence.
*  You'd just be like, if I made a claim about anything, I'd have to provide evidence.
*  But let's let's imagine that you were working with someone like Trump
*  and you're like a top guy and you know there's no election interference.
*  You know that the election integrity was 100 percent.
*  You know that he's not telling the truth.
*  How could you stay with him?
*  How could you stay with him without laying it out to him?
*  Like, sir, can I just have an hour of your time?
*  Well, I think I'm going to explain to you what the problem with saying that it's rigged.
*  Here's where you can say it's rigged. OK, for sure.
*  There was 100 percent involvement in social media companies
*  suppressing information that would have changed the results,
*  for sure, at least in some percentage in one way or the other.
*  Yeah. And listen, I'm open to it being that there was fuckery in other ways.
*  I just think that just like anything else, you can't take someone's word.
*  Well, he says there's a he just didn't have it on. Sure. Yeah.
*  But I would imagine that if there's something you've been talking about for three years,
*  like if you ask me, yeah, important stuff in my like even stuff like
*  you asked me about, like, jujitsu, right?
*  I could tell you all these different things that have happened.
*  I could tell you why this is important and why that's not important.
*  And that's like a minor thing relatively to you lost the president of the United States.
*  That's a major thing.
*  And so if you knew that you had been cheated to the point
*  where you're willing to talk openly about the fact that they cheated,
*  they cheated me. This is how I know.
*  I would want to be able to rattle off. Yes, he should.
*  I would want to be able to say we found there was 25000 inconsistent votes in this place.
*  We know that there was manipulation of this thing or that thing.
*  Tell me you should have that ready to go.
*  Sure. Ready to go.
*  Because that's a it's a thing that we don't want to think is true.
*  But if we're going to put our fucking necks out there and agree with it
*  or at least entertain it, you have to have those got to have it laid out.
*  Bullet points. Yes.
*  You got to have it laid out.
*  But I think he's just so fucking busy.
*  He's probably got other people doing that.
*  And they're all telling them that it's stolen.
*  And he just listens to them and doesn't doesn't have that stuff like ready to go.
*  Well, yeah. I mean, listen, Steve Bannon brought up an interesting point
*  the other night on Megyn Kelly, where he said
*  they had lost by a certain amount of votes.
*  Or Biden had gotten however many more votes in Obama, whatever.
*  But also the Republicans picked up like a ton of House seats,
*  which is there's something fishy about that, where it's like all these people
*  are just voting Republican down and then Biden.
*  So he there were there were there were things.
*  And again, I'm not talking about the veracity of it. I'm just saying.
*  There's some suspicious.
*  There were some suspicious things that he felt was fishy or tricky or whatever.
*  Now, I don't know.
*  Again, this has been a thing that's been over the heads of.
*  Whereas you have people on the right that go, it was stolen
*  and don't know any of the evidence. Right.
*  Then there are people on the left that go, he's an election.
*  He's an election denier, which they also did with the Russiagate stuff for years.
*  Right. Said that he was installed in a compromise or whatever.
*  And then I think there's just got to be like you said, there's just
*  there's going to be more information about whatever happened. Right.
*  Well, the idea of breaking into voting machines
*  goes way back to the HBO documentary Hacking Democracy about George Bush.
*  Remember that about the Diebold machines? That's right.
*  And the fear in this is back when I was a hardcore lefty.
*  The fear was that the Republicans were going to be able to rig
*  the vote with these machines, because the people who made those machines
*  were contributors to the Republican Party. Right.
*  Now, what's the other way?
*  Now, now the right is constantly worried about Dominion.
*  Well, they were that loss. Dominion won that lawsuit. Right.
*  Against Fox News, correct?
*  Against Fox.
*  Because Fox was saying things that it didn't have evidence for.
*  How's the best way to do it?
*  Is it paper ballots, voter ID? Right.
*  You have to have an ID.
*  Well, I would imagine, first of all, of course, you should have to have an ID.
*  The only reason why you wouldn't want someone to have an ID is because you want to cheat.
*  You have to have an ID for everything.
*  You got to get a fucking membership at Costco.
*  Why not? Let's do that.
*  Because maybe you lose your ID that day,
*  but maybe you can go in and say, here's my finger. Why not? Why not?
*  I mean, some biometric thing.
*  Yeah, biometric could be easy.
*  It could be something you register for on your cell phone.
*  They always have your face. Now you can just show up.
*  That's not hard to do in this day and age.
*  But the idea that you wouldn't want anyone to have ID,
*  that means you want people voting that shouldn't be voting.
*  And we know that that happens.
*  That's been proven that at least in certain circumstances,
*  people are voting that shouldn't be voting.
*  And the only reason why you would want that is because you want to cheat.
*  So the only reason why you would want no ID is so that you could cheat. Yeah.
*  So now I got to go, how much do you cheat?
*  So you're willing to cheat in that way.
*  You're willing to cheat where you are willing to block information
*  that would have changed the vote. Oh, they've always been willing to do that.
*  I think you're willing to cheat where you tell people they don't have to have ID.
*  They've always been willing to do that.
*  And then the right has been willing to do things to that compromise,
*  the integrity of things, for sure. 100 percent.
*  And you just got to figure out how to do like an actual election that is fair.
*  It's AI. And it's going to be President AI. Yeah.
*  I think we're going to give up government to artificial intelligence
*  once it's vastly superior to us. That makes sense.
*  Yeah, it does make sense.
*  But I think it's on our path.
*  What we're talking about before about people becoming more frail
*  and more like feeble and like the British people,
*  we talk about their teeth, you know what that's from?
*  It's from your job.
*  All British people don't get mad at me.
*  Wouldn't when people have small jaws like in your. Yeah.
*  They all have scurvy.
*  It's it's literally from eating mushy food because they have bones.
*  They are mushy peas and they have scurvy.
*  Your bones aren't as thick anymore because they're not chewing meat.
*  You're not breaking things down with your teeth.
*  You don't have to crap.
*  So your jaw, like over time, becomes smaller and smaller.
*  Interesting. Yeah.
*  There's actually a technique called mewing.
*  And this guy figured out this technique where you can change the shape
*  of your jaw with exercises and tongue pressure.
*  And that there's other guys that I have a thing that I use at home.
*  It's like a weight lift with my jaw.
*  It sounds crazy. Yeah.
*  But there's these weights.
*  It's like a rubber ball and you put it in your teeth
*  and you fucking mash down on your teeth and it builds your jaw muscles
*  and it makes your jaw more square.
*  Like literally works. You do jaw exercises.
*  And that's the reason why these people for a long time
*  were eating mashed potatoes and fucking gruel.
*  Like they're poor as shit.
*  Their jaws all shrunk. Interesting.
*  Yeah. It's a good theory.
*  It makes sense. Yeah.
*  Like you would need like that's one of the reasons why people have to get
*  their wisdom teeth removed.
*  Our jaws are getting smaller.
*  We're not like breaking down tough meat anymore.
*  So the shape of our face looks different.
*  So eventually there's just going to be a bunch of AI government.
*  We're going to slim down these tiny jawed bitches in there.
*  Look at aliens, right? Look at the aliens.
*  They always have the little tiny jaws.
*  Yeah. Big ass fucking head.
*  That's us. Ten years are just going to be unreal.
*  We're going to be those things.
*  I think those things that we see, the people keep seeing,
*  even if they're not real, we become that's us in the future.
*  The grace. Yeah.
*  We have sexless, genderless cyborgs.
*  Right. Or maybe even completely artificial by that point.
*  Maybe we realize that consciousness can actually be captured
*  and that we all share it.
*  And there's no benefit whatsoever in being an individual.
*  That is just a cheat code that the primate used in order to think of itself
*  as important enough to continue to innovate to the point
*  where it creates artificial intelligence.
*  Now, if she had run on that instead of the word joy, I would have voted for her.
*  I think that's where we're going.
*  I think that's what all this I would have been in transit.
*  Yeah, I think that's why male hormone levels are dropping through the floor,
*  which is all a big part because of sedentary lifestyle
*  and also because of these estrogens and plastics and all these different things
*  that are fucking with people's reproductive cycles.
*  Do you think we've been here before?
*  In what way?
*  In this, do you think humanity's ever been in this spot before?
*  I think humanity's been in a different but similar spot.
*  OK, I think that's what ancient Egypt was all about.
*  There's no way that level of sophistication could be achieved
*  unless those people were beyond what anybody is thinking about
*  from people that lived 5000, 6000 years ago.
*  There's just no way. There's literally no way.
*  Because God figure into this at all.
*  Well, I don't know if God's real, God's everything.
*  Right. God's real. God's the universe.
*  And there's like a powerful creative force that didn't just made Earth
*  and bunch of stupid people that were in a garden and this bitch
*  talked to the snake and an apple. Right.
*  No, God made the whole thing.
*  That's there's a real God. He made the whole thing.
*  And the whole thing is made by what? It's made by the universe. Right.
*  The universe makes itself right.
*  So the universe is probably God.
*  So, yeah, God plays into it.
*  But I think there's a direction that primates go in
*  and it goes into like ever more weak and feeble,
*  but much more capable with tools.
*  And it happens with some like bonobos.
*  They're super peaceful. They just fuck each other.
*  Somehow or another, there's chimpanzees that are murderous monsters
*  that just run around, killing each other, killing each other.
*  Tribal wars, killing monkeys.
*  And then there's other ones just fuck each other and chill.
*  Yeah. Like, what is that?
*  Like, there's just like that seems like they're a little bit more evolved.
*  Right. That's probably how humans were.
*  And then humans eventually figured out tools and. Right.
*  And we became what we are now.
*  Well, we're going to keep going in that direction.
*  So we're so much weaker than even a monkey.
*  You're like a monkey will tear your fucking head off.
*  Like we're so feeble and we're going to get feebler.
*  We're going to be smarter, way smarter.
*  Yeah, we're going to be communicating completely with our minds.
*  We'll probably never need sounds anymore.
*  We'll probably never use devices.
*  Everything will happen in your mind.
*  What's the fun of all of that?
*  What's the fun of being a chimp?
*  Is that fun? You want to throw shit for the rest of your life and eat bananas?
*  Get the fuck out of here. I want to drive a Cadillac.
*  I want to watch a fucking movie.
*  Yeah, but I want to call people on my phone that are nowhere near me.
*  I know. So what's the purpose of being a person?
*  You're filled with anxiety.
*  You're worried about who's going to win the election.
*  You're trying to stay off drugs, but you want a cigarette.
*  Right. What's the point?
*  What's the point? That's stupidity when you can be an enlightened being
*  that flies through space with your mind.
*  Oh, well, I never thought about it like that.
*  If Lazar is telling the truth, Babazar, the guy that supposedly back
*  engineered these crafts, if that guy's telling the truth, he said there's no
*  controls inside those devices when they are powering them with their mind.
*  There's some connection between the entity
*  and the device that's not an interface.
*  Like we think of like a joystick and buttons.
*  So they're just so evolved. It's a different thing.
*  It's a different thing. But it's probably a different thing.
*  It's probably what we become because we didn't always have clothes.
*  Well, of course. Think about clothes and shoes and your silly sunglasses.
*  Yeah. All this stuff.
*  This is all they're beautiful.
*  I'm still silly because I don't have a course when I have a month.
*  Oh, well, you're right. We're advanced. We're advanced.
*  So we're so much different than chimps.
*  It's a big evolution. Didn't end with thumbs.
*  It's our distant, distant, distant cousin.
*  But if you look at them and you look at us like, what is going on with them?
*  Why do they have to have clothes like what is that?
*  Wearing coats and jackets and shit. They all have shoes.
*  No one works. Walks barefoot at all. Right.
*  Like we're softening ourselves up. Right.
*  We're like literally putting a nice shell over ourselves.
*  So we become a fucking squid, like some.
*  So usually you come back to this planet in 50 years if it's still here.
*  Robots. Robots.
*  I think no more biological life in terms of humans.
*  Wildlife will exist. All that stuff will exist. No more people.
*  I think really. Yeah. I think people are the cocoon.
*  We make the electronic butterfly. It comes out of the cocoon.
*  We don't know why we're making the cocoon, but we're making the cocoon.
*  Everybody gets the newest phone. Everybody has the newest TV.
*  Look, it's got Wi-Fi built in. So do you get a skin suit?
*  You don't even you're not even going to be biological.
*  I think we're going to give up. Are we going to be able to?
*  This is what I think they're going to do.
*  I think they're going to integrate first.
*  I think we're going to be cyborgs.
*  It's going to start with things like. Can I get that now?
*  You can get. Can I sign up for it now?
*  I don't want to wait.
*  But you don't want to be an early adopter.
*  Like those girls who got those lip jobs.
*  I'll take the chance.
*  Many of them are in Miami. They're fine. These whores.
*  I will take the thing now.
*  It just sounds fun. It sounds good.
*  I want to be in a vehicle without communicating with my mind.
*  So there was a guy who branched off.
*  He was one of the original guys with Neuralink.
*  He branched off the form, his own company, and they just created
*  an implant that allows blind people to see.
*  And so you can find that, Jamie.
*  I think it is like you wear goggles.
*  I think it's like there's a whole thing.
*  I don't think it's like as simple as they put it in your head.
*  But again, cell phone used to be a suitcase to you carried around.
*  Yeah. And you had to like open the suitcase to get your phone out
*  and pull the antenna out.
*  Now it's this little tiny thing that you'd be on for 24 hours in a row.
*  Watch movies.
*  But this is eventually going to be inside of us.
*  Yeah. And then that's a good point, because then you go the next step.
*  We had the first Neuralink patient on and interesting.
*  And he controls a cursor with his mind.
*  And he said when he plays games, it's like a cheat because he's got like an aimbot.
*  So everywhere he sees is where the cursor goes.
*  He doesn't have to go hand to eye.
*  Eye goes to cursor instantaneously.
*  So he's like, I don't miss.
*  I just like you look at where you want something to go and it just goes there.
*  That's it. He's controlling it with his mind.
*  So there's going to be over the next however many years, different generations.
*  You know, it's just like iPhones.
*  Yes, for sure.
*  Science Corporation.
*  Imagine that's your name. Science Corporation.
*  How what how uncreative?
*  Is this the Chinese front?
*  Science Corporation.
*  That's a fake science corporation, a biotech startup
*  launched by a Neuralink co-founder claims it has achieved a breakthrough
*  in brain computer interface technology that can help patients with severe vision
*  loss in preliminary clinical trials.
*  Legally blind patients who lost their central vision
*  receive the company's retina implants, which restored their eyesight
*  and even allowed them to read books and recognize faces.
*  The startup announced last week.
*  Whoa.
*  To my knowledge, it's the first time that the restoration of the ability
*  to fluently read has ever been definitively shown in blind patients.
*  CEO Max Hodak, who is the president of Neuralink
*  before founding Science Corp, said in a statement, Holy shit.
*  What does it look like, Jamie?
*  Show what it looks like.
*  I want to see what it looks like.
*  Sounds crazy.
*  Science Corporation. Good luck finding that on Google.
*  What are you going to find? Oh, it's in the first one.
*  Prima. All right. What does it look like?
*  So this is the implants. Where is it?
*  So where does it go? Oh, look, they're showing you.
*  So they stick it back there, the back of your fucking eyeball.
*  Look how tiny it is.
*  Holy shit, man.
*  I love how, by the way, it's just Americans are like, look,
*  you'll be able to see the oven.
*  So he has to wear glasses.
*  And the glasses work with that implant.
*  And now he can see things. This is crazy.
*  It's said for people who lost their vision,
*  you have to already have some sort of they couldn't like.
*  You got to have some vision.
*  Yeah, you have to know a basis of why I don't know what things look like.
*  And how could you recognize someone's face if you never saw it before?
*  Well, you wouldn't until you saw them.
*  And then from then on, you'd be able to recognize their face.
*  These political texts are so crazy. They're still coming in.
*  What are you getting? Oh, I just this one.
*  You were to go. This woman had my phone named Janina.
*  And I guess she was a big Democratic donor or not.
*  You know, she's because they're like, Janina, we're panicked.
*  Can you please answer? Have you voted?
*  I'm like, oh, we're panicked.
*  Right. I go, I don't know what to do.
*  Janina, are you going with you fucking with her?
*  No, because it's just a bot.
*  This is what we're talking about. It's all AI.
*  It's just bots going like, please vote pan.
*  Yes or no. Are you a Republican?
*  Five thousand votes counted so far.
*  Only who won who won out of seventy five thousand.
*  I mean, I don't even know where they're from.
*  It's forty nine thousand for Trump.
*  Twenty four thousand for Harris.
*  So even now.
*  What is your what is your suspicion of what's going to happen?
*  What's your suspicion?
*  It was, you know, I think it will be him.
*  But I also thought that is very close.
*  And I think with Roe, that was a one X factor.
*  One hundred percent.
*  That was the only X factor I had thought about.
*  I think without that.
*  Not just Roe, but that thing that I brought up with JD Vance
*  was some people believe is true.
*  And apparently there might have been a case in Texas, Jamie.
*  I know you're Googling, but yeah, where we were talking about women
*  in a place where it's restrictive, like Texas has a six week law,
*  which is crazy because you don't even know you're pregnant in six weeks.
*  You barely missed your period. Right.
*  It's crazy, especially if your period is like not regular.
*  And then if you go to another state where abortion is legal,
*  and they find out they can prosecute you.
*  Right. So that's the type of stuff I think that could she could win on that.
*  Right. Because that is crazy.
*  Well, it's not it's not just crazy.
*  It's gross. Here's why it's gross.
*  Not just because you shouldn't be able to tell people where the fuck to go
*  and where where they can go and do things that it's a legal medical procedure.
*  But imagine if you're a woman who gets pregnant and you have a miscarriage
*  and you go and visit your mom who lives in Oklahoma where abortion is legal.
*  And then you get questioned as to whether or not you had an illegal abortion.
*  You get. That that's a you imagine.
*  I know it's crazy. You lose your kid and you're fucking heartbroken.
*  And then one thing where I could see a groundswell of women
*  coming up for her and she could win.
*  Yeah, because that's for sure.
*  The idea of that is attached to these apps.
*  Right. So there's apps that women can use that track their ovulation.
*  Yeah. Right. So they track their menstrual cycles through these apps.
*  And if they get the data from these apps
*  and the apps show that you lost your period or you didn't have your menstrual cycle
*  and then you went to Oklahoma.
*  It doesn't mean anything, but you are going to let people
*  investigate people's bodies. No, it's crazy. It's crazy.
*  It's crazy. It's it's insane.
*  Because that's that's the worst direction it could head
*  because they made one headway Roe versus way they got rid of it.
*  So now it's up to the states.
*  Well, that makes it sketchy.
*  And now the states are going to prosecute people for traveling to other states.
*  Well, then now you're you're saying the state is in control of your body.
*  No, that's crazy. Your ability to go somewhere in America.
*  What did you agree with or don't agree with it?
*  He said he wasn't aware of that and we would want to do that. Right.
*  But I think that this is a thing that was brought up.
*  See if you can find that in Texas.
*  So the case I found in Texas, I don't think it had to do with out of state abortion.
*  I might be wrong, but it had to do with in state.
*  You know, Europe handles this all kind of well.
*  It's one of the things they do.
*  They just have like whatever their rule is and everyone's OK with it.
*  And it's just the thing is they have a restriction as well.
*  They do. We're talking about France.
*  I'm going to go to Europe where a woman's right to choose.
*  But they have restrictions.
*  But it makes sense that everyone no one cares.
*  It's like there's a certain time where you can't do it anymore
*  because it's viable outside the world.
*  It's not Bill Burr's bit. Yeah. Yeah.
*  You know, I think women should have a right to choose.
*  And I think you're killing the baby.
*  Like both those things are true.
*  Yeah. It's like it's just these issues.
*  They're the problem with some of these issues that can be solved.
*  And like when Fetterman said that thing about immigration, he goes,
*  yeah, nobody wants to solve it because it's good for everybody.
*  There is something to me that's about all of these issues
*  that seem weirdly like people are against any type of rational common ground.
*  I think you're right in that regard.
*  I think there's definitely some truth to that.
*  I think some people do want things solved, but I also don't want late term.
*  There are these things are these political beach balls.
*  They get tossed around a concert. Yeah.
*  And one of the ones that people were terrified of,
*  if they got rid of Roe v. Wade, the next one was gay marriage.
*  Yeah, because they were like, no, a marriage between a man and a woman.
*  And that was what people were worried that all this stuff is coming out of religion.
*  Well, I think a lot of it's going to go to states rights.
*  So I think where you live will determine a lot of your
*  freedom, freedom.
*  And that that I think they've said they don't care about gay marriage,
*  but I imagine that would come up.
*  And I imagine that.
*  Instagram does not want to give up half this stuff.
*  Right. Yeah. I don't believe in gay marriage.
*  No, neither do I. Marriage itself is minerals.
*  Yeah. Good for him.
*  I'm more with him on that in the mineral front.
*  But no, I think that, of course,
*  these things will probably go to popular votes.
*  And it's because people are uncomfortable with
*  the courts and telling them
*  that they have to believe a certain way or think a certain thing.
*  And that's the whole thing. It's like you can you can vote with your wallet.
*  You can vote with your feet. You can leave a state.
*  Obviously, I am for a woman's right to choose.
*  I am not an elected official in Missouri.
*  I have no power there. I do not live there.
*  I have no influence at all over a woman's body in Missouri,
*  positively or negatively. It's like there are things.
*  This is this crazy big country where, yes, I would agree that a lot of things.
*  But I also I didn't agree with a lot of things that they've done.
*  Wouldn't you if you wanted to?
*  This is an interesting way. You want to play for DHS?
*  Like if you wanted to get rid of the Republicans and you're a rhino,
*  you're like a sneaky fake republic. Yeah.
*  Wouldn't you like push to get rid of Roe v.
*  Way? Because one of the things that Roe v.
*  Way is going to do.
*  It has an effect. Yeah, I don't know how much.
*  Here's one thing that Roe v.
*  Way is going to do. Roe v.
*  Way is going to it's going to charge up a bunch of women who don't want men
*  telling them what to do.
*  So they're going to want to vote Democrat. Right.
*  And they're going to go out in large numbers.
*  And if you do that at the same time, you're shipping all these immigrants
*  into all these swing states. Right.
*  And then you have those folks. Yeah.
*  Join the Democratic Party, too.
*  So they're all voting Democrat, too.
*  Now you have a reason why you should want to take over
*  this red area and turn it blue because these fucking men are trying to tell
*  these women what they can and can't do.
*  It's like one more layer on the cake that you're allowed that you for sure.
*  Like the percentage support, you'll get more percentage support.
*  It's like a good idea if you are like a creepy puppet master
*  that was controlling the strings of civil unrest in the country.
*  The Democrats had said, listen, we're not allowing any gender experimentation
*  on kids until they're adults.
*  And we are not and we're going to enforce the border law.
*  And Biden had said, I'm serving one term.
*  And they had a primary. Trump probably wouldn't be back.
*  He's back because they opened the fucking door.
*  His main issue is immigration.
*  They literally exacerbated it.
*  Ten million illegals came over the border.
*  And then people are incredibly uncomfortable with their children
*  being indoctrinated in schools with this crap.
*  So I think he would have been back anyway.
*  He might have been back. I don't think they would have won.
*  I think they thought he ripped him off.
*  They ripped him off. I think he would have.
*  I think I think the reality is they've given him
*  on a silver platter his biggest issue, which is that people want a country.
*  Well, what do you think they would do to beat him?
*  So if he's back, if Biden does say that he steps down, who is running?
*  You know, a Federman's obviously not mentally there to run,
*  but a guy that has that you need a working class guy who goes,
*  we need a country.
*  We need to have a distinction between citizen and non-citizen.
*  The social contract has to be otherwise we have a social contract with no
*  it's invalidated completely when you're bringing people in from all over the world
*  and the government is promising them things and they're getting votes
*  and they're and they're they're replacing Americans in certain
*  manufacturing jobs or whatever.
*  You don't have any sense of a country.
*  And you need a country and you need a working class person
*  who's not condescending and somebody who goes,
*  look at the Tavistock Clinic in the UK that just closed.
*  Why? Because experimental transgender therapies for children
*  is a science that is not only not settled, but it is doing damage to people.
*  This is why that clinic clinic clinics full of progressives that said,
*  we're shutting this down because we're making a lot of fucking mistakes
*  that are irreversible and these are human beings.
*  If you take away those issues,
*  then the Republicans have to run on,
*  you know, an economic platform that may or may not be that popular. Right.
*  But the Democrats chose instead to elevate the eye
*  to talk about the most important thing is in America's diversity,
*  equity and inclusion.
*  They chose to convince everyone all of the capital,
*  the social capital that they spent convincing people
*  how important it was to support the Ukraine with no plan
*  and no end game and open ended and ditto, you know, whatever Israel wants to do.
*  And maybe we'll have to go into Iran and like to get all of that
*  and to explain that to people.
*  And they didn't even explain it that well, but they kept telling people
*  how important it was.
*  They could have easily, easily crafted a message that was
*  that was rational and sane.
*  All they had to be was because Trump is a lot.
*  And I think there's a lot of people in America that would have said, hey, man,
*  we should just move on. It's chaos. It's volatile.
*  Here's the question. Who's the spokesperson?
*  So I have a primary. Who would it be?
*  Gavin Newsom is not trusted.
*  No, it's got to be someone we barely know.
*  Harris is already the vice president.
*  So you have to choose her.
*  Well, it's like because if you're going to go with all that DEI stuff,
*  you can't just go all with it.
*  But here's the thing, if you're going to go all in with like this idea
*  that we need a woman of color who's the president.
*  Which is one of the things that they were saying all along.
*  He was going to do that.
*  And I was like, why not just have the best person? Right.
*  No, you have to have it.
*  It's OK. You've already accepted that.
*  You have her. She's the vice president.
*  She's been there for four years.
*  She knows how shit runs. Right. It's automatic.
*  It's automatic unless you change course and you realize
*  and someone competes against her.
*  You have a primary and you got to find.
*  I don't know. I don't know who that person is.
*  I don't know every Democrat in the country.
*  I don't know every Democrat, a congressman, governor, senator.
*  One person that stood that stands out like any person
*  that colors outside the lines like Tulsi Gabbard,
*  they get fucking ostracized.
*  Well, we have the lines have to change.
*  That's the problem.
*  The problem is the lines have to change.
*  You cannot be beholden to extremists.
*  And then on one side, you have the extremists on the other side.
*  You have these like corporate oligarchs that are
*  demanding fealty to foreign wars,
*  endless trade agreements that don't benefit workers,
*  you know, hollowing out the middle class.
*  And this was all stuff the Republicans were all about in the 80s.
*  And the Democrats were about in the 90s under NAFTA and stuff like that.
*  So if you transform the Democratic Party again into a workers party
*  with common sense, reasonable considerations,
*  and it's not based on religious fundamentalism
*  and it's not based on woke fundamentalism on the other side.
*  How do you get people out of that that are in that?
*  Where it's like part of their tribal identity?
*  Like, how do you get people to relinquish?
*  You need a figure that rejects it.
*  Like, I think you need somebody to reject it publicly.
*  When Bill Clinton had that Sister Soldier moment, right?
*  When Bill Clinton was a moment, the Sister Soldier moment
*  where she had she was a rapper or something.
*  She said something about American. He corrected her.
*  I forget exactly what it was.
*  But it's a it's a moment where Bill Clinton was running for president
*  and he went against and, you know, and establishes Bonifides as a,
*  you know, here we go. Yeah.
*  What was this?
*  I kind of remember this.
*  Sure. Let's play the video.
*  Let's stand up for what's always been best about the Rainbow Coalition,
*  which is people coming together across racial lines.
*  You talked about Mr.
*  Fields from Louisiana that you had here last night.
*  A great role model.
*  We don't have a lot of time to do this.
*  We don't have a lot of time.
*  You had a rap singer here last night named Sister Soldier.
*  I defend her right to express herself through music.
*  But her comments before and after Los Angeles were filled with the kind of
*  hatred that you do not honor today and tonight.
*  Just listen to this.
*  What she said.
*  She told the Washington Post about a month ago, and I quote,
*  If black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people?
*  So you're a gang member and you normally kill somebody.
*  Why not kill a white person?
*  Last year, she said, You can't call me or any black person anywhere in the world a racist.
*  We don't have the power to do to white people what white people have done to us.
*  And even if we did, we don't have that low down dirty nature.
*  If there are any good white people, I haven't met them.
*  Where are they? Right here in this room.
*  That's where they are.
*  I know she is a young person, but she has a big influence on a lot of people.
*  And when people say that, if you took the words white and black and you reversed them,
*  you might think David Duke was giving that speech.
*  Let me tell you, we all make mistakes and sometimes we're not as sensitive as we ought to be.
*  And we have an obligation, all of us to call attention to prejudice wherever we see it.
*  A few months ago, I made a mistake.
*  I joined a friend of mine and I played golf at a country club that didn't have any African American members.
*  I was criticized for doing it. You know what?
*  I was rightly criticized for doing it.
*  I made a mistake and I said I would never do that again.
*  And I think all of us have got to be sensitive to that.
*  We can't get anywhere in this country pointing the finger at one another across racial lines.
*  If we do that, we're dead and they will beat us.
*  Even in Reverend Jackson's new math of this election,
*  it's hard to get to a 34% solution or a 40% solution if the American people can be divided by race.
*  That's, if he ran on that today, he beats everybody.
*  This is what I mean.
*  In a landslide.
*  That's what I mean.
*  In a sensible.
*  That's what I mean.
*  That's what a Democrat used to be.
*  That's what I mean.
*  How good was that guy, by the way?
*  The best.
*  The best speaker.
*  And the best person.
*  But what I mean is that had Kamala Harris repudiated a lot of what happened in the madness of 2020, 2021,
*  all that stuff and said America is not a white supremacist country that is only set up to
*  terrorize people of color and minorities and that, you know, yes, we've had a
*  past that's been terrible, but we've made tons of progress.
*  And people should be rewarded in this country on the basis of their hard work,
*  their ability, their willingness to take risk, to, you know, you know, and we cannot have
*  a society that is arranged by people's tribal identity.
*  If she'd come out and gave some more eloquent version, I'm off the top of my head, of that
*  speech, it would have been her sister soldier moment.
*  And she could have said this, my party went in the wrong direction.
*  And by the way, it would have been very compelling to a lot of people.
*  Yeah, but she would have to formulate that or someone would have to help her.
*  Someone would have to.
*  So what I'm saying is you should run for president.
*  You should become a Democrat and run on that.
*  Maybe I am.
*  Well, you probably couldn't become a Democrat.
*  They probably never let you in, but I bet you they let you into the Republican.
*  Not only will they never let me in, depending on the next eight hours, I'm going to be in jail.
*  There's going to be.
*  No, but I think that was the thing.
*  I think Trump ran against the Republican Party in 2016.
*  Yeah, he ran against the Bush's.
*  He ran against foreign war.
*  He ran against big business.
*  He ran against every single Republican donor base, every plutocratic concern.
*  Trump ran against it.
*  He ran against the Chamber of Commerce.
*  He ran against all the people, the Koch people, all the people that were open borders.
*  He ran against all of those people.
*  You know, he ran against major, you know, major power factions within that party.
*  He steamrolled them.
*  And Kamala Harris has refused to do that.
*  She didn't repudiate Biden.
*  Well, how could she though?
*  Because he's still president.
*  She's still vice president.
*  She would have to.
*  She has to throw him right under the bus.
*  But she would almost need a fresh start, like to get out of this cycle and then come back again in 2028.
*  He's an old fool.
*  That's what I would have said.
*  Somebody asked me about him.
*  I would have said, he's an old fool.
*  But then you'd have to say, well, what is Biden?
*  Oh, he sharpens the tack.
*  Now I don't believe you anymore.
*  Here's the deal.
*  The vice president we all know kind of doesn't do anything.
*  She should just say that.
*  She should go, listen, the vice president didn't do anything.
*  Maybe she should say that.
*  She should say that.
*  She should go, let's be very honest.
*  Legislation originates in the House of Representatives.
*  The president has an agenda.
*  I'm sitting around.
*  He's an idiot.
*  We let way too many immigrants in.
*  The tranny stuff's gone nuts.
*  And we got to put some people in jail.
*  If they break into your car, they steal your phone.
*  Yeah.
*  She should, if she said, if a Venezuelan steals your phone, they go right to jail.
*  I would be phone banking for her.
*  She hasn't acknowledged his appeal.
*  They never give him his due.
*  They never give Trump his due.
*  Had she said in the debate, listen, Trump, you brought a lot of people into politics.
*  You've ignited their passions.
*  I respect that.
*  And you've brought up issues that are important that have been ignored for a long time by both
*  parties.
*  But I just think we need to move forward in this election.
*  And you're a very entertaining guy.
*  It was a time George W.
*  Bill Clinton said to George H.W. Bush, he goes, in the middle of the debate, he goes, listen,
*  we all respect your military service and we respect the sacrifice you made for the country.
*  But I think we have to go in another direction.
*  And it was just, and then you could see like H.W., the older one, being like, oh, it was
*  seething because Clinton had kind of complimented him and said, we like what you did, but we got
*  to go in this new direction.
*  That would be a brilliant move to use against Trump.
*  It would have been a brilliant move to use against Trump, but you're right.
*  She can't do it.
*  She's owned by donors.
*  She's owned by these people.
*  And it's unfortunate because had she run against them, there might have been a contingent of
*  people that said they would give her a shot.
*  But I think she hasn't done it.
*  She doesn't have it.
*  No, it's a very particular type of skill.
*  So she has one skill.
*  And that was in that one speech where she said, come say it to my face.
*  Remember that?
*  You got something to say about me?
*  Say it to my face.
*  Everybody cheers like, oh, my God, she's going to win.
*  Like that was, there was a moment.
*  But that was a really well rehearsed thing that she did.
*  And she had excellent timing.
*  And that's right.
*  So then all the pressure comes out.
*  And then the bumbles.
*  And then the interviews and the stumbles and the inability to ask, to answer certain questions
*  and then all that stuff.
*  So her ability to do that kind of thing is dependent upon a teleprompter and a well
*  rehearsed speech.
*  She doesn't believe in anything outside of her own ambition.
*  Bill Clinton did his whole State of the Union speech once when the teleprompter went down.
*  He did it all off the top of his fucking head.
*  He was a different thing.
*  He was a different thing.
*  So a guy like him, you don't find those now because they're all pussy hounds and they're
*  hiding.
*  Right.
*  You don't want that fucking job.
*  Bill Clinton was around before the internet.
*  It was great.
*  Maybe that's what we need to go back to.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's like, but because she, you know, it's that again, it's that corporate hollow
*  like speak that inspires nobody, really.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, the thing that inspires people.
*  Is she laughs a lot and she, you know, you go girl, woman of color, all that good stuff.
*  She was already, you know, attorney general already.
*  She already had vice president.
*  She's, she's in.
*  Yeah.
*  Very qualified in that regard.
*  But yeah, what that what Bill Clinton just did, that's what we want.
*  That's what we need.
*  We need an actual leader that I go, well, that's an exceptional human being.
*  The way he talks is better than I can talk.
*  I mean, this is in both of us.
*  Everyone.
*  But the way he's doing it in front of everybody.
*  I'll tell you about that.
*  It's very, very, because that moment he was the left flank of his party.
*  I'm sure didn't love that.
*  And I'm sure that there were people that criticized him for that, but he basically came out and said,
*  listen, I'm going to go out here and I'm going to, you know, take a stance.
*  That's going to anger people, but I'm going to reach across the aisle and, and say, you're right.
*  This is not moving us in the right direction.
*  There were moments that she could have done that.
*  She chose not to.
*  And I think that's, you know, again, we don't know anything.
*  So I don't know if I'm doing a post-mortem on her campaign or not.
*  But what do you think if you had a bet right now?
*  I think it's him now.
*  I would, I think if he gets Michigan or Pennsylvania, it's over.
*  And I think he's getting one of them.
*  I don't think she gets both of them, but I could be totally wrong.
*  What do you think?
*  Jamie, Jamie make up the results.
*  Because there's been these, all these turning points.
*  There's been all these ups and downs and.
*  Yes.
*  You know, stumbles and recoveries and, you know, different interviews.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm still fucking.
*  There was a time I thought it was definitely her.
*  And then there was a time that I thought was definitely him.
*  And then there was a time I thought it was definitely her.
*  And now I think it's him again.
*  God, I wish I got a chance to interview her.
*  You know, that one would be interesting.
*  What if she changed my mind?
*  What if she like in actual conversation?
*  It's cool.
*  She could just be herself.
*  There's a thing.
*  She would have had to do what Clinton did and she can't do it because they are being held hostage.
*  By an ideology that is crippling to thought.
*  Right.
*  But so wouldn't you want to.
*  So a person like that, really, I'd want to talk to them about stuff outside of being president.
*  You know, because I think that's when you can find out a lot of shit about people.
*  Yeah, I think the Walsh thing was a mistake.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I think she even said.
*  He's a buffoon.
*  She chose him when she was sleep deprived.
*  Of course.
*  He's a buffoon.
*  By the way, it's a hilarious thing to say.
*  Of course.
*  You can't kick him out either, right?
*  No.
*  You can't say I changed my mind, you're fired.
*  She should have went with Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania.
*  Republicans would have been panicked.
*  But do you think that the free Palestine people would have got upset because Josh Shapiro is Jewish?
*  Yeah, but at the end of the day, he would have won more Jews back.
*  He's a better debater.
*  And I think he would have been instrumental in PA.
*  And I think PA is the ballgame.
*  So I think, yes, people would not have been happy with his.
*  But by the way, Walsh is saying the same stuff.
*  So Shapiro is going, Israel's got a right to defend itself.
*  And it's our big friend and whatever.
*  Walsh is saying the same thing as Shapiro would have said, except he's a goofy guy
*  who should be at like a state fair eating hot dogs.
*  He shouldn't be the vice president.
*  So if you're going to have that party line, because it's the party line,
*  no matter what you ask them, that's just their party line.
*  They go, Israel has a right to defend.
*  And it's funny if that's going to be the party line.
*  Have a competent shrewd operator say it and not this buffoon.
*  Not only that, a buffoon who's been caught lying multiple times.
*  He's a pathological liar.
*  And he lies about stuff that's not important.
*  That's right.
*  That no one cares about.
*  Like you don't have to lie about that.
*  You don't have to.
*  You're lying because your version of the truth is not like what you're giving people is not
*  the truth.
*  You're changing the truth and always to make you look better.
*  You're a head coach instead of an assistant coach.
*  Your military rank is better than it is.
*  You pretend kind of that you served in war.
*  It's a total, you know, it's patronizing to the American people to just put this guy out there
*  and say he's just like you.
*  And he's one of the most radical people.
*  I mean, he's just not a mainstream guy.
*  Shapiro is much more of a mainstream guy who just happened to be Jewish.
*  And this guy who comes from Minnesota is a very far left radical guy who, again, is he,
*  he's not Karl Marx, but he's nowhere near the mainstream of American politics.
*  And they pick him out and they go, but he taught.
*  He's folksy.
*  He's got a charm.
*  He's a fun guy.
*  But he happens to be a liar and full of shit.
*  And, you know, his wife, when the BLM riots were happening, said, we just rolled down the,
*  you just open the windows and smell the burning tires and really took in the moment.
*  That's a quote from his psychotic wife.
*  So they're psychopaths.
*  They're psychopaths.
*  Joker shit.
*  Rolling up the windows and we smell the burning tires.
*  We just took in the moment.
*  That's a quote from Gwen Walls.
*  Good Lord.
*  So at the end of the day, it's like they're not representative of the American people,
*  just because you might bump into them at a state fair.
*  They just broke those two.
*  They got, they don't have a dollar.
*  So that was exciting.
*  They're like, oh, we got this guy who's broke and he was like a coach and he has no money.
*  And, but he turns out he's a liar and he's, you know, people don't, you know, people don't.
*  When riots are going on, people are not taking in the moment and sniffing the burnt tires.
*  This is, you know, no, why is this psychopath?
*  This is a psychopath.
*  Those first days, you know, when there were riots, I could smell the burning tires.
*  And, um, that was, that was a very real thing.
*  And I kept the windows open for as long as I could,
*  because I felt like that was such a touchstone of what was, what was happening.
*  She's mentally ill.
*  I kept the windows open.
*  I got as much burning tire smoke in my house.
*  So you can't, can we?
*  What?
*  It's a psychopath.
*  And, and the Democrats bring her out because they go, she's their teachers and they're broke.
*  They're like you.
*  I think you can't let anybody talk off script.
*  If they're going to be smart about this in the future, you got to put everybody on a script.
*  Unless you find yourself another Bill Clinton, put everybody on a fucking script.
*  He was good.
*  I mean, listen, pedophile, perhaps Epstein friend, perhaps human trafficker, perhaps,
*  but God did he talk.
*  Such good talk.
*  God did he talk.
*  And then I think it goes back to what we're talking about, about like secret societies.
*  Like they've, there's always been these people that were in the white house or wherever these
*  fucking places, these people fucking, they go crazy behind closed doors.
*  And you're just assuming that they're the person they portray themselves on television.
*  This button down person with a suit and tie.
*  Right.
*  Talking to you about the future.
*  Right.
*  And it's that.
*  That is not what's happening.
*  That's not what's happening.
*  They're human beings.
*  They have vices.
*  They like wild shit.
*  I bet they like power for sure.
*  Otherwise it wouldn't be president.
*  They like power and they probably are into some kinky shit that they know they're not
*  supposed to be doing because it's fun.
*  For sure.
*  That's probably what's fun about it.
*  For sure.
*  President, you get your dick sucked.
*  It just is crazy in the oval office.
*  Think about that.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a good point.
*  So much fun.
*  That's probably why Kennedy did it.
*  They were, they were out of control just, and then all of a sudden they can't be anymore.
*  Right.
*  So it's, it's like, what?
*  Huh?
*  Yeah.
*  It's like when they said Catholic priests couldn't get married anymore.
*  Like what?
*  Yeah.
*  Like Catholic priests used to fuck.
*  They used to be rock stars, but they were fucking too many people.
*  Yeah.
*  But thank God after they banned marriage in the Catholic church, nothing bad happened.
*  Definitely.
*  Thank God nothing bad happened.
*  You think it's, you think it's him for sure?
*  I do not know.
*  I do not know.
*  Jamie, who won?
*  You know who had a really good post about this?
*  Max Lugavere.
*  He had a really good post because I'm not voting for Trump because I'm voting against
*  all these things.
*  He just listed like a, like a very clear and concise list of all the different things that
*  are fucked up about the, this ideology that's being pushed today.
*  For sure.
*  The fucking censorship of it all is the thing that's the most spooky.
*  Cause it's the only thing that's going to keep us from working our way out of this.
*  That and the war.
*  Yeah.
*  Those two things.
*  That and the ratcheting up tensions all over the globe.
*  Yeah.
*  Is a problem.
*  Yeah.
*  He's the one who's saying he's going to try to stop all this shit.
*  Let's hope.
*  And if that, if that's a reason to vote for someone, that should be like the biggest reason
*  to vote for someone.
*  Like get someone who wants to stop people killing people.
*  Number one, get us out of these fucking international conflicts.
*  Number two, right?
*  Make it so that we have our own oil and we have power here.
*  We don't have to import foreign oil and prop up dictators.
*  That all would be good.
*  All that would, all that sounds good.
*  Right.
*  You know, it's like, I don't hear the things that people keep saying.
*  He's saying like, this will be the last time you get to vote.
*  No, they're going to put you in camps.
*  They're going to separate into racial relationships.
*  The way to run against him was what I said.
*  It's not saying he's Hitler.
*  It's saying here's where he's right and here's where we can do it better.
*  Yes.
*  That's the way to run against them.
*  That's how you're going to win.
*  And they chose not.
*  I'm going to back you.
*  I'll get Peter.
*  Well, you better think when you, I'm coming to you for money.
*  So you better, you better.
*  We're going to get you fitted with a nice suit.
*  Thank you.
*  I think you're more of a like a collar open guy though.
*  Collar open.
*  Man of the people.
*  Collar open and just kind of like.
*  Girl, you can't lose.
*  Yeah.
*  Gay Republican.
*  You get so many people to jump over to the other side.
*  I would go, I would, should be the governor of California.
*  For sure.
*  You could win.
*  It's an actual good point.
*  You could actually win that.
*  It's a great point.
*  No, no one likes that Newsome fellow.
*  They don't trust him anymore.
*  He got caught with his fucking mask off at the French Laundry.
*  I will, I will either save the state or destroy it in five days.
*  No, you'll fix it.
*  But it's either or and I think either one is fine.
*  You're going to be a national hero.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm going to be screaming for you to be president.
*  That's what's going to happen.
*  Let's pray.
*  You'll be the first Republican president since Arnie.
*  Makes sense.
*  You're in.
*  You're in.
*  Yeah.
*  Or first Republican governor rather.
*  Yeah.
*  In California.
*  So that'd be huge.
*  That's a good plan because I could go from there and then right to the White House.
*  And you're socially liberal.
*  So the liberals won't feel bad voting for you.
*  Right.
*  To an extent, I'm socially liberal.
*  To a pretty fucking wide extent.
*  Yeah.
*  To a wide extent.
*  Yeah.
*  I do believe women should ask to leave the house.
*  Like I do.
*  I do have that.
*  That's where I have that Islam thing.
*  I do believe that.
*  Permission is important.
*  Permission is important.
*  Sharia law thing is the craziest.
*  Well, let's hope everybody's peaceful and happy.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's hope it's not all handmaid's tale in the future.
*  Yeah.
*  Thanks for being here, man.
*  Thank you.
*  It's always fun.
*  Always.
*  Thank you.
*  You had some brilliant rants tonight as always.
*  Thank you.
*  I appreciate it.
*  Where are you at?
*  Where can people come see you?
*  Tim Dillon's show on YouTube, timdilloncomedy.com.
*  And the mothership sold out, but I'll be there next week.
*  Oh, you're there next week.
*  We might add a show.
*  Are you traveling around?
*  Yeah.
*  There's a few.
*  We just did a tour and we're kind of at the end of it,
*  but we've got some dates in Canada.
*  We're kind of at the end of the tour.
*  Are you coming club tonight?
*  Are you there?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Come tonight.
*  I'll probably stop in.
*  I'm doing Ron White Show.
*  OK, cool.
*  I'll come and tell you.
*  All right.
*  Talk soon.
*  Thank you.
*  Bye, everybody.
