# Joe Rogan Experience #1467 - Jack Carr
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 30, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ra4522ikFoU)
*  And we're live hey, what's up? Hey? Thanks for having me on my pleasure my pleasure good to see you again
*  Good to see you
*  You know when we first met I knew you were an author and I knew that Chris Pratt was involved in doing that thing
*  With you and that you guys were working towards making a seat which is happening now
*  Which is very exciting crazy, but I never read any of your work until now so getting ready for this
*  I actually listened to the audiobook which is really well done the guy who reads it. What is his name Ray Porter?
*  He's fucking great. Yeah, he's a little disturbing when he does a girl's voice, but no getting around that like if a guy's doing a girl voice
*  Especially putting an accent to it. There's like no getting around the creepy part of that
*  It's a little weird, but you you take but he's so good at like Russian accents
*  And then South African accents, and it's a really good book man. It's fucking riveting like it's it's hard to put down
*  It's it's really good and most of it. I listen to either
*  On workouts walking hikes with the dog or in the sauna
*  I burned through it in a few days. It's really good man
*  Yeah, do you know like half the characters are the one people that were inspired by actual?
*  I know that was what's crazy is like so many people whether it was
*  You know John Dudley or Barclay or you know half-faced blades like black rifle coffee
*  icon four by four the six so many different things
*  Sitka, you know so many different things that I strange not for me to tell me not to talk about gear
*  Just cuz I was a gear guy before I went in the Navy and then of course in the SEAL teams
*  You're like you that's your time to shine and to like go down these rabbit holes and try to make the gear better or anything
*  That's gonna make you more effective and efficient on the battlefield
*  So he really gets it go all in and then just after the military same thing
*  I'm just a gear guy so it'd be strange just to say he pulled out a rifle. You know something like that
*  I couldn't do it. I just wouldn't sit right when you were in the SEAL team
*  Did you think you were ever going to become an author?
*  Is something that you'd always had in the back of your head you would like to dabble in someday like yeah
*  Yeah, it wasn't even a thing. I was gonna dabble in it was I was going to do it
*  And since I was a little kid my mom was a librarian
*  so I grew up surrounded by books and this love of reading from a very early age and
*  Back then like so early 80s. There's hardly anything written about seals
*  But what there is written is a lot of times from fiction
*  So protagonists in different stories by guys like Tom Clancy David Morrell Nelson DeMille
*  H.A. Quinnell all these guys in the 80s who had protagonists with backgrounds
*  I wanted to have in real life one day, and I enjoyed reading them so much
*  I knew that after the military then I would write so I just said wow
*  so you had kind of mapped it out join the military first join the seals and
*  Then after you retire then and how many years were you in for 20 you're in for two and then during that time you would
*  Always mapped out that you were going to be an author when you were done. Yep. Yeah, I didn't really thought it like while I was in
*  I wasn't writing I wasn't practicing, but I was reading so I'm first. I'm a fan
*  I'm always a reader both fiction and non so all those guys I read in the 80s
*  Those are like my professors in the art of storytelling and then I coupled that with the academic study of warfare
*  terrorism insurgencies counter insurgencies and then the practical application from
*  Afghanistan from Iraq and then it all kind of came together at the right time and place as I was getting out
*  So for that last like year year and a half then I started writing because I wasn't taking guys downrange anymore
*  My job was essentially to get out of the military and because it's you feel like you're the first person to do it
*  Even though people do it every day
*  But you walk in you need to get something signed or go to a meeting or gets read out of a secret program
*  We go to medical or dental so your job becomes to get out of this gigantic bureaucracy
*  So during that time that takes like a year
*  I mean you can probably do it in a really like Jaco didn't do any of it when I understand
*  He's just like no and he's left
*  You know
*  On yep exactly yeah, I didn't do these transition classes
*  You're supposed to do and you sit there in these rooms and people drone on and on about transition and some options for you and here
*  Awful horrible, but but I did it. I thought you had to so I get something signed and off you go
*  But yeah, you don't have to do it. I think you do just Jaco didn't like that's what he told me
*  He's like no I didn't like who's gonna tell him to do it. You know, right?
*  Hey, no one no one's gonna say you have to do this. Yeah, it's not good luck. Yeah
*  so
*  So you were planning all along to write and so during that time
*  While you were being deployed and while you're you know, you're being a seal in the back of your head
*  That was always a part of the plan. Yeah, that was when I'm done with this then I'll do that
*  So I wasn't thinking about I kind of set it up
*  I didn't know anyone in publishing didn't know anything but I knew that one day that's what I would do and it wasn't even a
*  Question, but you clearly had equal enthusiasm for being a seal as well. Yes. Oh, yeah, you have that's why they had to be separate
*  So I had to be 100% all in on being a seal because you have to that's what you owe the guys under your command
*  When you're going down range, that's what you owe their families the country the mission
*  But when I got home from that last Iraq deployment and took a breath and looked around and saw my family needs me
*  I've been gone for quite some time
*  Even when you're training coming you're training you're out for three weeks here two weeks there a month there getting ready to deploy
*  So it's not just the six to seven month deployments
*  It's all that time spent training up to go down range with your team
*  So I knew that my family needed me it's time to get out
*  So it was very clear wasn't a hard decision for me
*  Plus I'd I'd gotten to the end of my time where I would tactically lead guys on the battlefield
*  So that's a troop commander
*  So that's where Jocko was when he did his last deployment as a troop commander as an 04
*  Which is a major in the other services a lieutenant commander in the Navy and after that, yeah
*  You're still a leader, but you're leading from behind essentially or the tactical operations center. You're more of a manager type leader
*  You're not out there kicking doors with the guys
*  Which is what we all come in to do or most of us come in to do anyway
*  So I knew that that part of my life was over and it was time to transition take care of the family
*  So it's time to start writing. Did you take journalism classes or writing classes or nope?
*  It was all the reading all that reading I did growing up and my mom introduced me to a guy named Joseph Campbell back in 1987
*  So he did a series of interviews with Bill Moyers on PBS called the power of myth and he wrote a book called hero with
*  A thousand faces so back in 1988. So I'm I don't know 11 years old or whatever 12 years old
*  I get introduced to him and I read that book and I watched all those interviews and I read the book that came out
*  Called the power of myth based on those interviews and I think I applied that
*  Paradigm that model of the hero's journey the monolith to really every every movie I watched every series
*  I watched every book I read from then on and that really helped as I made the transition because I had this foundation
*  It wasn't just like I woke up one day and said, you know what? Can you make money at writing?
*  Oh, that sounds like a good thing to do
*  I'll go back and read and I'll go back and see kind of figure out the history of this genre
*  No, I already had that figured out because I did it my whole life and it was that foundations that was already there
*  And while I was in the military, I kept reading for fun
*  I read those fiction books still and I've discovered Stephen Hunter and Brad Thor and Vince Flynn and Daniel Silva and
*  And now Mark grainy today
*  So those are the kind of the kind of the bigger names in the genre and but then I was also studying studying all that
*  Nonfiction stuff trying to stay up on my game to make my make the best decisions
*  I possibly could under fire for the guys when it mattered
*  So I'm just always studying always reading when I was downrange. I never really watched a movie or played video games
*  It was always if I wasn't out operating and we weren't putting together a target package. I was reading that's interesting because I would think
*  That most people that would vent for and become a professional novelist
*  They would have some sort of background in writing like some sort of
*  Education some classical education English literature or something. Yeah, no, it's all reading
*  It was all knowing what I liked knowing what I didn't like and that's why the first novel is really all about revenge because that
*  Theme resonated with me. Obviously, it's resonated with people from the beginning of time from telling those stories around campfires usually
*  Told in a way to pass on some sort of a lesson about something to the next generation
*  So they don't have to learn the same lessons in blood
*  But they're told as a story and passed down that way and I think that's why there's so many Death Wish movies
*  Yeah, there's just because you can't if someone cuts you off in traffic. You can't go out and do something or someone, you know work
*  There's some politics. You don't get the promotion or whatever you get mad
*  You can't do anything about it
*  but you can in the pages of a novel you can escape there or you can escape in the movie theater and
*  You can see somebody that goes out and gets this revenge and it makes you feel good because you know
*  You can't do it because in real life if you do it, you're gonna go to jail you can get the death penalty
*  It's not possible, but you can do it and if you can explore all that in the pages of a fictional thriller
*  So I think that's why it resonates with with people and then in this particular case
*  I got to take the emotions and feelings behind things
*  I was involved in down range and then just apply them to a fictional narrative
*  So I didn't have to talk to somebody and say hey
*  How did it feel to be a sniper in Ramadi in 2005 2006 and then?
*  Filter that through whatever biases I had or whatever my past experience or whatever and then put it into a fictional narrative
*  No, I just took my experience and then just
*  Morphed it and put it into the narrative. So it ended up being very therapeutic. So did you approach?
*  An agent first like how did you get started? Thank goodness. I didn't know you're supposed to do that
*  Because I'd probably still be looking for one today
*  So I did very little research on that front because I think that a lot of people
*  Can study how to do something too much or too long and it's gonna be different for everybody
*  But you know some people can study how to do something their whole life and never actually do it
*  because you only have a certain amount of bandwidth and
*  For me, I read so Steven Pressfield who's become a great friend now who's on this show a while back
*  So great, yeah
*  It wrote Gates of Fire a Legend of Bagger Vance the Afghan campaign and then has those series of books on creativity the war of
*  Art. Yeah, just you gave that out to people right for a while
*  I had a stack of them that he's to keep at the studio. Yeah, so he's he's amazing actually
*  Listening to him on this show
*  Before I started writing gave me the idea of writing a one-word theme down to keep me on on point
*  So I wrote revenge for that first novel on a yellow sticky, but he didn't really say this on your show
*  He's talking about somebody else who a playwright who would write a sentence to keep him on theme
*  But somehow through my filters
*  I heard him say oh a one-word theme on a yellow sticky on my computer and so I did the same thing so wasn't
*  It's not really what he said on the show
*  But I took it as what he said and I wrote it down and that really for the first book revenge
*  Second book redemption and then fourth book. I morphed our third book
*  I morphed her a little bit Dark Side of Man
*  But so those are the themes that really kept me on track
*  And you're on the fourth one right now you're on the fourth one
*  Yeah
*  How long does it take you to do one?
*  The first one can take as long as you want because you have to have for fiction you have to have the finished product
*  So for nonfiction you can sell like an idea a chapter an outline something like that
*  You're coming from sports or politics, you know
*  You can sell that idea because they know they're gonna get some sales for this you have to have the whole manuscript done
*  So the first one took about just drive two years
*  And you get it as good as you can possibly get it
*  And then what you're supposed to do is go to an agent, but I didn't know that thank goodness
*  Because I didn't do I did that research I talked about with Stephen Pressfield's books on creativity war of art authentic swing
*  Turning pro do the work read those read Stephen King's on writing
*  That's great. Yeah, it's great King's books. So it's not biography really. Yeah, just about writing. Yeah about his his entire life
*  David Morrell's the successful novelist
*  I think those were that those were the main ones that I that I read and then I was like, okay
*  Got it and I put those within sight of me and my computer
*  But I didn't touch them again and I but they were there
*  So I would look to them for inspiration as far as Stephen Hunter says you're a professional. Sorry Stephen Pressfield says you're a professional
*  You're a writer you sit down and write
*  Writers block doesn't exist because it doesn't exist for dentists or truckers or doctors
*  Yeah, I get doctors block so you don't get writers block your professional and you write so just having them that close
*  Really helped with that transition and I made the decision to not once I was a seal and now I write
*  So I think that really helped but I didn't know he needed he needed an agent
*  And thank goodness
*  I didn't because otherwise like I said it's still be looking for one because those are the gatekeepers essentially and they have assistance that are
*  Even gatekeepers to them. So it's it's tough
*  I think but lucky for me a friend of mine sat next to a guy named Brad Thor who writes in this genre
*  as a character called Scott Harvath who's a former seal and
*  He's a he's a great guy
*  My friend sat next to him at a one of these events for to raise money for a seal foundation type thing
*  And as I'm writing about four months in and my buddy says hey, you know this guy named Brad Thor and I said, oh, yeah
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't know him but I've read all this stuff and he said do you want to talk to him?
*  I know you're writing a book and I said yeah, I'd love to talk to him that be he would he talk to me and he said
*  Yeah, I'll set it up. I helped him out with a couple things in his books. So sure enough
*  He sets it up and actually I'm up here in an event in LA at the time
*  I was trying to find a quiet place to have this call with Brad Thor
*  So I go to the parking lot at the Terranea Resort parking lot up there sons beating down on my old
*  my Land Cruiser, everything's off though, the engines off because it's so loud and and
*  My pen and paper are there. I'm sweating but sure enough. We have this great call and and it was like a job interview
*  I think he wanted to know like hey, why do you want to write?
*  And I told him the same stuff
*  I'd tell you or tell everybody that I grew up loving reading and knew I was gonna do this one day and
*  But my mom being a librarian and knowing the history of the genre and all that and just being excited about it
*  He could sense the passion and he's like, alright
*  So if you write a book what I can do for you your friend told me some things you did in the SEAL teams
*  And as a thank you for that, I'll let my publisher know it's coming. I can't guarantee they'll open the package
*  Can't guarantee they'll read one word definitely can't guarantee that they'll like it
*  But as a thank you I can let them know it's coming and I said that's all I need and he said how long till you're done
*  I said one year from today. And so he's like, all right, don't call me. How did you know your first book?
*  How did you know one year from today you'd be done because I was because other guys that have serious characters have one book a year
*  And so I figured well
*  Doing this sort of thing. That's about four months into it. So I was like I give or take a couple months
*  So sure enough, I I called him back one year from the day and he's like, but he said hey, don't don't call me
*  Don't send me chapters. I'm not gonna give you any advice
*  He did give me some advice on that call, but he didn't want me bugging him throughout the year, right?
*  Which I totally understand now
*  And called him back a year from then said it's done and to his credit it was so awesome
*  He said is it done or is it the best you can possibly make it and I said well
*  I could probably edit it a little bit, but it's finished and he's like, alright call me back again
*  What is the best you could possibly do? So I took another four months of reading it and editing it sending it to a couple friends
*  And then called him back four months later and said this is the best I can possibly get it
*  And he said alright, I'll let him know it's coming. So how many hours a day do you think you were putting in?
*  Gosh, so it's not like hours
*  I mean I would love to get on a discipline type schedule like a jocco type schedule someday
*  But I'm not quite there yet
*  Especially at this stage where I'm still feel I still feel like this is a startup and I can't say no to a lot of things
*  I need to take advantage of emerging opportunities. Just like I would on the battlefield
*  Looking at the enemy they're learning from us. We're learning from them and it's really who adapts quicker
*  You're looking for those emerging opportunities taking advantage of momentum
*  Looking for gaps
*  So the same things that you would do for a startup or starting like a coffee shop somewhere you have to do for writing
*  And I didn't really get that at the outside
*  How so so I did you you're not just writing and sending it to New York
*  Which is what I thought up until about the time I published the first one
*  I thought you just went back and forth with an editor a little bit and then you start the next book
*  Well, really you have to do
*  advertising branding
*  Co-branding your marketing stuff your budgets your social media like anything you would have to do with any other business that you're starting up
*  You have to do as an author
*  so so I kind of treated it as a startup and
*  starting it like just like you're starting something in your garage and you're hungry and you're passionate and
*  you're seeing an opportunity here or there and you just want to build this readership and
*  Let people know that you have this character and see where it goes. So so it's been a sprint
*  At some point I think you get to a stage where you can say no and you don't have to sprint off in all these different
*  directions almost at the same time and
*  You can say okay, you know what? I'm gonna do
*  I'm gonna wake up and I'm gonna write for four hours
*  And it doesn't matter if someone calls for an interview or if CNN wants you on or Fox News wants you on doesn't matter
*  I'm just gonna do my four hours and then after that then I'll check my texts then I'll check my emails and if something comes
*  Up, yeah, we can schedule it out and maybe later in the week. But right now it's just like oh really Fox wants me on
*  Bam. I'm on and then all of a sudden now I'm not writing for those four hours
*  Right, right. Usually it's the first novel and these then this all the others
*  We're really done between 10 at night and about 4 in the morning because that's the time it was quiet in our house with three
*  Kids a dog wife. Yeah, that's how I do stand up writing to the same thing when everyone's asleep
*  It's great best work because there's no one interrupting
*  But I have friends that feel like they can't work like that and they only work good if they get up in the morning and then
*  Immediately they write even before breakfast
*  So I was getting up and working out like that
*  Up until the publication of the first book and then things got a little crazy publicity stuff
*  It was a stuff and then writing late at night also working on the next one dialing that in and then you're editing one while
*  You're writing another so at the same time when you're on this book a year type program. That's what you're that's what you're doing
*  And maybe I'll get past that at some point and I'll have a end date and then I'll start the next one
*  But right now it's not not quite like that yet
*  So my mornings were taken up with getting up early and not anymore
*  I need to get back after it but in Park City where we live there's some crazy in-shape people out there
*  Yeah, I happen to know a couple of them. So as soon as we moved out there after the Navy
*  They're like hey come come meet gotta go work out. It's 530 in the morning
*  I know chocolate's been up for two hours already
*  But for me, that's pretty good
*  So waking up at 5 getting down there and doing these crazy trail runs crossfit stuff jumping in the pool
*  All sorts of crazy stuff that these guys put together
*  It's like five or six crossfit workouts meshed into one with trail running with the endurance side
*  And yeah, what group are you in with that's doing this? Is it a local gym or yeah?
*  We go we meet at the local gym, but Hobie darling was the CEO of skull candy
*  He's like all into human performance at all levels
*  Emotional physical mental spiritual like being the best like human he can possibly be like you love him
*  Like and those guys are all out there they're all out there. Yeah. Yeah, and
*  Eric Snyder is another another guy big his defender 110 is used in some of my videos
*  He's a big defender guy, but those guys are animals
*  They're animals and get up with them work out get home get the kids to school
*  So I had a schedule like that for a little bit
*  But then it all became hey when you're working till four in the morning and getting up an hour and a half later
*  That's a little much. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's always been a problem with comedy
*  You know because you have to go late
*  You're at the you're testing stuff out and then you're home and maybe you get home and then you're right at home
*  Yeah, but then after you after you test it out something at the comedy club you come home and make those notes
*  Yeah, well luckily now the way now we can't do shit
*  But when this crisis the kovat thing wasn't going on what I would do is I would record my sets on my iPhone
*  And then on the way home
*  I would listen to this set and then when I got home either I would listen to it more or would write
*  You know sometimes I'd listen to it more and then tick notes and then write and try to adjust or just write on completely different
*  Subjects, okay, but I just got to a schedule where the best writing
*  I was doing was when no one was home because I'd be writing and then I'd hear daddy
*  Or my wife would want to know something or you know someone else would need something or phones would ring
*  At two o'clock in the morning. No one's calling you exactly. It's free. You're free, and then it's just quiet
*  Yes, and also it's creepy
*  Something about the darkness is creepy like you have
*  Your thoughts are weirder. Yeah, maybe it was a real hard time to get up and do like I would do like a 10 a.m
*  jujitsu class right and when you're up at 4 and you crash and then try to get up six hours later or not even five
*  Hours later and then get to the gym with a little bit of food in your stomach. Yeah, it was too hard
*  Oh, yeah, and you just listen to yours or do you video? I just listen but video is better. I really need like
*  Damon Wayans who's a hilarious comedian has a
*  Collection of every set that he's ever done since the 90s really yeah, he films everything
*  He brings a tripod and a fucking camera
*  And he sets it up in the back of the room and films every set he does and then he edits it all himself on
*  His computer. I'm like that's next level that is next level and you ever look at
*  Is there like it like for people on Amazon you can leave reviews of books are there like for Comedy Club are there reviews?
*  Of comics that go in there
*  I mean that's good that you don't know then yeah, I don't read any of that shit. Yeah, you can't okay?
*  It's it's all at scale right when you get to a certain number like the number of people that are contacting you like
*  Yeah, I'm at a place where I just I can't know it's like nine million
*  Something Instagram followers or whatever the fuck it is. It's like you can't you can't read that
*  Yeah, just get it and it's not good for you
*  It's not good for you positive or negative like just you should know what you're doing get out of it
*  Yeah, so for me. I feel like I need to thank everybody at this point
*  I'm so fortunate that the books are resonating with people and really this whole thing's been at grassroots
*  Like it made this third book made the New York Times list and it made it without like a national news appearance
*  With any of these other bigger things it was all grad was hunters. It was tactical shooting people
*  It was readers that took a risk on a new author and then told a friend
*  And then that person took a risk and told another friend. That's awesome
*  It's crazy and then these companies like black rifle coffee like those guys like, you know veteran-owned businesses or you know
*  Like Dudley like those guys that posted and he's dumped like all those guys that hold held it up and said, oh, I love this
*  But it's still grassroots. Yeah, it's just like instead of around the water cooler at work. It's modern
*  Yeah, so I feel like I need to get on and say thank you so much
*  I really appreciate because I do I feel so fortunate and I really want to thank everyone
*  But I think I'm about at that stage where I can't do it anymore. I got to do a blanket. Thank you
*  Yeah, I don't people don't think that I'm not thankful. Oh, no, that's not the case. It's just for my own sanity
*  Oh, yeah, and I've seen people that do get really too into the comments and they lose their fucking mind. It's not healthy
*  Oh, yeah, you can't do I don't respond to anything negative. If anything's like a little weird I do the block
*  I'm sorry
*  I'm very and I treat it like if I owned a general store in small town USA and I'm behind the counter
*  I own the place somebody walks in and they ask for directions and some drunk comes in screaming the n-word
*  So the guy who wants directions and doesn't want to buy anything I mean you're like, yeah treat that
*  Here's the here's how you get back the interstate so much
*  You know, right and he has a good impression that he's there someone comes in wants to buy a candy bar a six-pack or whatever
*  You know, you just point him in the right direction conversation
*  So I treat it kind of like that like I treat people on social media the same way
*  I would if I was interacting with them the way we are right here
*  But just across the table at my my business local general store
*  Yeah, I try to treat it like that
*  but I'm about at that point where there's too many people coming into the store and
*  And I can't say hi to everybody
*  Yeah, but but I still am so sincerely thankful for everyone that took a risk on me as I was starting this out
*  Yeah, well I can I can relate I understand where you're coming from and I I used to interact with people all the time online
*  too, but then it got to the point where I was like I see too many of my friends like getting mad about things or or
*  Engaging back and forth and having these Twitter wars with people then I realized like the worst way to communicate ever
*  Yeah, you can't you know, it's just not a good
*  It's it's also not it's just not a good effective way to express yourself with another human being if there's any sort of a dispute
*  Or disagreement about things like the best way to express yourself is in person
*  Yeah, I know you can't do that with everybody but it's just
*  It's not you you only have so much time in the day. It's not it's not it's not a smart way to value your time
*  Oh, yeah, you know, it's that it's that bandwidth
*  So I never worried about how hard it was to get out
*  Like I didn't worry about how hard it was to get into the SEAL teams or get to get to buds
*  All I knew that it was very hard and that for me that was enough
*  So it can be done people have done it before. Yeah, and so even growing up even some mid 80s
*  I'm still doing like what today people would call CrossFit. So I get home from school
*  I'd run the hill by the house. I'd go under the basketball hoop and then pull myself through, you know
*  And these kind of pull up things, you know, we had a jungle gym in the backyard
*  So I do some regular pull-ups there changed my grip put a rope up in the backyard
*  So I was doing that had my bow out so I'd shoot for the heart rate and everything
*  So I was doing all those things and I was reading like Zen and the Art of Archery
*  And I was reading both the nonfiction stuff on warfare and I was reading these those authors
*  I talked about earlier that who's the genre I'm writing in today
*  So I was doing all that stuff, but I wasn't focused on how hard it was or maybe I'm not gonna make it
*  Am I good enough?
*  I'm like, well, I'm gonna get myself as good as I possibly can by doing all the things that I think I need to do
*  And now you can type in like Navy SEAL workout program and you there's so many
*  Hard to pick which one back then there was nothing, you know, so I'm like, what do I see?
*  I see I'm running in the sand. I've seen a couple pictures like that
*  I see these guys in Vietnam with these guns and I'm like, okay, I've seen a couple movies and okay
*  What are you gonna do? Okay, you're gonna climb this tree. You're gonna do this rope stuff do these hill sprints
*  So I just did that
*  And did you have like a program that you wrote out or just no bling it?
*  Nope, just as many can work out to you tired
*  Which is very similar to actually when I got to the SEAL teams were it was pre CrossFit days and all that so you ran
*  As far as you could as fast as you could in sand and then you came back and you lifted as heavy weights as you
*  Possibly could like that like Arnold Schwarzenegger, you know 1980 encyclopedia bodybuilding
*  Like that was the workout up until probably early 2000s. So early 2000s what changed a crossfit came on the scene?
*  That was huge
*  We adapted or adopted it fairly quickly crossfit seems great until things go wrong
*  Seems great until your joints start going or your back starts going. Yeah, if I crossfit
*  I just kind of mean functional fitness in general. I don't really mean the actual actual program
*  But but first yeah, those programs came out and people would get on and say oh look look at this thing
*  This is new give it a shot with me
*  it took a little bit of time, but some guys jumped right on and and but really what it showed us and then
*  Right about that time also more kicks off and and all that and we realized okay
*  You're at ten thousand feet in these mountains. You have a rock on your radio guy
*  You have an automatic weapon guy that has a ton of ammo
*  Then you're going you're hitting this compound and you're putting these ladders up and then you're going through these windows and sometimes
*  There are these spaces you have to get into to clear where people are hiding or they're hiding weapons
*  So the encyclopedia bodybuilding and running as far as you could as fast as you could in sand and that being all you did
*  There's probably a better way. So we're kind of forced into it
*  Essentially do they do any work where they're monitoring heart rate and checking recovery and you know and trying to keep you at a certain
*  Heart rate while you're working. No, they might now so I'm a little dated
*  So I got out in summer of 2016 and I know they were trying to modernize a lot of things as I was leaving
*  For those last couple years, but so they it's possible
*  they do now one things that they did to that incorporated a little technology was
*  In hell week like when I went through with with Andy
*  They just pull you out of the surf and then they'd walk down the line and shine a flashlight in your eyes and they'd say
*  Okay, this guy is on the verge of hypothermia. He's about to die pull him out
*  But then they have someone that looks totally fine
*  And then that person would just collapse as soon as like the doctor walked by so what they had people do is start to take
*  These little RFID chips and swallow them and so they'd walk down that line and they'd hit you with like the Zapper from Walmart
*  And they'd get your core body temperature. So it lasted for about like two days until you passed it
*  But for those first couple days, that's how they did it because so you had an RFID chip in your stomach
*  And then you shit it out after two days. Yeah. Yeah, and so that's how they could tell your temperature
*  Yep, I don't know when they started doing that. They did certainly didn't do it in 97 when when I went that's what they're gonna
*  Do with this fucking COVID virus shit?
*  Maybe they're gonna make you swallow an RFID to put it in your put it under your skin
*  I'm really worried about this tracking thing that they're trying to implement that they're talking about how South Korea is doing that
*  They're giving up a little bit of personal liberty and freedom
*  I'm like you can kiss my ass. They're giving up a little bit of privacy
*  Yeah, like no. No, I'd rather wash my hands and stay home. Fuck off. Oh, yeah, and they're not gonna give that back
*  Something thank you. I don't know how many times they've actually given none zero
*  Yeah, there's no way once they have that kind of surveillance where they can monitor you they're tracking you
*  Okay, so they can track everywhere you go and measure you
*  Versus all the other people that they know are infected. Did you come in contact with them?
*  This guy's got a recent test you don't like you need to get a recent test now you're registered
*  Okay, now we're tracking you and everywhere you go. You're gonna be tracked you're telling me when they come up with the vaccine
*  They're gonna just drop that tracking and go hey go back to being completely free go back. No chance
*  No, once they take those freedoms like you never laws are never I shouldn't say never rarely taking off the books
*  Right every we have people on talking about bills that they're sponsoring
*  Well, are they getting rid of another one to add that one or use addict?
*  There's a book called the three felonies a day and it talks about how a guy wakes up in the normal guy gets up
*  In the morning goes to work comes home has dinner puts the kids to bed and unbeknownst to him during that day
*  He has committed three felonies because there are so many laws on the books
*  You can't even keep track the American Bar Association can't even tell you how many laws are on the books state local federal
*  International ones that play in all sorts of different ordinances laws
*  And you're breaking at least three of them a day to commit a felony
*  It's a fascinating book and that they're not gonna give those back. They're not gonna give those freedoms back
*  I've read a really disturbing thing today, and I'm not even sure if it's true
*  So we should find out right now clickity clickity click did the CDC stop tracking flu deaths for this year?
*  Because this is what I read and it might have been some wacko right-wing website that I was on
*  So you never know but I was like this can't be true because the real concern is that the CDC tracks flu and they?
*  Find out that flu is lower or the same as co vid and why we're making a big deal out of co vid and then you know
*  People riot in the streets. That's why people can't it's hard to tell who to trust
*  It's easy. Yeah two politicians and you see you don't trust either side
*  And you see everyone trying to make a power grab and use this as a way to make power or hurt an opponent or whatever
*  It is and even with yes, the CDC you don't know their World Health Organization
*  You obviously can't tell there you can't trust information coming out of other countries
*  So people at home are just like what do I what do I do safest thing to do is just to stay where I am
*  Yeah, but you don't know who to trust. It's very hard. It's very hard to figure out who to trust and doctors are giving despair
*  What do we on their website? I'm seeing information updated as of last week April 18th for flu deaths
*  For like it's on the CDC weekly flu surveillance and I mean it's all the flu information
*  I could so how many people have died this year from the flu?
*  Because the cove it deaths or what is it now 55,000 I think something like that
*  I think it's more right maybe 60,000 now closing in on that
*  Which is not a small number. It's a lot of people but then you find out that that that's a bad year for the flu
*  That's normal. But obviously this year we've locked everybody down
*  Worldwide even and you know, there's just there has to be a slow start to the flu
*  Worldwide even and you know
*  There's just there has to be a slower spread because of this quarantining and because the social distancing
*  So you're I would imagine you're getting far lower numbers than they would have gotten if everybody had just gone out into the streets
*  Oh, yeah
*  Yeah, no doubt about that
*  But no doubt for for a flu is my understanding because in that fourth novel that I'm writing right now is deep into the study of infectious
*  diseases perfect timing
*  Crazy and then how you weaponize those infectious diseases
*  What the Japanese did prior to World War two in that space how they use them in World War two against the Chinese what?
*  Happened to that data afterward after the war the Soviet program from the end of World War two up to the collapse
*  What happened to that information and then our programs today from the end of World War two up to and continuing through today?
*  So I was I was keyed in to all that ahead of time and so it made me a little kind of hypersensitive to this
*  Talking to doctors people that had worked in that space doing my research
*  But from obviously I'm not a doctor but from what I studied the difference here
*  Is that the incubation period so for us?
*  So in the military go overseas and now we're fighting insurgents, and what do they look like well?
*  They look like the people that aren't insurgents. What does that car look like that's pulling up to this this checkpoint?
*  It looks like the one that didn't have a VB ID in it or is that one looking a little low on the suspension
*  So they're not in a uniform. They're not driving a military type vehicle so same with this
*  It's that's like an insurgent that's adapted
*  It's adapted to those other diseases and how we fought them and it's adapted by the incubation period by that nine days
*  So if you get the flu you're down. You know you shouldn't go into work if you show up at work
*  Someone's like bro go home you look like you look horrible get out of here. You're gonna infect everybody
*  You don't know that with right 19 so you go out there for this nine days
*  Whatever it is and you're infecting people during that time frame, so it's like that insurgent that hides amongst the amongst the populace
*  It's the same type of thing like it adapted SARS was different flu is different all these other ones have been different
*  And that's the adaptation of this one is that you go out and you infect other people without knowing it
*  So that's the difference between it and the flu so it's a hard thing to wrap your head around when you just look at numbers
*  But it but there is a difference in that flu. You're staying home. You're sick
*  You know it's it's really in a lot of ways
*  It's a perfect way to spread a virus because there's a there's a video game that my wife plays
*  She used to play doesn't play anymore now that this is going down
*  but it was a virus video game really you send a virus throughout the world and
*  The the key is if you make your virus too strong
*  It's a video game you play on your iPad or your phone if you make the virus too strong
*  It kills people too quickly, and then it doesn't spread
*  So the way you get a virus everywhere is you have one that sits in your system for a little bit and it's just weak
*  in the beginning and
*  Slowly spreads its way across the world and that's essentially what this is in a lot of ways
*  But this is this one's so weird man
*  I mean the Newsweek actually had a story yesterday saying that they think it came from a lab
*  So now that that theory of whether or not it came from a laboratory. I think I tweeted it
*  I think I tweeted it so you could find it on my Twitter page. I was reading it yesterday
*  Okay Newsweek not really a sensationalistic
*  Publication right when they're publishing something like that you got to go hmm
*  Probably something to this and there's a lot of speculation. I mean it's not so hard to imagine
*  I mean you're talking about something that literally was a few blocks from the epicenter in Wuhan where they had that level four lab
*  Right so the deal is with like the video game your wife was playing
*  And that the goal of that game it sounds like was to infect the world to kill the world
*  But if that's not your goal if you have if you have a goal and you want your country to survive
*  Then you don't want it to become a global pandemic
*  You want to hit the city the country whatever geographic area you want to hit with a weaponized?
*  Infectious disease you want it to burn out in that city so instead of going over and dropping bombs on it like like World War two
*  Like firebombing Dresden or whatever else or Tokyo and just destroying those cities well
*  You know what after the war you can go in with an infectious disease
*  And you know it's burnt out, and there's no damage. Yeah, but you don't want it to spread throughout the whole world and come back to your own country
*  So when I first looked at this and I heard about Wuhan I heard that there was a
*  Say not a weapons lab maybe but maybe it's a weapons lab
*  But at least a lab doing research in infectious diseases a couple miles from these wet markets where they're saying that this thing
*  broke out
*  There are cases in the former Soviet Union of them doing these this research into infectious diseases
*  weaponizing it and then having it get out because the protocols weren't followed or whatever else and kills a few people and they
*  Hush hush it because it's a 1960 something or 1970 something
*  So there is precedent and it wouldn't be beyond the beyond the pale to think that oh someone was doing some sort of research
*  And it doesn't even have to be weaponization
*  It can just be they're just studying this infectious disease not even weaponizing it and someone
*  Contracts it somehow in that lab and then brings it outside. Yeah, that's the controversial theory
*  So here's the thing the controversial experiments in Wuhan lab suspected of starting the coronavirus pandemic and says the case against a Wuhan lab
*  And so it says why the Wuhan lab remains a suspect in the coronavirus investigation
*  I mean, it's really likely that we never really will know right but they most certainly were working on viruses
*  Similar to this one right there the end of this article says there's another one called
*  At
*  RATG 13 which is very very similar to the SARS-CoV-2 one that we're experiencing now
*  Oh terrific share 96% of the same genetic
*  Yeah
*  Wow, it's thought to be the most similar to the SARS-CoV-2
*  Of any known virus the two share 96% of their genetic material that 4% gap
*  But still be a formidable gap for animal passage research says Ralph Baric virologist University, North Carolina
*  Probably in bed with the Russians who collaborated with like when you found out that a Harvard guy got arrested that uh
*  Because he was taking money from Russia or excuse me taking money from China because he was doing something
*  With them. Yeah, I mean it's real spooky. What's really spooky is the World Health Organization is essentially in bed with with China
*  Yeah, and they're not giving us a hundred percent clear detailed information. Everything gets filtered down through the Chinese propaganda system
*  Oh sure very dangerous and they also were exceedingly we don't know the numbers right and we can't trust China
*  But it seems like they were a little more prepared for this than we were with our first testing case goes and all that
*  So if you're doing research, there's a lab where you're doing research similar to this close by there
*  There's a history of other countries
*  Maybe even China to of doing research into infectious diseases not following protocols that we would here in the United States
*  They're not all as safe as they are shocker here in the United States where we're doing the same type of research
*  Then it gets out and then they just happen to have a lot of these kits ready to go for testing
*  I don't know. Yeah, well in 2018 they were actually cited for violating safety protocols at that same lab in 2018
*  So they were there were there were concerns about that area long before but what's really fucked up is the World Health Organization
*  Posted in January that according to China there is no evidence of person-to-person transmission of this disease. This is
*  Days after they knew for sure it was being transmitted from person to person
*  so China has been deceptive about this from the very beginning and
*  They think that if they were honest about it and that they they stopped everybody from leaving
*  It could have covered they could have covered this in the point where it would have been
*  95% less saw that yeah 95% less people would have gotten infected
*  Just lock down Wuhan to deal with it there as much as you can anyway, let the rest of the world know
*  I mean looking back that seems like but you're dealing with China
*  It's so you're dealing with Russia you're dealing with some of these countries like that. It seems the worst. It seems like the worst
*  It does seem that way. It's a perfect storm. It seems like but the way they handle their own citizens when their citizens are tested positive
*  This is horrible video this family being dragged out by these people in hazmat suits and they're trying to resist these people are dragging
*  Them away because they tested positive. Oh, yeah, once again that government taking a little more control
*  Yeah, control little more control and we're just giving it up and we give up so much and even before this obviously we gave up
*  So much information about ourselves voluntarily
*  We would let's say in the 50s 60s 70s 80s we never would have given up and now we're like, oh click accept
*  Yeah, and now BAM. There you go. Awesome. I can post a picture or whatever it is, you know, this is fun
*  I can communicate with my friends. We're very accustomed to
*  Clicking on those user agreements, I know no one can figure them out
*  Those those concern me and obviously we've given up a lot of our information in terms of data
*  Where we go the map information that kind of shit
*  But this tracking thing really freaks me the fuck out
*  It really does because they're gonna find another reason why they should be able to track you
*  Once once they do it because of the virus and then it'll just be next year will be the flu
*  You know, they'll find reasons keep fucking tracking you which is safe
*  Like if you got you're not doing anything wrong, what are you worried about? Listen, as soon as someone says that yeah
*  Yeah, you're a fool. Yeah antennas gotta go up and you don't understand
*  You don't understand what this could mean
*  Look the fucking mayor of Los Angeles is paying people to rat people out for not finding social distance
*  Not following social social distancing rules. Oh, yeah, there was an article in the fucking newspaper
*  We're saying that normally snitches get stitches
*  Get reward. I saw that video. It's horrible
*  I know crazy. It's just like like so for this third novel
*  I went to Russia to do some research and I'd always wanted to go there
*  I knew that for this third one the first one did you go before after August written about Russia in your books?
*  I was in the process of writing it. I was getting kind of closer to the end, but I finished up edits gosh
*  I want to say Jan this January. So I've only read Savage Sun. Is that I didn't even read it
*  I listened to it people get mad if you say you
*  Know I was like hey
*  Yeah, I guess because it's harder to read
*  But so Savage Sun is the only one I've listened to it
*  Did you talk about Russia and the other books in the second one?
*  I did it plays in and the geopolitics side
*  So the first one is really very I wanted it to be very basic very visceral very primal right out of the gate
*  Because I knew that in New York Simon & Schuster all these big publishing houses
*  They see thousands of these things a year
*  So something needs to make this stand out and a lot of that was the the personal experience from Iraq and Afghanistan
*  Morphed into the novel to make it feel real personal and visceral
*  So I wanted to come out swinging with that novel of revenge without constraint
*  So I'd I'd done that research essentially just as part of my life by going to Iraq going to Afghanistan all those sorts of things
*  For the second one I knew it had to be different
*  So I put in a lot of more the geopolitics of what's going on with Russia power struggles
*  All this other to make it a little different side and when people saying oh, he's just a one-trick pony
*  He just picked up this revenge thing now
*  In Africa drops it in China drops it in Europe
*  That's what had to be different had to continue that hero's journey in this story of violent redemption
*  But I went to Mozambique as part of it to do that research because I knew and this is before I even had a publishing
*  Deal I knew that hey John Grisham
*  He wrote a time to kill first and he couldn't give that book away
*  And then he wrote the firm and that's the one that takes off with the movie with Tom Cruise then later
*  Then they go back and they publish a time to kill Matthew McConaughey makes the movie
*  But if he'd stopped at a time to kill he'd probably still be practicing law somewhere in Memphis
*  So I knew I was always gonna write to so off
*  I went to Mozambique to do that research get that boots on the ground experience like I had in Iraq had in Afghanistan
*  Already for the first novel had by living in San Diego knowing LA knowing New York
*  And really being able to incorporate what I'd done already, but I hadn't been in Mozambique had to go there
*  So put boots on the ground and everybody over there wanted to tell me the story of their country wanted to talk about the politics
*  We wanted to talk about Chinese influence in the region with mining operations both legal and illegal and the meat poaching that goes along to feed
*  All the people in those mines how that's affecting the environment
*  So they just that couldn't stop them from talking it was great
*  and then for this third one, I thought it would be the same in Russia, so I wanted to go to Kamchatka Peninsula and
*  Do a hunt do a little fishing over there at the same time, but it's all part of the research and
*  You can for one month a year you can get to Kamchatka Peninsula from Alaska
*  So you don't have to go from here to Germany or London and for all of August so you get in one flight a day
*  Another share one flight a week only in August only in August. Otherwise, you have to go all the way around the world
*  So much better to fly to Anchorage then hop on a couple hour flight and next thing, you know, you're in Russia. It's awesome
*  But I thought it was gonna be the same
*  I thought you know land I'll get to this remote backcountry place where we have these guides and all that and I'll be able to
*  Really and it's on the military installation because the people guiding us used to have some connection to the government
*  So he has this hunting concession out there in the backcountry
*  And I thought they'd all want to talk to me and then I realized very quickly that for most of Russian history
*  If someone is asking you pointed questions that kind of you'd ask if you're writing a political thriller
*  You were not long for this world. It was off the firing squad gulag off to Siberia, whatever
*  So they were very hesitant to talk to me and I left on my computers behind
*  So I didn't as soon as I walked through customs
*  I knew there was gonna get everything sucked out of my phone and computer
*  I know who who sent things to me an email or text over the last 20 plus years that
*  Yeah, so I just left all that behind brought a pen and a paper
*  But I was asking these questions and I you know, I thought oh they can you know, here's here's my book
*  You know, they're gonna know I'm an author
*  I'm just asking this but no they were very standoffish and very suspicious of why I was asking you know
*  These kind of questions, but it all worked out
*  I got some great stuff and got to weave that into the to the third one
*  What kind of hunting did you in Russia? So brown bear? Oh, wow. Yeah, it was crazy
*  What does brown bear taste like I
*  Tell you that I don't know
*  Cuz usually I follow not you well
*  Yeah
*  Usually I follow the customs of the local people because I don't want to like show up and be kind of the ugly American and show
*  I'm better than you you don't right, you know, you're gonna eat this but I well this is what we do
*  So I kind of adopt what the locals do and they don't eat the bear
*  Interesting wonder why? Yeah, I don't know. It's just one of those things that they don't well a lot of times people
*  I mean it bears a maze. I had the best bear this year a black bear
*  Brian call gave me some oh
*  Incredible. It was like bears delicious. It was so good. Yeah, I tell that to people and like shut the fuck up like
*  My daughter got asked. What's your favorite food? She goes bear. Yeah, and her friends like what amazing
*  Yeah, like it's probably not really her favorite food. I think she was probably trying to shock her friends
*  I don't know that black bear that that Brian gave me is
*  I mean is canned so it was just sitting there for a while. Yeah, it's this canned thing
*  So how did he make it, you know, so what do you boil it and it's in the yeah
*  How are you Wayne in the cot from the Bo rack up in Springfield, Oregon gave me some canned deer meat
*  And it was really good. Yeah, but it's really bottled. It's like bottled deer interesting
*  I've had bottled bottled deer before but I'll tell you bottled black bear and if this maybe it was eating
*  no blueberries or whatever, but it was and it sat on our counter for
*  Six months because my wife was like, hmm
*  So then we had all these guys came over like guys from total archery challenge and yet we came over the house
*  We did a wild game dinner Trevor Thompson came over and so
*  We open it up and it was everyone's favorite. I wish we had more of it
*  What were the ingredients behind besides just put a couple some spices in there of some sort, but I don't know
*  I mean, it didn't look like it you just open it up and it looked weird
*  You open it up
*  Jam yeah, same as the deer that I had same like one of those vacuum sealed bottles. Yeah, it was awesome
*  I want to go down there and get some more from him if he has any more if he's listening
*  I'm gonna come down and get some of that cuz that was legit. Yeah, my wife loved it
*  She's like wow this and as soon as you opened it up and it hit the air it changed like it changed
*  It didn't look like this murky thing that was in the jar. Like it looked beautiful. It was amazing. We loved it
*  It was great. Everybody's favorite. It's awesome. Yeah, that's a weird thing
*  Like bear actually tastes good people are so wrapped up in bears because of teddy bears
*  they have this distorted perception of what a bear is and
*  People that have no problem meeting cows have get mad at you if you eat a bear
*  Do you know how much nicer a cow is than a fucking bear? I know cows don't eat their young. I don't think
*  They eat their children though, they'll they kill other people's children and then the mutt well other bears children rather and then the month
*  when I was in
*  Alberta
*  My friend John and Jen the people who run the camp out there the rivets their son saw a male bear
*  Kill a cub and then the female bear chased the male bear away and then finished eating her cub
*  It's amazing cuz he was eating her cub. So she she ate her own cub right after she was defending it
*  It becomes meat once they're dead. Yeah, they're all cannibals. It's crazy
*  A lot of that stuff is interesting how people have
*  Will associate bears with well and humans
*  I mean they do look when you skin them
*  They do look a little like humans sort of that someone looks like a fucking bear when they're dead
*  Like you've done something awful with your body. That's a big boy. You're not gonna carry yourself
*  It's Steve Rinella calls it best. He says that they're charismatic megafauna. Yeah, there's oh, yeah
*  There's some animals that we have in our head that you're not supposed to eat and we also I think we connect bears to
*  What you would call trophy hunting meaning like someone who hunts lions something
*  Things you don't eat although mountain lion apparently is very good. It's delicious. I've heard this
*  I've had friends. It's like their favorite food. Yeah. Yeah, don't events. It was saying I've heard him here
*  He's talking about was the best thing he's ever ever eaten
*  I guess yeah, and I thought I did my first one this year and it was amazing
*  You had my I didn't eat it because the guide didn't really was like it was like a no-go same thing
*  Yeah, the guide wouldn't let you eat it. It was very clear to me that that was not something that was done
*  There you know, I should I should have pushed it in Utah, so I probably should have pushed it
*  I could have but yeah, I feel bad about it now. It's hard to get a tag for them, too
*  So it's not like it's easy to get it was crazy. It was wild. Yeah, that was amazing
*  But the back back to that that their experience was incredible
*  especially with someone that doesn't speak English like you're over there with this guy who's
*  That's really he was part of well in the military and then worked for the government and then is now
*  People just listening you doing air quotes. Yeah, so it was really interesting
*  but yeah, so got my bear and then but the craziest part was my friend who got his and
*  He wounded it first by accident, of course and that happens like we know
*  And it goes off into this thick thick brush
*  In the States because I went and did another hunt in Alaska this year
*  Like they won't let you go in after a wounded bear
*  Into the thick stuff like maybe some will but my from what I've gleaned
*  They're gonna go in and do it kind of like going in after a wounded leopard or something in in Africa like the guides
*  That's where the guys are gonna go earn it go and do that
*  So this thing's wounded and they hand me this rusty
*  Side-by-side shotgun that's at the bottom of this boat that we're in this little tiny little boat that we're in on this river
*  And the guy hands it to me and then hands me two shells
*  I'm looking at this right thing and I'm having these two shells in my hand
*  I'm like, okay, and I'm like no cuz he had he had so a couple more Mike
*  You know, give me some more and I trained up for Africa with the double rifle
*  I went to FTW ranch in Texas to get really good with a double rifle because I wanted to do a Cape Buffalo hunt
*  The same way someone would have done it a hundred years ago. So no optic side by you know double rifle
*  So it's a rifle, but it looks like a shotgun big big rounds. So there's two rounds
*  Side by side
*  Two shots but you have two other ones ready to go and so you practice at FTW practice and they have charging animals that
*  Are coming in after you and you're just like you would in the military changing bags
*  But this time you're getting two more in there and getting it back up
*  So I trained hard for that and so when he handed me this old rusty shotgun
*  And I think someone said oh that was made in an AK factory
*  I was like, okay
*  I feel better about this because I've seen a lot of a case and I've seen a lot of them rusty and
*  Working so I'm like, okay, I'm gonna have trust my about to trust my life to this thing and it's rusty
*  And it's from a bottom of a boat and this guy doesn't even speak English. So BAM. Here we go
*  I'm gonna show you get you for so and I look at I'm just to make sure it's not like buckshot or something
*  So I can see the slugs. I see that it's a slug
*  It feels like the double rifle I trained up so hard with to go to Africa
*  Which was an amazing experience couldn't have written that one better but and off we go into the brush
*  So it's like they wouldn't let you do this in in the States
*  Like you're going into this thing and they were wounded a huge bear brown bear and off you go
*  It's just me the guy to my friend and this thing it's all quiet
*  and I haven't felt this dialed in since Ramadi 06 like I was on and
*  Then BAM this thing rears up like 15 yards away
*  So it's like a human and I just spin and boom shot him like I want a person to how how big was it?
*  It ended up being over 10 feet. Yeah, I'll show you a picture after this
*  10-foot tall bear and she's even more than that was the size of the head and I forget how
*  Well, I think they measured it back for it was huge. It was huge. I'll show you a picture after this
*  So yeah shot like a what a human that it goes it goes running off like I don't know 20 yards or something like that
*  Into some more thick stuff and then we hear a death bellow
*  But before we hear the death bellow the guide in broken English was like I'm gonna go around the other side
*  And I'm gonna scare him towards you and I'm like, oh, okay
*  So I do I go around to the other side and I get down I'm like
*  Well, if it charges out, it's probably gonna be on all legs and it's gonna come charging like this
*  So I knelt down and then just got ready to put one in if it's coming charging at me
*  I'm trying to figure out okay face mouth right here, you know, it's my first bear hunt
*  So anyway, it heard the death bellow after that
*  It was it was huge. It was crazy. That is such a different kind of hunting when you're hunting something that
*  Absolutely could tear you apart. Oh, yeah, like you're made out of tissue paper. Oh, yeah. Yeah, no doubt
*  I'll show you the big yeah, it's crazy. But what surprised me was how it wasn't like Wild West over there
*  We said, oh can I can we go and get another bear? It was very like no you had your tag
*  Just like you would in the States. It was all science-based. We need to take this many out
*  For the population like it was just like the states which surprised me big business and people coming over there
*  Huh? They don't want to deplete the resources. Right? Yeah
*  Yeah, they're smart. But for some reason that surprised me. I thought oh, it's Russia because I've been to Russia before I've been to Moscow
*  I've been to Ukraine time into the catacombs for earlier in life and I wove those into into the second novel
*  but I just figured it would be kind of wild Westy kind of like how I remembered it over in in Ukraine and Moscow back in
*  the early 90s and
*  But it wasn't it was all very much you have your tag
*  No, this is yours and and we're not gonna deviate from that. It's kind of interesting. They wouldn't even entertain eating it
*  Yeah, no, and there's a language barrier there, too
*  So it's hard especially when you're dealing with people that are tough
*  I mean they're living in these huts built into the ground essentially
*  Asian just south of Siberia Socomchak is just south of Siberia
*  But essentially the same same type of thing and so they're built these
*  Into these small hills for insulation. So I mean they're out there Wow, and it's it's it's a rough existence
*  So when they say we're not doing something and they say it in a way with this Russian accent and there's really it's not like
*  Let's talk about it. Right?
*  No, you would think that those people would want meat more than anybody, you know
*  I mean you would think meat would be very valuable in a ten foot bear. You could feed so many goddamn people
*  Maybe that's why they told us we couldn't because they're keeping it. That's possible
*  That's possible. That's very possible. I would definitely not
*  That yeah least that's possible. Yeah, but a ton of fish out there moose huge moose out there northern pike, right?
*  Yeah, well, they have they might but we were at after
*  Dolly Varden and
*  Rainbow trout brown trout. Oh, wow some big ones out there. So it was pretty crazy
*  It was a good trip and I got to weave all that stuff in so I got to weave in some of the people that I met
*  Over there the snowmobiles they have over there have one skid in the front instead of the two
*  Huh? Yeah, so they're going through this Tyega this tundra. Oh, so it's tightly ass
*  So they're only watching one getting hit by a root or something like that instead of the two
*  So I got a lot of good stuff by going over there and I wouldn't have known
*  What to ask I wanted to see the vehicles that they used over there
*  I was very happy to see some land cruisers. So that was pretty cool
*  But they had a whole bunch of other stuff to some Russian some crazy Russian stuff and I got to incorporate
*  Incorporate those vehicles into the novel as well
*  so you really never know what you're gonna get until you get on the ground talk to people build those relationships and then
*  Things ended up end up waking making their way into the stories
*  Have you ever seen that Werner Herzog documentary happy people life on the Tyga? No, I need to see that
*  You'd need to see it. I wish I'd seen it before I read the book. It's crazy. It's really good
*  It's and it's this amazing documentary about these people that live in the Tyga in Russia and
*  It shows them from being in the summertime
*  all the way through into being in the wintertime and it just
*  There are just hunters and gatherers and they're so happy. It's really weird. It's really weird. Like there's no mental illness
*  There's no suicide and everyone's just struggling. I mean, they're just ever they're making their own skis
*  They're making their own homes. They're making their own
*  I mean they have these cabins set up for trapping and they use snowmobiles and then they have dogs
*  they have a very tight relationship with their dogs and they get fish and they get meat and then that is that was what they
*  And they bring bread with them and the breads all frozen obviously
*  So they have these loaves of bread they bring they store their cabins
*  They have to bear proof everything but it's just their life is so compatible with being a human being
*  It's like there's something about our human reward systems that have evolved over thousands and thousands of years that
*  Being a hunter-gatherer just completely locks in with all the things that keep you content and happy. There's the documentary right now
*  Oh awesome. Yeah, very interesting the relationships with our dogs. Oh, yeah dogs over there were amazing
*  Everything their dogs are everything they have a huge very very tight relationship with their dogs
*  That's incredible. Yeah the dogs that we had in the camp
*  They protected the camp from the bears like that was the bear protection was these dogs that were specifically trained up to chase bears off
*  Yeah, I think I called like he to go back and look but absolutely incredible dogs. They were amazing
*  It's a really amazing documentary. Absolutely one of my favorite. Yeah, there's another really interesting documentary. Well, not a documentary
*  It's a vice guide to travel
*  Where it's I think it's called high. I think his name is hi mo
*  Hi Mo's Arctic adventure and it's a guy who got a job in Alaska in like the
*  1970s and he owns the he has like a lease to have a cabin out there in
*  This very remote part of the Arctic. Yeah, and and once he's dead like this is it like no one else can go back to the government
*  Yeah, I don't think anybody else is gonna be allowed but it's it's another amazing documentary and he's a guy who's a really he's an American guy
*  who's a
*  Really articulate very interesting guy very intelligent guy who loves living like this and he raised his family out there and his his wife is
*  American Eskimo and it's just a fucking amazing way of life. I don't want to live
*  I don't want to live like that. I mean, I like cities like cars. I like all that stuff, but there's something
*  Incredibly compelling about being completely reliant on nature and your own, you know
*  Ingenuity and hard work and he was talking about it in this documentary where the the vice people this is back when vice was
*  You know just starting out to this vice guide to travel
*  So one of their earlier see your series that they were doing on on YouTube
*  It's it's really cool when you're seeing this guy who's this reporter who has no experience like this at all
*  interacting with this guy and him explaining his life and why he lives like this and why it's so important to him and
*  That I think maybe that's why people find their way back to nature in some way shape or form like you want a cabin somewhere
*  They they like going to the mountains. I go into big sky. They like going to Park City. That's the dream for people
*  Yeah, but it's still nice to be able to you know drive in and go to the grocery store
*  Nice to go to a restaurant. I know it is not
*  Prepared like who's looking smart now exactly that guy might not even know what's going on, but he doesn't even need to write
*  Yeah for the people I think also this was a little bit of a wake-up call for people as far as how soft we've gotten
*  Generally as a people and I'll say from the end of World War two for those guys that came back and got back to work
*  Didn't complain and built this country into what it is today. But
*  Since then we've gotten a little soft and people are like, oh wait a second
*  Maybe it would have been better had I had like a week of food or maybe I would have had
*  You know, maybe if 20 to go to have a gun in the house and I always do it's in that safe and I haven't
*  Shot it in years or it was gave to me. My dad gave it to me
*  Maybe I should learn how to maybe use it in case the police aren't there for me when I need them to her
*  Do we have fire extinguishers in the house?
*  Do we know how to use them are those things expired the kids know how to use them?
*  Like all those little types of questions once again gets back to bandwidth
*  So if you're worried about that stuff, you know what you're not worried about. How do you adapt your business?
*  How do you adapt having your family at home and moving forward here when maybe you don't have a job anymore and you need to get creative
*  So you're worried instead about oh how many beans are in the cap?
*  Instead if you had oh we have three and everybody's experience is gonna be different like what they're
*  Comfortable with as far as their levels of preparedness and it's not really about being paranoid
*  It's just allowing you to focus elsewhere if there's a natural disaster here in California like an earthquake, you know other places
*  You know, we're tsunami or whatever. Whatever it is hurricanes, whatever
*  It allows you then to focus where you need to be focused
*  And some people will be like three days of food and maybe a little water
*  Do I need something to filter water with in case I turn on the tap and there's nothing comes out it's brown
*  So everybody's level is gonna be different, but I think this was a wake-up call and
*  I'm not super confident that people going forward will take those lessons and act on them because that's what's important
*  Most will slide right back into complacency
*  Unfortunately, I think that you're that you're right. Yeah, but it's funny cuz my wife was like
*  Now I see why we have all this stuff and no, it's not crazy stuff
*  But it's just I like being prepared about it's not just from being a seal
*  It's from before that it's always been drawn to the outdoors and wanting to be prepared to know how to
*  To live out there survive or whatever else I've just been it's always been a part of me
*  So it's very natural for us to have a couple guns have some ammo have some water have some food
*  Because when this hit, you know what I did book was coming out and I had to figure out how to adapt very quickly to
*  The changing environment and launch it in
*  To me it was very important to do it in an appropriate way and do it as much good as I could
*  At the same time by helping independent bookstores who have no foot traffic that sort of thing
*  But very quickly I had to take that breath look around and adapt
*  And I didn't have to worry about food or water or filtration systems or ammo or
*  So I guess put all my effort into figuring out how to adapt to these changing conditions
*  Did you get a lot of questions from people like how do I get a gun? Yes a lot of California people
*  The lines around the block
*  In front of gun stores were hilarious. They didn't realize you couldn't just walk in they've heard about this loophole
*  Wait, how can I like what was that loophole that they keep talking about?
*  How do I just get one of these? No
*  No
*  I can't even loan you one because if I loan you one and you work walk more than but 20 yards away or whatever now
*  It's an illegal transfer of a firearm. Yeah, so sorry. I might have 300 of them, but guess who's not getting any you
*  Because you didn't prepare and I don't want to be a felon. Well, there's also so many people that were anti-gun that now want a gun
*  I mean it is hilarious. It's it's really interesting to see like this is where
*  What people are protected and when societies weren't running great and we you know up until this pandemic at least we had a wonderful
*  Society, I mean it's like yeah, I mean there are problems with every society
*  There's it's certainly not perfect and there's certainly a lot of crime and certainly certainly there's things wrong
*  But however, it is absolutely the best time in history
*  Yeah, to be a human being and to be alive, especially in this country
*  It's so many people like why would you need a gun?
*  No one needs a gun the first amendment's bullshit when you take all the guns now that the pandemic hits those same people are like
*  Oh, okay. Now I get it
*  There's not enough cops in the world to deal with riots
*  if there's mass riots in the street and people are breaking into people's houses and the world becomes lawless because the economy has
*  Absolutely collapsed and people that were maybe like a little bit sketchy
*  Just go on to become a full-on criminal that is absolutely inside the realm of possibility and oh, yeah
*  We need to recognize that and the people that were
*  Anti-gun there is I mean a great percentage of them now or saying to me like I either
*  I want a gun or I get it or how do I get a gun or how do I train?
*  Like I see those videos you training. How do you train with a gun? Where do you go?
*  How do you how to just start and all these questions?
*  Where do you hunt like the the Google searches on hunting must be through the roof?
*  I would think so
*  I would think so because if you're worried about food like my friend went to the grocery store
*  Right after the big thing hit and everything was shut down. He said all I could find was one package of ground beef
*  Yeah, we're definitely not worried about yeah, you're not over here man. I got three
*  I'll hook you up. I'll give you I've been given a lot of my friends me. I love doing it
*  I like this is all I ask send me a picture of your food. I love it
*  Want to see what it looks like when you cook it
*  Yeah
*  I mean this isn't the first time this is the first time that you've been somewhere else and you've been able to it's not
*  LA riots and you're seeing the Korean shopkeepers defending their stores
*  Yeah, it's not Katrina where you're hearing a few things about the police not maybe confiscating firearms there
*  But then not not being able to protect right but you know if you live in no, Montana
*  Or you're maybe you're in upstate New York or whatever and you're seeing that on the news
*  And then you go back to making your dinner and have them whatever
*  It's not real now this one. I think was real for more people for everybody
*  Yeah, because the whole country's locked down even Montana
*  Which has a very low number of deaths and a very low number of infections still has statewide social distancing rules
*  The media crew those guys are all doing their podcast from their homes remotely
*  Yeah, it's a different deal. It's just drove it home for me. I think it did it drove home the vulnerability
*  And I think this is a good drive run because this is and I don't want to disrespect anybody who's died or anybody who's got sick
*  But this is not the worst pandemic the the world's ever experienced
*  It's not it's it's it's not nearly as bad as like the 1918 Spanish flu which killed 50 million people worldwide
*  So this is a smaller number still bad smaller number
*  But this is a wake-up call that this kind of thing is a real possibility
*  And then take this and then couple it with okay a terrorist attack or
*  Take this and couple it with a natural disaster
*  Now you have two things going on now you have a pandemic and now you have a huge earthquake here in California
*  You have fires you have a tsunami whatever it is
*  So you have have those things or civil unrest somewhere? Yeah, so that's three things now
*  Choose one of the choose any of those or maybe someone's watching and this is a time because we're weak and you get hit with a cyber
*  Attack from somewhere now all of a sudden you're at home and your credit cards don't work
*  All this data has been gathered over the last 10 15 years on people credit card information
*  I mean they're building in China all these huge fields of the collect data huge hard drives essentially that collect data
*  So now you're at home and you want to order from your whole foods delivers or whatever. Oh not working credit cards
*  Let's try this next one. Oh, this one's not working now. What do you do?
*  There's also it can get worse it can get a lot worse and but being prepared
*  It's just a little bit don't get crazy, but it'd be nice to prepare to defend your family for me as a husband father
*  I feel that's my responsibility as a citizen
*  That's my responsibility that that's one of my jobs is to be able to prepare my family for their and and defend my family if need be
*  So my my family might be maybe a little bit different
*  But my wife spend a Thunder Ranch up in Oregon training on both pistols and a ours up there our daughter has been hunting
*  Since she's seven, you know, she's very comfortable with firearms
*  But it's just natural and I think it's just natural for us as people to want to protect that the greatest gift of life
*  Yeah, not just ours, but those that we love as well. So I think it seemed
*  Like it was not inside the real world of problems that most people gonna have to deal with before this and now that they've seen
*  Like oh the the the actual structure of our civilization is very thin
*  The the veil that keeps you from bad things happening
*  It's very small and it's just we lived in this nice little Goldilocks zone where nothing was happening
*  Where there wasn't any pandemics it wasn't any state like besides 9-eleven
*  There's no real attacks on American soil other than that one day
*  So you look at the United States over this long period of time?
*  Like wow, this is like the most amazing time ever to be alive and everything's going so great
*  This is just how it's gonna be now forever
*  And then something like this happens and people realize like oh and especially I feel terrible for the people that work hard every day
*  And then their jobs taken away from them. That's no fault of their own. They're not lazy. They're not drug addicts
*  They're not they didn't gamble it all away one day
*  They woke up and the world had changed and now they don't have food money. It's tough. It's fucking hard. And it's yeah
*  Also one of the well, it's the other piece when we talk about being prepared
*  It's the one that often gets overlooked when you're talking about preparedness is that financial security?
*  So yeah, and for everybody it's gonna be gonna be different. Is it one month worth of bills?
*  Is it two is it three? That's what the experts say or whatever?
*  Everyone's gonna be different, but it's important
*  I think going forward for people to realize if they weren't prepared financially for this that going forward
*  They need to start putting a little bit away. They need to talk to somebody about how they best can yes
*  Because things aren't always gonna be rose you're gonna face adversity in life and we're just like we're facing as a country now like
*  Yeah, you're gonna face it in life as well. It doesn't have to be a pandemic
*  You could just lose your job or something could happen to a family member
*  Whatever it may be it doesn't need to be a pandemic or a terrorist attack or anything these global calamities
*  It can just be you losing your job or getting sick or whatever it may be so having that foundation of financial security
*  Hopefully that's one of those notes people are taking from this going forward so they can be better prepared
*  Not just for any of these calamities we're talking about but just for normal everyday life
*  Yeah, you're gonna get hit you're gonna get knocked down and you're gonna have to get up and keep moving forward
*  And you know
*  It's gonna help you with that is not wasting bandwidth on figuring out where that neck how you're gonna pay that next bill
*  Because you're prepared ahead of time. Yeah a little bit
*  I hope all people also recognize that if you're in a dead-end job
*  And you've been just playing it safe
*  And then it got taken away from you because this pandemic and even though you played it safe
*  And you did is this terrible job that sucks like you realize like maybe I should have chased my dream
*  You know, maybe there's a chance
*  I mean like a guy like you who takes but I want to get back to this because we never really we never really
*  Finished how the book got
*  Talked about how you wrote it off on some tangents
*  Yeah, we did go on tangent, but that that your story is one of the great American success stories
*  I mean that is the story the story is the guy has a dream or the woman has a dream
*  Whoever works hard and then one day figures out a way to make it happen. That's it and that's what she did
*  That's it and I didn't that whole thing about just not worried about it not happening
*  I mean it can always not happen. It's good to have contingency plans for sure
*  I had I didn't have any specific contingency plans, but I I knew I was I was gonna be okay
*  I was you when you sent it off. I want to get to the I want to get a lot of things
*  I want to ask you how you created Reese how you created these characters
*  But when you sent it off
*  Like what does it feel like when you've spent a year and what eight months or something?
*  Yeah, a year at four months first and then another four months to edit and then you're like, alright and you send it off
*  What is that? What is that feeling like? It was awesome. It was awesome. Yeah, Coronado, California
*  I went to the UPS store on on the main street there called Orange Avenue and I wanted to get next day air tracking
*  You know everything insurance whatever you could possibly do and show you other copy
*  So it's all perfect and what I found out from taking those notes in the car when I was talking to Brad Thor
*  I found out how Emily Bessler who is his editor who is Vince Flynn's editor who did the Mitch rap series who sadly passed
*  Away a few years ago, but he wrote a book called term limits in the late 90s that really defined the modern political thriller
*  So I knew the font that she liked I knew the spacing that she liked
*  And also I made a space in this you like
*  Ariel two and a half. It's in my old it's in my old notes now
*  It doesn't matter so much
*  but back then I wanted to make it as I wanted to do everything I possibly could to increase my chances of success or
*  Making her not just look at it and have anything even who is just psychological like oh, it's in the wrong font
*  I don't you specifically like juice up the beginning chapter the first chapter just to make it very riveting. Yes grabber. Yep
*  Absolutely. Yep
*  You like that cuz I knew what I liked and I knew what I liked reading and I knew I like sniper stuff and I had
*  That background and I could weave all that in there and you know, I didn't just say he's walking in his shoes
*  You know, they're Solomon boots. Why because that's what I use down range or you know
*  Sikka gear because well point buddy John Hart started sicka and also it would make him blend in to that environment
*  So he's not dressed in military stuff in the beginning
*  So I needed to do all these sorts of sorts of things were very natural to do
*  And and get him to a place where the reader wants to turn the page
*  But how do I make the reader want to turn to that next chapter and want to keep them up at night?
*  How do I make them want to go through the entire night to finish this thing?
*  Did you spend the most time on the first chapter because of that?
*  Nope, I think it was all pretty very pretty much the same on every chapter
*  I would say when you go back to edits is really where you spend time dialing it in and
*  Gosh, I'm trying to remember there weren't very many edits on the first one from New York
*  I thought there was gonna be a ton
*  But because maybe it was because I had that yellow sticky from listening to your show with Steven Pressfield
*  I had that thing that said revenge. I tied every single
*  Paragraph chapter whatever had to directly or more importantly indirectly tie back to that theme to keep the reader going
*  Same thing with the second one had to directly or indirectly
*  Tie back to redemption somehow even if it was very subtle
*  So that came on savage son the dark side of man
*  So it's explorers the hunter versus hunted dynamic through the dark side of man
*  So really finding out a is James Reese the protagonist is he a killer? Yeah, is he a soldier?
*  What what is he is he a hunter or is he all three of these things?
*  So exploring that because a lot of us are drawn to these to these jobs
*  We're defending our country defending the guys to our right and left when we're downrange
*  So why are we doing that? Is it because of his country? Well people have been doing this from the beginning of time
*  They've been defending the tribe. They've been picking up the same type of weapons to provide meals for that for that tribe
*  They've been passing down lessons on how to hunt and how to defeat other tribes in battle
*  to ensure the
*  Success and the continuation of their bloodline
*  So why are we still doing that today?
*  Is it all forgotten country or is there something more and so that's what I was really exploring with with the other one
*  But but the third one but but yeah
*  The important thing is to get to the end of that chapter and to have the person want to turn the page and look forward
*  And also to establish a relationship with the character like I knew creating James Reese
*  I wanted him to be a likable guy
*  Like I don't want people people don't want to spend time with someone they don't like that's like why would you do that?
*  So I wanted people to invest in this character to like him to want to sit down and have a beer with him
*  but also he needed to have that background the training the experience to be able to flip that switch when everything's taken away and
*  Essentially become the terrorist become the insurgent that he'd been fighting for the last at that point 16 years
*  At war and use those tactics techniques and procedures that work so well against us from the enemy side in Iraq and Afghanistan and use those
*  Here on the home front. So it's a little it's more than just a story of revenge that first one
*  It's really also about someone who comes home and brings the wars from Iraq and Afghanistan
*  Home to people who have been sending young men and women to their deaths for close to 20 years now
*  So it's so it's you can read it at a couple different levels
*  Depending on how much you want how deep you want to go into it now when you sent it to her
*  How long did it take before they respond almost immediately really? Yeah, it was so cool. So I sent it off. I'm super excited
*  get I totally remember because
*  After I put it in after I mailed it I'm in the street walking back to the Land Cruiser and
*  This crazy lady walks out into the street from around the corner in this nightgown and I'm like what's going on?
*  And she's like there's a there's a dead rat in my house. Can you help me? I'm like
*  What and it was right there like 50 feet away and I couldn't say no
*  So I remember this vividly that I sent this off sent to have my lifetime dream
*  I get it in the mail to Emily Bessler Simon and Schuster and off it goes and I've taken that breath and I take a couple
*  Steps towards the car and this lady runs around the corner like in a in just frantic look in her eye
*  And I'm like, yeah, I'll help you and so I went into this house and it was like this hoarder house
*  There was just stuff everywhere is crazy
*  So I had to go to this top level this old like Victorian house and take this dead rat and take it down
*  Did you think you're gonna die in there? Imagine if you send out it was
*  But anyway, I just remember that distinctly because it was so odd
*  But yeah, so sent it off and then I didn't know like you don't know are they gonna call you back?
*  Are they not?
*  Are they gonna read one word of it and just say or then I've been opening it all who knows but about
*  Two weeks about two weeks when I say immediately. I mean like two weeks. It's pretty quick. Yeah pretty quick
*  I get a call from from Brad Thor and I'm in Texas
*  I'm on I just finished this hunt and I pull over to the side of the road and
*  He said hey, you've been struck by lightning and I was like what and he said, yep
*  What year was this this is I mailed it in
*  November of 2016 so I got out of the military in July or June 2016 mailed it in November and
*  Then I heard back that early December. Wow. That was crazy. And
*  Yeah, she he said she loves it and she wants to publish it and later
*  I found out that she called him because he's their political thriller guy and
*  she's like hey, you know, I got Jack Carr's manuscript and
*  I love it. But kind of you're our you're our guy
*  What do you want me to do? And he's like, I want you to publish Jack and that was so cool
*  So cool, so he could have put the kibosh on it if you maybe I don't know maybe I don't know. He's so great
*  He's so awesome. And one thing he told me when we first talked like I said, he didn't he said don't call me throughout
*  This next year when you're writing
*  But what he did say is that the only difference between a published author and an unpublished author is that the published author never quit?
*  And so for me from buds and having that Bell right there that's with insight of you during hell week
*  We put it in the in the trailer hitch of these vehicles that follow you everywhere
*  So you don't even have to run anywhere
*  You just have to like take a few steps and ring this thing and you're done
*  So that really resonated with me because of that and I just I love that so Mike
*  All right, I can I can do this and and I always knew I could anyway because I had that background and had that foundation
*  I knew I was gonna do and I was so excited
*  So anyway, he told me that that next couple weeks later, right or mid-december. I fly to New York and we sit down
*  I think she wanted to make sure that I wasn't a crazy person
*  So we get to New York especially after you read your books who the fuck is coming up with this shit
*  Good point in that first one. Well, I'll tell you that there's a first one
*  There's like in this third one if you've got to the torture scene yet
*  Well, there's something similar read the whole book and I went through the whole book. So there's a torture through the torture scene
*  Yeah, so there's that one and then the second one there's another torture scene and then in this other the first one
*  There's one that I got from the Shining Path guerrilla movement in South America
*  And what they used to do is and they got it from somewhere too
*  But they'd eventually eviscerate you while you're alive and make you walk around a tree
*  So your intestines are now wrapped around this tree and then the jungle eats you alive
*  Yeah, it was crazy. So I was worried that might be a little off-putting to somebody in New York and publishing
*  But later I found out that that's like everyone's favorite chapter from the book
*  especially people you wouldn't expect like librarians and like it people absolutely love it, but
*  What I gets in New York and I'm little like snow Mike. Okay
*  I've run to make a compression. So I bring a suit and I I've never had to do this before
*  So I heard of people you hang it in the bathroom and you let the steam
*  Get to it to get the wrinkles out of the suit
*  So I do that and I'm getting ready and then I go to put the suit on it's soaking wet and it's December
*  It's New York. It's freezing
*  I don't have like a coat like other people in New York have or scarves or whatever they wear and
*  So I put this thing on and I walk I'm like soaking wet and I have to walk to this coffee place
*  And by the time I get there I'm like a sheet of ice and I get there make sure I'm there an hour early
*  And I gave the guy I think I'm like 40 bucks or something to try to wait for a table to be ready
*  That was a little more private than the other tables in the coffee shop. And so in we go I sit down waiting
*  I asked her what her favorite coffee is ahead of time. Boom, you know, she shows up sit down
*  We have a great conversation for about 45 minutes to an hour and she said hey, I want this thing
*  But do you know you need an agent and I was like what?
*  Like you need an agent. To negotiate
*  Yeah, like the Pressfield thing didn't say that in there and when I was learning about though the war of art and the resistance and all that stuff
*  We didn't talk about agents in there and I'm like, oh no, how do I get one of those?
*  She's like, all right new guy
*  I'll introduce you to four and then just pick one and I was like, okay
*  Oh, so interview four and how do you know who to pick? So it was crazy. So there was two two males two females
*  They were all
*  Fantastic all great reputations all amazing the guys I was like it was very obvious that it wasn't
*  They would have been great and you're not gonna pick I'm not gonna make a wrong choice here
*  So it was in that sense. I was very lucky
*  But I said, okay, they're probably not the right ones, but between the two females are both so amazing
*  But they were 180 out from each other one had been around since the Tom Clancy days small boutique agency
*  Represents John Grisham so you go in there and you have all these John Grisham posters all over the place
*  The whole team comes out sits down and talks to you. It was amazing. She was so awesome
*  And and then the other one younger hadn't really hadn't found her Tom Clancy or Grisham type person yet
*  bigger agency
*  That also ICM that's out here in Hollywood as well. And it was such a tough decision
*  It was like a final rose ceremony
*  I haven't broken up with someone in 20 years, but I felt like I was breaking up with someone because I was so invested in both
*  Of these agents. I just like they were both so fantastic
*  but I felt like and I was in Lanai at the time when I made the decision and I was like
*  oh
*  man
*  I felt like the final rose ceremony and then pick the one with ICM because I thought you know for this type of a novel and
*  For where I wanted to go with a movie or series or something like that to be that part of the mosaic
*  And to continue building this foundation of readers
*  I think that's probably the right choice and I think it was so you had this plan to turn this into some sort of a series
*  From the time you release the very first book
*  From before that and so what's crazy is that as I'm writing this now they tell you not to think of someone playing your
*  Characters you're writing but as a child of the 80s, that's almost impossible not to do
*  So as I'm writing the crazy part is like usually you think of like Mark Wahlberg
*  You think of somebody that had done these sort of things kind of before
*  but I thought it Chris Pratt and he had just done all he'd done is Parks and Rec and
*  He'd done he had a small role in zero dark 30 where he plays the seal
*  He has like a couple lines in there and for some reason like that's the guy
*  Really had no connection to him
*  And know what it wouldn't have been the obvious choice back then
*  This is 20 so I've start writing in December of 2014
*  I think or early 2015 somewhere there so so he wasn't as giant movie star back then
*  I hadn't done any of that stuff yet, and I thought you know what this is a likable guy
*  And he seems like an awesome, dude. I'm getting a good feeling from him, and I thought you know
*  Growing up in the 80s. I love Magnum
*  You know he started off as a naval intelligence officer, and then they found out about seals the writers
*  They turned him into a seal a couple seasons into it
*  I'm like everybody loved Magnum in the 80s women liked him the guys liked him
*  You know nothing not to like about Magnum, and he also does the first essentially what you would call a murder on
*  National television with the other person not having a firearm or a weapon and it's the end of I think it's season season 3
*  But the guy a guy that had him as a POW in Vietnam comes to Hawaii
*  There's a little conspiracy thing involved and at the end he thinks he's walking away
*  And then Magnum asked him if he seen the Sun rise that morning because that morning when his friend his friend gets killed
*  There's a sunrise and the guy turns around
*  He's like yes
*  Why and Magnum turns around and boom and they stop it right there with this like fireball coming out of the end of his
*  1911 and they freeze it right there, and it was the first time on
*  On television in that prime time hour where someone had killed somebody else the hero had killed someone else who wasn't armed
*  I forgot about that very remembering it now. It was very controversial. Yeah, yeah
*  And it's it's a miss so I thought that's who I need I need somebody who's a likable guy
*  who's gonna invest in this and I
*  Heard he was like pro-military and that sort of thing and and Chris Pratt's the guy and that's all that's all the thought
*  I gave to it couldn't have picked a better guy so awesome and I
*  Who knew he was gonna turn into a Jurassic Park and all he hadn't been passengers
*  He hadn't done anything serious yet
*  But I also thought about because I've been studying this and stuff my whole life
*  And I thought about in the 80s look what Tom Hanks did in the 80s. You know he's in bosom buddies
*  He's in
*  Dragnet he's in the burbs he's in Joe versus the volcano and then he does something called Philadelphia in the early 90s
*  And he takes that risk and since then he'd be able to write his own ticket
*  He's one of the greatest actors of his generation
*  And I thought who's that guy in this generation that needs to stretch a little bit that needs to do something different
*  And I'm like that's that's Chris Pratt. He can do this and so I thought of and then even crazier before the first book came out
*  I'm at Thunder Ranch training doing some shooting stuff up there in Oregon and I get this call from a guy that I knew in the seal
*  teams and
*  He's like hey, bro. Do you remember me and you know, you know Jared and he he was out there in Utah with us and
*  He's like hey, bro. You remember me. I'm like, yeah, of course. I remember you
*  how's it going and talked to him in five years or something and
*  We catch up a little bit and he's like, hey, you know, I just want to thank you for a couple
*  I was leaving the seal teams. I don't know if you remember but you've had me in your office
*  You sat me down you talked about transition you introduced me some people in the private sector and I've never forgotten it
*  I was like, oh wow. Hey, of course
*  I'm gonna do that for you because I mean he's awesome to total stud great operator
*  He wants to get out of the team. So I'm gonna try to help him as best I can
*  But he really remembered it and he said hey, I heard you wrote a book
*  I said, yeah, it's coming out in a couple months here. They're these galley copy things, which are early copies of a novel
*  I can send one to you. I'd love to send it and he said yeah, that'd be great
*  But I'd like to give one to a friend of mine and I said no problem. Who's that? He said Chris Pratt
*  It's like no way
*  Yeah, so he gives it to Chris Chris reads it and next thing, you know
*  He's optioned it before it even comes out. Are you a guy who believes in fate?
*  Do you believe in destiny? So when I was in Ramadi in 2005 2006?
*  that's where I got to think about this a little bit because every time you left the wire anything could have been an IED and
*  You could have either spent that time on the way to target and coming back from target
*  Worried about oh is that is that dead donkey on the side?
*  Is that is that gonna blow up and kill me or kill that hit that humvee in front of me?
*  That piece of trash right there. Is that covering something else? Is that a is our wire there?
*  You could spend every single mission especially going to and from target and even on target
*  Worried about that or you could focus on the mission focus on the job get there do the job get back and
*  At that time I was like, you know, I think I have to resign myself to fate here in a lot of these things
*  Otherwise, my mind is gonna be focused not where it needs to be but on is that nighty is that nighty?
*  And so I thought all right, you know what?
*  If I get blown up today, that's just that's just how it was you're doing everything
*  We're do everything we possibly can to mitigate that but you know
*  It could happen and I'm not gonna spend inordinate amount of bandwidth
*  Worried about that other than trying to mitigate it as best we possibly can but that's not gonna be the focus of
*  My everything that I'm thinking about it can't be I need to be focused on this mission. I need to focus on contingencies
*  There's a firefight I need to figure out what assets are available to come in here for QRF or whatever
*  What air we have overhead? How do we how do we maneuver here all those things like that's what I need to worry
*  What's your leader quick reaction force?
*  So you have those set up at different places in case you get hit so they can come on in usually in like
*  Bradleys or Abrams sometimes
*  Different vehicles that have a little more firepower than you do as you're sneaking through the streets
*  So so I kind of resigned myself to fate and there's a book called
*  The bridge at San Luis Rey and
*  there's like I forget how many people that say five or six people that are on this bridge and
*  It collapses and the story is how each one of them got to be on that bridge
*  Why were those six people the ones that were on that bridge at that time and it's fate. So
*  So I guess and I haven't really thought of it too much since then
*  Other than that experience in in Iraq and just having to or feeling like I had to resign myself to it
*  The Chris Pratt thing is eerie though. It's crazy. It's a little eerie. I mean wonderfully eerie
*  No, eerie may be the worst word
*  Is pretty amazing. I feel very fortunate. Yeah, and
*  Yeah, it's one of those things that you've kind of maybe made that happen
*  Like maybe you kind of put that out there as you're writing it thinking about him
*  Maybe I don't know I say that and I said shut up hippie
*  But it's like oh what do you got a crystal up your ass too, you know, but that yeah
*  I'm like no hadn't if I hadn't if I was like, I don't know
*  I mean I was you know, whatever an average seal or whatever
*  But if I you know hadn't taken the time to sit down with Jared and like maybe Chris doesn't even know this exists today
*  Right and other crazy part of this. I thought of Anton Fuqua directing it really directing it. Yeah
*  Why why why him because I love shooter these training day. He did training day got the Oscar for her training day
*  Magnificent seven. I knew he'd worked with Chris on on Magnificent seven. I actually did know someone who knew him
*  But so I so I did have that connection through someone someone else
*  But I love shooter which is based on the book point of impact by Stephen Hunter with Mark Wahlberg
*  Love that movie because I could I love the book so much
*  They made it more modern for today's time, but it's a Vietnam sniper is Bob Lee swagger
*  It was who it originally is but I just thought he's the guy
*  He's the guy to direct this thing and now they're both doing it wow crazy that is crazy
*  Yeah, that's so weird man that you had those two people in your head
*  Like that's what makes me think I don't I don't not believe that it's possible to manifest something
*  But I think most of the people that talk about that stuff are full of shit
*  Yeah, that's where it's a problem
*  Like most of the people that talk about that stuff they're trying to sell you something that well
*  You know you can make your life happen and you just need a dream board and write all those things down
*  There's a lot of that stuff is horseshit because you got to do the work, right?
*  That's it
*  But part of me thinks that if you do do the work and you do have that focus and that intensity
*  I feel like there might be some sort of frequency that you can tap in where you make things
*  More likely to happen or possibly you can make things happen
*  But the thing is you know like you only hear those stories from the people that are successful
*  Like how many people like I wrote a book I had Chris Pratt in my head
*  Yeah, and he's like get the fuck away from me
*  No, it's totally crazy how all that how all that stuff kind of comes to comes together
*  You couldn't have picked a better guy than Chris. He is such a good guy. He's such a great guy
*  He's almost weird weirdly nice. Yeah, no he's so nice. Maybe that's just different for around here. Maybe I don't know
*  But he's very different in terms of like Hollywood actors like there's a few like him like you know
*  It's like people love to say that actors are full of shit
*  They're gross and they're self-centered and narcissists and yeah, it's true a lot
*  But it's not true all the time yeah, and Chris is a great example of a guy
*  Who's like he's a very religious guy very pro-military very he's a really positive guy very very very friendly guy
*  He's not your typical actor. Yeah, he's he's been so great to me also a huge movie star, so it's weird
*  It's like he's not that you know guy who does coke and goes to parties, and he's a different different animal
*  Yeah, they do exist male and female there
*  Are actresses that are great people they just they just really genuinely enjoy acting
*  But for the most part the people that get into it are people that need a disproportionate amount of attention and for the most part
*  The people that need a disproportionate amount of attention are disproportionately annoying
*  You know yeah, and usually they like to get rid of the author right away when you option something cuz they're like
*  I want to get rid of that guy cuz he's gonna be on set and he's gonna be like that's not my vision
*  You're ruining my book or whatever so they'd like to get rid of you, but Chris wanted me involved
*  So I got to help out on the pilot script
*  That's awesome. It is so good. No is this a Netflix things that we're doing it's it's still classified
*  Okay, they're doing some some announcement at some point, but it's a streaming service. Oh, that's right. Okay. I know what it is
*  I forgot yeah, so it's a
*  10-10 fart series maybe something like that eight to ten parts
*  Yeah, cuz if they tried to jam that
*  Well you don't have to anymore yeah, it's great people like it looks genius right especially now yeah
*  Another crazy fate thing is because when you were doing that like when you were writing that in 2016
*  This the streaming thing wasn't what it is today right and well even when we did the deal
*  It was like a movie was kind of like that that it was early
*  2018 when we did the deal and it's like well do a series or movie so it's both
*  It could be both in the contract and now and then they decided to do the series
*  You know earlier on before cove it even was on the radar, but now it looks like yeah genius move
*  Well now like series have a giant advantage over movies can now movies are getting released on yeah
*  He's a really interesting thing today
*  One of those theater chains was saying that they're not gonna have universal films anymore because universal release trolls on
*  Directed demand with people with Apple TV and Amazon stuff like that
*  So these cinemas are now going to war like publicly going to war with the studios because they're saying hey
*  You need to release your fucking movies in our theaters
*  We got a business together and the theaters like
*  You know the the movie production companies like you might not have a business in six months off
*  Because who the fuck is gonna go to the movies now. I know even when they're like okay. It's all good
*  We're open up may 1st or whatever it is or June yeah, and then who's gonna rush right back with their kids
*  It's not gonna be what it used to be yeah, it's gonna take a long time
*  Yeah, they were because well. I've been saying forever. I would love if you know I have a big TV at home
*  I would love if I could just watch movies on TV
*  I don't want to go to the movie and some guys talking to his girlfriend in the middle of the movie and ruin and everything
*  Or people are checking their phones. I see the light from their phone. Yeah, some weird guy walks in all of a sudden
*  You're like kind of like right anyway. I'm like looking at that
*  Exactly backpack great. What does that mean? Yeah?
*  I'm gonna sit here the whole time with my kids just on edge the entire time worried about this lure the exits
*  You know that sort of thing which is important to do in a movie theater exits like their smoke or whatever
*  You know you gotta go to the wall use your hand down the wall to get to the exit like that sort of stuff
*  But yes, it's yeah, when it's to stay at home enjoy it at home, but make your popcorn at home
*  So it's looking like a good move now, but going back to that going back to the faith thing
*  so it's also like what if I had not been a
*  You know the operator or whatever that I was what if the guy had a different impression of me that sat next to Brad
*  Thor at the fundraiser
*  He's not gonna recommend me to to Brad Thor if I was if he had a bad impression or me or to thought of I was
*  A bad operator had a bad reputation or whatever else like he's not gonna make mention my name to Brad Thor
*  So all those little things that kind of came together or what if I didn't read growing up
*  What if I didn't read all these guys like David Morrell created Rambo in 1972 and our read Brotherhood of the Rose early on which
*  Also solidified me to go into the seal teams
*  I was already on the path
*  But he has one sentence in that book Brotherhood of the Rose that talks about seals and I had such a good time
*  He's such a great experience reading that novel that I knew that one day I'd write in the same genre as he does and now
*  He's a he's a dear friend now. He's absolutely incredible guy
*  So all those little things just kind of have I mean they happened
*  But I did them because I was passionate about them
*  I was passionate about reading passionate about writing passionate about serving my country passionate about being the best operator I could possibly be
*  So I was always focused on those things and then you know these other things kind of it helped it helped propel this whole thing forward
*  So that seems like the formula for success and everything really really does like being passionate about something
*  Focusing all your attention and all your energy and really trying to do your best at something that seems like the formula
*  But do the work. Yeah, it's that whole press field book is called do the work
*  Yeah, I have to do that before anything else can happen
*  You can't just wish that something was gonna happen and you know
*  You have to sit down and do the work whether it's write comedy whether it's write a novel
*  Yeah, start a gym
*  Whatever you're gonna do like you have to sit down and do the work and people don't they for whatever reason don't quantify in their head
*  That all those little things you don't feel like doing when you just make yourself do them they all add up
*  Yeah, and it really makes something happen that doesn't happen before it's not gonna happen. Otherwise. No one's gonna do it for you
*  No, no, I hear authors talking all the time about what their publisher doesn't do for them
*  So I hear that about comics to my agent doesn't do anything. Yeah be undeniable. They can't do shit then. Yeah for me
*  I'm like, well, I have no background. I'm not coming from politics. I'm not coming from sports
*  I'm not coming from anything where I have any sort of a following that's gonna push me forward in this type of a realm
*  What are they they don't owe me anything? I owe them something
*  I need to prove myself to them and prove that I was a good investment because most books don't make back their initial investment
*  So you have to make most books? Yeah most real
*  There's a few of them kind of like movies like all the movie all the Avengers and all that sort of stuff makes the money
*  Back for the studios for all the other ones that no one sees that maybe win Oscars, but aren't making back their money
*  So same thing in publishing there's a few at the top like the Stephen Kings and Brad Thors and Vince Flins and all that
*  They make it back for all the books that don't make back their investment
*  So I was like I need to prove myself to Simon & Schuster. How am I gonna do that?
*  Well, I owe them they gave me this shot and so I'm not gonna leave any rock unturned
*  I'm gonna look at things like from other industries like black rifle coffee
*  How do they build a coffee company like guys get out of the military and out of the agency?
*  How do these guys get together make some YouTube videos and all of a sudden now they have this amazing company
*  Well, it's a great product huge company. Yeah, it's a amazing product at its base, but you know what else they did
*  Oh, they did some advertising they did some marketing
*  They did their own marketing on advertising on social media platforms
*  And they connected with other people that had similar interests or that they thought might be able to then grow the brand and also help
*  Those other brands along the way well
*  It's also this it's authentic like Evan really always Evan Hayford the CEO of black rifle coffee has always been a coffee freak
*  Yeah, like his whole life used to fucking
*  Roast coffee in the back of his humbler
*  Deployments amazing. Yeah, he's great and we take you through you sense that passion. So when he talks about coffee
*  It's like me talking about writing, you know, you can sense that passion and it's incredible
*  I learned so much about coffee from him now
*  I'm turning into more of a coffee snob like before I wasn't but now that I know him and know those guys and have seen
*  The process and now I'm a total coffee snob
*  Does he give you a hard time because Reese likes honey and and a little bit cream in his coffee?
*  Not as much as I thought he would
*  Because you know when he makes coffee
*  It's really good without anything in it like when he knows what he's doing and they do that thing with a glass deal and the
*  Whole thing it's all he measures it out. Yeah, and they weigh it and the whole thing. It's awesome for me
*  I mean getting up in the morning. It's chaos
*  The kids are you know, it's insanity and so we just hit the coffee maker of black rival coffees in there and I toss in
*  Some honey tough and tossing some cream. So that's you
*  You're the honey guy
*  Yeah, I want to make my character relatable. Did anybody give you shit about putting honey in your coffee?
*  Yes, so in the seal most just like the protagonist of these stories. They they like their coffee black
*  Well in real life a lot of seals and special forces guys like their coffee black also they like to suffer and yeah
*  I guess but I always liked, you know, that latte
*  Can get that caramel macchiato latte?
*  So I always I always did that and then I found out about honey and coffee and honey and tea later
*  But it just was very natural for me to write that into the character because he has a background similar to me as a former
*  Navy SEAL sniper that becomes an officer and he's at this point in his time in uniform where he's gonna get out and take care
*  Of his family, which is where I was when I started writing it. So I wanted him to be relatable
*  I didn't want him to be a this superhero
*  I wanted him to be someone that wasn't was good at some things like kicking indoors like that
*  Taking sniper shots some of the things that I'm okay at
*  But then also surveillance side of the house some of the things that we don't typically do in the SEAL team
*  Maybe he's not as good at those sorts of things and maybe he drives a FJ 62 Land Cruiser because I love Land Cruisers and there's also
*  You know that whole subculture of people that love Land Cruisers. Yes, you can bring into the fold also
*  So it's very natural for me to talk about those vehicles and then to develop characters
*  By talking about oh Defender 110 Land Cruiser
*  You know give each other's a hard time whatever else or nine film versus 45 or whatever just use those things as character development tools
*  So it's very natural for me to add honey and cream to the protagonist coffee because that's what I drink at home daily
*  Yeah, that's got to be the interesting one of one of the many many interesting things about writing a character is that you can?
*  incorporate your own little quirks and
*  Rescoe watches
*  All the different stuff that you're you mean and the gear thing too, it's like you're very
*  Meticulous and very specific about the type of gear and and how he prepares everything
*  You have be very very odd for me not to do that and some people don't like it
*  And there are plenty of books where someone
*  Takes the safety off on their Glock before they shoot someone or something like that or they you know click it off on a
*  Revolver or whatever like just plenty of books out there that do that and you know, I won't make it a mistake that I agree
*  Just I'm sure I'll make a mistake at some point for the people that really get when you see a mistake like that
*  Doesn't it take you out a little bit? It's like
*  It's kind of watching a movie where they really kind of jack something up and I'm like
*  because the worst thing to do is watch a like a seal movie with a seal or a
*  Police movie with a cop or whatever
*  That's all gonna tell you about all the mistakes so you can't enjoy the film
*  So I try to just enjoy them for what they are
*  But it does take you out and it's like what else did they get kind of not right if the guys like right in the safety
*  off on this Glock
*  So so for me, it's very natural to incorporate that gear and it's also very natural for me to talk about it because I was so
*  Into it for so long that I know a lot of people in these industries and like this is an Aries watch right here
*  I was at the CIA is friends with Evan Hafer, you know, so I talked to Evan be like, hey, this dude legit
*  He's like, oh, yeah, he's legit. So so like all that stuff gets woven in there as well
*  It's just so natural for me to do and also, you know
*  When I see somebody I can tell a lot about them by what they're carrying how they're carrying it
*  You know what kind of belt they're they're using what kind of shoes they're wearing
*  What kind of knife is in their pocket like I can tell a lot about them. It tells a story immediately
*  So I'm reading them without them saying one word
*  And so my characters do that as well
*  And then I use those tools to describe other characters that that aren't me that aren't a seal that aren't somebody else
*  Well, I know how SF guys
*  Travel or how they tell they have their packs whatever it ever whatever it is
*  Or I know someone that doesn't really know what they're doing. This character doesn't really know what they're doing
*  So yeah, he's gonna be carrying his 1911
*  That's brand new that he's not carrying Coxton lock doesn't have one of the chamber
*  Whatever it is like I can tell a lot about someone just by looking at their setup with a quick glance
*  So it's very natural for me to do that in stories as well and it gives me a lot to work with
*  How many seals are novelists is that is it so it's not common there are seals obviously who get out and write nonfiction
*  Yeah, the Richard Marcinko who created Marcinko. I read those
*  Yeah, those are the first books that I ever read on military and oh nice. Yeah early 90s
*  When that came out I was so excited because I had read everything you possibly could on seals up until that point because I
*  Wanted to be a seal since I was seven years old
*  I knew I was gonna be in the military even before then those came out in the 90s
*  So I was did they really? Yep early 90s. That was the first one
*  I don't feel like a read them. Yeah, I read World War. I felt like I read them before then but I guess that makes sense
*  Yeah, I'm gonna know blend times kind of blends together
*  So when I found out hey
*  There's an autobiography coming out about the guy that started this command damn neck on the East Coast as counterterrorist unit
*  I was so excited to read that book wasn't there an issue to people were kind of upset that he was telling these stories
*  I think so, but it's a kid reading that like I don't know any of that. You don't know any of that back story
*  You're just like oh, this is amazing
*  He had an incredible life to be able to write a book and the first commanding officer of Delta Force wrote a book called
*  The Delta Force and I think 1986 which really goes into the Iranian hostage crisis and does what happened at Desert One in 1980?
*  and that was a very formative time for me because I knew I was going in the military and
*  At the time Walter Cronkite's on TV were watching it during dinner
*  He's counting down the days that US personnel have been taken hostage in Iran and I'm seeing those clicked down
*  I'm everything or a quick up every single night and I'm wondering I see the pictures black and white photos of
*  US military and
*  People from the State Department. I didn't know that at the time though
*  I just see a guy in a suit and a guy in a military uniform
*  Blindfolded in black and white photos on the cover of the newspaper and I'm wondering why are the why is the United States standing by and
*  Letting this happen even though I'm six years old at the time
*  Why is this happening? Why don't we go in there and get those guys and then Desert One happens?
*  And of course that's that's on the mind. It's still
*  Shades everything we do is a special out in this in special operations
*  There's a big black eye for the country special operations in general explain to people what happens so
*  so about six months after the
*  hostages were taken in Iran, so they were taken I think in November of
*  1979 and
*  About six months they were eventually held for four hundred and forty four days, but about five six months into that
*  We made an attempt to rescue them. So they're being held at the embassy still or an adjacent building
*  I think and
*  We was the first use that most people know of what's called Delta Force
*  So our premier counterterrorist unit that is modeled after the British SAS and the British SAS has been in service for a long
*  Time so we had guys that went through their program
*  In the 60s even and they took those lessons and created ours because late 60s mid 70s
*  There's a lot of hijackings. We have the Munich Olympics
*  We have all these these these terrorist events and we don't really have a good way to counter them
*  And so Delta Force is created and their first test was
*  Operation Eagle Claw to rescue the hostages in Iran. So it's just an anniversary of it just happened the other day
*  so April 1980
*  We give it a shot and
*  It didn't work out. So what happened was we have marine pilots
*  Flying these sea stallion helicopters off. I think it was the USS Nimitz. I think so. They're flying off an aircraft carrier
*  They're meeting the Assaulters from Delta Force who are flying in on C 130s from an island called Masira in the Gulf of Oman
*  Where a place where we would then launch into Afghanistan years later
*  Interestingly enough I spent a little time time there and
*  they were gonna meet up in the desert and
*  Outside of Tehran Iran a few hundred miles outside the side of the city. So the C 130s land
*  EC 130s land that have fuel
*  helicopters land from the aircraft carrier
*  they're gonna refuel those helos and the planes are going back to Masira and
*  The helicopters are gonna get closer to Tehran. So they're gonna get closer. They're gonna land
*  They're gonna get camouflaged during the day and then some guys who have been on the ground in Tehran
*  This is the best part of the story that no one really talks about we've had guys on the ground in Iran
*  We had an e6 Air Force guy that spoke Farsi. We had a special operations legend Dick Meadows
*  It was also on the Santa a raid in Vietnam
*  And we have two special forces guys out of Germany and then two CIA assets
*  I think one's called Bob and one's named Mohammed and they had to get vehicles out there to the hide site where the Delta Force
*  Guys are and then they're gonna assault they're gonna go in they're gonna retake the embassy
*  They're gonna get the hostages and then the helicopters are gonna take back off land in a soccer stadium
*  Next door and they're gonna extract from their exfil from there. So what happened was the planes land
*  Helicopters have some mechanical problems. It will get lost in the sandstorm
*  They needed six to do the mission. They launched with eight
*  Less than six make it to that link up point in the desert. So they have to scrap it's called no-go criteria
*  So it takes a decision essentially away from the ground force commander because ahead of time
*  He knows that if we don't have if we have four helicopters, we can't do this mission
*  So instead of being on the ground saying, okay, we have four how many guys do you have?
*  Can we do it with this those decisions have been made ahead of time in the planning process?
*  So the helicopters land not enough they scrapped the mission their abort
*  And what would have happened is they would have gone back and they would have reconstituted and gone after the hostages a few days
*  But one of the helicopters in refueling collides with one of the EC 130s huge explosion eight US servicemen die and
*  So they don't go take the hostages
*  They don't go back for the hostages again a few days later
*  Iran moves the hostages different locations all over Iran to make it a lot more difficult if we had gone after them again
*  But the next day president Carter makes an announcement said we tried to get the hostages didn't work had this disaster in the desert
*  And it was a big black eye for his his presidency and for special operations in general
*  But the important part we took those lessons and we got we applied them going forward
*  So now we train all together instead of having all these pilots and assaulters and all these people that have never really trained together
*  Up until that point. Well now we do now we have a special operations command. We all train together
*  So pilots are training you're doing all this stuff together
*  So when 9-eleven hit all those years later, we're much more prepared because of what happened desert one
*  So that's how we honor those guys that died
*  That's how we honor that mission is by taking those lessons and apply them going forward and that's what you
*  Interestingly enough. That's what you in life
*  Also when you have to learn these lessons and apply them going forward it's all about how you apply them going forward
*  Well, that's a huge advantage for you as an author to have all that information and to have that legitimate background
*  Like to be writing about these things like we're talking about guys
*  We're writing about taking safeties off Glocks people that really don't know what they're writing about when they do
*  It's like I mean you can be creative and pretend you're a ballerina without a ballet danced
*  But I don't think it's gonna be the same and there's there's an authenticity to the way you write and to
*  the one book that I've read at least savage son where you
*  just it
*  There's a frequency that you tap into that is a frequency of a person that has experienced this stuff in real life
*  You're not imagining, you know, there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff where people write about things where they're imagining
*  You know, there's a movie called warrior where it's an MMA movie. Oh, yeah
*  Yeah, they fight two days in a row and when they thought they fought two days around like get the fuck out of here
*  I'm watching like what do you talk? You can't fight two days in a row
*  Have you ever seen someone the day after a fight? They look at their fucking elephant man, right?
*  Her whole body's a mess. Everything's swollen like this is nonsense
*  But someone that doesn't know is like I have this in the story they're gonna he's gonna lose the first night
*  But the next night he's gonna go in he's gonna win
*  Exactly. They do things that take you out of like you if it's it's a world
*  They don't really know about and they're writing about this world
*  Whereas you're writing about a world that you were so
*  Deeply embedded in for all those years that when you're writing about it, it's just it's really compelling. It's very interesting
*  Thank you, yeah
*  I got and I incorporate some real-world stuff in there too like a shot that I didn't take into Jaffa rack and I fictionalize
*  It by having it a memory from Fallujah
*  And so I join I morphed it around a little bit
*  But the passion is there the feelings and emotions behind it are there and it's woven into the first story and then someone so it's very
*  Therapeutic I get to take I was very lucky down range
*  So you can do all the right things in combat
*  Like if you were to whiteboard something out here and we talk about tactics and all the rest of it
*  You could make those exact same right decisions down range and things can still go south and people can die
*  Then the other as opposite truly you can make all the wrong decisions of quote-unquote wrong decisions and things can work out just fine
*  Little like life like life
*  So you could so whether you made mistakes or not point being you're gonna have a hard time dealing with them later for whatever reason
*  Whether it was luck or whatever else I sleep very well at night because of the things that that was involved in down range
*  But I still got to tap into them and put them into the story
*  Now there's a going back to what you said about seals writing books
*  Interestingly enough in the first book. There's an interrogation scene
*  interrogation an interview meaning not a not a torture scene, but sitting down with NCIS though the Naval Criminal Investigation Service and
*  So some bad things my career wasn't all all wonderful
*  Like the down range stuff very lucky very fortunate to be in a couple right places at the right time to do some interesting things
*  But when we got back a good buddy of mine
*  Mark Owen he writes a book called no easy day and that's the one about the bin Laden raid and that one
*  Well, it was like a tipping point because in our community at the time
*  They've been active valor that movie with it was seals active duty seals playing characters in an actual movie
*  There were other books out there. So there was already discussion happening like hey, are we too much in the limelight here?
*  We're supposed to be these quiet professionals
*  But you know going back in time I read all these Vietnam books growing up and every autobiography I could about people in the military
*  You know Grant has his memoirs or whatever
*  So there's a precedent not just in this country
*  But worldwide of people getting out talking about their experiences and that's part of a first-person account
*  The historians will use later. Is it frowned upon at all?
*  So it it got it was starting to get even more and more frowned upon
*  Right up to that point and that was the tipping point. So when that book came out
*  That's when everyone said or not everyone senior level leaders were like, okay, stop. I'll stop
*  and they really well
*  Because of that book they went and vet and all the investigations that happened they went in and
*  Essentially anyone that had a connection with him
*  They pulled in and investigated as a way to put pressure on him to get what they wanted
*  so
*  So I was one of those guy I've known him for since 99 or something like that
*  So we've been dear friends since that time and so we have emails going back all these years
*  so I got pulled in to this interrogation room and
*  They pulled out single
*  personal emails single sentences
*  totally out of context to try to get me for something that would put pressure on him and
*  They did that not just with me but with almost anyone that had some sort of a connection with him
*  They investigated because he's already out of the military
*  so so things that you said totally out of context like joking around about something or is
*  Just statements about things just statements. Like what did you mean by what did you mean by this?
*  And I used that in the first novel because I'm sitting there in this interrogation
*  You got these guys across from you and essentially NCIS here from my perspective are people that
*  They couldn't make it in the FBI or the CIA and they weren't tough enough to be street cops
*  So now they're busting people on piss tests in the military and that sort of thing
*  actually, my first experience with them was after September 11th and
*  You know
*  I think we're all in the same team and we're doing these ship boardings in the northern Arabian Gulf to enforce the UN
*  Embargo for oil tankers that are leaving Iraq and then going to Iran
*  and so our job was to take those ships down before they got to Iranian waters and then
*  UN would take over after that
*  But it was a really interesting time cuz like a cop pulling over someone and you're walking up and you don't really know what's
*  Going on and so they would come out of out of Iraq
*  They had all these metal over all the windows it cut off all the ladders on the ship
*  So you'd have to use a caving ladder to hook and climb up and then you'd have to breach and get inside these things
*  And get them back into the Gulf before they hit Iranian waters
*  Otherwise you had to get off so it was kind of a crazy deal
*  but during what we're doing a couple nights on a couple nights off that sort of thing with another platoon and then NCIS shows up and
*  They pull us all into these different rooms and they said hey so and
*  An M60 some sort of a machine gun type thing
*  Was has gone missing on one of these ships that you guys were on and I was like, oh, that's terrible. You know, okay
*  Well, how can I help you?
*  And so we start talking and they
*  How would you get one off a ship if you wanted to steal a machine gun from a ship?
*  How would you get it off and me? I'm just kind of creative. I'm like we're all on the same team here
*  I'm like, oh, this is what I would do
*  I'd take it off piece by piece and whatever I said, you know
*  So I gave him my and then as I was nearing the end
*  I'm seeing it in their face and seeing the notes they're taking I'm like, wait a second
*  Are they like trying to get me to like I didn't take an M60 off a ship piece by piece
*  We're only on there for like a problem is you're an author and I'm trying to think it's all through
*  Yeah, it's all Mike. You're being creative
*  Yeah, so even back then I had a bad experience with them but so what are they saying to you anyway?
*  So this they just start accusing you in in with the Marco and over there
*  No, they didn't accuse me
*  But I could tell that things shifted and I'm getting so creative and telling him how I do it and I mix it in
*  With this and we'd get it off like that
*  These guys are just like anyway, so I kind of figured it out near the end and I'm like, oh wow
*  This is not this isn't something's not feeling quite right here. Like these guys are just after a win
*  That's what they're there's trying to get somebody that's their job and if they can get a seal even better
*  So after so after Mark Owen wrote the book no easy day same thing and you saw these guys across the table
*  And this is years later. So it wasn't like immediately they went after some guys immediately whatever
*  But they put all this together over a long time and follow their ultimate goal. What do they want?
*  I think they wanted him to it
*  They wanted to build a case against him a criminal case against him for what for not?
*  Submitting his book to the Department of Defense for review
*  And is that so they can redact certain things that are classified?
*  Yeah, which is why I was hypersensitive to it and even the minor fiction I submitted them
*  And that is a protocol so when all those things in your book where it says redacted is that why it's redacted
*  Really? So it's because of them. Yeah, so they made me hypersensitive to it
*  So no other author of fiction that has the class fake it the the security clearances that I had no one else submits fiction
*  But I was so
*  Just tied to this because of my experience with the Mark Owen book and what they tried to do
*  I was like, I just want to make sure right and I said what they've taken out
*  Absolutely ridiculous. So the first book I didn't appeal it because they took 45 days to do it
*  Which I thought was pretty good because they say they'll take 30 and I thought it's pretty good
*  They took out nine lines or something like that, which is fine
*  But the second one they a month goes by and two then three then four then five then six and they get almost to the seven
*  Month mark when they finally get back to me. So at this point we had to push the publication date
*  To the summer. It's like a movie trying to figure out like when you don't want two Avengers movies coming out at the same time
*  From the same studio, right? So it so these are thought well ahead of time
*  So it was not convenient to have to push it all the way to the end of July
*  So it was a pain and every single thing in there that was blacked out
*  My attorneys found in publicly available government documents
*  So not just like on Wikipedia or from somebody else that wrote a book or no publicly available government websites government documents that anyone on earth
*  So they have done their due diligence to check if that stuff had actually been released already publicly my lawyers did
*  Yeah, but the people that the those guys know the people you submitted to it the Department of Defense
*  They just have this black pan and they're just
*  Just taking things out and then they see oh CIA will send it off to the CIA
*  We can know I don't work for the CIA but they send it off and then that starts the CIA clock looking at it
*  It's ridiculous and this is not something you had to do
*  It's by precedent. No because it's fiction because it's fiction by precedent now
*  Like we talked about those laws earlier three felonies a day
*  Yeah
*  Laws are written if you look at them very broadly so that the government can interpret them the way they want to
*  And that didn't always used to be the case
*  If you go back 50 years
*  The idea was you had to write a law that the average guy could understand in one when you looked at it one time read it
*  It's evident what that law means not anymore the language involved how long they are
*  How tough they are to decipher even for attorneys to decipher?
*  So it's it's written in a way that they can come after anyone they want for anything
*  Which is by design and they used it to go after Mark Owen. They used it even though that's nonfiction
*  You know, maybe should have he went to an attorney that had experience in this space, which you would do
*  Who's the best attorney for this?
*  Oh the guy that did a book called kill bin Laden with someone from Delta Force that guy has experience
*  I'll go to him
*  So he went to that lawyer who said no you don't need to submit this
*  So there's lawsuits and all sorts of stuff that are associated with that
*  But for me what they did this is years later his second book. He sends it to me
*  So I'm getting ready to get out of the military
*  he sends me his second book and says hey, what do you think of this and so I read it and
*  I
*  Just you know, read it quick and then I sent him like one note that said it awesome
*  Maybe in the first part in the preface
*  Maybe talk about your experience over the last couple years with the first book and what the government did to you and how you reacted
*  Just people would probably interested in that so I wrote that so now I'm in this interrogation room with these NCIS guys
*  And that's one of the things that they pull out and said so why are you editing classified material? It hasn't been approved, but like I
*  don't know
*  Guys guys a good friend sends me the sends me the thing I look at it
*  So what they wanted was to just put pressure on him and said hey
*  We're gonna go after your buddy if you don't do this for us, which was totally to say
*  So what did they want from him? I think they wanted to admit he was guilty
*  And they also wanted a statement of not submit of not submitting it to the Department of Defense
*  Office of pre-publication and security review not going through they want to make an example of him
*  so that anybody else getting out would know that they had to do that and I
*  Don't think it worked because there's plenty of bucks out there that nonfiction that have not been through that process
*  But that's what they wanted from him. They wanted all the money from it, which was
*  Yep, and interestingly enough
*  All the money and he was always gonna give it all that's the other part of this is so interesting is because I've known him
*  For so long he was always gonna give it all away
*  And he had no reason to tell me that you know year before the whatever however long it was before like he wasn't setting this
*  up as some criminal mastermind, but he was always gonna give it away to a seal foundation and
*  When the book came out it all went into a bank account
*  But guess what came out of the bank account lawyer fees after that
*  So he still had all the money except for the lawyer fees and then they still go after you for taxes that you're supposed to be
*  Anyway, it's the government so so they wanted that money anything money going forward like if they made a movie from it all those proceeds
*  They just wanted to crush him and make an example of him
*  So other people would submit or make people think about nuts not even writing anything anyway, how did it all end up? So it's
*  lawsuit with the attorney that gave the bad advice
*  I'm not sure exactly where that is
*  And then all the money went back to the government that was in the account
*  And he's paying off the rest of it that went to attorney fees so so he didn't make anything no
*  Wow one penny all the money went to the government all the money to the government and plus taxes
*  so
*  double money so so all the money goes to the government because he lost is that the idea because
*  Because they finally put enough pressure on where the lawyers do their thing and they figure out a settlement of some sort and that
*  Was the settlement all the money Wow and his second book the same deal
*  No, that one went through the process went through the but after I read it so he sent it to me before he sent it in
*  But you know there's nothing
*  But you treat it and that's what they that's what that one of the things they used to try to get him to do what they
*  Wanted so and that wasn't the only one there's all everybody that knew him got got pulled into this thing and
*  But point being is that had that not happened then that
*  Interrogation scene in my novel where James Reese sits down after what happens to his team sits down with those guys
*  Across the table and I changed it to Afghanistan change it from San Diego to Afghanistan
*  But that's how I felt about the guy sitting across the table from me
*  So it feels real because I wasn't just like hey have you read into interrogation room or I'm resting a couple cops shows
*  Where they have somebody in an interrogation room?
*  I'll just kind of write what that looks like or feels like no, that's what it feels like to be in there
*  Having these eyes on you having them tell you that there's no cameras on when you know that there are
*  And all all that sort of thing so I got to put all that together and make the book what it is
*  So without that happening without them trying to go after me to put pressure on him and everyone associated with that
*  The first book would not be nearly as good like the combat stuff
*  Yeah, it's different
*  But the other stuff the conspiracy side of the house and the NCIS guys and that interrogation in particular and some of the bad guys
*  That's once again. You can't kill people in real life
*  But you know what you can you can in fiction and so it made it so much better than it would have been otherwise
*  So now looking back and I thank him to this day
*  I'm like, you know what that first book that resonated with Simon and Schuster for some reason and a lot of it's what happened
*  Downrange and those feelings and emotions
*  But a lot of it is because of what happened with with you as I was getting out. That's interesting
*  So now when you create these characters, do you write a backstory?
*  Do you spend time like writing out this guy's life and then sort of use pieces of that in the story?
*  Or do you write it along while you're writing the story because he was had a background so similar to mine
*  I didn't need to do that. So I didn't need to create
*  So now I am for this fourth one because now there's so many characters that it's hard to keep spelling straight and background straight and all
*  That sort of thing. So now I have these family trees and these characters written out on Scrivener, which is how I write it
*  Yeah, I use Scrivener too. I love it for stand-up. Amazing. So good to organize things on the left side
*  Yeah, so cool. You hit that button and it's all turns into like a poster board type thing
*  I absolutely love Scrivener, but I didn't use that one until the third one up until that point
*  I was using Word and like copying and pasting and then
*  scrolling and then putting it in where I wanted and then you know
*  Maybe I didn't cut because I was worried it was gonna delete so now I go back and now delete it
*  So it's so nice to use use Scrivener like that. It just makes it so much easier to do that
*  So so now I do but at the beginning I didn't with one novel and kind of creating you have the story
*  So I did the I wrote six or seven different ideas down like one page executive summaries as I was getting ready and the one
*  I wanted to start with was Savage Son
*  That was the one I wanted to start with really but I knew the characters weren't quite at that place
*  Where I could explore the dark side of man I needed to get readers invested in them take him on a journey much like
*  I learned about Joseph Campbell and the hero's journey and the hero with a thousand faces back in 1988
*  I had to take him on that sort of a journey and get him to that point where I could explore the dark side of man
*  Through these characters. So so I had to start with that that first one. It was very evident. It's gonna be the terminal list
*  That's the one so I took that one page executive summary
*  Turned into an outline
*  But if I came to a point in that outline where I got stuck and this is the important part
*  I didn't say ah man readers aren't gonna figure this out. They're not gonna come along on me with this journey
*  That's not believable. I just went around it because I'm not on the battlefield
*  I'm solving problems on the page like I am I'm adapting like I am on the battlefield
*  But you know what I can sleep on it and I don't have to solve this problem right now
*  I can get five months down the line and just continue going and
*  Eventually, I'm gonna figure this problem out and it's gonna work out
*  So I didn't let anything any obstacle stop me as I was writing that outline and I took that outline and started writing
*  And as I figured out those problems then I would change the outline and I would adapt it so I could have a visual
*  representation of what was going on and then eventually about the 75% point then I just
*  Discarded the outline completely and just kept writing so
*  Scrivener made that a ton easier for the third book because doing it in Word was a pain
*  There is apparently a way that you could set up word to behave like Scrivener. Oh really?
*  Yeah, I read an article on it and I tried to do it and I was like I fucking give up
*  Just gonna keep using Scrivener
*  I just love how word I write bits in Word because I can get it on my phone
*  I can get it on a computer just log into Microsoft Word and it just shows me all the files any laptop any computer
*  I use any phone I use it just goes right to it
*  Whereas like with Scrivener you have to like upload it to Dropbox and then get it from drop. That's a pain
*  Yeah, I know I just do it in Scrivener and then when I sent it to the editor
*  I did that
*  Thing where it changes it to Word and then I'm working word the rest of the time so I didn't go back to Scrivener
*  After I did that once it's a finished product. Yeah as finished as it could be anyway
*  What else has changed from the time you wrote your first book to now in terms of like your process and and and how you do it
*  And what do you think you're better at now than you were when you started?
*  So the timeline is obviously compressed now
*  So I started writing the second one before I'd even submitted the first one to Simon & Schuster because I was always gonna write those
*  Too because of that John Grisham story and him not being able to give a time to kill away
*  So I was always gonna write to you. So I was already in Mozambique
*  I was already doing that that research over there
*  Already writing that second one and if both of them didn't work out then I was gonna reevaluate my life choices
*  But I was always gonna go all in on two
*  So now so point being for the second one
*  I wasn't yet on that year
*  Timeline because there was no deal hadn't even gone to Simon & Schuster and then once the first one did get to Simon & Schuster
*  Then they plotted it out and I still had another over a year before it came out while I'm working on the other one
*  So this third one is the first one that I've had but to be on that year-long timeline for
*  But I've had it in my head for so long
*  so this fourth one now is one where things are really compressed because
*  Especially because of kovat 19 having to adapt at the last second for this book tour and having to think of things that I wouldn't
*  necessarily have thought had to think of otherwise like
*  Helping these independent bookstores. I can't away drive business towards them. They're hurting so bad right now. How can I help?
*  Before this right and then well people are going back to them. Yeah, they're hurting for a while and then people were going back
*  Yeah, people like that page in their hand
*  They like to have that experience with someone that they know in their hometown
*  So so those kind of bookstores were actually on on the upswing. It was like the bigger ones
*  Never was importers that shut down years ago. Yeah Barnes & Noble adapting ish. They're kind of hurting so
*  The little ones like hey, they're part of a you know, just a main street Park City. There's a bookstore there the dollies
*  Yeah, they're yeah, but people go in there. Yeah, it's great. Love it. They have a little chocolate place attached to it
*  Whatever so it's great
*  So I figure how do I help them at the same time?
*  And what I did was do these signed book plates that you can only get through those independent bookstores
*  So if anybody wants a signed book, that's where they have to go. So did that I have some merchandise on my site
*  All of that
*  It was already going 100% to these veteran focus foundations that I had some sort of a touchpoint with because they'd help friends of mine
*  Or whatever else but now it's all going Center for Disaster Philanthropy
*  COVID-19 response fund so there are things to talk about on interviews rather than oh, I just have a new book out
*  You can talk about though how you're trying to help as you're launching or talk about preparedness
*  Talk about what the enemy is learning by watching our response to COVID-19 and how they're incorporating that into future battle plans
*  Those sorts of things so how to adapt do virtual book signings that sort of thing or Q&A is
*  Using the technology that wasn't available 10 to 20 years ago. Certainly 30 certainly 40 years ago to to today
*  So I had to spend all that time doing doing that so
*  Point being this fourth one when I get back from here, it's all in back on book four
*  Which is which would be great because I love writing
*  That's what I love to do and the other side of it the business side of it that we've been talking about
*  that is interesting to me because
*  I'm learning something new and I love learning new things and
*  I wouldn't be learning about branding and marketing and all this sort of thing if I didn't have a product if I didn't have a
*  Book and it and I can help other people as they're getting out of the military starting other businesses that aren't even writing
*  Related at all like I can help them and talk to them about my experience and what I've learned and how I've adapted
*  Because I had to no one's gonna hand this stuff to you
*  You have to go out there prove yourself get after it do the work and be smart about it
*  You have to study that landscape
*  so I studied social media for like a year before I even did my first post and
*  But I saw what people do
*  Studied it. I studied I saw what do I like? What do I not like? What's appropriate? What's not?
*  Did you write this stuff down or just keep it on the head? No kept that in my head
*  That's just pretty obvious like what's appropriate and what's not like when someone walks into that general store very very very clear
*  What's how you should treat someone whether they come in yelling and screaming or they come in asking for directions like right?
*  Thanks, that's some basic stuff that a lot of people don't don't quite get how fortuitous is it that you're writing about?
*  Infectious diseases and then this shit goes down
*  I mean if there's ever a person who got a gift by a tragedy
*  It's crazy because I've done all that research in the fall and into the early part of the year
*  Did you go to Galveston the CDC? No, no
*  I talked to doctors that have involved in infectious diseases and with the weaponization of infectious diseases
*  And I read there's some books out there
*  a lot of stuff online with the online stuff you have to be able really careful about and check with other people that really know
*  Right there what they're doing even though it's fiction
*  So I done all that part of it ahead of time
*  So what really changed for me as far as what I'm doing now and what I'm incorporating from this is
*  What our response has been to COVID-19?
*  Because it's put obviously our economy into a tailspin
*  So what's the enemy doing the enemy is looking at that and realizing look at this invisible?
*  Virus has done to the United States with the Soviet Union couldn't do in 40 plus years of trying
*  So how do we incorporate that into future battle plans? Can we have a strategy even a failure?
*  What if there's a threat of a bio attack? What if there's a failed bio attack somewhere?
*  It's still going to affect that economy, especially right now with us being so gun-shy about all these sorts of things
*  So what are they taking from that and what are they learning to apply going forward?
*  So for my fourth novel
*  I'm taking those lessons of what the enemy is learning from this and how they're going to how I think they're going to apply it going
*  Forward and incorporating that into a fictional narrative. So in in that sense, you know, I'm trying to yeah learn
*  Always learning. It's always important to learn and apply it going forward
*  And you're you're also you're in the middle of writing a novel
*  And you're you're also you're in the middle of writing this story
*  But you're also living a life of a person that actually has to deal with this
*  Coronavirus pandemic where the whole world is kind of shut down
*  Like as a just as a human being when you're dealing with this what's frustrating for you about how everything is going down
*  I you know, I think it's what we just talked about as far as
*  People not taking these lessons seriously going forward and making this a stronger country because of this
*  So, you know you get knocked down you get back up you're stronger for it you've learned something
*  Like we talk about in jujitsu, you know, it's either you win or you learn and uh, and so what are we going to learn from it?
*  Are we going to apply that going forward? So like the whole thing with the iran crisis with the hostage situation
*  We learned from that we'd applied those lessons and we were more prepared for 9 11 as a special operations force
*  Uh because of it
*  So for this I worry just like you said our people are going to go back to their old ways after this
*  Uh, they can't wait to they can't wait to slide back into their old ways
*  Yeah, so are we going to be a stronger citizenry? Maybe maybe a certain percentage take these lessons to heart
*  I don't know
*  But uh, so I think that's probably the it's it's knowing that people expect the government to take care of them
*  Uh, and that's the expectation. Yeah, not you. It's not you don't have to take care of yourself or your family
*  The government's gonna get looking for a daddy. Yeah, how do I get that? What 1200 whatever that whatever money they handed out?
*  Uh, oh great
*  Well, you know what's even better you being strong self-reliant self-sufficient and having your kids look up and see how you're handling this
*  And say oh well mom and dad are either in the kitchen talking about how much they're worried about paying that rent or that mortgage
*  Or they're in that kitchen maybe talking about it even if they are worried in a way like hey
*  How do we do this better next time?
*  How do we prepare as on the other side of this and what are the things we can do now?
*  To get better prepared if this happens two months from now a year from now five years from now
*  And the kids can see that too or they see mom and dad in the kitchen talking about hey
*  We are so lucky that we prepared for this. We were prepared financially. We had a little food here
*  Um, whatever it is
*  And so the kids will take those those lessons on take those to heart because they're very impressionable right now, especially as we have 14
*  Uh 12 and 9 and they're definitely processing this and they're catching things on the news and they're talking to friends on their on social media
*  They're texting back and forth all that sort of thing. So this can either make them stronger
*  citizens going forward
*  Uh, or they can see mom and oh look mom and dad relied on government
*  We came out the other side of this we got this check and nothing really changed
*  So oh what lesson are they going to take going forward from that?
*  So it's a very important time, uh, not just for how you deal with this
*  And how you get through it and how you uh move forward better for it
*  But because of the lessons that we're teaching our kids, uh, whether we mean to or not
*  It doesn't have to be a conscious thing like they're going to take lessons
*  And as parents it's up to us to figure out what those lessons are going to be and we can morph it and make them
*  Stronger more self-reliant going forward like our daughter sees our freezers full of elk and moose and she we pull that out
*  We frost it and she's she's a part of it because she knows she got this elk in colorado last year now
*  She's feeding our family. How old is your daughter? She's 14. Wow. She shot her first elk at 14. She had her first elk at 10. Whoa
*  New mexico, yeah, no kidding. Damn. You got a tag in new mexico at 10
*  Yeah, so somebody uh, it was a retirement gift a great guy
*  Uh, and I said, you know, she gave me two one for me and one for my wife
*  Or one for me and one for my daughter and uh, I was like, you know what? I got an elk last year
*  Um in new mexico public land. It was crazy crazy
*  But I was like, you know
*  Can I transfer that to uh to my wife and have my wife and daughter go do this together and i'm with them also
*  And I get a family experience and he was like, yeah, absolutely. That's let's do it. And uh, so she was 10
*  standing off sticks 300 some yards
*  One shot and the guide was uh, he said miss
*  And she'd been hunting before she's been hunting since she was seven and she is good
*  And I was like, oh, you know, it was a tough shot. Uh, hey, uh, you know, it's okay
*  How'd you feel about that shot? She's like I felt good
*  I'm like, oh, it's just a 10 year old saying that because they don't want to kind of lose face in front of the guide
*  And mom's there and dad's there
*  And uh, i'm like, well, it's okay. You know, it's okay to miss everybody misses. Um, I guess let's learn from it move forward
*  She's like I didn't miss and as they go up there, there's no blood. There's no anything
*  We think we're tracking it we walk up but like, yeah, she you know, she missed and we walk back down
*  There's this little tiny just rivet in the ground and there it was 20 yards away. Wow. Yeah amazing
*  I'll show you a picture after it. Does the guide feel stupid?
*  Because he's like miss but it really just went all the way through and you saw he saw an impact behind, you know one shot
*  But uh, yeah, that's the problem, right?
*  They see the dust kick up behind the animal and they think that it's a miss
*  Yeah, so yeah, but you so we have that meat from this last year in colorado
*  That's amazing about it with the family and she's like she knows that she provided that for all of us and that's gotta be very exciting
*  And rewarding for her and then a little guy. He's uh, he he got his first animal in africa this last year
*  Whoa, yeah, so I went back to a crazy place to get your first animal. Yeah, so crazy
*  So, uh, i'd been over there doing some more research
*  I went to south africa to help train up an anti-poaching unit
*  Uh because they hadn't used glocks hadn't used m4s
*  I have a little bit of experience with both those weapon systems
*  And I wanted to do some research in the the art and science of man tracking
*  So went to south africa helped train up this anti-poaching unit
*  It was amazing experience and then they asked me to come back as a thank you to uh with my family
*  Over the over the summer so uh came back with my with my family and our little guy got his first animal there
*  They put the blood on his cheeks
*  I have this amazing picture here in the back of the land cruiser on the way back is he's never had a haircut at age 9
*  So he's blonde hair blowing in the wind. It's awesome. Uh, and then we use every piece of it
*  That's what's great about over there is they see you use much more than we use over here
*  I mean stomach linings like everything gets used in africa
*  Which is cool for them to see because they think we're using it all here
*  They see us taking that rib meat and neck meat and all the rest of it
*  But over there they see everything get used, which is a pretty cool thing for them to experience at that
*  At that young age. So yeah, that is that is a very amazing thing for them
*  So it helps to be self-reliant too it's and they see the people out there working on the land cruisers
*  They see all everything you have to do in africa
*  Like you can just call someone to fix the plumbing or call someone because the electricity is out or whatever
*  You fix it yourself
*  Uh, because you have to how did you get to be a land cruiser fanatic? How'd that happen? Gosh, you know, I found out about icon
*  2006 or so I think it was maybe five and it's from seeing him overseas
*  So I saw the high luxes first in afghanistan
*  2003 I think it was yeah 2003
*  Yeah, you're seeing these things over there and then you're seeing what we're doing to them
*  We have some mechanics over there that are bolting on armor and they're doing things to the engine and they're putting in these
*  Radio console stuff for our secure communications and they're like, wow, this is pretty cool
*  And then I saw the evolution of the high lux over the next 15 years
*  And got to see these things purpose-built from a factory to an aftermarket place that then does all that stuff that we were doing
*  In afghanistan with with screwdrivers and the rest of it
*  Uh, I got to see what those look like and that was pretty sweet and you just see how much abuse they can take
*  And what they're going up and over and so I think it was seeing the high lux and then
*  Looking into maybe i'll get a takoma when I get back because I saw these things over there and these things last forever
*  It was amazing had some crazy experiences in them and then I was like, oh land cruisers. This is pretty sweet
*  And I just it was a natural thing for me to like older stuff and more classic stuff and then to also
*  Like classic stuff that looks old but is really new and can really I can really gas it down
*  Well land cruisers those little 62s just like uh that portion that I have out there where the metal is thicker
*  And heavier gauge like you shut those doors like oh, this is not a it's just different
*  They're just they just made they're made different. Yeah
*  So I started doing my research and I think on the first things that pops up when you put in like, you know restoration for
*  Uh land cruisers is is icon. Yeah, there's a bunch of other people doing it now, but jonathan gets really mad
*  Jon, I mean he gets mad at people doing shitty jobs of restoring broncos or shitty jobs restoring land cruisers
*  And I guess he's got every right to I mean he's so meticulous and they're so what they do is just incredible
*  I mean, it's amazing like it's one of those build it and they will come type businesses
*  Because you know who is gonna buy a 3 000 man hour restoration job?
*  Out of 95 land cruiser. It's not not that many. It's a niche market. Yeah
*  But he's he owns that fucking niche, you know and on so many other cars too
*  I'm so fortunate that he's you know down the road. Yeah, I can hang out with him and talk to him
*  Yeah, and I listen to him on your podcast
*  I listened to him there
*  So and then I drove up from la and gave him I had them start working on my
*  Fj62 when we were in san diego just doing a stage one kind of making sure all the belts and stuff were good
*  And you know, whatever just kind of making sure it wasn't going to fall apart
*  But I always wanted to do that stage three or that icon type restoration
*  And so I always had my eye on that and then my land cruiser broke down
*  My wife was driving it and oil came out engine sees crack engine block like not that it's her fault
*  But anyway, so it sat in our driveway for a couple years as i'm getting out of the military and that's kind of a bummer
*  Seeing it there but get that deal and so one of the first things I did was send that up to jonathan and get in line
*  I had to get mine was behind yours. He's like, yeah, you're just behind joe
*  So I had to wait for your 80 to get done
*  I think I have a few of them working at the same time
*  But uh, they took a cool picture with with yours and mine yours was just getting done or they were frame off or whatever
*  And then mine was there kind of looking dilapidated in the back just waiting, you know, like I said, you have 18 months
*  You had to wait almost two years. Yeah
*  Yeah, that's crazy. So that was cool. So it just showed up the other day and of course, i'm not I don't want to really
*  I want to show people or whatever. But at the same time people are hurting right now, even though it's been in the works for a long time
*  It's not appropriate to you know, show it. Yeah, this is not a time to be flossing
*  No, yeah, it's sweet though. That thing is legit. So I love it
*  So it's natural for me to put them in the books and that's and uh and use it like that
*  And I want to say thank you to jonathan for doing that
*  So just like I put sitka in the books for my friend john hard who started sick
*  Like I think it's on the first or second page of my first novel is sick a year
*  So, you know that's woven in there and I just love to do that sort of thing
*  Yeah, it was cool. Gave me a bunch of smiles the all the different things the black rifle coffee sick dudley. Yeah
*  All that stuff is very cool
*  Now when when you're in the middle of this book now, um, what is what is your timeline like how far have you been?
*  Like how long have you been writing on this fourth book? So I outlined it
*  I had the idea for a while, but I was still finishing up the third one
*  So on the way to russia, I outlined it because I didn't have my computer when you when you outlined it
*  How do you do that? So this time I used I the third one
*  I outlined it in word and then I got my scrivener set up and then I transferred it over and did the writing in word
*  So this one I did the outline in scrivener and i'm writing it in scrivener as well
*  So I had those little the post things or whatever they call them in scrivener with a little description of the chapter
*  So i've outlined it that way
*  But I started doing it long hand because I didn't have my computer with me on the way to russia
*  Didn't want to take it didn't write all that information sucked out when I walked through customs
*  So just legal pad and just wrote it out and uh just arrows and things and asterisks and all that just a mess
*  Uh, so I did that back then got home finished up book three and then started writing book four
*  But i'm also doing the research so you have to i'm diving into books
*  I'm talking to those doctors as i'm talking to them and getting other ideas about how to move the plot forward
*  Uh different things that can test the protagonist. So this theme of this next one is really
*  um the ethics morality and legality behind targeted assassinations, uh, and the bioweapons piece
*  Is really forms the foundation of that but really what the protagonist is struggling with
*  Is targeted assassinations and who is he today? Is he now an assassin? He's been a hunter. He's been a soldier
*  uh, he went after these people that wronged his family and his troop and uh,
*  And put them all in the ground in that first book and now he has a he has both it's a mixture of a personal
*  and professional track that he's now going to take going forward because he still has a little unfinished business to take care of
*  And needs to use the united states government to track these guys down that he still needs to needs to get
*  so in uh
*  As i'm doing that and interviewing all these people i'm thinking about how that works and i'm reading a book
*  It's almost done with it. It's called rise first and kill
*  by ronan
*  bergman and it's really about the state of israel and
*  Because really we think of targeted assassinations and we don't really associate with our government
*  I mean we do we've done it before and we just did it in january
*  Um, and but israel it's much more closely associated with israel from its inception up until today
*  And it's a fascinating book. So i'm getting lots of ideas from there. I'm reading david kilcullen's
*  It's called the snakes snakes and dragons, uh dragon and the snakes
*  And he's a fascinating guy who's a counterterrorist advisor for patreus during the surge. He's become a good friend
*  Um, and so i'm reading doing all that research which helps me move the plot forward. So i'm writing it
*  I'm touching up those outlines and i'm working that research into the plot
*  So at this stage i've written probably about half of it and it's hard to say because you never know
*  We're gonna get another idea or what and it's gonna take too long
*  But i'd say i'd say a little more than half, uh, even though it's all outline
*  I know where i'm going know what I need to do and that first draft is due in mid june
*  When you when you write out an outline, but then in the middle of your writing
*  Do you ever have these like steven king apparently doesn't write outlines. Oh, he's a they call him a pantser
*  Yeah, right by the seat of your pants. Ah
*  Yeah, what are your thoughts on that? I mean like when you read that he does that and he's
*  I mean i'm a giant steven king fan. I mean, he's probably written some of the most amazing horror novels ever
*  I mean not probably has and what an amazing story also about doing the work being persistent being resilient incredible
*  I'm getting hit by a bus. I know
*  Fucking idiot not paying attention every bone in his body's broken insane the story and in on writing about him
*  starting back up again and his wife setting him up and
*  Um, but what do you think about someone who writes like that? I mean with his incredible results
*  I mean, he's yeah, no, it's all also by the way a lot of cocaine
*  Cigarettes and alcohol because earlier shit like the shining and apparently he doesn't even remember writing kujo. Wow
*  Yeah, he talked about that. He was so fucked up. He didn't even remember writing it
*  Hey, I mean it makes me want to do more drugs
*  Like it's and I do think about that when i'm up late and it's 3 30 in the morning
*  I'm exhausted. I know the kids are gonna be up at 6 37 or whatever. I'm like man
*  I mean, I need a little little bump right here to keep me going like I work for stephen king
*  But uh, yeah, he wrote just the craziest shit
*  But I your stuff's pretty fucking crazy too
*  But your stuff is crazy in a sense that like I think these things really happen, you know, like you like
*  even like the torture and I wanted to talk to you about that too like the torture scene like um,
*  There's
*  I've seen so many pencil necks talk about, you know, be rude about I shouldn't even said that
*  But people who talk about torture saying that torture doesn't work. I'm like
*  How can you say torture doesn't work?
*  Like by what statistic and i've seen people say these two we shouldn't torture because torture doesn't work
*  I'm like, how do you first of all, how do you know?
*  Have you tortured someone like how do you know like where you what are you basing this off?
*  And why are you saying it with such?
*  Authority and resolve. Yeah authority and resolve and conviction that you know based on statistics of something
*  You read that torture doesn't work. It seems to me like
*  If people have information and they don't want to give up that information
*  Yeah, we we don't want to think of ourselves as being this barbaric type of civilization that would torture someone to get information out of them
*  but
*  Also, if you want to look at it pragmatically that is how you would get people to talk
*  So to say that torture doesn't work and in fact people who are tortured will say anything and well, that's
*  Says who?
*  I hate that kind of conversation because you're because it's an it's an anti-military conversation a lot of ways because it's the same
*  It's the same kind of mentality that sort of dismisses all sorts of tactics that are used to protect people that don't
*  They have the luxury of not knowing what needs to be done or how it is done. Yeah
*  so it's very
*  It's very complex and yet it's very simple and I obviously use this in my writing
*  Uh, and I did in that first book because the protagonist had to become that terrorist become that insurgent
*  Yeah
*  So he had to adopt those tactics and he had essentially to had to abandon everything that he'd been fighting for
*  Uh for the past 16 years, uh to go after these people that wronged his family and his troop
*  So as far as the torture stuff goes, so I got to explore it in a fictional sense
*  so in real life
*  Um, it's important to talk about these things with your troops
*  So at the tactical leadership level where where I was my entire career
*  Whether I was just a brand new guy enlisted guy or a troop commander at the end
*  It was important especially once a 9-eleven happened to talk about these things before
*  We're in a situation where we called it first. We call it bit first. We call it battlefield interrogation and then it became
*  Uh tq tactical questioning a lot more pc to call it tactical questioning rather than battlefield interrogation
*  um
*  But you had to talk about it ahead of time so that your guys would know
*  What was appropriate ahead of time? So they're not in a situation where an ied has just gone off
*  One of our guys is killed and now we have someone we think
*  Is responsible for that and there's one or two of us three of us in this room with him
*  Um, what are those guys gonna do? Well, they're emotional
*  And maybe we haven't talked about it ahead of time
*  So what are they gonna do? They're gonna well who knows but point being before we get there during training
*  It can't just be a brief by like a pencil neck lawyer that comes in and says, all right, this is not this is yes appropriate
*  Exactly. It can't be that it has to be incorporated into the training. It has to be discussed by people that are trusted
*  And so that when someone's in that situation
*  He knows what one is appropriate because of the second and third order effects that may come from it
*  Um, yeah, you might want to put a bullet in that guy. Uh, you might want to torture him whatever
*  uh, but
*  Second third order effects of doing that
*  Could be more devastating to this unit, uh to the the uh
*  Our our strategy, uh as a whole that we're trying to accomplish over there. So you need to talk about it ahead of time. So
*  For me, it was important that for the guys to know that we have to maintain the moral high ground
*  Because there's very few things that separate us from our enemy when you get down to it
*  Uh, you're both killing you're both killing each other
*  and
*  There has to be something that makes it different for us and that's maintaining the moral high ground
*  We do not deliberately target civilians. That's a big differentiation
*  They they target civilians on purpose to get the political end that they want
*  Um, so that is a huge differentiator right there. Um
*  The torture thing is so interesting because of definitions. So it's making someone uncomfortable
*  Torture right is waterboarding torture. Is that torture? Well, they did it to my seer class
*  Here is survival evasion resistance escape and we all go through this training
*  Uh back then when I went through it, it was based on vietnam era type
*  Experiences that people had had in in vietnam and
*  it's morphed a little bit over time, but uh,
*  it's
*  They waterboarded people and they waterboard people in my class
*  If you did something that they thought the instructors thought would get you killed in real life or get somebody else killed in real life
*  so
*  Being a model prisoner it did not happen to me
*  But to my buddy he got waterboarded because uh, you did something that the instructors thought would get you and it's crazy
*  They put you in this prison camp where they're speaking a different language a made-up language
*  Their sights you look like you're in a prison camp because it's built like that their smells are cooking weird things
*  So the smells feel like you're in a different country
*  So all these different sensory inputs are telling you that you're not in the united states anymore
*  And you get slapped around they call it camp slappy. So you're getting slapped around so which is different
*  Uh, but you get waterboarded if you do something wrong
*  Uh, so is that torture are they torturing you as service members or is making them uncomfortable for a while?
*  Um, so these definitions are very important when we start talking
*  We put somebody in sitting in a corner and you're and they're they're in that seat position and they're not sleeping
*  We're keeping it up at night. Is that torture? Well, we kept bud students up in seal training for almost a week
*  Um, so is that torture? I I guess it's self-imposed. I mean, we're all volunteering to do it
*  This guy's not volunteering to sit there in the corner
*  Uh, but we also snatched him off the battlefield and we think he might have some information and it's putting him in an uncomfortable seated position
*  Is that torture some would say yes
*  So it's crazy in that when it becomes politicized and the enemy gets to use it
*  And when I say the enemy I also talk mean all their social media type networks all
*  Journalists that are sympathetic to the cause or whatever as soon as that can be morphed and called torture and become a distraction and become something
*  That undermines the mission as a whole then you have to look at it and say, okay
*  What are we getting by what we're doing in guantanamo? What what how?
*  Versus how much is that hurting and helping the enemy's recruiting efforts and I don't know where that is
*  I don't know what those numbers look like or where that tipping point is
*  But as soon as the enemy can get something and use it for their own benefit like having black sites if we didn't know
*  The black sites existed. Uh, you know, that would be wonderful, but everyone knows that black sites exist. It's been a black sites. It's just a
*  a
*  Base that is typically set up by another government agency with the knowledge of a different government
*  Um, and so it's not in the united states. It's not on us soil, uh to
*  Let the other government do the things that they can do that we can't essentially
*  So it's off the books type site
*  But everyone knows what it is because it's been on cover on the front pages of the new york times and everywhere else
*  As soon as that becomes something that the enemy can then leverage at what point?
*  Do does does it hurt us more than help us to have those and at what point does it hurt us more than help us?
*  To quote unquote torture someone or continue waterboarding or to put somebody in these seated positions and to have that be the distraction
*  And I don't know the answer
*  um, but it's something that needs to be thought of and talked about and at the tactical level the guys have to know that
*  We need to maintain that moral high ground
*  That's the only thing in a lot of cases that differentiates us from the enemy and we have to hold that ground that's imperative
*  So as a leader you got to talk about it and the guys have to know that once you have somebody much like a police officer
*  Here in the states once they have you cuffed and you're on the ground
*  Uh, like it's over like your job now becomes to protect that person. That's how it has to be
*  That's what makes us different that makes it you're different from that criminal that makes us different from the enemy
*  They're gonna if they have us in that position
*  They're gonna behead us and they're gonna hold our heads up on tv and they're gonna use it
*  For us our job is now to protect that person with our life
*  That's the difference between us and the enemy at the base level
*  So it's important to talk about that important for the guys to to understand it
*  So that when they're in that position and it's a guy's first deployment and his friend is wounded or dead
*  And he thinks this guy is behind it that he doesn't execute him when he has his hands cuffed behind him
*  so it's important stuff to talk about important stuff to think about and uh,
*  And it's it's tough. It's it's a tough thing to grapple with and
*  Those those are the variables right public perception whether or not that perception or the the knowledge of things that have been done
*  Could be used against our troops or used against our our country as a whole and in social media in perception
*  but the the idea that this is what what has driven me crazy about it is that those
*  Hard fast statements that torture doesn't work
*  And i'm like, which I don't know what you're saying. Yeah, I mean, what are you saying?
*  I think it probably works in some situations. Maybe not another I mean who knows when people say that i'm like
*  I bet I can get you to say yeah
*  I can get you to tell me where your fucking car keys are. Yeah. No exactly like what are you saying?
*  Like of course they it works. Yeah, like the idea that it's like
*  And they'll say it and it's always really left-wing people that'll stay statistically torture doesn't work
*  Yeah, what's that?
*  They say who's been keeping these stats since the beginning of time, bitch
*  Have you ever seen anybody torture like what are you talking about if I kept you up?
*  You would tell me everything all I'd have to do is keep you up. Yep
*  No, I mean there's a reason people have been doing it from the beginning of time. I'm sure in some phases
*  It didn't work or whatever
*  but at at that outside that tactical level when we're talking about
*  That next stage where the world knows about it where media knows about it where they're driving that story
*  And they're helping the enemy by shining a light on these things that may or may not work doesn't matter
*  Whether it works or not. Yeah, it's it's detrimental at this point. Uh, and whatever that point is
*  Then it's time to abandon it
*  Do you find that now that you're a prominent voice in the world of fiction authors and the fact that you're
*  your
*  Novels have a lot to do with like real places and real things real issues. Do you get asked questions?
*  Do you do get asked to give statements or get have your opinion on things?
*  Where you have to kind of measure it and go is there a benefit to this?
*  Is there a risk to like to be talking about it? Yeah, am I alienating?
*  People or is this something where you can use?
*  Your your your knowledge and your position as a platform to kind of like give your perspective on things from an educated point of view
*  Yeah, so it's it's uh
*  for me
*  It is very it's hard for me not to tell the truth
*  Like I am i'm the worst liar on the earth and my wife will let you will tell you
*  uh, so it it's very natural for me to
*  Answer honestly, but then also to be thoughtful
*  Uh, and that's why the novels I think also another reason they resonated with simon and schuster is because it's thoughtful violence
*  That's how I think of it
*  Um, it's not just uh, she's the guy in the knee or whatever
*  It's it's thoughtful violence, which is why those terrorists torture scenes are so intricate and involved to that one with the russian monster is heavy
*  Yeah, there's some good ones
*  So I want kind of that to be a kind of a hallmark of the series is that there are things that people haven't seen before
*  And it's not just extra violence. It's thoughtful violence
*  So I don't worry about alienating
*  It's it's more about me being honest
*  Uh, because people can tell like if you especially today like maybe 20 years ago
*  You could have hidden it behind managers and uh reputation man whatever you call it
*  Uh today you can't really hide if you're on social media
*  Like I think eventually if you have a thousand some posts people are going to glean and you're doing it and it's not obvious
*  That it's just a manager that's doing it and it's a picture of you know, you are not really it's not you
*  It's obvious. It's not you i'm talking about when it's obvious. It's you
*  It's hard I think to not be authentic and to let something slip through
*  Yeah, I think eventually it slips through. Yeah, I think I mean and you can see things that aren't appropriate
*  You're like, oh my god. Why would this person say that? Oh, you know why because it's them like that's that's why
*  Or they were drunk. Maybe maybe a little late at night
*  So like people don't understand the ramifications of posting things that and like you were saying how you got brought in by ncis that
*  One thing could be taken out of context. Oh, yeah and used against you in a really weird way
*  Oh, yeah, and I used to think oh, no, we're on the same side and you know, it's all about the
*  No, people are after a win that had to be a really disturbing revelation
*  Oh it was and that's why that book is so powerful in that scene and why uh, why how those guys go down is so violent?
*  Um, because it was therapeutic for me
*  I didn't have to actually go out and do it myself. I got to do it on the pages of a thriller
*  But for me, it's interesting so I do get asked I am I do go on different shows now as a military analyst
*  they ask me things and I answer honestly and I try to do it in a thoughtful way so example being the uh,
*  This was the co of the roosevelt that was relieved
*  last couple weeks because he wrote this letter and you know was framed by senior level officials as he
*  Sent out essentially like an open letter. It sounded like they made it sound like he sent it out to his entire address book
*  and he went above the chain of command and
*  Uh, so he was fired and it didn't go through the right proper channels
*  And it smelled weird to me from the beginning because you don't get to be in command of a nuclear powered aircraft carrier by being like
*  Eh, just some guy like, you know the military you're in for like 25 years at this point. You're a captain
*  uh, and I would be shocked if he had not
*  Exhausted every other avenue to try to get out what he needed to have done and he's responsible for
*  Fighting that aircraft carrier and he's also responsible for the men under his command and he and now we have like 900 cases
*  On that ship and that's after we explain to people that the the the ship was infected
*  Yep
*  So they had a couple cases I think they had three to start with on an aircraft carrier to docked in thailand or something like that
*  Uh, you know, maybe in january early february something like that before really things got out of control
*  So you're an aircraft carrier and the only place worse than a ship in a circumstance like this with an infectious disease
*  Is probably a submarine but he saw what was happening and he saw it starting to spread
*  He saw it as saw that it was impossible to abide by social distancing guidelines
*  And once you do when you actually have it not just social distancing, but once you have it how you isolate somebody
*  Impossible to do on a ship
*  And so he saw that
*  and then the story is that he wrote a letter wrote a letter and it got picked up by the chronicle in northern, california
*  And that it just went out to this
*  Huge number of people so it went out to 20 people. It was i've read the letter. It's four pages
*  It's very very well done very, uh thoughtful
*  It gives two courses of action one if we're at war and how we can keep fighting the ship
*  And two if we're not at war need to take care of these guys and be ready for when war comes
*  So it's very clearly delineated in these four pages very professional. It's on navy letterhead and it went out to 20 people
*  and for me, I thought you know what
*  this is very strange that
*  uh
*  That he's being attacked like this from senior level leaders making it seem like he sent it out to his entire like gmail address book
*  No, it's still us navy dot mill or whatever. It's not a secret
*  It's a secret communication, but there's official navy emails that aren't secret as well
*  And yeah, it bypassed the chain of command I guess
*  But that at some point I think is his responsibility
*  He needs to keep that ship fighting and who knows what the relational relationship was between him and the guy above him or whatever
*  I think there's something investigation will show it and now the and then the secretary of the navy flies
*  from washington dc
*  To guam to give a speech to these people on the aircraft carrier
*  And he says that the the captain that has just been relieved of duty
*  Was either stupid or incompetent if he thought that what he wrote in that email wasn't going to get out to the press
*  Meanwhile, the ironic part is that whole thing is videotaped that whole speech is taped and there's audio that makes it out to the media
*  So that's a funny part for me. But then also so then he's fired a couple days later
*  and then the uh, the uh secretary of the army or the secretary of defense
*  Now writes a letter an open letter that says essentially the same thing as the captain of the aircraft carrier
*  Wrote a few days earlier that got him fired. So it's really interesting. I went on some of these some of these shows
*  uh, I got to sit down with a couple different people with military backgrounds and I was the only one saying that
*  Something doesn't smell right here
*  And this guy has a responsibility to to fight that ship to to support his his soldiers or his sailors
*  And uh, something's just not right about this and now we'll see what happens
*  But but point being yeah
*  I do get asked about these things and I answer honestly because the
*  What are the other guys were saying on this show was that nope train of command he didn't follow the chain of command
*  And he should have followed that chain of command regardless, you know, the typical navy type line
*  But being from special operations and being a free thinker that's what we're supposed to do. We're supposed to be creative
*  We're supposed to think uh think
*  Kind of red sell things from the enemy side think about it from that side of the house
*  And do what what we do, which is why we get in trouble a lot of the time in special operations because we're kind of uh,
*  Not military and uh, I mean we're military but you know
*  We like to like to not break the rules
*  We like to bend them to a certain extent to get what we need done
*  And that's just very natural for us
*  But uh when you're sitting down with people that aren't like that, uh, and don't think that way
*  It's kind of interesting but point being I do get asked about these things and I don't really measure it against if i'm going to alienate
*  People uh or not. It's just hey i'm going to be honest
*  I'm going to be open i'm going to be authentic and that's what people can trust about me and they can trust about my writing
*  Is that when they read that they know that I just didn't get it from somebody else like it's a part of me somehow
*  And it's very personal even though it's fiction
*  And that's what you can trust and if my protagonist is using a certain weapon or a certain knife or a certain
*  It's not just that I googled navy seal knife and so or someone's saying and then he pulled out his navy seal dagger instead
*  Like no, that's not how it goes. You're gonna know exactly who made it the relationship all that sort of thing
*  So what people can trust is that they're gonna get my honest assessment. That's what I owe the guys in the teams
*  I owed them my honest assessment. That's what I owe the people above me in the chain of command
*  Uh, no matter what it did. I owed them my honest assessment because that's what they could trust
*  Uh, they they didn't have to worry about whether
*  Uh, i'm just telling them something just because I think that's what they want to hear
*  Uh, or i'm looking to get ahead because I never wanted this to be a career in the military
*  I was just in there to fight and uh and to lead
*  But that's what they can trust is my honest assessment. And so that's how I deal with today
*  I'm just going to answer honestly, but it will be thoughtful
*  It's not going to be like an off the cuff craziness that I then have to go back and retract or I hope it's not going to be
*  It's going to be thoughtful because that's what I that's what I owe the guys also
*  Was that thoughtful assessment both up and down the chain so
*  That's just natural for me to do and what you're going to get today
*  Well this mindset and this the the discipline and the authenticity it comes out and you're writing man
*  I know I started with the last one and I have to start
*  You were a little bummed out that I was like starting with the last one, right?
*  Well, most people get invested in the character like people ask me like can I start with this third one and the publisher wants me
*  To say yes start with the third one like buy it now. Let me tell you you could absolutely start with the third one
*  Maybe i'll be more invested if I start with the first one. I don't know man, but the third one was fucking great
*  I loved it and uh, i'm gonna get into the first two now
*  Listen, you knocked it out of the park man. It was amazing amazing book. I'm excited to read the first two now
*  People can follow you is it jack car usa jack car usa on the socials most active on instagram and twitter
*  Uh, there is a facebook but three was too much. So yeah
*  Uh, yeah, i feel the exact same way usa and then officialjackcar.com is the uh,
*  Is the website and people can go deep dive into weapons or knives or gear on that sort of thing. So all right, man
*  Well, thanks brother. I appreciate you. Thanks much for having me on and thank you for what you do for uh for hunting
*  And for those of us that are self-reliant and forgiving this, uh,
*  We're really opening people's eyes to to what they can do to be better citizens and better prepare going forward
*  So thank you for all you do my pleasure my pleasure. Thank you. Bye everybody
*  Yeah, man
*  Me
