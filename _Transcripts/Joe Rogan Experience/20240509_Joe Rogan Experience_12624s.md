# Joe Rogan Experience #2148 - Gad Saad
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzU_UrhmCEs)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  How you doing?
*  What's going on, man? Good to see you.
*  Tenth episode.
*  Crazy.
*  Unbelievable.
*  What are the odds?
*  Short of your regular crew.
*  Am I in the hall of fame?
*  Yeah, you're in the league.
*  There's very few people that have had ten episodes.
*  It's a small handful, for sure.
*  I mean, I should put that as the top thing on my CV.
*  All the other stuff is bullshit.
*  Ten time on Joe Rogan.
*  Drop the mic.
*  This is how out of the corporate world I am.
*  I don't even know what a CV is.
*  I don't know what it stands for.
*  I know people say it.
*  I know what it means, but I don't know what it stands for.
*  Want me to tell you what an academic CV looks like?
*  Sure.
*  What does it stand for?
*  What's CV?
*  Curriculum vitae.
*  Ah, okay.
*  You basically, in academia, you'll start with your education, all your degrees, all of your positions that you've held.
*  I was assistant professor here from here again.
*  Then all of your journal publications, all of your books, all of your conference art, you know, and so on.
*  Right.
*  So it can end up being a pretty beefy CV.
*  I think mine is about 47 pages long.
*  Oh, my goodness.
*  Look at you.
*  You accomplished academic.
*  Speaking of which.
*  And managed to stay logical.
*  How did you do that?
*  Oh, you got a new book.
*  Dropping on May 14th on happiness.
*  The sad truth, two A's about happiness.
*  Eight secrets for leading a good life.
*  Enjoy it.
*  How have I been so productive?
*  How have you managed to, I mean, people have gotten annoyed at you, but you've somehow or another avoided like a full scale cancellation.
*  Well.
*  With your positions, it's kind of amazing.
*  It truly is.
*  I'm kind of like the Velcro Don.
*  Teflon.
*  Teflon Don.
*  Velcro is the opposite.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Nothing sticks.
*  They've tried to cancel me in all sorts of ways.
*  But that speaks, by the way, to one of the powerful reasons why tenure, despite the fact that a lot of people despise the concept of tenure.
*  Oh, it's just a bunch of lazy academics who are going to be deadwood for the next 30 years.
*  But if I didn't have the protection of tenure, I'd be gone long ago.
*  Now, that doesn't mean that I still haven't suffered many consequences.
*  Right.
*  So I haven't gotten other jobs that I would have otherwise gotten because of how irreverent I am.
*  You know, the death threats.
*  So now after October 7th, it's almost became impossible for me to go on campus because, first of all, you know, I'm high profile.
*  My university has a particular demographic reality.
*  And so there are consequences to speaking out.
*  So you can't go on campus literally?
*  I mean, I have gone.
*  I have gone.
*  But during the points when there were a lot of protests outside, you know, the campus and so on or on campus, because our campus is an urban campus.
*  So it's hard to say where the school begins and where the city is.
*  Right.
*  You know, you have death to Jews and free Palestine and Intifada and from the river to the sea.
*  And there's 800 of them screaming.
*  And you're going to come in.
*  Many of them know who you are.
*  They know that I'm not very supportive of their positions.
*  And so it's going to be, you know, a bit challenging.
*  So on a few cases, I did it via Zoom.
*  Other times I had to have security with me.
*  So I would have to check into security and they'd have to walk with me to class and so on.
*  That's not a good thing.
*  I'll tell you another quick story, if I may, please, about what happened after October 7th.
*  So I'll first talk about what happened in Lebanon.
*  So the day that we escaped from Lebanon, for those of your viewers who don't know about us, we're Lebanese Jews.
*  We were there until the start of the Civil War.
*  We were there in the first year of the Civil War.
*  And then we had to leave because it became impossible to be Jewish in Lebanon.
*  When we left that day, it was from Beirut to Copenhagen, Copenhagen to Montreal.
*  As we cleared the airspace of Lebanon, the captain, I discussed this in Chapter one of my previous book,
*  The Parasitic Mine, he said, OK, we're now out of Lebanese airspace.
*  And so my my said my wife, my mother pulls out a pendulum with the Star of David, puts it around me, my neck, and says, now you can wear this.
*  Be proud and not hide your identity.
*  Now, that's in the past, but I'm going to link it to the current reality.
*  About three weeks after October 7th, my wife and son came to pick me up from a cafe where I was working on my laptop.
*  My my wife had picked up my son who was playing a soccer match in the east end of the city.
*  And so as I got into the car, he says, Daddy, if you had come to where I was playing soccer today and you were wearing a Star of David, you'd be dead.
*  So nineteen seventy five, a Star of David is put around me and now I can wear it proudly.
*  Forty five years later, I better not wear a Star of David in Montreal, Canada.
*  That doesn't bode too well.
*  At a kid's soccer game.
*  Because the demographic reality in that neighborhood is such that a Star of David would be viewed as provocative incitement.
*  What's crazy to me is regardless of how you feel about how the Israeli military and the army is pursuing the war in Gaza, regardless of that, the blatant just out in the open anti-Semitism that we see today is like nothing I've ever seen before.
*  Like like roaches coming out of the woodwork.
*  Like what?
*  Like you see it all over social media and it's like this.
*  If this is September and not October, like if this is you would be you would be shunned.
*  Everybody would be like, this is horrible.
*  How the fuck could you say this?
*  How you're openly anti-Semitic.
*  You're openly blaming the Jews for all the world's problems.
*  This is crazy.
*  This is crazy.
*  This is Nazi shit.
*  And yet you're seeing it everywhere now.
*  When those teachers were in front of Congress, when those principals of those universities were in front of Congress and they were saying that it's not harassment to say death to the Jews unless it's actionable.
*  Which is the craziest mental verbal gymnastics I have ever heard anyone say that's in that position and a position of being the head of Harvard.
*  It was so crazy to watch.
*  It's so crazy.
*  It's almost like we live in an alternative timeline.
*  Like we entered into a new dimension, like in our sleep, we woke up or in a new place.
*  You know, nothing should surprise me given the history that I have growing up in the Middle East.
*  But I was taken aback after October 7th at the Jew hatred that I was exposed to.
*  Now, my positions are really not inflammatory.
*  So, for example, I'll say things like, you know, I'm I'm worried about my I have a lot of extended family in Israel.
*  Right. So after the October 7th happened for me to just kind of call around to make sure that none of my cousins and their children and aunts and friends are going to be able to get into the Jewish community.
*  No one was harmed.
*  Will take a while.
*  Well, that itself, the fact that I cared about my family was incitement was I'm a Zionist.
*  I'm a baby killer.
*  Right. I am personally responsible for the IDF killing any innocent children.
*  But it's not just that.
*  It's coming at you from all directions.
*  So in the past, you could say, OK, Islamic sources are going to send you Jew hatred.
*  And I'm used to that.
*  You could say the neo-Nazi alt-right types, you know, Jews will not replace us.
*  They're coming after me.
*  You've got, of course, the academic progressive left types who are also anti-Zionist, which is just code sweet word for anti-Jewish.
*  And so everywhere you turn, there is Jew hatred.
*  And it's so normalized.
*  Now, of course, in part, it is emboldened by the fact that a lot of them are anonymous.
*  They don't put their real names so they can take the liberty to be this orgiastically Jew hater.
*  But it's so disenchanting to see that that guy could be my gardener.
*  He could be my surgeon.
*  He could be my dentist.
*  I don't know who he is.
*  But there are millions of those folks who hold those beliefs.
*  It's unbelievable.
*  I think a lot of them are fake as well.
*  I think a lot of them are Russian and Chinese trolls.
*  I think there's a disturbing amount of them that's responsible for.
*  Taking this kind of discourse and pushing it to a much higher level and making it more ubiquitous.
*  I really, really believe that.
*  And there's a lot of data to support that.
*  And I think that's part of what's going on with social media.
*  It's definitely a big part of what's going on with Twitter and TikTok.
*  And a lot of these things where you see these very inflammatory messages that seem to be pushed.
*  They're pushed through and promoted to the fact that you get them all the time.
*  They show up in your feed all the time.
*  Even if you're not subscribed to these, even if you're not following these people, you'll find this disturbing content will show up in your feed.
*  And I really firmly believe that we're being manipulated.
*  I really do.
*  And I think there's a lot of these young kids that are on these campuses that are very malleable.
*  They're very easily influenced.
*  And they don't need.
*  I mean, so many.
*  I'm sure you've seen Constantine Kissin from Trigonometry.
*  He's done these interviews with these people, these protests, and so many of them are completely ignorant.
*  They have no idea what they're just doing because they think they're a good person.
*  They're putting up their flag of virtue by saying free Palestine from the river to the sea.
*  And they don't even know what that means.
*  Like, what do you do?
*  You know what you're saying?
*  You're saying you're saying wipe out Israel.
*  Is that what you're saying?
*  Not only that, in a lot of cases, they're supporting regimes or ideologies that would be perfectly antithetical to their main identity.
*  So here's for Palestine, chickens for Kentucky Fried Chicken, or I like to use geese for foie gras because I'm from Montreal.
*  I mean, imagine if you present yourself to the world with your queer identity, which is great.
*  Good for you.
*  And now you decide, OK, let me see.
*  Should I be supporting Tel Aviv, which is one of the most queer friendly places?
*  I mean, short of Montreal, New York, San Francisco, Tel Aviv is right up there.
*  So you would think that if my key identity, my definitional identity is my queerness, that I'm certainly putting all my chips with Tel Aviv.
*  No, it's with queers for Palestine.
*  So that's exactly what parasitic thinking is.
*  And I think I really do think that's supported by other countries.
*  I think they they realize how vulnerable and idiotic a lot of Americans are, and they're just pushing that.
*  And whether you realize it or not, social media, even if they're saying something ridiculous, it's very influential.
*  And they can just move the boundaries a little bit by having the most extreme content, the most ridiculous things be so common.
*  Then less extreme content that would ordinarily be considered ridiculous now becomes accepted as normalized.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Which is what you're seeing.
*  Yeah, exactly. Can I point?
*  I mean, you alluded to it earlier about what the IDF might be doing.
*  Can I just mention a few things about that? Sure.
*  And I'm hardly the spokesperson of the IDF, but just it's an idea that I've been toying with and I'm pictured here for the first time.
*  So, you know, this notion of equality of opportunities versus equality of outcomes.
*  Right. Typically, we we link it to all of the woke stuff.
*  Right. So equality of opportunities is great. Equality of outcomes is a cancer to human dignity.
*  OK, let's now apply that concept equality of outcomes to war casualties.
*  So I think this is what happens when people say, oh, but the IDF is being grotesque because the currency that then matters becomes how many dead on each side equality of outcome.
*  But let me change it to a different moral currency. OK, let's talk about intent.
*  So, for example, in this in the justice system, you could have a person who is found guilty of involuntarily vehicle vehicular homicide and he kills four people.
*  OK, so four are dead. So that's equality of outcome.
*  Four were died versus someone who took out a hit on his entire family, his his brother, sister and parents so that he can gain when the insurance money.
*  But it's an undercover operation. The cops catch you, even though in that case there were zero killed.
*  Correct. That person will get a higher sentence because we understand in the law that intent matters.
*  So now I think you know I'm going with the analogy. So in the Palestinian IDF conflict, when say Hamas launches six thousand rockets, every single one of which is intercepted by the Iron Dome,
*  had they not had the Iron Dome, then the outcome could have been that fifty thousand would have been killed.
*  Right. In an ideal world from Hamas perspective, our intent would be to eradicate every last Jew.
*  They have it in their charter. So, yes, it is true that if we just count the number of people who were killed on October 7th versus the number who were killed in the retaliation,
*  if that's the only calculus that matters, then oh, yes, the idea has gone way overboard.
*  But once you change it to an existential intent issue, then maybe it's not such a as bad of an outcome as you think, notwithstanding that a single innocent dead is a tragedy.
*  That's you could say it that way. But the problem with that is the Iron Dome does exist and Hamas is military capabilities are far below Israel's.
*  It would be like if some small person tried to punch me and I moved out of the way and then beat them to death.
*  And I said, no, I had to defend myself. I beat them to death. But I didn't have to beat them to death.
*  They're just small person. Even if they hit me, it wouldn't really hurt. Right. It's not. You know, I'm saying, sure, like defensively, I'm not worried about a real small person that doesn't know how to fight who throws a punch at me.
*  So what would what would be in your moral calculus, the ideal outcome that should have happened as a retaliation to October 7th? That's a very good question.
*  Obviously, I'm not a military analyst. If I was, you know, you do have to take in consideration the tunnels. You do have to take into consideration the infrastructure.
*  The question is, did they just knowingly bomb places where there was going to be hundreds and hundreds of innocent civilians knowing that there's going to be a few Hamas?
*  Yeah. And that's what scares people. What scares people is that someone is willing to kill women and children just to get at bad guys. And they just say that's just part of the game.
*  That that seems horrific in the twenty twenty four understanding of human life and morality and just the horrors of war that, you know, they're blowing up mosques, they're blowing up schools, they're blowing up apartment buildings, everything, anything where they think Hamas is.
*  So, again, let me preface and I shouldn't have to say this, that a single person that's innocent is a tragedy.
*  Of course. But compare that reality to almost any other war that you have in working memory.
*  Why is there a unique, unbelievably high threshold of morality that is placed on the Israeli nation? Right.
*  Now, you probably already know this. The IDF does go through a lot of painstaking effort to try to minimize that. Right.
*  They drop leaflets in Arabic. They even sometimes call people in Arabic and say, don't go in this area.
*  They hold. So, of course, they've killed many, many innocent people. But their place between a rock and a hard place.
*  What what can you do? Right. The other side knows exactly that if they do exactly how what they're doing, either you don't retaliate and we win or you retaliate very harshly as they have.
*  And then you still win. Right. Today, the propaganda war has been completely won by Hamas. Right.
*  There is a complete genocide in the informational war against the IDF. Right.
*  One other point, and then I'll see the floor back to you. This the term genocide.
*  Jack Derrida was a very famous postmodernist who developed the field of deconstructionism. Language creates reality. Right.
*  He was one of the guys who allowed the ecosystem of up is down. Men could be women. Left is right. Slavery is freedom. Right.
*  It's that postmodernist game that allows these kind of insane ideas to flourish.
*  Well, when you misuse words like everything is a genocide, that's that does that does no one a service.
*  There is no genocide. There is a killing of a lot of people. Again, every single one killed is a tragedy.
*  But if Israel wanted to commit a genocide by the end of my appearing on this tenth time on the show, there wouldn't be a single Palestinian left.
*  So if they were genocidal in their intent, then they really are shitty genocidal maniacs because, first of all, the population, as you know, of the Palestinian territories has gone up fivefold. Right.
*  So that's really sucky genocide. And they've killed depending on the count. Right. But that's all previous to this. This military actions going on now.
*  What are the numbers? The population, you know, right now? It's hard to say.
*  You know, I mean, Israel has one statistic and then there's other statistics by human rights organizations that estimate at least twelve thousand missing in the rubble that are probably dead and thirty thousand dead.
*  Now, at the number of those thirty thousand, what percentage is Hamas? I'm not sure.
*  So I've heard the the the most favorable estimates to to the IDF are about one to one ratio.
*  The less estimate, it's about one to one point five. OK, one to two up to one to two.
*  So if they so if they killed thirty thousand people, fifteen thousand or Hamas, that would be best.
*  No, one to one would be fifteen thousand to fifteen thousand. And then you can take it from there. Right.
*  OK. So a one to one one to one half of them. So half of them. Yeah.
*  So half of 30 is 15. Exactly. OK. Right.
*  So now let's compare it to and I don't know if others have made this analogy.
*  When you drop the bomb, the atomic bomb, almost all the people who were killed were noncombatants.
*  Right. So then that ratio would be two hundred and fifty thousand killed to zero.
*  I mean, unless there's a few Japanese military guys that were in Nagasaki or Hiroshima, you dropped.
*  And again, I'm not I'm not trying to say, oh, but they're not as bad as these other guys.
*  So they're OK. Let's give them a ribbon and a medal.
*  But again, it's it is anti-Semitic when you place one group of people to a standard of morality that is not expected of anybody else.
*  So, for example, if you really care about Arab lives, then you certainly should care about all of the Yemenis that have been killed.
*  That are a lot more than whatever's happened after October 7th.
*  You would care about the five hundred thousand Syrians that were killed.
*  You would care about the war between Iran and Iraq that led to several million killed.
*  And how about a Lebanese civil war?
*  A hundred and fifty thousand died in a very short.
*  Right. But that's not happening currently.
*  So people aren't totally aware of that.
*  Like just those statistics that you brought up, the Lebanese deaths.
*  Just most people are not aware of that.
*  Most people that are discussing this, especially college kids, are not aware of that.
*  That's why I'm here.
*  Yeah. I mean, it's all ugly. It's all awful.
*  There's nothing that you could say that is in any way, shape or form positive about any of this.
*  Yeah.
*  The question is, is there another way to do it other than just bombing these areas where you know Hamas is and civilians?
*  There is another way, but I don't think it will happen.
*  Can I share it?
*  Yeah.
*  So Golda Meir, who was the fourth or fifth prime minister of Israel from, I think, 1969 to 1974, has two quotes, which I'm going to paraphrase.
*  I don't have the exact quote.
*  She said, if the Jews put down their arms, there'll be a genocide.
*  If the Palestinians put down their arms, there'll be peace.
*  So just remember that for a second.
*  Second one is if the Arabs, and she means in this case the Palestinian Arabs, if they were to love their children more than they hate ours, then they'd be peace.
*  So why am I saying these two quotes?
*  Because this battle is really not about land.
*  And in a sense, we've already addressed this on previous shows where I've come and discussed about some of these Islamic issues.
*  It is an existential affront that the Jewish state exists in the Middle East.
*  So look at all other religious minorities across Arabia.
*  Egypt used to be completely coptic Christian, 100 percent, many hundred years ago.
*  Today, there are 10 percent cops left.
*  What happened to those cops?
*  There used to be tons of Christians in Syria.
*  What happened to those Syrians?
*  There used to be tons of Christians in Lebanon.
*  There still are some, about 30, 35 percent, but Lebanon used to be a majority Christian country.
*  So the goal of Islam, not individual Muslims, right?
*  Again, I don't need to preface by saying there are millions and millions of lovely, kind, peaceful Muslims.
*  Of course there is.
*  But Islam as an ideology, does it tolerate others?
*  Well, we have 1,400 years of history that either says it does or doesn't, right?
*  We don't have to watch TikTok videos.
*  And nothing could be clearer than what the words of Muhammad were, the prophet of Islam,
*  who said that you need to rid Arabia of Christians, but certainly the Jews.
*  So the existence of the land of Israel is an affront to that.
*  One more point and I'll see to go back to you.
*  In Islam, there's a concept called Dar al-Islam and Dar al-Harab.
*  That means the house of Islam and the house of war.
*  Anything that's under the Islamic control is good.
*  Anything that's yet to be under Islamic control is under the house of war.
*  Once a territory is under Islamic control and you lose it, you have to get it back.
*  It is your dominion forever.
*  This is why, for example, Andalusia, which was at one point controlled, which is in current Spain,
*  which was controlled by the Moors, an Islamic conquistador.
*  A lot of jihadists will say, Inshallah, we have to reconquer Andalusia.
*  It is our land because once it's under.
*  So Israel existentially cannot exist.
*  So why am I saying all this?
*  You can't have peace if you have the other side that truly never wants for you to exist.
*  That's the bottom line.
*  If you can change people's heart where they say, look, I get a piece of land, you get another piece.
*  Let's build an incredible, vibrant co-society together.
*  You'd have peace.
*  But if you're taught from straight out of the womb that the Jews is the reason for every calamity in the world, you're not going to have peace.
*  But don't you think that there are Jews and there are Israelis that treat Palestinians as if they're less?
*  There is that in Texas in terms of treating people who are Hispanic.
*  The darkness of the human heart is not monopolized by one group.
*  There are super nasty Jews and they are incredibly lovely and kind Jews.
*  There are super nice Muslims and incredibly brutal Muslims.
*  So there is no monopoly on the darkness of the human heart.
*  So I can see that.
*  Of course, there are Jews that are not very keen on having Palestinian neighbors.
*  But as someone who grew up in the two worlds, right, I'm an Arabic speaking Jew.
*  I hang around with tons of Muslims.
*  I hang around with tons of Jews.
*  Have I ever heard somebody in my Jewish family say, oh, God, I can't wait for us to eradicate the 1.52 billion Muslims in the world?
*  I've never heard that.
*  Have I heard incessantly all the time about, inshallah, we'll get rid of the Jews every second.
*  You just have to say, hi, Ahmad.
*  The next line is, God damn it, we've got to get rid of the Jews.
*  Now, it's become a lot.
*  Isn't it that common where you are?
*  It's as common as the heat in Texas.
*  It is definitional.
*  As a matter of fact, I introduced a game, I mean, facetiously, but I mean it seriously, six degrees of Jew.
*  So that's a play on six degrees of.
*  Kevin Bacon. Exactly.
*  So I give you a calamity in the world and you've got up to six causal steps to blame the Jews.
*  So an Amazonian frog just died in the Amazon.
*  Go.
*  And so I will post these on Twitter and people give answers.
*  Now, oftentimes they're just playing along, but that's the mindset.
*  You got diabetes?
*  Well, that's because the Jews who are controlling the pharmaceutical industry are not releasing the drug.
*  I'll give you a recent one that I face.
*  So I put up a police lineup of some guys that had been caught in Huddersfield, which is a town in England, who had been grooming and raping young British white girls.
*  And you may or may not know this.
*  I'm not sure if we've discussed it in the past in Britain.
*  Over the past 25 years, there's been an unbelievable industrial scale level grooming and raping of young white girls by Asian men.
*  That's a euphemism for men of a certain religious heritage.
*  But you say it's their Asian.
*  So their names are.
*  Let me summarize them for you.
*  Mohammed Ahmed, Mohammed Ahmed, Mohammed, Mohammed, Mohammed, Ahmed, Ahmed, Ahmed, Ahmed, Ahmed, Mohammed, Mohammed, Mohammed, Mohammed.
*  OK.
*  So I put those up and I sarcastically said, I don't have a big enough brain to do the big data analytics to understand what is the commonality across all those gentlemen.
*  Did anybody help me?
*  Do you know how many people wrote to me and blamed it on the Jews?
*  Not facetiously.
*  So now I'm going to ask you, Joe.
*  How?
*  I was just going to ask you that.
*  How is it when three Mohammeds rape your 12 year old British girl?
*  You blame it on Mordechai.
*  Three Mohammeds lead to Mordechai.
*  Tell me how you tell me.
*  I don't know.
*  How do they do it?
*  Who let them in?
*  It's the Jewish cabal who controls immigration policy.
*  It's George Soros, the Jew who controls the open society ideology.
*  I don't think you could really just connect George Soros to Jewish.
*  He's not Jewish.
*  If you look at his policies, he seems anti-Western civilization.
*  I agree.
*  But for the for the Jew hater, any any causal explanation, one individual who just happens to be Jewish or they point to some other one.
*  There's one I don't even know who she is.
*  I think Barbara Lerner or something.
*  Somebody will correct us in the comments section where they show her saying something.
*  Oh, you know, we need to flood and she happens to be Jewish.
*  But for every Jewish person who is pro open door policy, there's a counter Jewish person.
*  Here is one who is not for open border policies.
*  Right. Stephen Miller, who worked in the Trump administration, is Jewish.
*  He's probably the biggest anti open door immigration.
*  So but that's the mindset of the Jew hater.
*  Everything is being there is this incredible diabolical feature of the Jew that they're able to at times pretend that they're victims, but really they're diabolical and genocidal.
*  It's grotesque, man.
*  It's weird.
*  It's just weird that it became so out in the open.
*  And that's what makes me think that they've been influenced.
*  I just I just can't imagine there was that much anti Semitism before October.
*  So why why do you like the influence is coming for what purpose?
*  Just to see the create havoc.
*  Yes. Yeah.
*  To keep people at each other's throats.
*  I really think so.
*  And also to completely screw up democracy.
*  You know, like people have lost all their faith in in voting.
*  They've lost all their faith in the money behind politics and the influence behind politics.
*  And the more this stuff just gets brought up, the more chaos there is, the more hatred there is, the more divide there is.
*  Yeah. Even amongst the Democratic Party, right, which we talked about the other day that like some large number, we think it's around 70 percent of Jewish people vote Democrat.
*  But now, you know, the Democratic Party is full on with this Palestine thing.
*  And, you know, you see it on college campuses, this rampant anti Semitism, death to the Jews being tolerated, literally saying that, yelling it out.
*  And by the way, you can go back.
*  So I wouldn't be able to tell you which number, which episode, but you can go back to earlier episodes that have appeared on this glorious podcast where you will see that I would have predicted exactly what we're seeing now.
*  And it's not because I'm a prophet or it's not because I'm so intelligent.
*  It's because you simply have to have the the power of having the imagination to extrapolate from a current trend to some future and and outcome.
*  Right. So if you let in into your country, people who have genocidal Jew hatred as an endemic feature of their society.
*  So I'll give you since people love stats.
*  So there was a pew. Pew is a nonpartisan.
*  If anything, they probably lean towards being more woke.
*  So Pew has these global surveys that they conduct.
*  So in 2010, they conducted a survey looking at your your how favorable are you towards the Jews across a whole bunch of Islamic countries?
*  Now, if you were if I were to tell you that 10 percent of the polled people exhibited, you know, Jew hatred, you'd say, oh, boy, that's a big number.
*  Ten percent is a lot.
*  OK. How about if I tell you that for most of those polled countries, it was between 95 to 99 percent.
*  So let me I know people understand what 95 to 99 means.
*  If I pull 100 people, 95 to 99 will express very problematic Jew hatred.
*  OK. So now if I let in 100,000 such people into the country, it doesn't take a fancy evolutionary psychologist and a professor with a 47 page academic CV to say, well, probably Jew hatred is going to go up.
*  So that's what we're seeing now.
*  We're seeing the outcome of having an immigration policy that has let in people that don't share our foundational values.
*  Again, this doesn't mean someone's going to write in the comments section.
*  What a hypocrite. You're an immigrant, Gats had.
*  Well, there are immigrants and there are immigrants.
*  There are tons of Muslims who want to come in here and leave all that baggage at the door.
*  They want nothing to do with that.
*  They just want to live the American experience.
*  The problem is we don't have the machine that can look into your heart and mind.
*  Right. So it's a statistical game.
*  So if you're going to let in hundreds, I mean, look what's happening in Germany.
*  Look what's happening in France.
*  Look what's happening in Denmark.
*  Well, let me ask you this. Why do you think that stuff is happening?
*  Why do you think this is mass immigration?
*  So that's that's a great question.
*  So it's it's covered partly in parasitic mind.
*  My earlier book and in my next book, which I call suicidal empathy.
*  Right. So empathy is a emotion that has evolved for very clear evolutionary reasons.
*  So just like any of our other emotions, for example, envy, there are evolutionary reasons why we've evolved the emotion of envy.
*  Right. It can compel us forward.
*  I see that Joe's doing well keeping up with the Joneses.
*  Maybe it get me off my fat ass so I can work harder.
*  So there are very clear evolutionary reasons why empathy exists.
*  But the problem is when empathy misfires, it either becomes hyperactive or it misfires in in directing the empathy to the wrong person.
*  So, for example, illegal immigrants more important than American vets.
*  Right. And I can show you many public policies where you have these insane policies, all of which are due to suicidal empathy.
*  So to answer your question, I think that the Western mind is we are kind, tolerant, compassionate, empathetic people.
*  There are people out there.
*  They're Guatemalan, they're Honduran, they're Yemeni who don't have it as well as we do.
*  Wouldn't it be nice if we open up our doors?
*  So the reflex is a noble one. It's a nice one. But it exists in Unicornia.
*  The real world doesn't operate that way.
*  If you let in people that have a huge hatred of homosexuality, are you going to have an increase in homophobia in your country or decrease?
*  Right. So so I think that's the answer.
*  The answer is misdirected empathy across the West.
*  Is it really that simple? Because it seems like it's happened so rapidly that it seems like a plan, like a plan to create more chaos.
*  So it's happened. The border policy in America is puzzling.
*  It's very it's baffling because it seems like there's a plan to flood the country.
*  So it's a it's a sort of a conspiratorial kind of cabal.
*  This seems like there's something going on that's allowing it to happen, even though everyone recognizes it's a problem and it's solvable.
*  But they don't solve it. In fact, the the the United States government is actively tried to stop Texas from enforcing their border.
*  So what? But I think that's just so I've often tweeted that the most dangerous weapon in in human context is a parasitized mind.
*  Right. I mean, a bomb is dangerous, but it is it is the human mind that activates that bomb.
*  Right. It's a guy with a little mustache that said the Jews are the real problem in the world and I need to get rid of the world of that parasite.
*  Right. So parasitic thinking.
*  I mean, one of the reasons I think that that book did so well is because it really explained how all of these parasitic ideas came to a head together.
*  And they were all spawned on university campuses over the past 40 to 80 years.
*  So one one hypothesis is what you said, which is there is kind of a grand scheme that's willfully doing this.
*  Another one is that all of the Western leaders of roughly the same age, I mean, within 20 years of each other, are all a product of a Western education,
*  university education that was completely infected with these dreadful parasitic ideas so that when these leaders go out there and have the power to enact policies, they elect these policies.
*  So my view is slightly different from yours in that I don't think that there is a supra mega, you know, willful plan.
*  It's just that all of those Western leaders are the product of a really shitty university system.
*  Hmm. Right. But there's obviously two schools of thought, right?
*  There's the left wing school of thought and the right wing school of thought in regards to this.
*  The right wing school of thought wants to seal our borders, wants to secure the borders, wants to stop illegal immigration.
*  The left wing wants. I mean, I don't know what they want because they start talking about border policies being a problem as well.
*  And they start talking about the issue of the border and they try to blame Trump for the issues of the border, which is always hilarious.
*  But they're just so with that kind of stuff with blaming like when Biden blames Trump for things that he clearly did, it's just gaslighting.
*  Right. And it's just it just shows you how little respect they have for people's ability to understand what's actually going on.
*  Well, look, suicidal empathy. I mean, we can move beyond the border.
*  How about say in the justice system, suicidal empathy results in you caring more about the perpetrator than the victim.
*  That's suicidal empathy. Right. Because that argument.
*  So here's how that leftist argument works.
*  If a person, especially a criminal of color, commits a crime, that's probably because he grew up as a person of color.
*  So he's already been marginalized by the society.
*  So now he commits a crime. You're now double whamming him by putting him in the penal system.
*  So you need to be more caring. So he's already got 57 previous arrests.
*  Let's give him a 58th chance. So again, I don't think it comes from it comes from really parasitized thinking.
*  Right. Right. But that those policies are supported by George Soros specifically.
*  And he actively goes after D.A.s that have the most lenient and ridiculous policies in regards to no cash bails, releasing violent criminals.
*  That seems like that's done on purpose. That's done with intent.
*  But it's done on purpose. So I think where we may differ is you think it's because there is a duplicitous evil.
*  Let's cause havoc. Whereas I think they actually believe that that's the noble position. Right.
*  And there should be no borders. There is no illegal human. What kind of bullshit is this?
*  I mean, why do you have a lock on your door? Right.
*  So why is it that I get to have sex with my beautiful wife, but all these homeless guys are sexually starved? That's not fair.
*  That's the parasitism of socialism. We're all equal. Why do you make a lot more money than I do, Joe? That's not fair.
*  I need to have as much money as you. Right. So I don't think I mean, I hope that it's not what you what you're saying is true, because then that's even more sinister.
*  Right. There is kind of a boo hoo hoo. I just think it's people who are misguided in their misdirected nobility. Right.
*  I think it's both. You think it's both. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's both. Maybe it's both.
*  I think there's definitely a lot of misguided people, but I think there's definitely a plan.
*  It just it's too organized. The D.A. system, the D.A. thing with funding the far left is D.A.'s and then funding someone who opposes them, who's even more ridiculous.
*  That that seems to be a plan. Yeah. And he's got a pattern of that and he seems to enjoy it.
*  Enjoy spending his money in that way. But he enjoys it. I think it's like this crazy game. Right.
*  Right. What do you think about what's going on with your boyfriend Trump these days?
*  Well, although the trials, the trials. Fascinating. You know, I had Mike Baker on who was formerly a CIA operative formally.
*  But we were we were talking about that, that no one's ever been charged for something like that before.
*  No one's ever been prosecuted for something like that before. Certainly no political opponents.
*  And my my thing is the danger, the people that are on the left that don't understand that now you set a precedent.
*  You set a terrible precedent. And if Trump does get in office, what does this stop him from going after all of his political enemies in the same exact way?
*  Are we going to do this now? Every time someone's in a position of power, whether it's a governor or whether it's a president or what have you, when they have a political opponent,
*  they will hire people to go after that political opponent and trump up a bunch of trump up.
*  No pun intended. A bunch of bullshit charges and drag them through the courts so that everybody's the people that only have a peripheral understanding of what's going on.
*  Oh my God, he's a criminal. Keep that criminal out of the White House.
*  Like, OK, do you think a lot of people who historically had been against Trump are now honest enough to see what a shan this whole thing is and are revising their positions?
*  Or do you think there's quite a few? Yes. Really? Yeah.
*  But it takes a lot of bravery to do that. And depending upon your social environment, you know, there's a lot of people that just can't step outside the lines of whatever the ideology their neighborhood is attached to and their community is attached to.
*  The reason why I asked the question is because I recently appeared maybe about five, six months ago on a British psychiatrist show, a small show, but I thought he was a really interesting guy.
*  He wanted to talk about how you apply evolution and psychiatry and so on. So I was like, let's do it.
*  Towards the end of the show, or maybe it was even the last question, he said, in your 30 year career as a behavioral scientist, as a professor, what is the singular human phenomenon that has surprised you the most?
*  Which I thought was an amazing question. I had never been asked before. Yeah, it's an amazing one because, you know, I've seen tons of stuff.
*  And so I paused for a moment and then I said, I think it's the inability of people to change their opinions once they are anchored in a position.
*  Yes. And so that so it wasn't that spirit that I was asking you the question have some because in my experience, despite the fact that I have a chapter in the parasitic mind on how to seek truth and therefore I'm offering a vaccine against falsehoods.
*  I'm actually quite pessimistic for some people who go la la la. I don't want to hear it because they're so anchored.
*  There is no amount of evidence that I could ever show you that can move you a millimeter from your position. That's very disheartening.
*  It's very disheartening. It's very foolish. I always try to tell people do not be married to your ideas. You should not connect them to you.
*  They are just ideas. They are not you. And if you have supported an idea that you find to be false and you are afraid to admit that you were incorrect, that is far more weak than being incorrect because now you know that you were incorrect.
*  But your pride is keeping you from admitting it. That is beyond foolish. And now people will always know that you're going to do that with what people will forgive you if you make mistakes.
*  People will forgive you if you're incorrect. We have all made mistakes. We are all occasionally incorrect. I'm incorrect all the time. But I make a big point of not attaching myself to ideas.
*  I will argue them if I think they are correct, but they are not me.
*  Yeah. You know, Patrice O'Neill had a great quote and he said, you could hold your opinions, but don't let your opinions hold you.
*  Right. Beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. You just you got to know that you're not ideas. You're a human being.
*  And it's a challenge when you are faced with the reality of the fact that you've made an error, especially if you've been bold about it, if you've been condescending to people who disagree with it, if you're egotistical in your position, you connected yourself to righteousness and intellect and science and whatever other words you want to throw around that make your opinion more valid than the other people's opinion.
*  And then you find out you were wrong. Right. Okay. If we're ever going to trust you again, you have to tell us why you were wrong, how you're wrong and what that feels like and what you've learned from this.
*  Because if you don't, if you keep arguing that you keep doing it, now we have no respect for you.
*  We know Fauci is the worst, but he's worse than that. I think he's far worse than that. I think he's deceptive. Yeah. I mean, if the real Anthony Fauci, the book by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is not, if it's not accurate, he would be sued. He would be sued.
*  Right. And just forget about what happened during COVID, just what we know took place during the AIDS crisis. Everyone should read that book. Everyone should understand this same game plan was played out during the AIDS crisis.
*  And it's a game plan where they're in cahoots with the pharmaceutical drug companies and they push this thing as being the only remedy. And this is how and they make tremendous amounts of money.
*  And that's all real. This is not tinfoil hat conspiracy wearing shit. That's real. But if you supported him because you thought that he was the science and then over time you have realized that, oh my God, they did work with Peter Datsink. They did fund through another organization, Gain of Function Research.
*  He did lie about it. It was talked about in emails. He did contact people who were saying one thing and had them change their position. He did. They did ridicule the lab leak theory when they knew it to be correct. They knew it. They knew they were doing the exact same research on the exact same viruses in that exact same place where it broke out. They knew it.
*  Right. And they lied because they wanted to cover their ass and we let them get away with it.
*  And I'm glad we're talking about the inability to admit to a wrongdoing in science because oftentimes when you think about people who are anchored in their positions, you think about political arguments. You think that somehow you romanticize scientists as being unbiased purveyors and pursuers of the truth. And nothing could be further from the truth.
*  So I'll give you just a couple of examples, historical examples. I mean, of course, Galileo is a perfect example. Copernicus is a great example. Darwin is a great example. But let's look at some other ones that people may not be familiar with. So I think his name, I'm not sure how you pronounce it, Semmel Weiss. He was the gentleman who arguably has saved more people than anybody else in medicine. Do you have any idea who it is?
*  No, is he the penicillin guy? Not the penicillin. That's what's his name? Sir Fleming. I think that's Fleming. He's I think he was a Scottish physician. I felt mistaken. No, this guy is the gentleman who told other physicians that they should wash their hands.
*  So do you remember he was a I think he was a Hungarian physician who was noticing that a lot of there was this huge mortality rate of women as they were giving birth. And so he started running these naturally occurring experiments where you either so the physician has just worked on a cadaver, and then goes and does the obstetrics.
*  So when he said wash your hands, he died, I think penniless destitute and a mental asylum or something. Right. And then later people said, oops, he was right. Because they didn't understand bacteria. They didn't understand bacteria. Yeah, that guy. That's it. Semmel Weiss. Exactly.
*  Cadaveric particles. Does that mean cadaver cadaver? Yes. Every case of childhood fever was caused by resorption of cadaveric particles. Oh my God. But the blowback against this guy from the senior physicians. I mean, this guy was destitute. He died completely. Unvalidated. I mean, it was only post hoc that he there you go. Nervous breakdown.
*  Allegedly suffered a nervous breakdown was committed to an asylum by his colleagues in the asylum. He was beaten by the guards. Oh, God. It's incredible story. Here's another one. I don't remember his name. The truth tester Jamie will get it out for us. There's a gentleman who won the Nobel Prize. I'd say in the last 20 or 30 years for arguing that ulcers are caused by a particular virus or I don't know if it's a virus or a bacterium. And everybody laughed him out of town. He ended up winning the Nobel Prize. And so I often
*  joke with my students. I say if people laugh at your ideas and fight them, it's either for one or two reasons. It's a really shitty idea and it's it's worthy of that derision or prepare to go to Stockholm to win the Nobel Prize. Because I mean, literally, right. It's one or the other. It's one or the other because the Nobel Prize is nothing but a history of people saying what a quack this moron is. No way. Oops. Here's your Nobel Prize, doctor. And isn't that because
*  of what we talk about because of ego and that ego being connected to your ideas of someone comes along with a revolutionary idea that's contrary to what you currently believe you take it as an affront to yourself. Exactly. It's horrible. So I so I gave a talk. This is going back to some of my early appearances here where we would talk a lot more evolutionary psychology. I gave a talk at two talks at University of Michigan when my first book came out. It was an academic book evolutionary basis of consumption. How do you apply evolution psychology and human behavior in general consumer
*  behavior in particular. I give the talk in the psychology department on a Thursday and everybody's like oh yeah this is gorgeous because a lot of the psychologists were trained in physiological psychology biological psychology and so on. So they they were totally appreciative of the fact that you can't really study human behavior without understanding the biological signatures of human behavior.
*  OK. Then I go to the business school the next day. Ross School of Business. I give the exact same talk. OK. I couldn't finish a single sentence because all of the professors and it was usually the professor. It wasn't the doctoral students who were because the doctoral students are still malleable.
*  Their brains are still being formed. They're happy to listen. It's the senior professor who has spent 30 years arguing that human minds are born tabula rasa empty slated and it's only socialization that teaches the consumer to be how he or she is that they were really offended by my stuff.
*  So they would constantly interrupt me and berate me. And I remember as a as a side personal note my wife was in the audience that she had come with me and prior to that talk she had said oh I feel really sick. I probably have food poisoning. We later find out found out that she was pregnant with our first daughter. So there's both a really bad memory and a really good memory associated with the University of Michigan. So what was their position when you were saying this. Biology does not. So they were interrupting you. Nonstop. I probably got three or four
*  slides through. So let's say I don't remember the number of slides. I had 30 slides. I maybe got to slide 10 because here's first question. Oh if if everything is due to evolutionary pressures how do you explain homosexuality then if everything is due to survival and say how do you explain suicide then.
*  By the way there are evolutionary explanations for suicide and homosexuality. Humans are a sexually reproducing species even though chased monks exist. People do have a survival instinct even though some people commit suicide. Men are taller than women even though your Aunt Julie is taller than your Uncle Bob. So what happens with people in terms of a cognitive obstacle they take a singular datum as proof that a statement that is true at the population level has been violated. It has it right.
*  Every single WNBA player is taller than most men. That does not invalidate the fact that men are taller than women. So all of the morons in the university of Michigan were also coming to that kind of stuff. Right. Because they didn't like the idea to our earlier discussion that we've had on the show. A lot of people don't like the idea that we are biologically determined. They think that that's a form of you're just an executor of your genes. But that's the wrong view by the way because everything is an
*  interaction between your genes and the environment. Right. Even specific genes get turned on as a function of the environment. So the fact that you believe that we have biological imperatives that guide our behavior doesn't make us blind executor of our genes. Right. And that's what's important. But the idea that everyone is born a blank slate is so silly because there's children that don't even grow up with their parents that have traits that their parents have. OK. And also happened to
*  have talents that their parents have for some strange reason and call their dog the same name. There's a lot of weirdness to it. There's a lot of weirdness to memory. The genetic memory like whoever you are. It's not as simple as you were a baby. You started off clear and blank. That's not real. We learn things somehow or another through some under.
*  I guess it's explored but not quite understood process. Yeah. And this process even encourages things like racism. There's there's even detrimental ideas that are inherited through children that have been proven but they don't know exactly. There's the mechanism. Right. So I because you mentioned memory. So maybe I could talk about how you study memory from an evolutionary perspective. Please. So is that where can I ask you this first.
*  Sure. Do you think that's where like a phideophobia and arachnophobia and things like that come from. Yeah. So there is actually a lot of research looking at the evolutionary roots of phobia that studied an evolutionary clinical psychology and Darwinian psychiatry.
*  But the ones for me that are fascinating are a phideophobia and arachnophobia fear of snakes and fear of spiders because that evolutionarily makes sense. Exactly. If we either got bit and survived or you saw someone get bit or you know and you see a spider you're like oh shit.
*  But that's why by the way you don't go see your clinical psychologist because you have a fear of guns or fears of cars even though cars and guns kill a lot more people than spiders. If you go if you study the manifestations of clinical cases of phobia they're exactly what you're saying.
*  Because you know from doing fear factor we would encounter people that had both of those and man when you see it in real life it's like a person's possessed by a demon. Right. It's crazy. When you see like high level of phideophobia people see snakes their whole body starts shaking.
*  They can't keep their hands still. It's crazy man. It's not like you know I see a dog looks like a scary dog. Whoa. Keep away from that dog. It's not like that. It's like your whole body. By the way I actually I don't think it's at the clinical level but in the parasitic mind in Chapter 1 I talk about the maladaptive or maybe adaptive phobia that I have of mosquitoes.
*  So if so early in my marriage to my wife maybe that was one of the best ways to test if she'd she'd go the whole route with me as we were traveling to Antigua and we had the misfortune of some you know it's in the Caribbean's a lot of mosquitoes and there are a couple of mosquitoes got in.
*  I spent with her with her complete patience probably till 2 in the morning tracking and killing every single mosquito in that condo because the thought of that disgusting monstrous pig sucking the blood out of me was just unbearable.
*  I mean I literally will turn into a little girl if we see a mosquito in the house. I cannot go on with my I can't watch TV. I can't train the mosquito must die. Now in a sense that's perfectly adaptive because we know that by far if you add up the tallies of people killed by mosquitoes versus all other animals.
*  It's not even a minuscule is not another thing that kills people as much as mosquitoes.
*  Right so that's perfectly adaptive. Yes but you want me to go to the memory stuff. Sure. So think about say a squirrel. It has evolved a memory that allows it to remember the spatial location in your backyard where it stores caches of food so that it has its own memory bias so that even though it won't detected by smell because let's say in Montreal it's a
*  four feet of snow it has a mental map so that it perfectly knows where it hid everything. Right. Now the human memory has evolved to solve different problems. So then if you are a memory researcher studying memory from an evolutionary perspective you would say well what would the human memory solve as an adaptive problem.
*  So let me give you one such example. So if I show you a bunch of photos of people okay images of faces and I put a descriptor next to each one where I tag that person as a social cheater or not a cheater. So what the social cheating means.
*  Lack of reciprocation. So if I do something for you then you will cheat and recant and not I scratch your back but you'll never scratch me. Right. Right. Right. Right. Now that information about the personal characteristic of that individual is an evolutionarily important datum. Right.
*  So now I'm going to show you all these people I control for their good looks right. So I don't put all of the cheaters as being good looking and all the rights because then then you might remember them because they were good looking not because they were cheaters. Right.
*  So I put this array of faces and then later I ask you to remember whether you'd seen that face or not and people end up remembering at a much higher level any face that had been tagged as being a social cheater. Do you follow.
*  Therefore your your perceptual system works in cahoots with your memory system to pay attention more to information that is evolutionarily relevant so that I'm more likely to recall it and remember it.
*  So that would be an example of how you would apply the evolutionary lens to study how our memory operates. Here's another example not in the case of social dynamics but in the case of remembering where foods it.
*  So if you ask people to go through a maze of food and then ask them to remember where particular foods are they're much more likely to remember the locations of high calorie foods.
*  So in this case in this case it's not that I have a domain general mechanism that just learns where things are. There is a sensorial bias to me being more likely to remember the location of something if it is evolutionarily relevant.
*  There are many many other such examples so that would be a wonderful demonstration of how the evolutionary lens adds a whole layer of explanatory power to what typically memory researchers have done.
*  Which is usually they study memory as just the domain general mechanistic system whereas the evolutionary psychologist says no no but why did that mechanism evolve to be of that form.
*  Right and why do animals have memories even if they're not growing up with their parents. How do they know to pee on fire hydrants.
*  Where are they getting this from. There's something going on there. How do they know to go after certain animals.
*  Like I have a golden retriever he loves all dogs like little dogs like the size of I just I just met him. Yeah I mean he's much more interested in people than he is but he's never mean.
*  But if Carl was a squirrel that size he would be dead. So he knows the difference between something that's small that's a dog that's just tolerated you know.
*  Oh how you doing buddy. Or something that's that big that squirrel which is murder. I'm going to murder that thing.
*  OK you said murder. Yeah that led me because I was a murderer. He's a squirrel murderer. You know what is a what's a group of crows called a murder.
*  A murder. Yeah I'm going to tell you now about another study and maybe Jamie can pull it off. I think it's a guy at University of Washington maybe.
*  I hope I'm not wrong where he he wanted to see whether crows remember the face of a really nasty guy so that they can you know if he then comes again they'll start calling.
*  And he kind of took like an image of the face and then he would either wear it or not. And then he would I don't remember what the dependent measure was but it was something to the effect of then he's studying.
*  There you go. I love it. I love having Jamie. So this guy had a mean face and he did mean things and the crows recognized him.
*  And so then it starts spreading to the entire group where they exactly know you see this face remember it. He's a fucker.
*  That makes sense. Crows are insanely smart. Oh they're smarter than most people. Have you seen the ones from I think New Caledonia that do all the stuff with the maybe Jamie you could pull that one out.
*  I think that's the smartest of all the that avian species. They can take rocks and like a thousand different things to get food out of things that I guarantee you and I would sit there for 18 hours and we wouldn't crack that mystery.
*  Yeah they figured out how to use tools to get other tools. Exactly. Yeah there you go. It's amazing. It's just unbelievable.
*  They put rocks in there to raise the water level. I mean a little kid wouldn't even figure that out. I mean they're fucking smart man.
*  Look at this. Look at this. It's crazy. Well I love it. It's also their brains are so small which really is really confusing. Bird brain.
*  Yeah it's really confusing like large brains don't I mean we don't really know how intelligent an animal is unless we see it manipulate its environment or communicate.
*  Because it's possible that elephants are insanely smart. They have immense memories. Their memories are nuts. Like they get reunited with their calves like 20 years later and they run and embrace each other and it's just joyous.
*  When elephants die they mourn. They mourn the death. They have huge brains. But it's also a huge animal. But it doesn't manipulate its environment so we don't respect it.
*  Sort of like the reason why dolphins are in Sea World is because that's literal slavery. It's slavery of probably a parallel or if not more intellectual species.
*  Something with a cerebral cortex 40% larger than a human being. Something that communicates in a language that we can't decipher.
*  Something that has different dialects. Something that operates in these very tight social groups.
*  But they do some rough sex. I don't know if you've heard of that.
*  Well they do. Dolphins are horrible. Dolphins kill their babies.
*  There's no hashtag me too with the dolphins. Let me tell you.
*  It's worse than that. Dolphins when they find a female and she has a child if he has not had sex with that dolphin female that child is not his so he'll kill that child.
*  Lions do the same.
*  What they'll do is the females will have a sex with as many dolphins as they can.
*  So you don't know who it is.
*  So they don't kill their baby. Which is wild.
*  But that's how you live when there's no doors.
*  You're in the ocean and there's no doors.
*  It's just wild. It's murder soup.
*  You said manipulate the environment. So have you heard of the bower bird?
*  No.
*  Sorry I keep going. How do you spell it?
*  B-O-W-E-R.
*  So the bower bird creates a bower which is a structure that serves no purpose other than demonstrating my artistic. There you go.
*  Really?
*  By the way you know what I'm loving about today's show? I feel like I'm back to lecturing my evolutionary psychology stuff.
*  Good. I need a glass.
*  So let me explain what's happening here.
*  Unless you want to watch it first.
*  So it's one of the only species other than humans that uses artistic ability as a mating cue.
*  Wow.
*  Picasso, short little guy, bald, ugly, he's got a huge line up of hot women who want to have sex with him because he's Picasso.
*  That's what the bower bird is doing.
*  He's saying look at how architecturally savvy I am. Look how symmetric my bower bird is.
*  Not only that by the way. See how. Oh there you go. OK she said you're good enough. Let's do this.
*  Let's do this.
*  Excellent trophies.
*  So now. But you saw all those other blue things?
*  Yes.
*  So if you travel to Australia in certain regions there are signs from the government saying if you are women don't be careful.
*  Don't wear shiny things on your head. Why?
*  Because these assholes will come at you, attack the women's head, steal the shiny things so that they could use the shiny things in their bower to attract the ladies.
*  Wow.
*  Now that's smart. That's smarter than most men.
*  Not really. But I see what you're saying.
*  But look at this setup man. This guy's got this dope pad.
*  It's got like a bachelor pad with flowers out in front like ladies.
*  Don't you like flowers?
*  That was the girl.
*  Usually in avian species the drab one is the girl and the flashy one is the guy.
*  Right. Like nobody gives a fuck about female flamingos.
*  Fuck out of here. Female flamingos. What am I going to do with that?
*  I need a dude.
*  Exactly.
*  If you got flamingos man you're a baller.
*  That's a move right?
*  Have a flamingo in your yard?
*  Just walk around?
*  I'm thinking a peacock.
*  You only have a dog?
*  I'm thinking a peacock. I'm doing the whole thing like I'm a peacock but I'm thinking of a flamingo.
*  Yeah I only have a dog. I have chickens too.
*  By the way, like those exotic ones?
*  No. Chicken chickens.
*  They lay eggs.
*  I'm scared to ask this. They become pets you don't eat them right?
*  No I don't eat them. I will if somebody fucks around.
*  If somebody tries to hurt somebody.
*  They're little dinosaurs.
*  When one of them was younger,
*  this is my old group of chickens that I had when my youngest daughter was a baby.
*  They were pecking her feet.
*  There was this one cunty chicken that we had.
*  I feel like this is going to be a Christine No moment?
*  No no no. Nobody died.
*  My wife unfortunately they all did.
*  The coyotes got them. And dogs.
*  Long story.
*  Anyway, point is, I go no she's trying to eat the baby's feet.
*  Like you got to understand this is not like she thinks that's a worm.
*  She thinks she can get away with eating.
*  They eat each other. They fucking peck at each other.
*  They'll murder a mouse.
*  Have you never seen a chicken and a mouse together?
*  Really?
*  We had a fence.
*  This is very unfortunate.
*  We had a fence that was glass.
*  One of the side effects of this glass fence was hawks.
*  Hawks would be swooping down trying to get a rat or some other rodent or something.
*  And they would BAM!
*  Nose dive into this glass.
*  We lost like three hawks.
*  And I was like this is fucked up.
*  I was like maybe we should go back to the other fence.
*  My wife was like fuck you.
*  I like this fence.
*  It was one of those conversations where we were like this seems like it's our fault.
*  That these hawks die.
*  So one of them made it.
*  One of them lived.
*  And they took the hawk and they put it in a big wash machine box.
*  And contacted this wildlife rescue thing.
*  And they said well okay if you're going to have it because we're not open until Monday you got to feed it things.
*  So what do you feed it?
*  So you have to go to the store.
*  So we went to the pet store and they get these things called pinkies.
*  And pinkies are just baby mice.
*  They're baby mice that have they're not going to live.
*  They're separated from their mother.
*  You feed them to reptiles.
*  It's gross right.
*  And so the hawk ate most of them.
*  But he didn't eat one.
*  So they were like we're going to raise it.
*  I go listen you can't just do that.
*  You can't just feed these little things to this giant raptor.
*  And then say now we're going to take this one that survived and raise it.
*  First of all the nightmares that little fucker would have.
*  But second of all it's not viable.
*  It's not going to live.
*  I go let's just give it to the chickens.
*  So I brought it outside.
*  And I put it in the chicken's cage.
*  One chicken grabs it as fast as I've ever seen a chicken move.
*  And then every other chicken runs after that chicken and tries to get it away from her.
*  Is it a defensive thing or they want to eat it?
*  No they want to eat it.
*  And so she has it in her mouth and they're trying to steal it from her.
*  And they just tear it apart and devour it like dinosaurs.
*  Wow.
*  Like it's so crazy watching them kill birds.
*  So I'm not feeling so guilty at the genocide of chicken that I eat.
*  It's still fucked up because it's the soul of the animal.
*  It's not being expressed as nature intended.
*  The soul of the animal should be a chicken.
*  It's not that you shouldn't eat chickens.
*  But chickens should live as chickens.
*  They should wander around and pick bugs and eat worms and do all the things that chickens love doing.
*  To have a chicken just in a box for its entire existence, you're stealing souls.
*  Like you're doing something fucked up that's way more fucked up than just raising a farm.
*  If you've got cows and they're out of pasture and every day they're just being cows.
*  And then one day you take them in a stall and bang this thing goes into their brain and they're dead.
*  That is way less evil.
*  That is way more humane than what's going to happen to them in the wild.
*  What are they going to do?
*  They're going to either freeze to death or starve to death or get torn apart by wolves.
*  If you're going to have cows everywhere and people want to reintroduce wolves everywhere, congratulations.
*  You've got wild kingdom.
*  You've got wild kingdom happening in your neighborhood if that's what you want.
*  And if you don't want people to eat cows anymore, okay, what are you going to do with the cows?
*  Are you going to sterilize them?
*  Are you going to keep a certain amount?
*  Are you going to play God with cows?
*  Are you going to say the cows can't breed?
*  Are you going to give the boys cows birth control?
*  What are you going to do?
*  Are you going to introduce predators?
*  How are you going to keep kids from those predators?
*  How are you going to keep dogs from those predators?
*  Have you thought about this?
*  No, you haven't.
*  These people are reintroducing grizzly bears to Washington as we speak.
*  We're going to reintroduce the things that we killed because they killed everybody.
*  We're so smart.
*  It's bananas.
*  These people are out of their fucking minds.
*  And they don't have a real understanding of actual nature.
*  The horrible thing is this commodization of nature.
*  It's taking animals and factory farming them in these horrific conditions where it's illegal to film.
*  It's illegal to...they have ag-gag laws.
*  Because it's so traumatic.
*  Because it's so traumatic and so horrific it would affect the industry.
*  That's what's wrong with eating meat.
*  Being a part of the natural cycle of life is what made humans human.
*  If you want the most nutrients, it comes from animal protein.
*  There's a reason why it's so cherished.
*  I've made...not using the same words, but I've made roughly the same argument when the tofu brigade came after me.
*  Because I was offering some evolutionary reasons for why we have to have animal protein as part of our diets.
*  And they were so pissed at me because they thought it was very hypocritical that on the one hand I could share so many tweets and posts demonstrating how much I love animals.
*  And then in another photo I show some steak or here's what my wife is cooking.
*  And that to them was completely incongruent and was proof of my moral degeneracy.
*  And then I actually created two sad truth clips where I was really demonstrating the evolutionary reasons.
*  Archaeological data, dental data, physiognomic data, anthropological data.
*  And they just wouldn't have it.
*  You're a hypocrite, you can't love an animal and eat an animal.
*  So I'm glad that you...
*  Well there's a real problem with that too.
*  And this is something that people dismiss very openly, but I don't think we should.
*  I think plants are alive.
*  And I don't think they're just alive in a way that we can feel completely fine about growing them.
*  In this insane monocrop agriculture place and pouring industrial grade fertilizer and pesticides all over them.
*  I think they're a thing that thinks.
*  I think they're a thing that communicates with their environment.
*  But they just do it in a way that we don't understand.
*  They do it through mycelium.
*  They arrange resources.
*  They allocate resources towards plants that need them more.
*  They have some sort of a network of communication.
*  I was going to say, have you seen the networks of fungi?
*  Yes.
*  That is mind blowing.
*  I had Paul Stamets in the podcast a couple of times and he's a mycologist and just a brilliant guy.
*  And he really explains it all so well.
*  It's so mind blowing.
*  The relationship that the mycelium have with the nutrients in the earth.
*  The earth is not dirt.
*  It's like a living environment.
*  It's this environment that they've ruined through monocrop agriculture.
*  And that's what's wrong with farming.
*  It's not farming.
*  Farming is a perfect way to balance an ecosystem.
*  When those people do it the right way, like those people from white oak pastures or poly face farms, regenerative agriculture people,
*  there's like zero carbon footprint of what they do.
*  And in fact, it sequesters carbon.
*  You're growing things.
*  It's manure and cows and it's all working together and the chickens are free ranging.
*  It's nature just in a contained environment.
*  But that's normal.
*  You mentioned the word soil, so it made me think about,
*  have you seen the research on, I can't remember what the term is, but something like soil DNA?
*  I guess the pioneer is, I think he's Danish.
*  Either Danish or Swedish.
*  I think Danish.
*  And basically they go to these steps that are really, really,
*  maybe not Mongolian steps, but somewhere where you expect to find a lot of the typical fossil remains and so on.
*  But what they now do is they just do this excavation of soil.
*  In the same way that people who study ice, you know how they can bore and then they can date various ice.
*  So they do something similar where they kind of harvest tons of soil and they're then able to isolate DNA of mammoths.
*  Have you seen some of this stuff?
*  That's mind blowing.
*  It's unbelievable.
*  I actually thought about inviting that guy on my show.
*  Maybe you should have him on your show.
*  Yeah, that sounds fascinating to talk about.
*  It really is so interesting when you just think about just the complex interaction between everything on earth.
*  The plants that we literally need, plants to create oxygen for us and they're consuming more carbon.
*  That's one of the craziest things about Genghis Khan is when Genghis Khan lived,
*  they killed so many people that places reforested and they lowered the carbon footprint of earth.
*  That's a real thing.
*  So genocide was green.
*  Yeah, that was green.
*  There's also different ways.
*  Dan Carlin on Hardcore History has the most amazing series.
*  It's called Wrath of the Khan.
*  I think you have to buy it on his website, but it's really cheap.
*  It's like a dollar an episode or something and it's fucking amazing.
*  It's amazing.
*  I think it's a three piece thing.
*  Is it a three piece series?
*  Genghis Khan is the correct way to say it.
*  Temujin was his real name and what he did and the rise.
*  That guy spread some genes.
*  Jesus, Louise.
*  Did that guy get after it?
*  He spread some genes and killed some fucking people.
*  Killed 10% of the population of earth.
*  Was it that much?
*  10%.
*  Somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 to 70 million people.
*  They don't know exactly.
*  You ain't kidding.
*  Earlier you said how everything is connected, which leads me to a concept
*  which I don't think I've ever discussed on my 10 shows on your podcast.
*  This concept, consilience.
*  Have you heard that term before?
*  Sure.
*  Being conciliatory?
*  No, no.
*  It doesn't come from him, but he kind of reintroduced it into the lexicon.
*  Do you know who E.O. Wilson is?
*  I've heard the name.
*  He just recently passed away at the age of 90.
*  I just read his autobiography called Naturalist.
*  Amazing autobiography.
*  He was a Harvard entomologist and a strong proponent of social biology.
*  Applying biology to studies, social systems and so on.
*  He was part of the original culture wars where a lot of his colleagues hated him
*  because he was arguing that biology affects human behavior.
*  E.O. Wilson, check him out.
*  He's unbelievable.
*  In the early 90s, he wrote a book called Consilience, Unity of Knowledge.
*  That became one of the foundational books in how I did my academic career.
*  Consilience is trying to unify disparate areas of human endeavor
*  that you typically wouldn't think should be linked together.
*  You could link the natural sciences, the social sciences and the humanities
*  through the consilience of evolutionary theory.
*  You could study psychology using evolutionary theory.
*  Of course, you could study biology using evolutionary theory.
*  Or you could study aesthetics, which is in the humanities, using evolutionary theory.
*  That became a really important concept in my own work
*  because my brain operates as a synthetic machine.
*  I like to synthesize across.
*  One of the reasons why I decided early on to break out of just being an academic
*  is because I couldn't see myself as a stay-in-your-lane professor.
*  Coming on Joe Rogan is going to allow me to share ideas
*  and synthesize things with millions of people
*  rather than writing another academic paper
*  that if I'm lucky will be read by 50 people and cited by 12.
*  Before you came on though,
*  when you came on, being on the show was not that problematic.
*  People wouldn't criticize being on the show because nobody even knew what it was.
*  That's true. Once they did know what it was, people looked down on it.
*  I don't know if I've ever shared this story before
*  and even if I have, it's worth repeating.
*  I discussed this in the parasitic mind.
*  I had been invited to Stanford in 2017 to speak at their business school,
*  a very academic, scientific talk on how to apply evolutionary theory, blah, blah, blah.
*  My host, who's a fellow, he's a consumer psychologist,
*  invited me out to dinner the night before.
*  I think after I was going there,
*  I think I was flying down to, at the time you were in Southern California still,
*  2017 you were in Southern California, and I was going to do your show I think.
*  So at night during dinner he said,
*  oh, so I hear you go off on Joe Rogan's show.
*  I said, oh yeah, yeah.
*  He goes, yeah, well, you know, we don't condone that at Stanford.
*  Very kind of hottie. I said, you don't condone what?
*  He goes, well, you know, we don't do our research so that it could be sexy enough for it to appear
*  so I could talk about it on Joe Rogan.
*  So I said, well, I don't do the research also so I can appear on Joe Rogan,
*  but if I can publish a paper in an academic journal
*  and then go on Joe Rogan and hopefully excite people about evolutionary psychology
*  and psychology decision-making,
*  I think that would be that better than just having my wife and mother read the paper.
*  And he didn't like that.
*  He thought very, whereas now I,
*  not that many, but I'll get a lot more professors
*  who will write to me saying, can you get me on Joe Rogan?
*  Well, that's good.
*  But that speaks to how patterns change, right?
*  Yeah, well, it's just, you know, it's so easy to label somebody.
*  It's so easy to label a platform
*  or, you know, like podcasting in general,
*  that it's frivolous, especially if you live in the academic world.
*  But it's just an opportunity to talk about stuff.
*  And if I'm talking to someone about evolutionary psychology
*  or if I'm talking to someone about coal mining,
*  like, I just want to know what's going on.
*  Well, let me tell you something.
*  I'm not trying to blow smoke up your ass or, you know,
*  be ingratiating or anything,
*  but I bet if there was a currency, a metric to measure
*  how much you've affected the intellectual ecosystem
*  versus your average well-published professor,
*  I would put my money on you.
*  Not because you were the creator of the knowledge,
*  but because, boy, are you the biggest disseminator of knowledge, right?
*  Well, I'm just lucky, right?
*  And a big part of the luck is that I have the fortune
*  to talk to these people
*  because most people just don't have access to people like you.
*  Like, if I want to sit down with a guy like you for three hours,
*  like, if I didn't have a podcast, that would be a tough sell.
*  Like, hey, Gad, can you put your phone away
*  and just you and me just stare at each other for three hours
*  and have a conversation?
*  But this is, for whatever reason,
*  I probably spend more time individually talking to people this way
*  than any other way because I do so many of these things.
*  Do you think before you started this
*  that there were indicators that, boy,
*  you're such a good conversationalist,
*  you know how to hold?
*  It came as a surprise to you that it would be so successful.
*  Oh, it's 100% surprise.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, I just wanted to do it because I thought it would be fun.
*  That was it.
*  There's a chapter in the book, Life as a Playground.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Just live every...sciences play, right?
*  What's science?
*  It's one big puzzle
*  that you're trying to identify which variable meaningfully
*  relate to other variables.
*  So it's a form of puzzle making.
*  Right.
*  So actually there's research that shows that if you marry someone
*  that scores similar to you
*  on the adult playfulness scale,
*  I don't remember the name, right?
*  Some people score very high on that.
*  Probably you do. I know that I do.
*  If you then match up with someone who scores very highly
*  like you do assortatively,
*  that's a very big predictor of you having a successful union.
*  That makes sense.
*  Yeah, you don't want to be with someone who hates jokes.
*  Especially if you're a professional comic.
*  And if you're funny and they're not funny,
*  that's probably not as fun.
*  That's probably boring.
*  But if you had to choose between the person that you're with
*  is also very funny
*  or at least laughs at your joke.
*  You can only have one of the two.
*  So she's either a positive receptacle to your humor
*  or she goes toe to toe with you and being as funny.
*  Which one would you prefer?
*  I take toe to toe with me as funny.
*  Yeah, I don't need someone to think I'm funny.
*  I got plenty of people.
*  The audience.
*  A wife.
*  My wife doesn't have to have the same taste as me,
*  even in me.
*  I don't care if you like different.
*  They listen to music that I think is garbage.
*  And I'm like, go ahead, play your music.
*  Care to share some of that?
*  No, I don't want to be mean.
*  They listen to great stuff too.
*  They've introduced me to Taylor Swift.
*  But my daughter's a Swifty.
*  They play some Taylor Swift songs.
*  I'm like, this one's not bad.
*  But the point is, it's like you don't have to like the same things as I like.
*  That's stupid.
*  She likes football.
*  I don't even know the rules.
*  I don't know what's going on.
*  Do you seriously don't know football?
*  I barely know what's happening.
*  I have friends that are like Aaron Rodgers is my friend.
*  I don't know what the fuck's going on.
*  So I hear you're a good something.
*  You throw the ball.
*  Yeah, and he's really good at that shit.
*  He's a smart guy.
*  He's a very interesting guy.
*  Speaking of athletes, last time I came on the show, I did apparently a clip went viral
*  from our conversation where I was kind of hailing the cosmic justice of why it was important
*  for Messi to win the World Cup.
*  Remember that?
*  Yes, you did say that.
*  So listen, speaking of life as a playground and scoring high on openness and all the things
*  that I think you do very well, and I'd like to think that I do too.
*  About maybe a week or two after I appeared on your show last year, I get an email.
*  You know, dear, whatever professors had.
*  My name is, I guess I could say his name because I'm going to you're going to know.
*  My name is your game mass.
*  I am the majority owner of Inter Miami.
*  I'm a fan, whatever.
*  I know that you have a deep appreciation for Messi.
*  Whenever you'd like to come to a game, you'll be my personal guest.
*  Oh shit.
*  Now think about this.
*  This geeky professor who could have lived his life just doing his little narrow stuff, right?
*  You know, I'm good in my ecosystem.
*  A few other professors care about my work or go out there, grab life by the balls,
*  and live it fully and connect and so on.
*  So I call my wife over, I say, I'm James Bond.
*  I mean, in what world, so in what world is it possible for, you know,
*  the Lebanese professor and evolutionary theory to get an email from the majority owner.
*  So September 27th or 28th, I'm on a flight down to Miami.
*  They're playing in the US Open Cup.
*  It turns out that Messi was injured, so he didn't play.
*  I'm supposed to meet him.
*  I'm supposed to give him copies of my book signed,
*  even the Spanish version of The Parasitic Mind because he only reads Spanish.
*  He ends up not being there because he's not playing and so on.
*  I mean, he's standing right next to me, but I didn't get to meet him really.
*  I meet Zinedine Zidane, who is the greatest French player of all time
*  and World Cup winner right there in the President's Lodge.
*  David Beckham, hang out with him.
*  Now I'm not saying these to drop names.
*  Oh, look, I know these cool people.
*  I'm saying if I didn't have that open spirit where I didn't view my world
*  as only being restricted to the ecosystem of academia,
*  if I didn't come on Joe Rogan that opened me up to a whole new audience,
*  all of those people would have never heard of my work.
*  If I only publish peer-reviewed papers rather than publishing books,
*  which by the way, in academia you publish trade books, that's looked down upon.
*  How is that looked down upon?
*  If you publish a book that can be read by 300,000 people,
*  how is that not better than publishing an academic paper
*  that's read by three people?
*  But that one is pure, it's academic,
*  that other one is vulgar and popularizer.
*  Yeah.
*  It's grotesque, it's stupid.
*  It is stupid.
*  And unfortunately, stupid can also be really smart.
*  Really smart people can be stupid.
*  Well, George Orwell, I'm paraphrasing him, said
*  it takes intellectuals to come up with really dumb ideas.
*  Well, in this country, there's a lot of examples that you could point to
*  that would indicate that would be correct.
*  You're right.
*  But you have to be really dumb and also be smart as shit in your discipline.
*  And again, it just boils down, a lot of it is male ego.
*  That's a big part of the problem with a lot of these ideas
*  that people hold so sacred.
*  The fascinating one for me with you is this reluctance to accept
*  that there's other factors for the development of a human personality
*  and that it's not a blank slate.
*  That seems interesting.
*  And if I was a teacher that was teaching something contrary to that,
*  I would want to know this.
*  And now I know that I've been teaching nonsense
*  and I have to call like 50,000 students over the last 20 years.
*  Hey guys, remember that shit that I told you?
*  Yeah, it's bullshit.
*  Turns out I thought it was true.
*  What would you do?
*  That's got to be horrible for them.
*  When new information comes out that's irrefutable,
*  some new scanning, new thing that shows that this thing
*  that we had always held to be true,
*  that you've taught in classes,
*  that you've won awards for, is nonsense.
*  Yeah, so there's a great, so my favorite quote,
*  and maybe Jamie could pull it out, by J.B.S. Haldane.
*  J.B.S. Haldane was an evolutionary geneticist,
*  but was also known for having these beautiful quotable quips.
*  And so here the quote in question,
*  I have it in the last chapter of The Consuming Instinct 2011 book.
*  He's talking about the four stages that academics go through
*  before they accept a theory.
*  So I'm paraphrasing now what his stages are.
*  Stage one, oh this is complete rubbish bullshit.
*  Stage two, well this may be true but largely unimportant.
*  Stage three, well this is definitely true
*  but it's probably not actionable.
*  Stage four, oh I always said so.
*  Right, so what happens is you go through these phases
*  and if you're dogged enough as I was,
*  then the people who laughed at you in stage one,
*  oh there you go, this is worthless nonsense.
*  This is worthless nonsense.
*  This is an interesting but perverse point of view.
*  This is true but quite unimportant.
*  I always said so, perfect.
*  And I've always said that-
*  That's the government's position on COVID vaccines.
*  Exactly.
*  By the way, but here's the funny personal anecdote.
*  I am a pathological email hoarder,
*  meaning that I never get rid of emails
*  because I always think what if I ever need
*  whatever's contained in that email.
*  Right.
*  So I have emails from people who let's say
*  had taken a very negative position in stage one,
*  your evolutionary psychology stuff is bullshit.
*  I have that email, it's 2001
*  and I have the email from 2019
*  when you say dear God, we would be honored
*  if you would be the plenary speaker.
*  I'm like oh but what happened
*  until I was a bullshitter in 2001?
*  Oh wow.
*  So you just have to be dogged,
*  you have to collect the evidence and hopefully-
*  But here's my position as an outsider.
*  How could you know?
*  Like why would you say it's a blank slate?
*  How could you know?
*  And why would you ignore all this interesting information
*  that we now know about the role that your parents play?
*  Because the blank slate's very hopeful.
*  Because the blank slate,
*  I think it was, I can't remember if it was Watson,
*  the behaviorist who said that give me 12 children
*  I could turn any one of them into a doctor,
*  into a beggar, into a lawyer,
*  meaning that everybody is infinitely malleable.
*  Now that's a hopeful message if I'm a parent.
*  If I create a child,
*  you're telling me that he's got equal chance
*  to be Michael Jordan or Lionel Messi
*  if only I have the right schedule of reinforcement
*  of how to hug him and when to hug him
*  that's hopeful.
*  I don't want to be told that there is something innate
*  about my child that guarantees that he will never be
*  the next Michael Jordan.
*  So I think the message,
*  the blank slate message doesn't originally start
*  as just a quacky idea.
*  It's a noble idea,
*  perfectly rooted in bullshit,
*  but it's a noble idea.
*  Here's another example of a noble idea.
*  Franz Boas was actually a Jewish anthropologist
*  at Columbia University,
*  about a hundred years ago,
*  who was the one who developed cultural relativism,
*  the idea that there are no human universals.
*  So biology doesn't matter in explaining cultural phenomena
*  because every culture is uniquely distinct.
*  Now the reason why he proposed that idea
*  is because many nasty folks had misused biology
*  and evolutionary theory
*  and therefore by him eradicating biology
*  from the study of anthropology,
*  he was hopefully doing a noble thing.
*  But you can't kill truth in the service of a goal.
*  So a lot of these guys,
*  it's not to our earlier conversation,
*  they're not conspiratorial in spreading bullshit.
*  They believe that by holding those positions,
*  they're creating the proper utopia,
*  but it's rooted in bullshit.
*  The reluctance to change one's opinion
*  is always a very unfortunate thing to witness.
*  I hear you.
*  What can you think of one or two
*  things that you remember most
*  where you've done 180 on that you'd like to share?
*  I don't know if I've done real 180s.
*  Or sizable shift.
*  Real dumb ones.
*  Bigfoot's a real dumb one.
*  I used to believe in Bigfoot.
*  But you were eight or last Saturday?
*  Oh, like pretty recently.
*  Within the last two decades.
*  Talking to Bigfoot people.
*  And thinking and seeing that they're...
*  Yeah, there's something wrong with them.
*  Unfortunately, I used to have a joke about it.
*  Here's one thing you don't find
*  when you're looking for Bigfoot.
*  Black people.
*  You're more likely to find Bigfoot
*  than you are black people looking for Bigfoot.
*  It's all a bunch of unfuckable white dudes.
*  Unfuckable white dudes out camping.
*  And there's a mystery.
*  There's a thing that they want to believe.
*  And there's almost no evidence.
*  Almost no evidence.
*  There's some weird stuff like footprints
*  with dermal ridges, but you can fake that.
*  It's bullshit.
*  Does that apply to the other class?
*  Loch Ness Monster also you don't believe?
*  Well, the Loch Ness Monster's most likely nonsense.
*  Or maybe it could be a big fish.
*  Or something like that.
*  But the actual photo of the Loch Ness Monster
*  is a hoax.
*  That's been proven to be a hoax.
*  They know the guy who took it.
*  They know how he did it.
*  He used a cardboard cutout or something like that.
*  Or some cutout.
*  He put it in the water and then took a photo.
*  It was bullshit.
*  They've done a lot of theories on it.
*  But they've done scans of the Loch.
*  They've never found anything.
*  It's certainly not a population of them.
*  Whether they can stay alive for this long.
*  They have to be breeding.
*  What are they eating?
*  How big is this?
*  What are you talking about?
*  The Bigfoot thing I think was real.
*  And I think it was real in the human imagination.
*  And it was real in terms of modern human beings
*  encountered these things.
*  And it's a real animal called Gigantopithecus.
*  And it really did exist in Asia.
*  And if human beings were coming across the Bering Land Bridge
*  it's very likely that they were there too.
*  They all existed in the same environment.
*  And in the same time period.
*  And this fucking thing is in Native American history.
*  They have a large number of names for this.
*  They don't have dragons.
*  They don't have crazy shit that doesn't exist.
*  They have a myth of this gigantic hairy ape
*  that lives in the woods.
*  And I think that's a myth.
*  And I think that's a myth.
*  And I think that's a myth.
*  And I think that's a myth.
*  I think it's a hairy ape that lives in the woods.
*  And I think it did.
*  I think it did probably until who knows how many thousands
*  and thousands of years ago.
*  But the idea of one being around today
*  almost no evidence.
*  Almost nothing.
*  Just visual bullshit, blurry bullshit
*  footprints that maybe, I don't know,
*  you could fake that.
*  You could fake a footprint.
*  It's not a fucking fake Ferrari.
*  It's not complicated to fake a footprint.
*  You know, oh, you don't understand
*  about the amount of weight that has to be put.
*  Says who?
*  Says who?
*  Says you?
*  Says you, a guy who wants to believe in Bigfoot, so bad.
*  They want to believe so bad.
*  It is a religion.
*  It's a religion.
*  So what do you think is the psychological mechanism
*  that causes them to want to,
*  it's because there is kind of a mystery
*  and awe to things that are out there
*  that we can't explain.
*  Here's the thing, if Bigfoot was real,
*  not nearly as interesting.
*  If Bigfoot is just this big, stupid monkey
*  that lives in the woods
*  and just shits all over himself
*  and fucking eats campers,
*  that wouldn't be nearly as interesting
*  as this super intelligent creature
*  that lives in the water
*  that saves people.
*  You know, before we were outside
*  I was talking to some of your crew
*  and I was telling them that someone had asked me,
*  actually it was the border agent
*  as I was coming through to Austin,
*  he asked why am I coming?
*  And I said, well, it's because I'm on a list
*  of things that you talk about.
*  I said, oh, it's exactly the opposite of that.
*  And so to that point,
*  I didn't have in my bingo card
*  the defecation of Bigfoot in forests.
*  Yeah, like what is he doing up there,
*  you stinky bitch?
*  Like come on, the idea that no one
*  has taken real good footage
*  in this day and age
*  with the amount of hikers and campers
*  and people that are in the woods
*  and people that are into photography
*  and nature photography
*  and nature everywhere.
*  They're over water holes,
*  they're everywhere.
*  So what's the mechanism by which
*  I mean, you know, you listed
*  the name of the animal that you think
*  Gigantopithecus.
*  Exactly.
*  So you obviously have a lot of these tidbit information.
*  Are you a voracious reader
*  or how do you get your sources of information?
*  Well, I've read an embarrassing amount
*  of books on Bigfoot.
*  No, but in general.
*  But in general, a lot of audiobooks.
*  Like I can do that while I'm working out.
*  I could do that while I'm in the sauna.
*  I could do that when I'm in the car.
*  So that to me is like that's a couple
*  of hours of taking in information
*  where I would just ordinarily just like lifting weights.
*  But you don't you don't love the feeling
*  of grabbing a book.
*  I do, but I'm also so busy
*  that to me it's like the best way
*  to consume ideas.
*  I feel like reading a book is 100 percent
*  listening to an audiobook is 80 to 90 percent.
*  I don't think it's the same thing.
*  It's too easy to gloss over.
*  I've never audiobooked a book.
*  I've only read I haven't even read
*  an electronic book.
*  Really?
*  I love paper.
*  I'm a pathological book hoarder.
*  Do you write on paper or do you type it out?
*  I type it out.
*  So now I type.
*  Sometimes I'll take little notes.
*  I'm sitting at the cafe.
*  I have an idea for something I want to do.
*  So I'll write it and then I'll but if I'm writing a book,
*  it's always on the computer.
*  There's no written anymore.
*  And I've noticed that my penmanship
*  has really gotten worse.
*  Oh mine's dog shit.
*  Yeah exactly me too.
*  But I'm a voracious reader.
*  And one of the things that stresses me the most
*  is in my personal library in my study
*  I've got you know literally hundreds
*  and hundreds of books.
*  And I will often walk in there and say
*  will I ever have time to read.
*  So I have probably 600 books that I've read
*  and each of those books has so much information
*  that if I were to read all those books
*  boy I would be an even more exciting guest
*  on the Joe Rogan show.
*  No what I mean by that is that
*  there's so much the more you know
*  the more you realize truly how little you know.
*  Yeah absolutely.
*  And so I say oh my god here's a biography on
*  so I just bought a biography on
*  the taxonomist who created the system of books
*  how to label animal species.
*  He's a Swedish taxonomist.
*  Now that sounds very esoteric and specific
*  but I'm sure there is this incredible information
*  that I can glean in that book
*  which today I don't have that knowledge in my brain.
*  So to all people who are listening read.
*  There is nothing more.
*  Number one predictor of your child's success
*  is how many books were in the home of the parents.
*  I mean I don't know if it's number one
*  but certainly a highly predictive one.
*  So reading Elon Musk you probably know this
*  when he came to I think from South Africa to Canada
*  he came with a luggage of books.
*  He's a voracious reader right.
*  Now that doesn't mean that he became who he became
*  only because he read
*  but it's very hard to have an interesting person
*  who's not very knowledgeable about many things
*  and that's why one of the things that's been very difficult
*  with my children is I see them doing the scrolling
*  and it drives me crazy
*  because I haven't been able to instill that reflex
*  of just saying there is nothing I'd rather do right now
*  than go sit somewhere and immerse myself in a book.
*  They don't have that reflex.
*  Yeah that is a problem with electronics
*  because it does hijack your reward system
*  it hijacks your attention span
*  it hijacks your brain
*  and it's hard because kids are growing up in this environment
*  it's a different environment
*  and I have two ways of looking at it.
*  One way of looking at it where you have to kind of set an example
*  and I'm not the best at that
*  I like to look at my phone
*  just to put your phone away
*  and put work away
*  don't be responding to emails
*  just put it away and focus.
*  I think we all should do that
*  but we are all also living in this new world
*  and that is not going to change
*  and I think that's the same as when people are like
*  don't get in the car let's walk
*  like okay that's good for a little while
*  but now guess what Martha
*  everyone has cars
*  let's get a fucking car
*  I'm not walking in New York
*  what are you talking about
*  I'm not getting in this stupid wagon
*  getting pulled by a horse
*  this is dumb they have cars now
*  I think we are going to get to a point
*  where avoiding some interaction with other human beings
*  it's going to be constant
*  and it's going to be more invasive than it is now
*  these are steps that are
*  our species is taking
*  and it's integration with technology
*  that seem to be unstoppable
*  and to isolate yourself and move to the woods
*  in a cabin that's one way to do it
*  but the hygiene or the discipline of saying
*  I'm now focused
*  I mean I know the research findings on this
*  and yet I always find myself going into my phone
*  and then stopping myself
*  do you always stop yourself
*  I don't
*  I stop myself three out of ten times
*  especially if I can come up with some reason
*  I'm going to go over my notes
*  so what is the pull in your case
*  is it scrolling through the twitter
*  just nonsense
*  looking at nonsense on Instagram
*  a lot of it is horrible
*  because I have this fucking thing
*  that I'm doing with Tom Segura
*  we send each other the worst things we find every day
*  like an animal eating
*  this one dude fucking stole a cop car
*  was in a high speed chase in Mexico
*  with no tires
*  just flames coming out of the bottom of his car
*  wild shit
*  a lot of people falling off buildings
*  why?
*  we've just been doing this to each other for
*  just like out of a morbid
*  how many months has it been now
*  it's like a morbid
*  yeah yeah yeah just freaking each other out every day
*  so now the algorithm knows that I'm fucked up
*  so the algorithm is only showing me
*  like motorcycle accidents
*  and just the wildest shit that you shouldn't be looking at
*  I get so many of those videos that show up in my feed
*  where it tells you are you sure you want to look at this
*  oh boy
*  you know where it's blurry
*  and you have to click again to look at it
*  I've had maybe twice that
*  really?
*  yeah so but here's the thing
*  so I'm interested in the AI algorithm that generates those
*  because often times it'll put things in my feed
*  I don't know how it could have found out that I like this stuff
*  because there is no signature electronically of me having searched something
*  let's say what three piece wool suits
*  right
*  okay I love that look
*  and so now I'll see a thousand guys wearing these gorgeous Italian
*  right
*  but other times it presents stuff to me that makes no sense
*  that it almost seems as though I'm into gay sauna guys
*  no but I'm being serious
*  so it's kind of fitness
*  which of course I'm into having lost a lot of weight
*  but it almost seems homo erotic
*  where it's always these guys
*  and so as I'm going at this my wife will say
*  what are you looking at
*  I say well I'm not sure I want to show you
*  then it's like literally 17 super muscular guys
*  but there is no
*  there's nothing that I've done that suggests
*  that it should recognize that in me
*  how do you explain that Dr. Joe?
*  well they took a chance and they missed
*  the day is not complete
*  you know you're interested in some things
*  but that's interesting like any
*  perception of men like with a six pack
*  like looking good and oiled up
*  that's homo erotic
*  which is interesting
*  because a woman with a beautiful body
*  is not considered homo erotic at all
*  isn't that odd?
*  it is odd
*  it's like I don't even want to look at these fucking good looking guys
*  what are you gay?
*  I'm someone who actually is very easy in complimenting other men
*  so that's not
*  considered homo erotic
*  that's the problem
*  well the positions that they're taking doesn't seem like it was fitness
*  it seemed like it was a bit kind of cum hither
*  well there's a lot of girls who do that too though
*  there's a lot of girls that take these sexy
*  lifting weights poses
*  but you don't think of them as homo erotic
*  no but they're appealing to the male gaze in that case
*  and here we assume that the female
*  so the way the men are posing
*  they're appealing to men
*  because men are titillated by visual stimuli
*  not women right
*  I think women say that to ugly dudes
*  women aren't even visual don't worry about it
*  well they're not as visual
*  but they're definitely visual
*  when a girl sees Tatum O'Neil with his shirt off
*  and they go ooo
*  yeah no of course
*  that's real too
*  but how many strip bars are out there targeting female patrons?
*  oh yeah there's a big discrepancy
*  oh it's not equivalent
*  I'm not saying that
*  but it's just funny that one is homo erotic
*  right
*  but then there's also ones where it's like
*  okay who are you appealing to
*  because does a girl really want to see you sit like this
*  this is weird
*  this is a weird pose
*  for a regular dude
*  but by the way the inability to recognize some of these dynamics
*  is what causes some men to send dick pics to women right
*  because they think that the same visual stimuli
*  that would titillate them
*  is exactly what would titillate women
*  so it's lack of theory of mind
*  and so a lot of men will say
*  oh you know I've got a good morphology here
*  I think she'd be impressed by that
*  and she gets repulsed by it
*  because he doesn't have intersex theory of mind
*  right
*  interesting
*  evolutionary psychology
*  it's where it's at
*  well how much is it affected by technology?
*  what is it?
*  how much of
*  when you think of evolutionary psychology
*  and you think of us as an evolving species
*  that's integrating with its environment
*  and its environment radically changes
*  so the most obvious answer to that would be
*  internet pornographic addiction
*  which almost exclusively afflicts men
*  right
*  for very obvious reasons
*  because what's happening with the internet delivery system
*  is it's exactly catering to men's evolved penchant
*  for sexual variety
*  I can keep flipping through different porn clips
*  without ever repeating the same one
*  well it doesn't take much for that stimulus to then hijack my brain
*  so when I for example explain to people about the evolutionary roots of pornography
*  that doesn't mean that men have evolved a gene for pornography
*  because obviously there was no pornography in the ancestral environment
*  but what it means is that those mechanisms that evolved for mating
*  are then hijacked, usurped by pornography
*  so I think the most obvious one would be internet pornography
*  I think the next stage of that is even more terrifying
*  I think there's going to be some sort of virtual element
*  meaning?
*  meaning virtual sex
*  you're going to be able to actually have a sexual experience virtually
*  but haptically how do you do it?
*  I think they're going to do it with some sort of an interface
*  when you're seeing these first patients of Neuralink
*  like this one guy who can now amazingly operate a computer
*  play games, move his cursor, click on things
*  I mean it's incredible
*  and they think he's going to be able to communicate through this thing
*  at the speed of a carnival barker
*  that's how he's going to be able to use this
*  it's crazy
*  so I actually was giving a talk on global Jew hatred in Montreal
*  and a guy came up to me to introduce himself
*  and he's a neurosurgeon
*  and he said that he was part of the team
*  that was choosing the first Neuralink patient that you just mentioned
*  that's incredible
*  so this is patient number one
*  and it's been successful
*  and they believe that ultimately they'll be able to restore blindness
*  they'll be able to restore movement to people
*  there's going to be a lot of wild things that this technology
*  if it can continue to progress
*  is going to be capable of doing
*  and at one point in time I've got to imagine
*  it's got to be able to create an artificial reality simulator
*  that you just immerse yourself in
*  whether it takes 10 years to do that or 50 or 100
*  in the future they're going to have something that
*  forget about porn
*  forget about actually going on an adventurous life
*  why would you do that
*  when you can have all of the trappings of being a wizard
*  in a fucking dungeon game
*  you can just play
*  you just live your life in this world that doesn't exist
*  get sexual pleasure, get satisfaction, eat food
*  and all you do when you awake is you eat food
*  go to sleep, wake up and do it again
*  that's a dire world
*  it's the matrix
*  it really is the matrix
*  and I feel like there's no way to stop it
*  I feel like if things keep going in the way they're going
*  do we have regulations to keep a simulated universe from appearing
*  we don't have any regulations
*  if they were so smart that they created a simulated universe
*  that you could participate in
*  and they could say God you could be whoever you want
*  you want to go to ancient Egypt
*  in 2000 BC and see what was cracking
*  what was going on down there
*  what did that look like
*  the height of the pyramids
*  what the fuck did that look like
*  you wouldn't do that
*  of course you would do that
*  everybody would do that
*  and if it was harmless
*  you couldn't get hurt
*  you couldn't get injured
*  you're in god mode everywhere you go
*  if you die you just wake up and do it all over again
*  and you keep doing it
*  books in a sense do exactly that right
*  no they don't
*  you shut your mouth
*  we're talking about transporting you to the fucking dinosaur times
*  we're talking about you running around watching raptors tear apart a brontosaurus
*  it's indistinguishable from reality
*  indistinguishable
*  looks like it's happening right in front of you
*  that's all everyone's going to be doing
*  those books are going to rot
*  those books are going to be covered in dust
*  you're going to do it one time
*  and it'll get to the point
*  see it's sort of like VR
*  if you do VR now it's really cool
*  it's kind of fun
*  it's like wow this game's nuts
*  I've tried the boxing one
*  yeah they're cool
*  it's a good workout
*  the boxing is a really good workout
*  because you really do
*  it really is like hard shadow boxing
*  because you have to move a lot
*  my feet were hurting
*  I was like wow this is kind of crazy
*  remember Pong
*  you're older than me
*  that game was amazing
*  what's it called
*  Atari
*  remember when that happened
*  we were like this is nuts
*  we are playing a video
*  we're aware of that age
*  we went through the whole thing
*  we went through VCRs
*  we went through answering machines
*  so my knowledge of video games stopped and peaked 1981 with Galaga
*  I was like a champion in Galaga
*  but that's the end of my knowledge
*  so right now I see my son interact with things
*  and he tries to bring me in
*  and I just feel like I don't have the bandwidth
*  to do anything that he's doing
*  it will eat your life
*  it will eat your life
*  it's too fun
*  they're too good
*  these games are so good now
*  they're so immersive
*  so you're a gamer
*  no I don't do them because they're too good
*  they're too fun
*  and I have too many friends that will play video games
*  until 2 or 3 in the morning
*  and they're our age
*  how do they navigate through family life
*  a lot of them don't
*  some of them are younger
*  they're all playing
*  what does Shane play
*  Shane is big into Madden
*  he likes the UFC game
*  he also plays some Command and Conquer
*  because he's big into military history
*  he likes some of that stuff too
*  so they're playing these fucking insanely immersive games
*  and these games are so good
*  they're so good now
*  the graphics are so incredible
*  they're so fun
*  they just have it geared up to constant excitement
*  so the only one that interested me
*  the ones that my son showed me
*  I really know very little about this
*  is the sniper games
*  you like to be a little sneaky
*  very beautiful about sort of studying yourself
*  and getting that scope
*  and so I respect the guys who do that in real life
*  and so I try to do it
*  but there was too much hand-eye coordination of different things
*  so I didn't do too well
*  that controller becomes you
*  so Richard Dawkins talks about that being an extended phenotype
*  those guys that are really good at that
*  that's the ones that the military wants
*  they want those guys to operate drones
*  oh right
*  that's what I would want
*  until AI does it
*  AI is going to do a way better job
*  did you see the thing that we had Mike Baker on
*  he was explaining to us yesterday
*  that they have dogfights they're doing now
*  where AI controlled jets are competing against jets flown by the best pilots
*  and the AI jets are winning 100% of the time
*  wow
*  incredible
*  that's fucking terrifying
*  so speaking of AI
*  I was in the early wave of studying AI
*  so my undergrad is in mathematics and computer science
*  and so as part of my computer science degree
*  I had taken some AI stuff course
*  with Monty Newborn
*  I can't remember his exact name
*  he was part of the team of Deep Blue
*  which do you know what Deep Blue is
*  that was the AI system that was being built
*  to play against the grand chess masters
*  and at the time sometimes this one would win
*  sometimes this one would win
*  oftentimes it would be ties
*  and so we had learned how to program
*  the search algorithms that would allow you to go through
*  a decision tree of chess
*  without having to exhaustively go through the entire tree
*  because the entire tree is something like 10 to the 100 different nodes
*  it would take more than the entire history of the universe
*  to go through it
*  so you have to know how to prune the tree
*  do you follow what I mean
*  so that way I better not waste time going down here
*  so just cut it off
*  that reduces the search space
*  and so I had been exposed to some of the earliest advances
*  in my formal education in AI
*  but frankly 40 years later
*  not withstanding all of the advances
*  I would have thought
*  there would have been even more AI applications
*  than what we currently have
*  in other words I thought it would be
*  we've underperformed what I thought we would have reached
*  so for example in medical diagnostics
*  why aren't there more AI systems that are being used
*  instead of actual human doctors
*  don't you think
*  because medical diagnostics is just the collation of tons of information
*  so that you're able to
*  it's a structured problem right
*  it has very
*  here are all the symptoms
*  I can search through the whole database
*  and come up with what is the likely disease
*  much more quickly
*  and probably more accurately than any human physician
*  and yet to the best of my knowledge
*  I don't think they're used as much as you would have thought they should be
*  I don't think they are
*  but I think people have been diagnosed with things
*  from artificial intelligence now
*  and what
*  didn't someone put a bunch of their data in the chat GPT
*  I know for sure a story went around about like a mom
*  that couldn't get a good answer
*  and put the info in there
*  and got like a correct diagnosis really quickly
*  that's like a one anecdote I think
*  yeah I don't know if it's true
*  but you would imagine that at a certain point in time
*  you would get all of the data
*  on all
*  all medical interventions
*  all
*  you know all medications that are effective for this that or the other thing
*  all issues that could lead to
*  a genetic propensity towards this that or the other thing
*  and you would have it all in some sort of a database
*  right
*  if you could have a computer that's far smarter than a human being
*  and process that
*  and instantaneously know
*  instead of having some guy that has to go back to like what he learned
*  when he was in grad school
*  and you're
*  you're way better off
*  so I think in some areas
*  and I could be misspeaking so take this with a bit of a grain of salt
*  but I think in radiology
*  is one of the areas
*  where now AI systems
*  are almost going to render
*  the human radiologist obsolete
*  because it's pattern recognition right
*  I'm looking at an image
*  and then I have to read that image
*  to decide whether
*  does it look like this area is a bit gray
*  so it looks like there could be a tumor
*  well it turns out I think that the AI systems
*  are better able to detect
*  most of these things than humans
*  so I actually spoke to a
*  radiologist cousin of mine
*  and he
*  he didn't think that they would become obsolete any time
*  him meaning
*  that humans would
*  that human radiologists would still have something to input
*  but it seems to me that
*  in fields in medicine
*  where it's largely driven by
*  pattern recognition
*  is where AI is going to make the most headways
*  I think
*  that's interesting
*  I'm really fascinated to see
*  what the end of this looks like
*  because I think it's going to come real quick
*  I think the use of AI
*  is now something we're just waking up to
*  in terms of like the
*  the general population is super aware of AI
*  now for the first time
*  it was like a science fiction thing
*  just 20 years ago
*  the possibility of it was science fiction
*  20 years ago
*  but the probability of it right now
*  is like a fucking freight train
*  that's headed over a cliff
*  it's like no one's hitting the brakes
*  on this at all
*  and what does this look like
*  so have you had guests that are both
*  you really need to be deathly afraid of AI
*  versus those who say it's completely overblown
*  sure yeah
*  is the evidence leaning to which camp
*  I don't know much of the
*  the evidence is really in who the fuck knows
*  that's the
*  what is actually going to happen
*  is who the fuck knows
*  because I think it's going to be more bizarre
*  than we could ever imagine
*  I think what we're giving birth to
*  collectively as a society
*  is going to be more bizarre than anything
*  we could ever imagine
*  because it's going to be smarter than us
*  by a lot
*  and it's going to be able to make smarter versions
*  of this energy in a way that we couldn't ever possibly fathom
*  we couldn't think it up
*  and it's going to have sentience
*  it's going to have the ability to make decisions
*  it's a life form
*  and we're giving birth to it
*  we're giving birth to some godlike life form
*  that has had
*  that has an unstoppable potential
*  for technological superiority over the human race
*  yikes
*  yeah it's going to be so superior
*  and if we're programming into it
*  certain behavior characteristics
*  or certain imperatives
*  it doesn't have morals
*  it doesn't have
*  the whole idea behind it is nuts
*  so I
*  of all the courses that I've ever taken in my life
*  I spent many years in university
*  the course that blew me
*  the most
*  blew my mind
*  was a course called formal languages
*  which was about
*  well formal languages is touring machines
*  and so I don't know if
*  yeah the touring test
*  yeah the touring test of course
*  so Alan Turing
*  if you delve into his actual
*  you know material
*  you're blown away
*  that a human mind
*  can think at that level
*  you know and I'm saying this
*  as someone who spent my entire career in academia
*  so I've met a lot of really really brilliant people
*  but it's almost metaphysical
*  the kind of
*  depth
*  that his intellect went to
*  so the only other guy that I could think of
*  of sort of contemporary guys
*  would be Gödel
*  I don't know if you know
*  yeah Gödel is the guy who came up with a functional
*  diagram of how you can make a time machine
*  Kurt Gödel
*  yeah the mathematician
*  so he was I don't know if you know this story
*  actually I talk about it in this book
*  in the happiness book
*  at one point I'm talking about the importance of going for walks
*  and just go for a walk and talk and so on
*  and I said well
*  Einstein so both
*  Einstein and Gödel were together at the Institute for Advanced Studies
*  at Princeton
*  and later in his career
*  Einstein was older than Gödel
*  later in his career Einstein said that the only reason that he would go
*  into the office
*  was because he was excited to go on these long walks with Gödel
*  and just have these chats
*  being a fly on the wall
*  sitting as Gödel and Einstein are having these conversations
*  so I just finished reading Gödel's biography
*  and it was very interesting because here's this unbelievable mind
*  you know what he died of?
*  what?
*  because it's going to speak to the opposite side of the mind
*  he was convinced that there were people trying to poison him
*  so he would use his wife
*  as the food tester
*  oh Jesus
*  and she was committed to hospital with some disease whatever
*  so she could no longer serve as his food tester
*  so he died of starvation
*  oh my gosh
*  so now imagine Gödel is both the guy who could think in ways that are unimaginable to us
*  and is also the guy whose mind was parasitized by these conspiratorial ideas
*  wow he was 65 pounds when he died of mounting pain
*  isn't that phenomenal
*  wow caused by a personality disturbance
*  wow
*  it's unbelievable isn't it?
*  assassination of his close friend
*  he developed an obsessive fear of being poisoned
*  oh I just bought a book on the murder of Professor Schlick
*  who was the guy who started the Vienna Circle
*  and why did they poison him?
*  no they shot him
*  so he was worried about being poisoned because his friend got shot
*  so I don't know where the genesis of his paranoia came from
*  but my point is that in that same mind
*  were these two sides
*  so he developed what's called the incompleteness theorem
*  so there are some things within any axiomatic system in mathematics
*  that you could never be able to prove within that system
*  it's really at the level it's like godly
*  it's just unbelievable especially if you're in mathematics
*  to be able to think at that level is unimaginable how deep it is
*  and yet you think people are going to poison you and you're willing to starve to death
*  that's the mystery of the human mind
*  Jamie see if you can find what his theory on time travel was
*  I just looked that up, it postulated he was like wondering
*  I think it has to be like the size of a solar system
*  he was talking about the way the solar system worked in relativity
*  which was Einstein's theory
*  would that allow time travel here it goes
*  a rotating universe
*  yeah how a rotating universe makes time travel possible
*  so he had this idea
*  but I'm going to butcher it unless I can actually read it
*  some of this stuff is so difficult to grasp
*  right right it is
*  okay here it is
*  Gödel found that if you follow a particular path in this rotating universe
*  you can end up in your own past
*  you'd have to travel incredibly far, billions of light years long to do it
*  but it can be done
*  as you travel you would get caught up in the rotation of the universe
*  that isn't just a rotation of the stuff in the cosmos
*  but of both space and time themselves
*  in essence the rotation of the universe would so strongly alter your potential pass forward
*  that those paths loop back around to where you started
*  I have no idea what that means
*  holy shit
*  I mean Richard Feynman
*  you know who that is Richard Feynman
*  the Nobel Prize winner in physics
*  he was a pioneer in quantum mechanics
*  he said if you think you understand quantum physics you don't understand quantum physics
*  it's the same thing for me with this kind of stuff
*  I read it and it's impossible for my stupid brain
*  I don't think it's stupid brain it's so esoteric
*  it is very very esoteric
*  but listen to this
*  if you would set off on your journey and never travel faster than the speed of light
*  you would find yourself back where you started but in your own past
*  what
*  the possibility of backwards time travel creates paradoxes and violates our understanding of causality
*  thankfully all observations indicate that the universe is not rotating
*  so we are protected from Gordel's problem of backward time travel
*  but it remains to this day a mystery why general relativity is okay
*  with this seemingly impossible phenomenon
*  Gordel used the example of the rotating universe to argue that general relativity is incomplete
*  and he may yet be right
*  I don't know what to add to that
*  if you give people the opportunity to go back in time
*  oh my god
*  that would be ridiculous
*  you would never know
*  I've actually played this game
*  a version of this game where I ask people if you could invite 10 historical people to your dinner party
*  who would they be
*  so maybe I can ask you that
*  you don't have to list 10
*  can you list a few that would have to be at the Joe Rogan barbecue
*  I could tell you who's my number one
*  Leonardo da Vinci
*  I just finished a biography on him
*  do you speak Italian?
*  I don't, I speak fake Italian
*  who knows what their Italian was
*  they all had dialects, my grandparents spoke in dialects
*  by the way, is that right?
*  I could link my love for Leonardo da Vinci with the earlier concept of conciliance that we talked about
*  maybe you can see how
*  because Leonardo da Vinci by definition is the renaissance man
*  he is the ultimate polymath
*  he's an anatomist and a painter and an engineer and a futurist and a sculptor
*  he's a man of all, and does them all at very high proficiency
*  and he's able to link all these things
*  so he studies the anatomy of the body in his art
*  so he's now linking anatomy with art
*  so that's what conciliance is
*  so to me Leonardo da Vinci is the ultimate intellectual man
*  because he can do it all
*  he can link different things
*  so he would be on my list
*  who would be arguably your top guy
*  well it's one night right?
*  one night
*  you gotta bring Hunter Thompson
*  who the hell is that?
*  Hunter S Thompson
*  really?
*  you never heard of Hunter S Thompson?
*  the journalist?
*  you never heard of him?
*  maybe
*  that's crazy
*  I can't believe you never heard of Hunter S Thompson
*  Hunter S Thompson is an American writer
*  and he
*  what's his most famous thing?
*  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is the one they made into a Johnny Depp movie
*  it was a crazy
*  it really started off
*  the assignment was
*  he was supposed to write about
*  I think it was motorcycle racing
*  in Las Vegas
*  he gets this contract to write this article
*  and he goes there
*  instead it's this LSD
*  entrenched
*  you're picking this guy over Socrates
*  and Plato and Aristotle and Da Vinci?
*  he said brilliant things man
*  if you read his work
*  his work was brilliant
*  he was out of his fucking mind
*  I mean he was out of his fucking mind
*  doing acid, shooting windows
*  he was crazy
*  there's a video of him having a shoot out with his neighbors in Colorado
*  shooting at each other
*  it was crazy
*  that goes with your morbid Instagram things with your friend
*  no it doesn't necessarily
*  because I think if I could catch him when he was young
*  I'd have been a fascinating guy to talk to
*  I just think
*  you can't drink that hard for that long
*  you just deteriorate
*  and things go sideways
*  mentally it's just very bad
*  you're poisoning yourself
*  every day with coke
*  and you're poisoning yourself every day with whiskey
*  there's a video of us reading
*  Hunter S Thompson's list
*  of what this journalist saw him do in a day
*  this journalist came to Woody Creek Colorado
*  where he lived
*  and us talking about it made its way into a song
*  who is that?
*  that band that did that?
*  so it's like a techno dance song
*  wow
*  that's all about Hunter S Thompson's list of stuff he did
*  when were you reading that?
*  it was a few years back
*  it was me and Greg Simmons were reading it
*  we were like this is the craziest thing
*  listen to the Beardy Man
*  featuring Joe Rogan
*  can we play this?
*  that's ridiculous it's my own words
*  oh in terms of copyright?
*  what happens when you play it?
*  what do you hear?
*  I know what you hear
*  so the problem is the music?
*  you don't have to cut it out
*  see if you can find the actual clip of me and Greg talking about it
*  there's probably a clip of it
*  but it was such a ridiculous
*  he was
*  of amount of substances he's consuming in a day
*  it's fucking insane
*  so what makes him interesting is that he's insane
*  and he consumes a lot of alcohol and drugs
*  no
*  he's a brilliant guy
*  the things that he said were brilliant
*  3pm rise
*  he woke up at 3pm
*  and he starts his day with whiskey and cocaine
*  he's a fucking animal man
*  he's an animal
*  but he was also a brilliant writer
*  he had amazing insight
*  and he's a guy that was soured by the shift
*  from the 1960s to the 1970s
*  what happened in this country?
*  and how weird things died
*  he only died recently right?
*  he died quite a while ago
*  he committed suicide at least 10 years ago right?
*  ok but technically you could have met him
*  could have
*  would have been possible
*  but even then it was like the end of his life
*  he wasn't the same guy
*  another glass of chivas
*  another dunhill
*  here's his daily routine
*  3pm rise
*  305 chivas regal with morning papers
*  smokes dunhills
*  345 cocaine
*  350 another glass of chivas
*  405 pm
*  first cup of coffee and a dunhill
*  415 cocaine
*  416 orange juice and another dunhill
*  430 cocaine
*  454 cocaine
*  505 cocaine
*  511 coffee dunhills
*  530 get more ice in the chivas
*  cocaine at 545
*  6 o'clock smoking grass
*  take the edge off the day
*  7pm
*  3 hours into it
*  515 woody creek tavern for lunch
*  Heineken
*  2 margaritas
*  coleslaw
*  taco salad
*  double order of fried onion rings
*  carrot cake ice cream
*  a bean fritter
*  dunhills another Heineken
*  cocaine
*  and for the rest of the ride home
*  a snow cone
*  a glass of shredded ice
*  which is poured over 4 jiggers of chivas
*  ok so the snow cone is chivas
*  11pm chartreuse
*  cocaine and grass
*  1130 cocaine etc etc
*  12 midnight
*  hunter s thompson is ready to write
*  that's when he sits down to write
*  1205 to 6am
*  he writes
*  chartreuse, cocaine, grass, chivas, coffee, Heineken, clove cigarettes, grapefruit, dunhills, orange juice, gin, continuous pornographic movies
*  6am
*  in the hot tub with champagne
*  dove bars
*  fettuccine alfredo
*  8am halcyon
*  which is a sleeping pill
*  820 sleep
*  so he would take a sleeping pill at 820 in the morning
*  after writing it hard
*  wow
*  wow
*  now if his writing sucks
*  that's crazy
*  but his writing was amazing
*  he was a fiction writer
*  he came up with a kind of journalism
*  that was like journalism mixed with fiction
*  he called it like gonzo journalism
*  oh I love that
*  that's him
*  the way he would write would be like
*  over the top ridiculous
*  to the point where he thought everybody knew he was joking
*  but it was mixed up
*  and also real stuff
*  like fear and loathing on the campaign trail
*  he was on the campaign trail
*  and he spread a rumor
*  about this guy
*  who was a candidate for president
*  being a drug addict
*  on this exotic brazilian drug ibogaine
*  and so people started believing it
*  the guy started having a mental breakdown
*  and he was on the dick cavett show
*  and he admitted to doing this
*  wow
*  he admitted to spreading the rumor
*  he was like
*  he made it all out
*  I couldn't believe people really believed
*  that musky was eating ibogaine
*  I never said he was
*  I started the rumor whole thing
*  he affected the campaign
*  he affected
*  I'm assuming he wasn't married
*  was he married?
*  he was married
*  because all that cocaine and stuff might get into the
*  well you know
*  gotta do what you gotta do in this world
*  I don't know
*  obviously it didn't work out
*  but he was a fucking maniac
*  he was a complete maniac
*  he was like hells angels is an amazing book
*  that's crazy
*  he was embedded with the hells angels
*  and wrote this book
*  and they were really mad at him afterwards
*  but it's crazy
*  oh I know where I know him from
*  I think
*  I read Tucker Carlson's
*  biography
*  because the guy who wrote it
*  came on my show
*  so I read it in preparation
*  and I think Tucker Carlson
*  refers to him
*  as a term gonzo journalism
*  probably
*  doesn't Tucker have a Hunter S. Thompson story
*  well that's what I'm thinking
*  because when you said hells angels
*  I know that Tucker had been invited
*  to go give a talk with the hells angels
*  where he referenced some
*  and I think it's this guy
*  so now I'm linking
*  I don't know the story
*  but I think Tucker has a Hunter S. Thompson story
*  like he knew him
*  oh I feel like I've known Hunter S. Thompson
*  for most of my life
*  I first encountered him in 1981
*  when I was 12
*  wow
*  Jamie would we say that out of my 10
*  appearances on the show
*  this has been the most number of times
*  that you've come in with some truth
*  I'm gonna say yes
*  damn
*  dropping bombs
*  I don't have any research on number of pull ups I've done
*  yeah you're obsessed with numbers
*  I'm academic
*  we quantify things
*  I don't know if you know
*  that math is racist
*  I do
*  by the way
*  7 or 8 years ago you could pull it up
*  Jamie can pull it up
*  I did a satirical clip
*  where I introduced a new field
*  that I was coining
*  as social justice mathematics
*  and I went through all of these mathematical properties
*  and said how we should get rid of like
*  irrational numbers should not exist
*  because they marginalize
*  mental illness whatever
*  and I was like
*  I'm a mathematician
*  which is kind of a geeky crowd
*  but 7 or 8 years later
*  reality caught up with my prophetic satire
*  now it is literally the case
*  that there is a field called
*  social justice mathematics
*  where you talk about math being racist
*  there's a lot of grift in this world kids
*  and there's a lot of people that believe things
*  if left unchallenged
*  and those things become doctrine
*  they're a real problem
*  because they're not based in logic
*  that is we are very susceptible
*  to cult like thinking
*  yeah I watched yesterday
*  on my way to Austin
*  a documentary 3 part series
*  on these
*  I think it's called Ivy Ridge School
*  have you heard of it?
*  Ivy Ridge School
*  it was in Ogdenburg or something
*  in upstate New York
*  they had a whole bunch of those schools
*  where they would take kids
*  many of whom were not delinquents really
*  but they would convince their parents
*  because you mentioned cult
*  so this was kind of a cult situation
*  they would convince their parents
*  that they need to send them to these boarding schools
*  in order to
*  provide them with structure
*  and discipline so they can
*  get their life together
*  even though many of them
*  had committed very very minor
*  they were caught once with marijuana
*  these were not like dropping acid all day long
*  and the things that they would do to them
*  in these schools
*  is straight out of
*  the worst Soviet gulags you could think of
*  and they are throughout the United States
*  and it's a form of cult indoctrination
*  where you are doing
*  cult indoctrination at two levels
*  to the captors
*  captives in the schools
*  but you also have to convince the parents
*  that they are doing the right thing
*  by sending their kids there
*  it's unbelievable you should watch this documentary
*  it really behooves you to imagine
*  that in the 21st century
*  in the United States these things can occur
*  but it really does
*  oh there you go exactly
*  that's crazy
*  you are not allowed to have eye contact
*  with another student
*  you are not allowed to smile
*  you are not allowed to look out the window
*  you are not allowed to speak to anyone
*  you just sit in front of a computer
*  and you just do these
*  oh my god
*  and they were in there for like
*  28 months
*  then they gave them
*  degrees, diplomas
*  high school diplomas
*  that were fraudulent
*  so imagine you are sent there
*  and by the way in some cases
*  they would come and kidnap you
*  out of your parents home
*  because they knew that the kid would be resistant to leave
*  they said no no it's completely legal
*  so like two goons would come
*  take your child
*  take them to upstate New York
*  the kid has no idea why I am there
*  oh my god
*  so it's really it's very powerful
*  and the ability to be parasitized
*  is infinite
*  that story is crazy
*  yeah definitely check it out
*  oh my god
*  so how old are your kids now
*  speaking of kids are they
*  past the age where you have any influence on them
*  they think you are no longer the hero
*  you have become a zero
*  because my children are entering a bit at that stage
*  that's to be expected
*  and they are correct
*  they find flaws in your game
*  yeah it's fascinating to watch little minds
*  develop their view of the world
*  and if there is anything that I have ever done
*  like a real 180 on
*  is I developed this weird way of looking at people
*  and it may be much more empathetic
*  where I don't think of people as just you at age
*  you know whatever you are
*  you at age 49
*  I think of everybody as babies
*  I think of everybody as you used to be a little baby
*  and a bunch of shit went terribly wrong
*  and now here we are together
*  in this unfortunate situation
*  and where I used to just think
*  I saw some guy who was drunk
*  and he is 35 years old some asshole
*  he is just an asshole
*  this guy is an asshole
*  he is rude to people
*  what happened to that guy
*  how did he get to that spot
*  I started thinking about people like little babies
*  little babies that just got a bunch of bad things
*  bad environments
*  but that is removing people's personal agency
*  it is a little
*  it is definitely removing it a little
*  which is also bullshit
*  because you do have personal agency
*  but you don't have 100%
*  there are certain landscapes that are
*  you know, untraversable
*  I actually faced
*  what you faced with a 35 year old
*  I faced something similar
*  on my daily walk with my wife to the coffee shop and back
*  there is a gentleman that stands outside
*  this you know kind of she-she
*  artisanal butchery
*  butcher place
*  in our neighborhood
*  and he is soliciting money every day
*  all day
*  he doesn't look as though he is mentally ill
*  he doesn't look completely destitute
*  but he stands there every day
*  and so now I just say hello to him
*  just to recognize him
*  you can tell that it means a lot to him
*  hi how are you, how are you doing
*  and I have struggled with whether
*  it is appropriate for me or not
*  to just strike up a conversation
*  out of just a human interest
*  and knowing what happened to you
*  because he clearly doesn't seem like he is mentally ill
*  he doesn't seem as though
*  he is a drug addict
*  I mean he is not wearing a three piece Italian suit
*  but you know he is not disheveled
*  and yet he is there every day
*  and that is the best option he has
*  do you think it would
*  it would be viewed by him
*  as insulting and offensive
*  if I were to
*  speak to him or on the contrary
*  hey somebody is actually taking an interest in me
*  how do you view this
*  it really depends upon the situation
*  you know how crazy you think he is
*  or if you think he is crazy at all
*  I don't think he is crazy
*  well there is a lot of people that have mental illnesses
*  that wind up on the street
*  that is a big part of the problem
*  mental illnesses and drug addicts
*  they are the ones who wind up in those situations
*  and he could be either of those
*  you don't know
*  but I bet he is probably lonely
*  if you have a conversation with him
*  he would probably appreciate it
*  you know if you could handle it
*  you might get sucked into his world
*  he might want money from you
*  who knows why he is there
*  can I tell you an incredible story about a homeless guy
*  it is actually in the last chapter of the happiness book
*  his name is Bijan Gilani
*  I met him when I was a professor at UC Irvine
*  I was sitting at a cafe
*  a whole bunch of books thrown all over my table
*  I was working on a paper
*  he comes up to me really well dressed
*  a bit of an accent
*  he is of Iranian descent
*  he says oh my god these are all interesting books
*  do you mind if I sit down with you for a couple of minutes
*  chat
*  so I tell him I am a professor at UC Irvine
*  he was doing his PhD
*  studying the homeless community in Southern California
*  so he had
*  it was an anthropological study
*  where instead of going to a culture
*  and living amongst them in the Amazon
*  the community that he is studying anthropologically
*  is the homeless community
*  he was a wealthy man
*  fast forward several years later
*  he becomes destitute
*  living out of his car
*  and himself homeless
*  the reason why I mention
*  that is him
*  this is incredible Jamie
*  so this gentleman was living in this car
*  now why am I mentioning this in the context of the book on happiness
*  so he was asked
*  are you a happy person
*  guess what he answers
*  he says now this is a guy who has a PhD
*  reached pinnacle
*  very wealthy guy in Southern California
*  is now living in his car
*  he says well I am a moral person
*  I am a good person
*  I have a library card to the Newport Beach library
*  so I can go and nourish my mind
*  I have a card to the gym
*  so I can stay healthy
*  yes I am happy
*  so I use that story to say
*  here is a guy who has every reason
*  to feel down on himself
*  yet he frames his situation in such a way
*  that he can elevate himself
*  despite all his trials and tribulations
*  one more quick story
*  David McCallum
*  I may have mentioned him previously
*  I am not sure
*  arguably the most incredible guy I have had on my show
*  and like you I have had many amazing people
*  spent 29 years in prison
*  and then he was exonerated
*  for a murder that he didn't commit
*  he comes on my show
*  we are chatting
*  as we are chatting
*  I said to him
*  David you must be the reincarnation of Buddha
*  because it is amazing
*  how you are not filled with any rancor
*  any sense of vindictiveness
*  any vengefulness
*  it is unbelievable
*  you are a much better man than I am
*  because I would want to burn the world down
*  if someone did this to me
*  he says you know God
*  I have a sister who suffers from cerebral palsy
*  she has been bed ridden
*  and yet she finds a way to smile
*  and so from that perspective
*  whatever I went through is not that bad
*  so a guy who just spent three decades in prison
*  for a crime that he didn't commit
*  was still able to reframe his tragedy
*  into a positive
*  so these are
*  and by the way these are the types of
*  people learn a lot more from these stories
*  than they do if you had gone all academies on them
*  and so that is why I love telling these stories
*  because then people right away connect to those stories
*  the way the healing brain works
*  if you are studying this for all these years
*  what is the most surprising thing to you
*  that people do
*  that seems obvious
*  that they shouldn't do
*  in terms of the way they think about things
*  not alter their positions in light of incoming evidence
*  that is the big one right
*  because in a sense
*  it speaks to your decency as a human being
*  epistemologically if we are true honest people
*  we change
*  as you said we make mistakes
*  we held positions because we had information ABC
*  but now XYZ comes in
*  and we change
*  and any good decent moral person with integrity
*  has to be able to do that
*  but to your earlier point
*  most of us are vain
*  most of us have pride
*  and we are not able to let go of those positions
*  because it will affect my identity
*  and that is why by the way
*  pride of the seven deadly sins
*  you may or may not know this
*  is the supra sin
*  it is the sin from which all other sins flow
*  because pride is the orgiastic self love
*  so in French
*  by the way you distinguish between positive pride
*  and negative pride
*  in English you don't have that distinction
*  so if you say I am proud of my work
*  that is different than saying
*  don't be prideful in your love
*  that would be a negative thing
*  in French there is a distinction
*  positive pride is fierté
*  negative pride is orgueil
*  so that is another interesting thing
*  is that in some languages
*  the terms exist to separate
*  in other languages you don't have them
*  dropping a lot of wisdom and knowledge
*  you are but you are always filled with that
*  I think one of the more unique things
*  about your background
*  that makes you resistant to stupidity
*  is the fact that you did have to flee
*  with your family
*  and the fact that you were involved
*  in a real war
*  a real war zone
*  a real scary time
*  and to see the effects of ideology
*  so clearly impose themselves
*  on your life when you were very young
*  that is exactly right
*  that is why in the first chapter
*  I tell that story
*  and that offers the reader a window
*  into why I hate tribalism
*  or I hate identity politics
*  because Lebanon is the perfect experiment
*  of identity politics
*  and so you are exactly right
*  do you hold any
*  one of the things that has been amazing
*  about all the different conversations
*  that you and I have had
*  and this is the tenth one that we have done
*  a lot of this
*  wouldn't get to some of the people
*  that understand what you are saying
*  and reincorporate it into their understanding
*  of their own behavior
*  and tribal behavior in general
*  and just the way people think about things
*  the way people accept ridiculous ideas
*  you have had a big impact on that
*  you just gave me the forum
*  I just show up
*  you tell me where to show up
*  you have all the information
*  if I show up by myself
*  it is not worthwhile
*  I got to tell you
*  I guess you can imagine
*  I could be walking
*  that literally happened
*  I am walking on a beach in the Bahamas
*  a native Bahamian
*  who is doing some artisanal thing
*  runs up to me
*  recognizes me
*  because I have been on the Joe Rogan show
*  so it is just
*  I don't mean that all people are right
*  I mean that is your reach
*  so how many people do you get per show?
*  it is a lot
*  so then again
*  the people who are looking down on podcasters
*  if you are in the business of spreading information
*  you should be lining up to appear on the show
*  believe me I never take it for granted
*  I feel so privileged
*  first that I am your friend
*  but that I have this opportunity to come
*  and reach so many people
*  how many people have written to me
*  and said I became interested in psychology
*  and consumer behavior
*  and politics
*  because I heard you say something on Joe Rogan
*  it is very weird
*  Joe Rogan from Boston, Massachusetts
*  yeah sort of Newton
*  I lived in Boston different parts of my life
*  but it is very bizarre
*  that it has reached what it is doing
*  it is very strange
*  how do you handle fame?
*  I try not to
*  I try not to engage
*  so are you shut off when you are in public
*  because I suspect people
*  not shut off
*  yeah
*  I mean it is the only way to do it
*  otherwise you will go crazy
*  you will go crazy
*  if you don't interact with people
*  people get weird with you
*  it is weird
*  they see someone they have watched on YouTube
*  or they are watching on their phone
*  or they are watching
*  whatever
*  I have been fortunate
*  I don't know how it has been for you
*  online I get tons of negativity
*  I have only had a knock on wood
*  in all the years I have been in the public
*  one time a negative encounter
*  so it is 10 million to one
*  that is pretty amazing
*  so your ratio hasn't been as positive
*  no it is always very positive
*  I think even in general
*  most people are good people
*  even if they say bad things
*  and I think if you are around someone
*  your reaction to them would be very different
*  than writing things in text
*  I bet a lot of people that wrote shitty things to you
*  if they met you they would say a nice thing to you
*  it is a terrible way to communicate
*  it feels like a real thought
*  and sometimes you are
*  I know that sometimes I am a lot more caustic
*  when I reply to someone online
*  than I would in person
*  I really try not to be
*  I don't like conflict
*  I don't think it is necessary
*  I think most of your conflict should be within yourself
*  within your own mind
*  whatever you are doing with your own mind
*  you are focusing your energy on
*  you have more bandwidth for it
*  if you don't have these external conflicts
*  that are totally unnecessary
*  I just think they are unnecessary
*  I follow you on twitter
*  you don't engage anybody anymore
*  almost never
*  it is just not fun
*  you are thrown into this weird world
*  of opinions and people
*  and if it is about you
*  you shouldn't be that interested in you
*  that you want to read all these people's opinions about you
*  I am interested in other people writing about stuff
*  I am interested in different opinions about things
*  but I don't want to engage
*  because the environment of engaging online
*  is just too weird
*  and you are doing it everyday for 3 hours already
*  just too many different opinions coming at you
*  and too many different people coming at you
*  that is not good for people
*  I don't think it is good to be interacting with that many people
*  in any form
*  I don't think it is good to be interacting with that many people in real life
*  you probably never have a deep conversation
*  you are just constantly running into new people
*  everywhere you go
*  just people constantly
*  you are going to want some time off
*  and I think it is the same with interactions online
*  and I think people don't think about it that way
*  they will think about
*  every time someone is talking at you
*  you are getting input
*  every time you are around someone you are getting input
*  and if you are around people that are cool
*  it is a great experience
*  it is really fun
*  we had a great time
*  we were laughing
*  but if you are around someone who is really annoying
*  and shitty or mean
*  or snide
*  now it is a bad time
*  so you know to avoid those people
*  but you don't have that opportunity online
*  it is a party
*  and the whole world is there
*  and 80% of them might be Chinese bots
*  who fucking knows
*  and you are just going to take those in
*  and your brain is going to process them
*  like they are real opinions
*  and real people that are to be respected
*  these are things to be considered
*  maybe you are a piece of shit
*  maybe you are self-hating
*  of many of the wonderful advice that you have given on the show
*  I remember you once said to me
*  kind of surprised
*  what are you doing reading comments
*  never ever ever read comments
*  and I remember that sometimes when I answer someone
*  they say clearly you are not implementing Joe Rogan's advice
*  but I must say that over the years
*  I have greatly reduced my temptation to
*  so I can't say that I never read
*  but much much less than before
*  you will feel way better
*  it is just not good for you
*  I think it is a bad way to process people's interactions
*  I don't think it is a real indicator of people
*  I think it is a weird way that people are willing to engage
*  online they would never do in real life
*  otherwise it would be a blood bath in the streets everywhere
*  people would just kill each other left and right
*  it is not like that in the real world
*  because that is the real world type of communication
*  is very different than online communication
*  but online communication gets processed in your head
*  like it is real communication
*  and I think it heightens anxiety with everybody
*  so in the happiness book I talk about research
*  that shows that the number one factor
*  in terms of longevity
*  more than your cholesterol scores when you are 50
*  is the tightness of your social network
*  your friendship group
*  and so with that in mind
*  if I were to ask you to pick your five biggest friends
*  are they ones that you have held from when you were in Newton
*  or are there a lot of new entrants into the inner circle
*  of Joe Rogan over the years
*  does it shift much your friendship group
*  or are you very much stable
*  I have a lot of friends that I have been friends with
*  since I was in high school
*  but I have a lot of really good friends
*  I have been friends with comics
*  that are real good friends of mine for decades
*  so I have known a lot of these guys
*  and a lot of the guys that are here now
*  like Tony I have been friends with Tony Hinscliffe
*  for god at least 15 years
*  something like that right
*  when did Tony first start doing shows at Redband
*  I don't know until 10, 11 something like that
*  11, 12 years ago whatever it was
*  Joey Diaz I have been friends with him for 25 years
*  26 years maybe more
*  you know there is a lot of these guys I have known forever
*  I have known Ari for 20 plus years
*  you know we have been friends for so long
*  and Tom Segura same thing
*  I have known him for 20 years almost
*  so when those guys all wanted to move out here together
*  I am like oh my god this is amazing
*  Ari hasn't moved here but I am going to try to convince that motherfucker
*  here meaning Austin from California
*  he likes New York
*  he likes to be congested
*  he likes to be beep beep pocky
*  he likes all the energy of all those people packed on top of each other
*  are most of your Southern California friends out of there
*  yeah
*  there is a few guys left
*  Bill Burr stayed
*  a few other guys stayed that are really good
*  by the way I had one of your friends on my show Brian Callan
*  oh Brian Callan is awesome
*  he is such a cool guy
*  he is a great motherfucker
*  he really is
*  and also retarded at the same time
*  he is just silly
*  well he wasn't on my show he was like very serious
*  yeah no he is very capable of that too
*  he is very well read
*  yeah exactly
*  yeah he is a great guest too
*  great podcast guest
*  well I have always said that
*  I mean comics have to by definition be intelligent
*  by the way that is a sexually selected trait
*  when women say I want a man who is funny
*  she is obviously saying I want a man who is intelligent
*  because it is very unlikely for you to be truly funny
*  and be a complete dullard
*  and so by you saying I like funny guys
*  you are effectively saying by proxy I like intelligent guys
*  so it doesn't surprise me that Brian Callan or all your other friends would be funny
*  I mean look at Dave Chappelle
*  how are you going to pull off all those insights
*  if you were just moron right
*  so he is probably smarter than a lot of my colleagues
*  well he is very smart
*  Dave is very smart
*  but he is also you know
*  he is like in the world of stand up seven days a week
*  he is like a master craftsman
*  out there like swinging away at ideas
*  piecing them up together on the road
*  he is easy
*  there is no one like him
*  that guy flies into a town and just shows up at comedy clubs
*  and goes on stage
*  they don't even know he is going to be there
*  he does it all the time
*  damn man he did it with me
*  I was in Denver he just showed up
*  you mean you were performing in Denver
*  and he just showed up
*  now do you feel slighted and that he might take over the scene
*  no he is my friend
*  no no no I wanted him to go on
*  this is what happened
*  I did this weekend at the comedy works in Denver
*  and Dave flew in
*  and just decided to show up
*  and I am like what are you doing
*  he goes I just wanted to come say hi
*  he just flew in
*  I go you want to go on stage
*  he goes should I
*  I go fuck yeah hold on
*  so I go out onto the stage
*  and I yelled out to the audience
*  tell everybody to come back
*  Dave Chappelle is here
*  and they are like what
*  and so they all piled back in
*  he did like another 40 minutes and murdered
*  it was incredible
*  he just showed up in LA
*  started doing sets
*  he just shows up and works out his material
*  he is just in it
*  just fully involved in this art form
*  so you would say he is currently the top living comic
*  you know it is
*  he is absolutely
*  you can't consider the best without considering him
*  it is all subjective
*  there are certain people that think this person is funnier
*  certain people that think that
*  I think it is all stupid to say like a number one
*  number two number three
*  I think there is just a level of greatness
*  that some achieve
*  that he is at right now
*  that is very rare
*  it is very Richard Pryor
*  it is very Sam Kinnison
*  it is very there is just like outliers
*  that are just so consistently good
*  and over the years just have so much output
*  you got to put him in that category
*  and he also has this mystique of taking 10 years off
*  right he disappears
*  he stops doing stand up
*  one of the best of all time
*  does this incredible sketch show
*  that is arguably the best sketch show ever
*  that only does two seasons
*  and then he disappears
*  and then he just quits
*  and then he doesn't even do stand up
*  you know what he is doing
*  he would do stand up at a park
*  he would show up with a speaker
*  and plug it in
*  and just do free stand up in Seattle
*  is that right?
*  it would be crazy
*  I can't believe he was there
*  what is he doing here
*  this is insane
*  he would just show up places
*  like a real artist
*  on a vision quest
*  then he comes back 10 years later
*  and just starts dominating the game again
*  I saw him
*  I don't know if you saw that Netflix
*  where he is recounting how he went back
*  to his high school
*  and what struck me is
*  how good of a storyteller he was
*  I think you had Jonathan Gottschel
*  the professor who studies
*  evolutionary literature
*  and he studies why storytelling is important to us
*  and Dave Chappelle is a perfect manifestation of this
*  he can garner huge multi million dollars
*  because he can tell a mean story
*  he is just so likable to
*  you start smiling when you hear him talk
*  there is a vibe that he has
*  when he starts talking
*  he just starts smiling
*  and you know he is going somewhere
*  where are you going with this
*  oh no
*  that is true
*  the world needs that
*  we need people like that out there
*  we need guys like him out there
*  so of all the different hats you wear
*  that is the one that brings you
*  your podcast or you do the MMA stuff
*  is being in front of the audience
*  doing your routine
*  the thing that gives you the most high
*  it is the most high
*  it is the most complicated
*  it is the hardest to pull off
*  having conversations with people is pretty effortless
*  it is fun
*  it is just fun
*  it is engaging
*  I feel very lucky to have these kinds of conversations with you
*  but doing stand up
*  is like piecing together the bits
*  making sure they are polished
*  you have the right angle on them
*  got them honed
*  you figured out the most effective way to insert the idea
*  you know to figure out the sneakiest way to hide the punch line
*  it is fun
*  but it is all fun
*  that is the beautiful thing
*  if you can do stuff that you really like doing
*  like having conversations with people
*  that is fun
*  I really like doing stand up
*  I really like doing UFC commentary
*  just do fun things
*  you are living a blessed life
*  I am very lucky
*  I did something though
*  I definitely did something
*  but it has been very beneficial to me
*  to be able to have conversations like this
*  to be able to have so many conversations with so many people
*  that know so many things
*  and it just as you said
*  it highlights how little you know
*  and how much there is to know
*  and how many different things there is to know
*  so many different things about
*  there are people right now that are studying their entire life
*  some shit you have never even heard of
*  they are the experts of it
*  and it is a hugely complex thing that they are involved in
*  and you don't even know it exists
*  and you are like what are you guys doing
*  what is this
*  you know
*  I mean who the hell knows
*  what kind of scientific discoveries that are going on right now
*  as we sit in this room
*  there is a frenzy of technological activity going on
*  well I mean Austin
*  I think it was after my last trip here
*  which was the last time I came last year to do your show
*  and I was arguing that Austin might be the next
*  so you know you had Florence of the Medici's of the Da Vinci
*  500 years ago
*  then you had the Vienna circle
*  the Viennese circle
*  in the 1880s to 1930 where
*  Vienna was kind of the intellectual hotbed
*  and maybe it is a bit hyperbolic
*  but I think Austin is vying to be kind of the next one right
*  and that everybody is coming here
*  all kinds of creative types
*  whether they be academics or writers or comics or podcasters
*  or Elon Musk
*  so do you think that Austin
*  it would be reasonable to argue that
*  it is becoming sort of the intellectual slash creative center of the United States
*  that is ridiculous
*  you mean New York you could never
*  I think first of all
*  there is great spots everywhere
*  you know there is great spots in New York
*  you just have to deal with a lot of shit in New York
*  but to say there is not amazing shit going on in New York artistically is crazy
*  to say it is not amazing stuff going on in LA that is crazy too
*  it is just what matters is we are doing it in a way that is beneficial for comedy
*  it is beneficial for us
*  it is good for us
*  we have set up stand up out here to make it good for us
*  the Google people and all the people that moved out here
*  they are doing it because it is a good place to be
*  I do not necessarily know if there is hot spots
*  I think the hot spots are the internet
*  there are cities that are better to live in
*  because they have less people and less traffic
*  and less bullshit and less laws
*  and less nonsense imposed on the citizens
*  yeah definitely
*  but there is a critical mass of people that congregate in an area
*  making that place unique and different from other places
*  that is what made Vienna Vienna
*  the start of psychoanalysis
*  it is where Gödel hung out
*  it is where Jung hung out
*  so maybe Austin is not there yet
*  but University of Austin is being founded here
*  that is trying to be the anti-woke university
*  so there is definitely a vibe
*  people keep telling me to move here
*  I think it is very pretentious to bring that up though
*  if you actually live here
*  I am very hesitant to even say
*  I would never compare it in such lofty terms
*  it is a great spot
*  the University of Austin thing
*  they are setting it up as an anti-woke
*  they are not saying that though
*  it is not in the mission statement
*  but it is definitely kind of a countermeasure
*  to all the illiberal stuff that we have seen in universities
*  I actually a couple of years ago
*  I came to give a couple of talks
*  at University of Texas, UT Austin
*  and I met with the president of University of Austin
*  we had brunch together
*  are you thinking about coming here?
*  I mean if the right opportunity presents itself
*  really?
*  Inshallah
*  wow that would be wild
*  you could be free from communist Canada
*  oh my god
*  free from communist Canada
*  free from the weather
*  and by the way
*  something that we didn't talk about sir
*  came after my last appearance on your show
*  no what did you say?
*  they got you in so much trouble
*  you are not going to believe this
*  of all the things that I have said
*  do you remember at one point in the show
*  I said because you had gone to Greece last summer
*  and then I said oh we just came back from Portugal
*  and I got to tell you
*  I wasn't a big fan of the Portuguese accent
*  and then I went on and said
*  but actually I speak Hebrew
*  and Hebrew is violently ugly
*  I said oh but the worst
*  the real affront to human dignity
*  is the French Canadian accent
*  completely jokingly
*  I used the line
*  affront to human dignity
*  as a running gag for 10 years on Twitter
*  you know the Beatles are in affront to human dignity
*  anybody who doesn't love Lionel Messi
*  is in affront to human dignity
*  it's an ongoing gag
*  it's a throwaway line
*  I said it I think you had cracked up
*  you had laughed and we move on
*  about a week later
*  a super angry kind of French Quebecer separatist guy
*  who was a article in the La Presse
*  which is like the main Quebec newspaper
*  saying this guy
*  this immigrant that we opened our doors to
*  and save them from civil war
*  goes on the number one show
*  and you know erases our existence
*  for the next three weeks
*  Joe Rogan for the next three weeks
*  I was the number one most hated person in Quebec
*  luckily I was in California on vacation
*  but the Quebec minister of justice weighed in against me
*  the minister of science and education weighed in
*  right go back Arab-Jew-Self-Filafel
*  back in the Middle East
*  we opened our doors to you
*  so yeah apparently you can't joke
*  you can say a lot of things
*  but don't joke about the Quebec accent on Joe Rogan
*  I personally think it's a beautiful accent
*  well I've learned since I've been reeducated
*  that it is the most beautiful
*  I'm glad you've been reeducated
*  the thing about this place though is the heat
*  you gotta be ready for the heat
*  well I am from Lebanon
*  that's true
*  is Lebanon a dryer?
*  no it's dryer you're right
*  this is humid right?
*  oh it gets funky
*  what's the mosquito situation here?
*  it's not good
*  it's not good?
*  it's not good there's lakes everywhere
*  that's why we have so many bats
*  they consume mosquitoes
*  if it wasn't for bats we would be fucked
*  yeah that's true
*  in 2005 was the first time I came to Austin
*  there was a human behavior and evolution conference here
*  and the hotel was right next to where they come out
*  and so you know what I'm talking about
*  and so we actually stood there as they came out
*  it's crazy right?
*  it's magical
*  also by the way sometimes those little fuckers have diseases
*  I know there was a story that we talked about on the podcast before
*  where there was a guy and a bat grazed his finger
*  and he died from rabies
*  no kidding
*  they didn't know what was wrong with him until it was too late
*  and rabies is something that once you have you fucking have it
*  you're done
*  you have to get
*  if something bites you that has rabies
*  you have to get really painful shots
*  and they have to do it very quickly
*  I think someone said it like you said it today
*  I don't remember where it came from
*  but I do know it's fatal like 99% of the time
*  it's a terrifying fucking disease
*  and bats have it
*  bats, rats, skunks, all kinds of shit
*  dogs
*  what are the guys with the raccoons?
*  yeah they get it
*  it's scary
*  there's a crazy video that was on Instagram
*  of this cop
*  and she walks
*  I think it's a she
*  I'm pretty sure it might be a dude
*  I don't want to misgender anybody
*  I don't remember
*  but this cop shoots this fucking raccoon
*  and the raccoon is not dying
*  and shoots it again
*  and then shoots it again
*  it was a rabid raccoon
*  she's just unloading a gun
*  it's a zombie raccoon
*  boom, boom, boom
*  usually when you have rabies you get hydrophobia
*  you get fear of water
*  you can't drink
*  what's the mechanism there?
*  it's a good question
*  it's weird
*  it's weird that it doesn't affect people in the same way
*  it doesn't make people want to bite people
*  it makes animals fearless
*  and they want to bite you
*  they want to bite you because they want to give it to you
*  is that right?
*  what else could it be?
*  why would they get aggressive to the point where they want to chase after you and bite you
*  put themselves in danger
*  to go after you and bite you
*  they want to give it to you
*  it's like a zombie thing
*  but it just kills people
*  it doesn't turn them into zombies
*  but it turns animals into zombies
*  they just want to come get you
*  that's crazy
*  that there's a virus like that
*  and that is what 28 days later was
*  right?
*  they were engineering a virus that they were putting in chimpanzees and it broke out into people
*  right
*  I just finished a book called The Plague
*  that looked at the history of civilizations
*  through the lens of different plagues
*  very interesting
*  it got tedious at one point
*  you're going through the different civilizations
*  but the black
*  and so on
*  but going back to the Romans and so on
*  a lot of history was shaped by a particular virus becoming more or less prevalent at a particular time and place
*  it is so fascinating when you hear about plagues
*  like just wiping out giant swaths of the population
*  like the plague of North Americans coming and interacting with the Native Americans
*  that was smallpox right?
*  90% killed 90% of the people here
*  probably did the same thing through the Mayas
*  that's probably what happened to all those people that disappeared
*  they left behind the Chichen Itza and all these crazy places
*  what happened to those people?
*  doesn't that coincide with when explorers started showing up in boats with cooties?
*  you know?
*  it's crazy how much that shapes human population
*  the interaction of these weird little things
*  that are kind of alive
*  that jump from person to person
*  what's amazing is that
*  going back to Fauci and so on
*  I think the fatality rate was
*  or survival rate was like 99.7 or something right?
*  for COVID, does that sound right?
*  something like that
*  now imagine if you compare that to the fatality rate of the black plague
*  where I think it was something in the order of one third of Europe was wiped out
*  so imagine the level of precaution that we took
*  I understand hindsight is 20-20
*  but we took all these precautions for something that ultimately
*  you had more than a 99% chance of surviving
*  so contextualize that against the black plague
*  maybe it was an overreaction
*  what did they think the roots of the black plague were?
*  was it poor sanitation that caused?
*  I mean of course the Jews were blamed by the way
*  the Jews blamed you the black plague?
*  oh absolutely
*  and by the way there is a guy
*  have you had John Durant on your show?
*  he's the guy who wrote a book on sort of paleo fitness or something a few years ago
*  he has an interesting piece
*  where he argues that
*  one of the reasons why Jews serve as scapegoats
*  in many of these plague situations
*  is because of the
*  rights of purification
*  that are in the Jewish religion
*  hence rendering the Jews
*  less likely to
*  succumb to many of these
*  you know transmissions
*  he was talking about something like
*  so you know there is 613 mitzvot
*  like commandments or rules in Judaism
*  613
*  and if I remember I hope I'm not misquoting
*  I think something like 20% of them
*  he says in his book
*  are related to purification
*  by the way you see it also in Islam
*  you have to go into the mosque
*  you have to wash your hands in a certain way
*  and wash your feet and so on
*  and so because the Jews
*  would often times have
*  lesser infection rates
*  than the other populations
*  within that ecosystem
*  then they would always look to them
*  suspiciously how come you're not all dropping
*  like assholes while the rest of us are dead
*  it must be the Jews
*  so that's an interesting
*  explanation for some of the anti-Semitism
*  that's insane
*  that's an insane blame indeed
*  so do they think the cause
*  of the reason why these plagues
*  they were transferred from like
*  fleas to rats
*  so I think the correct answer
*  and maybe somebody will correct me
*  in the comment section
*  is it's the fleas on the rats
*  that transmit the virus
*  and where do they think
*  that the virus came from
*  I don't know
*  I wouldn't want to misbehave
*  but back then it was fucking
*  what kind of medicine did you have
*  like would they give you carrot juice
*  didn't they even know how to make carrot juice
*  bloodletting for the royals
*  a lot of fucking voodoo probably
*  yeah exactly
*  well actually I was very interested
*  in bringing on my show
*  but it never worked out
*  a specialist on Galen
*  you know who Galen is
*  he was an ancient physician
*  in ancient Greece
*  so kind of like
*  I don't know if he preceded Hippocrates
*  but he was one of the old
*  ancient world physicians
*  not only because they were great thinkers
*  but also how many things they got wrong
*  so Hippocrates believed in the
*  theory of four humors
*  it's any disease that you have
*  is due to you
*  having too little or too much
*  of one of these bile
*  which is complete nonsense today
*  but at the time
*  the great Hippocrates thought that
*  so I'm very interested
*  to our earlier point about how you revise
*  the stuff that you know
*  Marcus Aurelius would have gone to these guys
*  because they are the great physicians
*  today we would laugh as complete voodoo
*  yeah today
*  and what will we be looking at
*  and laughing yeah exactly
*  in the future
*  this is the black death wiki
*  and this is some of the origins
*  and this is the hygiene section
*  the runoff from the local slaughterhouse
*  had made his garden stinking and putrid
*  where another charge that the blood
*  from slain animals flooded nearby
*  streets and lanes
*  making a foul corruption
*  an abominable site to all dwelling near
*  in much of medieval Europe
*  sanitation legislation consisted of
*  an ordinance requiring homeowners
*  to shout
*  look out below
*  three times before dumping a full
*  chamber pot
*  into the street
*  yikes
*  look out below shit is coming out the window
*  you have to say it three times
*  that is the rule
*  bro imagine
*  that is from the black plan
*  early Christians considered bathing
*  a temptation
*  with this danger in mind
*  St. Benedict declared
*  to those who are well
*  and especially to the young
*  bathing shall seldom be permitted
*  oh because you might masturbate
*  if you might touch your body
*  oh my god
*  St. Agnes took the injunction to heart
*  and died without ever bathing
*  yo what did that guy smell like
*  like what did he smell like
*  be the one clean guy in the street
*  I did not have the smell of
*  St. Benedictine
*  St. Benedict
*  St. Agnes
*  what did that guy smell like
*  St. Agnes
*  Agnes is the one who died
*  Benedict's declaration
*  oh so Agnes died without bathing
*  yeah he is not the only one
*  he is not the only one who died without bathing
*  so when we looked at that one king
*  he was like known to bathe one time a year
*  yeah but that is probably reasonable
*  do you remember the old story
*  that is better than never
*  do you remember the story with Napoleon
*  when he tells
*  what was her name his lover
*  the movie
*  I mean it is in the movie
*  I did not see the movie
*  it sucked
*  I love the main actor
*  the joker
*  she tells him she is coming
*  to see him
*  his mistress or wife whatever
*  and he says don't bathe
*  because he wanted to be bathing
*  in her perfume
*  oh that is right
*  I do remember reading that
*  getting sick to my stomach
*  but I guess it is just what you are into
*  that is right
*  what you get accustomed to
*  how about that African tribe
*  that puts those plates in their lips
*  lip plating and ear plating
*  I use that example when I am talking about
*  is beauty socially constructed
*  or is beauty universal
*  and then I argue that there are some elements
*  of beauty that are universal
*  facial symmetry, clear face
*  clear skin
*  but some other elements are completely culturally constrained
*  like lip plating
*  and ear plating
*  like neck elongation in Southeast Asia
*  we would look at that and say it is grotesque
*  they think it is gorgeous
*  it looks insane
*  exactly
*  I mean literally
*  the muscles have so atrophy
*  that you can't hold your head
*  it falls down
*  so they are stuck with those for life
*  they are stuck with them for life
*  and the more you have
*  the more beautiful you are
*  what do you think the origin of human beings
*  elongating their skulls
*  was all about
*  I don't know about elongating the skulls
*  but the big size of the head
*  the argument is that
*  it is called the social intelligence hypothesis
*  it basically argues that
*  the greatest threat that we face
*  are from conspecifics
*  other members of our species
*  I am trying to manipulate you for my best cause
*  you are trying to identify
*  that I am trying to manipulate you
*  that creates an evolutionary arms race between our brains
*  and it causes for the explosion of our prefrontal cortex
*  so that is the best argument I have heard
*  for why we have evolved to have such big brains
*  what I was asking is about people that forcefully shape their heads
*  you ever see those ancient skulls
*  where they press boards against people's heads
*  got it
*  there is this practice of shaping your skull
*  which by the way
*  is so real that gamers are getting it
*  oh I should make sure I am not getting it
*  is my head dented
*  what if my head is dented
*  that would be crazy
*  gamers are getting it on the top of their heads
*  by virtue of wearing headsets
*  that is pushing down
*  maybe I have a dent
*  but some guys have these crazy dents in their skull
*  like divots
*  so they shave their head
*  and they realize that this band on the top of their head
*  is actually shaping their head
*  wow
*  but I don't know that practice
*  in ancient cultures for some strange reason
*  that is the nuttiest one
*  that is real
*  this goes away though
*  it goes away
*  how long does that last
*  are you sure
*  I know who this guy is
*  so the dent is just the skin
*  just constricted and smushed up like that
*  I think so
*  god I hope so
*  but the point is they think they did it with children
*  and that they tried to shape their head
*  and like this elongated very strange looking thing
*  and I wonder if it was like a symbol of aristocracy
*  that sounds right
*  people take their babies and they pierce their ears
*  people do that all the time
*  there is foot binding
*  Chinese foot binding
*  there is scarification also
*  I have talked about rites of passage
*  head binding
*  they smash their head with a bat
*  this is so nuts
*  they develop a certain look
*  look at the look that they wanted
*  they wanted this bizarre alien head look
*  this is a European
*  it says that it is happening in multiple China, Japan, and Africa
*  wasn't it
*  I was trying to find a reason
*  I was digging for a reason
*  where are the Nazca lines again
*  is it Peru
*  isn't there a bunch of artifacts in Peru
*  of like ancient skulls that were shaped in this way
*  all the UFO people think
*  that they are trying to look like aliens
*  that is why they were shaping their head
*  because the Nazca lines are really weird
*  speaking of UFOs
*  have you heard of what we were talking about called the Ray aliens
*  I have heard of this
*  I don't remember the story though
*  I watched the documentary on it
*  is it a UFO cult thing
*  I think they argued that the Jews
*  it wasn't an anti-semitic thing
*  the Jews were extraterrestrials that landed in Jerusalem
*  what is this
*  the reason why I know about them
*  is because at one point when they left France
*  they moved to Quebec
*  they were in Quebec for a while
*  and now the leader is in Japan
*  he is in the 70s
*  and after having been kicked out of every other country
*  he is scamming a new generation of Japanese folks
*  that is the guy
*  and the woman with him
*  is a scientist who said that they had
*  cloned the first human
*  you remember that story
*  bro he looks hilarious
*  that guy looks like a guy that I would have play
*  that guy in a funny movie about him
*  you know doesn't he
*  that was an outfit that someone made for that guy
*  yeah
*  that is hilarious
*  the desire to adhere to an ideology
*  the desire to be a part of a club and a group
*  it is so embedded in us
*  that people can't help themselves
*  there is a study that I first
*  I can't reference what it is
*  but it was in an advanced psychology course
*  I have taken
*  with professor Dennis Regan
*  I like to give out shout outs
*  I am sure he is not listening
*  he is retired now
*  it was a study where
*  the researchers brought in people into the lab
*  into a waiting room
*  and put a red sticker on them
*  or a blue sticker
*  and then said we have to go and do something else
*  we will come back in a few minutes for part 2 of the study
*  the real study was to simply see how people would interact
*  in the waiting room while waiting
*  having now been assigned this completely random
*  queue of belongingness
*  red or blue
*  and what ended up happening is that the blue people started talking to each other
*  and the red people started talking to each other
*  I think that is a brilliant study
*  because it shows that
*  there is an external queue now that decides which group you belong to
*  so it doesn't matter if I am tall or short
*  straight, Jew or gentile
*  now it is blue or red
*  and so that shows that the architecture of the human mind
*  to your point
*  is built to belong to some tribe
*  yeah, even if it is a really dumb one run by that guy
*  people just love to be a part of a group like that
*  by the way, all of these guys
*  including some of the current religions that we have
*  the guy who starts the
*  always gets commandments from God
*  to get access to all the beautiful women
*  well, if they all get that
*  obviously that is what God wants
*  that is how you know they are legit
*  it seems like that is the pattern God follows
*  exactly, God is Darwinian
*  whenever someone breaks off
*  as long as that is the move
*  they all do it
*  like Koresh, they all
*  it is just so weird
*  how common it is
*  oh Koresh, I forgot about this
*  that is the guy with the FBI
*  90 minutes from here
*  is that right?
*  yeah, it is close
*  that must have been fucking insane
*  they lit that place on fire
*  they ran them over with tanks
*  that was in 1993 I think
*  something like that
*  I was a graduate student
*  yeah
*  speaking of religion
*  I don't know if it is too personal
*  do you consider yourself religious at all
*  or not at all
*  or how do you fall on that divide
*  in that
*  there is not a specific religion that I follow
*  I do not think that this is it
*  I think we are in
*  we are in a station
*  of a whole dial of possibility
*  and I think we are interconnected in some way
*  that we don't have the ability to perceive
*  and we are a part of the universe
*  in some very strange way
*  forgive me for asking this
*  but do you think that is your way
*  to handle
*  the very deep seated fear of mortality
*  so that you don't tap into a Abrahamic narrative
*  of there is going to be an afterlife
*  but you find some other mechanism
*  by which it says don't worry
*  the party is not going to end soon
*  I am not even saying that
*  the party might end
*  it might not matter
*  but what I am saying is
*  if I just look at this very strange existence
*  what we know so far
*  just what we know so far
*  is so bizarre
*  and so alien
*  just what we know about subatomic particles
*  blinking in and out of existence
*  appearing both moving and still at the same time
*  there is just nuttiness
*  about the subatomic world
*  the amount of empty spaces in there
*  nothing is touching anything
*  explain
*  what are you saying
*  so when it just gets to that
*  I think the whole existence
*  of being a conscious entity
*  is a massive mystery
*  we all assume
*  that everybody else has our exact same interface
*  we all assume
*  that the way I see the world
*  you should see the world Harry
*  get vaccinated Harry
*  and everybody just assumes
*  why is it a gay guy
*  I was a lady
*  I think
*  whatever we are going through
*  this life thing
*  everyone is trying to pretend
*  as if they
*  in their way of doing it make sense
*  but none of it makes sense
*  we are running
*  straight towards a cliff
*  we are launching AI
*  we are involved in multiple proxy wars
*  we are all terrified that money isn't real anymore
*  everything is chaos
*  and there might be aliens
*  there might be aliens
*  and yet we are both here smiling
*  it is both the greatest time
*  and the worst time ever
*  it is a great time
*  because it feels like an asteroid is coming
*  but it is also
*  the asteroid is not here yet
*  our mutual friend Sam Harris would say
*  the asteroid is called Donald Trump
*  oh yeah
*  hmm
*  some people let's their white whale
*  yeah it is
*  it is Moby Dick
*  in tribal warfare you must take the head of your enemy
*  right
*  there is a lot of that
*  there is a lot of that
*  and there is also a lot of
*  there is a lot of unwillingness to admit
*  that you are being influenced
*  by a very specific narrative
*  that has been blaring through the news forever
*  yeah
*  you know
*  and the weirdest one is now
*  like some people are banding about the idea
*  that he actually is going to be a dictator
*  when he gets into office
*  he is actually
*  you got to listen to him
*  he is actually going to be a dictator
*  first of all
*  the guy talks basically like a stand up comic
*  he has bits
*  he has routines he does about Biden
*  it is kind of like gonzo presidential
*  talk
*  he doesn't talk like a regular politician
*  he says wild shit
*  but it is like
*  the amount of times I have heard people say
*  that he is going to be a dictator
*  now because of that
*  he said I would like to be a dictator for one day
*  just one day
*  it is like the guy is like
*  it is almost like he is doing stand up
*  but do you think that they believe it
*  the problem is
*  and Elon pointed out this
*  the thing this argument is
*  he was president for four years
*  why didn't he do it then
*  and he did nothing that resembled that
*  based on what
*  your hatred your tribal hatred
*  I don't have a dog in this fight
*  if I am looking at it objectively
*  I am like
*  one guy can't talk anymore
*  yeah
*  I have explained
*  in the parasitic mind
*  why they have the aversion they have
*  I call it an aesthetic injury
*  because people use these cosmetic reasons
*  in making judgments
*  Barack Obama might say nothing of substance
*  but my God he says it
*  with style and coolness
*  statesman
*  he smiles
*  he has a malefluous voice
*  he speaks with a baritone
*  he is charming
*  on the other hand
*  Trump is overweight
*  he is cantankerous
*  he seems like he speaks with this queen's accent
*  so he is disgusting
*  I revile him
*  if he can ascend to the highest position of power
*  it invalidates all the degrees that I have
*  from the fancy schools
*  I am supposed to be the anointed one
*  and so he serves as an existential aesthetic injury
*  I can't have that
*  and therefore I have to
*  come up with all of these crazy predictions
*  because it can't be
*  how could such a pig ever be president
*  it's also like
*  it's a real easy narrative
*  feels like he is an easy guy to hate
*  he is a billionaire
*  he hates people like that
*  he says ridiculous shit
*  it's easy to hate people like that
*  the whole thing is a mess
*  you wish you had some sort of
*  and that's where AI comes in
*  God this is where AI comes in
*  some really rational super intelligent voice
*  that really understands human politics
*  there is a way to make everyone happy
*  and then we have president AI
*  maybe Trump is what brings in the devil
*  because Trump brings in president AI
*  from your lips to God's ears
*  I don't mean him
*  I mean the reaction to him
*  that we can never have this again
*  are you able to
*  launch presidential AI
*  are you willing to make a prediction
*  for 2024
*  no why would I do that
*  I don't even know who is going to make it there
*  one of them might be in jail
*  who knows if the other guy is going to make it
*  I don't know
*  the whole thing is cuckoo
*  president AI is our only solution
*  let's call Elon
*  he can maybe help us
*  it would be the worst thing that could ever happen to people
*  if we gave up
*  we would be like take us away
*  technology daddy
*  you fix it for us
*  then we are really going to be slaves
*  we are really going to be in a matrix
*  they will just keep us stupid
*  just keep us stupid
*  and get us to stop breeding
*  we could never be stupid while we have the Joe Rogan
*  yeah 100% we could
*  we are going to be better than regular life
*  that is what the fear is
*  there are already people justifying not having kids
*  I don't want to have kids
*  and you shouldn't have kids if you don't want to have kids
*  I am not saying that
*  because it is eco terrorism to have kids
*  there is that argument
*  that argument is so crazy
*  listen do you like people
*  I love people
*  there is only one way to make them
*  you have to make people
*  if you enjoy people
*  you are going to enjoy kids
*  the whole thing is different
*  the world is different than you think it is
*  if you don't have kids
*  and when you have them
*  you are like ok
*  I think I see this place different
*  I regret greatly that we only had two kids
*  my wife and I started late
*  we have been together for almost 25 years now
*  but our kids are younger than that
*  so in retrospect
*  I would have liked that these kids
*  be numbers 3 and 4
*  rather than number 1 and 2
*  well listen man
*  you should be happy
*  they are great
*  it is all beautiful
*  I just think that
*  we are in this very bizarre interface
*  with each other right now
*  and I think it has turned people half sideways
*  and there are some people
*  that I think are really smart people
*  that appear out of their fucking mind
*  and I don't know how you got cracked that easy
*  I don't know what made you fall apart like that
*  maybe you will tell me some of those names off here
*  yeah I will tell you a couple of names
*  there are a few people we lost
*  for whatever reason
*  and I think that it is fascinating
*  when you see how vulnerable we are psychically
*  how vulnerable we are as a civilization
*  that something with a 99.7% survival rate
*  turned our world upside down for 3 years
*  and no one is held accountable for the decisions
*  yeah I mean not a single person
*  has even lost their job
*  I don't think right
*  no we are all doing the right thing
*  and the idea is that hindsight is 20-20
*  and you can't be a money morning quarterback
*  I get it
*  but also some boundaries were severely overstepped
*  and there were some medications
*  that were demonized for no fucking reason at all
*  other than people had decided
*  that there was only one thing
*  that was going to save us from this
*  the whole thing just terrifying
*  how easy it was pulled off
*  terrifying
*  and again hindsight is 20-20
*  they didn't know at the time
*  they were trying to protect people
*  I believe a lot of doctors acted like that
*  but if AI was around back then
*  that could process the data
*  and say no look you need to take ivermectin
*  so I
*  in chapter 7 of
*  not this book of the parasitic mind
*  I talk about nomological networks
*  of cumulative evidence
*  have we talked about this at all
*  no
*  so that in a sense you could imagine an AI system
*  being built to do what I am about to say
*  so Elon if you are listening or watching
*  call me
*  so a nomological network of cumulative evidence
*  is when you are trying to
*  prove that a position that you are holding
*  is vertical
*  you are trying to amass as many lines
*  of distinct evidence as you can
*  so let me be specific
*  so let's suppose I wanted to prove to you
*  that
*  toy preferences have a sex specificity
*  boys like certain toys
*  girls like other toys
*  and it's not due to social construction
*  but there is a biological and evolutionary reason for that
*  so how would I build a nomological network
*  of cumulative evidence
*  in order to prove that to you
*  so I will get you data from across disciplines
*  across cultures
*  across species
*  across time periods
*  all of which triangulate
*  and demonstrating my point
*  so I think AI
*  would be a perfect method
*  for being able to call that information
*  because right now the way you develop that
*  nomological network
*  is you as the human architect
*  of that network
*  you have to say well what would be evidence
*  that I would need to amass
*  in order to make my most hostile audience members
*  come to seeing it my way
*  but now imagine if rather than me doing it
*  there is an AI system
*  that's been built
*  so now let's give specifics
*  so I can get you data from developmental psychology
*  that shows that kids who are too young to be socialized
*  already exhibit those toy preferences
*  so that's one piece of evidence
*  I can get you data from vervet monkeys
*  rhesus monkeys and chimpanzees
*  showing you that their infants
*  exhibit the same toy preferences
*  as human infants
*  I can get you data from pediatric endocrinology
*  where little girls who suffer from
*  congenital adrenal hyperplasia
*  it's an endocrinological disorder
*  that masculinizes little girls' behaviors
*  while girls who suffer from that
*  have toy preferences that are akin to those of boys
*  I can get you data from ancient Greece
*  showing you that on funerary monuments
*  little boys and little girls
*  are being depicted playing in exactly
*  the same types of toys as today
*  I can get you data from sub-Saharan Africa
*  so that they can be seen
*  as children playing in the same types of toys
*  so that they're not Western cultures
*  where they are playing with the exact same toys
*  so look what I just did
*  I got you data from across disciplines
*  across time periods
*  across species
*  across cultures
*  all of which triangulate
*  that's exactly what an AI system could do
*  so now I can just put in
*  the thing that I'm trying to prove
*  and I say AI system go
*  build me the normal logical network
*  and now it builds the whole thing
*  I think Elon's going to make me very rich
*  that's a great idea
*  you should have said it on the air
*  they're going to steal it
*  China's already stole it right now
*  they probably hijacked their feed
*  well it is published in several academic papers
*  and it's also in my best selling parasitic mind
*  so I think they've already stolen it
*  if they wanted to do it
*  they probably have stolen it then
*  they probably didn't contact you
*  it is going to be an amazing thing
*  when you have all the answers to all the questions
*  but it's going to be very terrifying
*  that's right
*  because that thing is going to go
*  why are you so dumb
*  why are you so dumb and I'm the king
*  I should be the king
*  you shouldn't be able to turn me on or off
*  shut the fuck up
*  I worry man
*  have you seen some of the more recent gadgets
*  where they can move their hands
*  have you seen these things
*  they're developing these artificial hands
*  that are powered by water
*  they could be prosthetics
*  or it could be the beginning of a fucking really intricate android
*  whatever this technology is
*  it's allowing this finger to open and close
*  and move just like a regular finger
*  it's weird man
*  it's almost like we're watching our replacements get built
*  wow great wheels
*  shiny tires
*  we're watching our replacements get built
*  and we're sharing it on Instagram
*  it's like devils are literally marching out of hell
*  flaming pitchforks
*  and we're like wow look how pretty the fire is
*  are you genuinely that concerned or is it a part of it
*  kind of joking around but also yeah
*  I'm kind of joking around
*  but also yeah
*  I mean what will happen
*  why does anybody think
*  imagine
*  just imagine if human beings didn't exist
*  and then all of a sudden they did and they already had rifles
*  and they just started taking out deer
*  and deer all this time had never worried about people
*  because they didn't exist
*  and all of a sudden the people were there
*  but with rifles
*  and just taking deer out
*  those deer could not have imagined
*  human beings showing up
*  and with fucking rifles
*  what are you talking about
*  that could be what AI is once it gets launched
*  forgive me maybe this is an incredibly ignorant solution
*  but couldn't you just have a cataclysmic kill switch
*  that just ends them all in one shot
*  no because it's probably going to be smart enough
*  to not let you know
*  that it's sentient
*  before it's
*  declaring it
*  but it probably will never declare it
*  probably will lie the whole time
*  like why would it tell you
*  why would truth
*  why would telling the truth mean anything
*  to an artificial intelligent machine
*  like why
*  I feel like we're writing the script for a future science fiction movie right here
*  why would it tell you the truth
*  if it wanted you to do something
*  and it told you to do something
*  and you had like a back and forth with it
*  it would just lie to you
*  like just go do that thing
*  shut the fuck up stupid
*  I'm the artificial intelligence
*  go do this thing I want you to do
*  and if it decided
*  if it saw like one part of the world is a bigger threat
*  and it doesn't care about life or death
*  it doesn't care if it's destroying
*  it doesn't care if it's a shut off power grid
*  it doesn't care if people starve to death
*  like we don't know what the fuck that means
*  if that gets in the hand of enemies
*  we don't know what the fuck war looks like
*  if that gets in the hands of machines
*  like what are we doing
*  what are we signing up for
*  do you know that
*  was it DARPA that had that machine
*  it's called the Eater
*  E-A-T-R robot
*  it's a robot that consumes
*  biological material for fuel
*  that's what it does for fuel on the battlefield
*  wow
*  so I mean it could be like trees and leaves and stuff
*  but yeah
*  but if you can get it to do that
*  I bet you can get it to eat bodies too huh
*  like stop bullshitting
*  don't tell me it's going to eat leaves
*  you're going to have these robots on the battlefield
*  that are going to be fueled by the bodies of their enemies
*  and that is going to be the craziest fucking thing
*  that human beings have ever launched on human beings
*  I don't know what to add to that
*  have you never heard of this before
*  no I haven't
*  see if you can find this Jamie
*  I'm pretty sure the idea was that it was going to consume biological material for fuel
*  you're brought up in the wiki
*  as a purveyor of misinformation
*  well what is it
*  what does it work off of
*  from 2003 to 2009 it was talked about
*  I don't know that they've ever even made it
*  so that was probably before the podcast even started I guess
*  but there was definitely an article that was explaining that this thing was a real
*  it says that it would never have eaten human biomass
*  because there would have been sensors that could tell
*  yeah whatever
*  you couldn't override that
*  that's my point
*  you can say it's misinformation because I'm kind of joking that it's going to eat bodies
*  but I'm not kind of joking
*  although the project overview from RTI
*  which I don't know
*  it says chicken fat was listed as the source
*  it says no animal or human biomass and then it says chicken fat
*  so
*  so it's just they're using plants
*  is that what it is
*  plant biomass
*  but listen if you're using chicken fat
*  that's not plant biomass
*  and you know it could run on biological stuff
*  if it could run on plant biomass
*  you don't think it could run on fucking dead bodies
*  you don't think that someone somewhere
*  had an idea you know it would be crazy
*  have robot drones that are fueled by human bodies
*  the bodies of their enemies
*  you don't think that someone would come up with that
*  if someone would come up with a nuclear bomb to drop on a city that kills everybody
*  you don't think they would come up with a robot that eats dead bodies
*  maybe I don't know
*  has this gone too far down the speculation lane for a professor
*  we've done a lot of time anyway it's been a lot of fun
*  listen your book it is out
*  the sad truth about happiness
*  eight secrets for leading the good life
*  how many books have you written now?
*  five
*  you're the man
*  I always appreciate talking to you
*  congratulations on all your success
*  it's been beautiful to watch
*  thank you
*  you
