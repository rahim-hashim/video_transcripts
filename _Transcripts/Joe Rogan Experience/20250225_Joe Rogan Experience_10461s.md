# Joe Rogan Experience #2278 - Chase Hughes
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5.82s)]
*  We're debuting these mugs. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=16.16s)]
*  My friend turkeymerc on Instagram sent me these Cheshire cat mugs. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=17.92s)]
*  Isn't that badass? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=21.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's really good. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=22.72s)]
*  I thought it'd be good for you because we're talking about mind fucks. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=23.72s)]
*  Cheshire cat's a little bit of a mind fuck. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=27.72s)]
*  In the simulation. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=29.6s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=30.6s)]
*  So you were just telling me that you had a brain disease. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=33.32s)]
*  And you, what did you do to fix it? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=39.32s)]
*  So I. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=42.88s)]
*  What was it first of all? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  It's temporal epilepsy with mesial temporal sclerosis. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  When did you develop this? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  We don't know, but I started having seizures like a few years ago and everybody in my family [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  knows I'm a neuroscientist. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=57.64s)]
*  I say with a lowercase n, not a PhD neuroscientist, but. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=59.64s)]
*  But you studied neuroscience. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=63.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=65.0s)]
*  I had post grad at Harvard and Duke, but they assumed, you know, Chase has studied all this [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=66.0s)]
*  stuff. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=72.56s)]
*  He's going to know if he's having seizures, but these seizures come with amnesia. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=73.56s)]
*  So I didn't remember that I was having any of them. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=78.54s)]
*  And this was like three years ago. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=80.6s)]
*  I had retired from the military and then started having these seizures. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=81.76s)]
*  So then I found a neurologist, the drug that they gave me, the number one side effect was [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=86.56s)]
*  seizures from this pharmaceutical company. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=92.78s)]
*  So I kind of looked around and I found this guy's a functional medicine guy and he got [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=98.16s)]
*  me on methylene blue to start off. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=103.36s)]
*  And I know Mel Gibson was on here talking about it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=106.84s)]
*  And that instantly stopped everything. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=109.88s)]
*  That stuff was a fabric dye, right? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, in 1890. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  How weird. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  Who the fuck drank it first? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=121.44000000000001s)]
*  Who's that guy? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=123.44000000000001s)]
*  Make blue jeans out of that? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  Huh. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  What do it taste like? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=128.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=129.8s)]
*  What if I drink it every day if it affects my health? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=130.8s)]
*  It tastes like chewing an ass. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=133.12s)]
*  I'd take it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=135.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=136.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=137.0s)]
*  I take it every day as well. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=138.0s)]
*  Yeah, R.F.K. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=139.0s)]
*  Jr. told me about it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=140.0s)]
*  Yeah, man, it's fantastic. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=141.0s)]
*  So this guy's injecting, in 1890, injects these rats with it and then does an autopsy [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=142.2s)]
*  on these things. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=146.74s)]
*  And their brain, the brain stem, every single nerve is blue. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=148.52s)]
*  So he discovered this methylene blue has an affinity for neuronal tissue. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=153.08s)]
*  So he says, well, it's sucking into neurons. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=157.86s)]
*  What's it doing? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=160.48s)]
*  So we could talk about if you want to, but how it's working and working in the body. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=161.48s)]
*  So we started putting it in humans and we found out it's an MAOI, which is just- [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=167.28s)]
*  Monoamine Oxide Inhibitor. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=172.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=174.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=175.52s)]
*  Which helps with depression and anxiety and all kinds of life stress and stuff. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=176.52s)]
*  Does it cause side effects if you're taking any drug that you shouldn't take with an MAOI? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=180.48s)]
*  There are some studies that have been recalled that said you can't take it with SSRIs because [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=186.28s)]
*  you could develop serotonin syndrome. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=192.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=194.16s)]
*  And I did recall the studies as far as I'm aware. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=195.16s)]
*  And it is so incredible that it acts as an electron donor to mitochondria, especially [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=198.12s)]
*  your neuronal mitochondria. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=205.26s)]
*  So it helps you produce more ATP and it helps you get rid of the stuff called reactive oxygen [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=208.14s)]
*  species. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=213.76s)]
*  So you have an oxygen molecule that should have two hydrogens on it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=214.76s)]
*  And like your body's job is to convert stuff into water so you can pee it out. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=217.6s)]
*  So if you get an oxygen molecule, it's got four, five, one, it's a reactive oxygen, which [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=222.08s)]
*  we call free radicals. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=227.54000000000002s)]
*  So methylene blue goes in there and balances a lot of those things out in your brain and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  your nervous system. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=234.28s)]
*  So it is a miracle and it's been proven for 100 years. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=235.52s)]
*  It's one of the most well-proven drugs out there. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=240.28s)]
*  What's the side effects of it? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=243.44s)]
*  Are there any? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=244.44s)]
*  Not a bunch. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=245.44s)]
*  I would imagine if you're taking an MAOI, there's wild shit going on there. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=247.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=253.04s)]
*  Like if you mix it with anything that has metyramine in it, like aged cheeses, red wine, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=254.04s)]
*  you're not supposed to mix it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=262.08s)]
*  If you're on a high dose though, but you're probably taking one milligram per kilogram [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=263.08s)]
*  and you weigh probably 75 kilograms. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=267.64s)]
*  What's that weight? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=270.12s)]
*  What's 75 kilograms? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=271.12s)]
*  You're probably 189, 190? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=272.12s)]
*  Close. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=273.12s)]
*  Yeah, pretty close. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=274.12s)]
*  So you're about to sit? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=275.8s)]
*  A little heavier than that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=276.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=277.8s)]
*  So you take maybe 40 milligrams a day to 80 milligrams a day. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=278.8s)]
*  You put it in water, is that what you do? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=283.4s)]
*  No, I have these little trokes. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=284.8s)]
*  It's like the consistency of a starburst. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=286.44s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=288.4s)]
*  And you just cut them up and they're 40 milligrams each. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=289.8s)]
*  You obviously got to swallow them really quick or your teeth are going to be blue for an [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=292.92s)]
*  entire day. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=296.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=297.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's a pretty potent dye. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=298.52s)]
*  I see it in my pee. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=299.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=300.52s)]
*  Well, I had to change the toilets in my house to black toilets because my kids take it, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=301.79999999999995s)]
*  my wife takes it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  Jesus, everybody takes it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=308.59999999999997s)]
*  But like if you go to a party and you forget to flush, everybody just thinks that there's [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  blue stuff in it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=313.52s)]
*  It's one of those supplements that I take. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=314.52s)]
*  I'm like, are you sure? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=315.76s)]
*  Like every time I take it, I'm like, are you fucking sure? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=317.44s)]
*  Like I drink it in water. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=319.68s)]
*  I take a little eye dropper and I squirt it in water and drink it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=320.68s)]
*  No, Gary Breckett told me about it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=324.35999999999996s)]
*  I should correct that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=325.68s)]
*  He told me to take it with red light therapy. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=326.68s)]
*  That's what it was about. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=330.2s)]
*  Did he tell you why, why it all works? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=331.68s)]
*  He probably did, but I probably forgot. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=334.96s)]
*  Why does it work for red light therapy? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=337.32s)]
*  So anything that's blue means that it absorbs red and reflects blue light. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=340.8s)]
*  So if you're in a red light therapy machine, all your neurons are soaking up way more red [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=346.64s)]
*  light than they otherwise would without methylene. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=351.88s)]
*  Oh. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=355.4s)]
*  So it's fantastic. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=356.64s)]
*  It's like 600x the effectiveness of red light therapy. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=357.64s)]
*  I'm making that up, but it is a significant increase. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=361.04s)]
*  Where does it to be essentially a brain expert and get a brain disease? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  It was horrifying because I know where this is going to go. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  Your hippocampus, your memory center of your brain is eating itself. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=377.08s)]
*  And during a seizure, you can lose up to about a million neurons a second. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=382.04s)]
*  And the seizures were like a minute and a half long. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=386.6s)]
*  They're not like shaking on the floor, a temporal lobe seizure. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=388.8s)]
*  You're just kind of like, you're just out, like you're unconscious. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=390.96s)]
*  You just seize up like Mitch McConnell. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=394.52s)]
*  Yeah, like you turn into a little zombie, your head falls down. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=396.47999999999996s)]
*  At the end of the day, I tried so many different things to fix it and stop these seizures. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=401.28s)]
*  I was at a point of nine seizures a day. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=407.68s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=409.71999999999997s)]
*  And I was desperate. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  And you think this is because of the medication that they gave you that caused the seizures? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=412.32s)]
*  Or is this just a... [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=415.56s)]
*  I never took it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=416.56s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=417.8s)]
*  So you had seizures, but the medication, why would they give you something that has a side [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=418.8s)]
*  effect of seizures? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=423.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=426.76s)]
*  If you're getting seizures. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=427.76s)]
*  And I don't know why they're... [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=428.76s)]
*  I mean, you hear so much about these medical schools getting paid off by companies and [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=430.68s)]
*  stuff that don't really have our best interests at heart. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=435.28s)]
*  And I think that Methylene Blue, you shouldn't have to tell a doctor about Methylene Blue. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=440.04s)]
*  I think everybody should know about it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=444.4s)]
*  And you can get it on Amazon. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=445.96s)]
*  I get mine from this company called Mitozen. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=447.84s)]
*  And it's fantastic. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=450.47999999999996s)]
*  And it's changed my life. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=452.76s)]
*  I would have been gone by now. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=455.08s)]
*  What's the root cause of this disease? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=456.71999999999997s)]
*  Do they know? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=458.28s)]
*  They know what's going on? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=459.28s)]
*  So there's one... [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=460.28s)]
*  There's two factors. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=461.76s)]
*  You have a genetic predisposition. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=462.76s)]
*  So you have this thing in your genes called the APOE4LL. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=465.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=468.15999999999997s)]
*  That's the same thing that causes you to get CTE. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=469.15999999999997s)]
*  And yeah, Alzheimer's. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=471.96s)]
*  And if you have that plus... [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=474.28s)]
*  I shouldn't say causes you, but it's one of those ones where if you get hit in the head [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=476.16s)]
*  a lot, it's not a good thing to have. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=480.2s)]
*  And then I did 20 years in the military. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=482.4s)]
*  So being around explosions and all kinds of gunfire and all that kind of stuff, they said [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=484.6s)]
*  this probably caused some kind of concussive syndrome. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=489.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=493.4s)]
*  That's a real issue, right? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=495.04s)]
*  It's people think of concussions only as like you getting hit, but it's not. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=496.8s)]
*  It's any kind of jolting to your body. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=501.72s)]
*  My friend Mark Gordon works with a lot of soldiers and people with traumatic brain injuries, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=504.52000000000004s)]
*  and he says you can get it from jet skiing, which is really crazy. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=509.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=513.5600000000001s)]
*  Just the bounce? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=514.5600000000001s)]
*  Hard bouncing, the jostling. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=515.5600000000001s)]
*  If you like people who really love jet skiing and do it all the time, they start getting [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=517.64s)]
*  a little bit of CTE. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=521.64s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=523.0s)]
*  Our brain is floating. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=524.0s)]
*  It's neutrally buoyant inside of liquid. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=525.64s)]
*  So that makes sense. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=527.64s)]
*  It's smashing around inside your skull. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=529.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=531.8000000000001s)]
*  It's February. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=532.8000000000001s)]
*  By now, 80% of people have probably abandoned their New Year's resolutions, and it makes [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=533.8399999999999s)]
*  sense. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=538.0799999999999s)]
*  Life can get crazy, and all of a sudden, you don't have the time. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=539.0799999999999s)]
*  But one easy habit to stick with is AG1. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=541.9599999999999s)]
*  It's an easy, realistic habit that you can make to benefit your whole body health. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=545.3599999999999s)]
*  AG1 makes hard to get micronutrients easy to get and replaces multiple vitamins and [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=549.8399999999999s)]
*  supplements with just one scoop. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  You just mix it in some cold water, take a nice moment in the morning to do your body [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=556.9599999999999s)]
*  right, and honestly, it tastes pretty good. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=560.88s)]
*  It's not easy to pack this many high-quality ingredients with this much nutrient density, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=563.48s)]
*  but AG1 makes it happen without added sugars or artificial sweeteners ever. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=568.6400000000001s)]
*  AG1 is a great way to invest in your health now and in the long run, which is why I've [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=573.8800000000001s)]
*  partnered with them for so long. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=578.4000000000001s)]
*  Try AG1 and get a free bottle of vitamin D3, K2, and five free AG1 travel packs with your [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=579.9200000000001s)]
*  first subscription at drinkag1.com. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=586.72s)]
*  That's a $76 value gift for free when you go to drinkag1.com slash joe rogan. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=591.16s)]
*  Check it out. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=597.8399999999999s)]
*  So how did you get involved in, I mean, your space is like, you wrote this book, Behavior [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=598.8399999999999s)]
*  Ops Manual, and you've got a lot of stuff online, like how to motivate yourself and [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=605.92s)]
*  discipline yourself. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=611.16s)]
*  And that's how I found out about you. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=612.16s)]
*  Some of the different videos that I thought were really insightful about how to sort of [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=615.0s)]
*  schedule progress in whatever you're trying to accomplish in your life, how to set things [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=621.6s)]
*  out. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=625.84s)]
*  How did you get involved in all this kind of stuff? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=626.84s)]
*  It's a story, I mean, I was 19 years old stationed in Pearl Harbor. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=628.36s)]
*  I got turned down by a girl one night and I went home and I typed in, how to tell when [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=633.12s)]
*  girls like you on the internet. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=637.52s)]
*  I printed out like a two-foot stack of shit just to read through because I didn't want [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=642.04s)]
*  to be rejected again. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=647.04s)]
*  So that's hilarious. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=648.92s)]
*  I got into this body language stuff and then it was just behavior. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=650.1999999999999s)]
*  And the more I could kind of see somebody's insecurities and when somebody was stressed [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=654.36s)]
*  and the little fears that are hiding behind behaviors, like it made them human to me. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=658.64s)]
*  So I think I had some social anxiety and me being able to kind of see behind that mask, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=663.68s)]
*  I wasn't judging anybody, but it was like, wow, they're messed up too. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=668.04s)]
*  So I kind of got addicted to that and I just rode this line down this behavior path. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=671.9399999999999s)]
*  And I got obsessed with studying all this behavior and a friend of mine was killed on [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=677.2s)]
*  USS Cole during the terrorist attack in 2001. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=682.04s)]
*  September 11th, Cole got attacked in the Gulf of Yemen. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=686.48s)]
*  And I was like reading these intelligence reports afterward that said there's failures [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=690.0s)]
*  on the ground, we didn't develop assets in the country, we didn't take the actions that [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=695.6s)]
*  we needed to take to get this intelligence. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=699.44s)]
*  And I was like, man, they need this behavior stuff. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=702.32s)]
*  So I got more and more obsessed with it and I started training people in the government [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=705.36s)]
*  probably around the age of 30 or so. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=709.0s)]
*  And that was like just a few years before I retired at 38. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=712.16s)]
*  And the novelty still hasn't worn off for me. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=715.6s)]
*  I'm still obsessed with that field of study. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=718.5600000000001s)]
*  So were you trained to train people? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=721.08s)]
*  Like how did you go about starting to train people? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=723.64s)]
*  What was it based on? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=726.0s)]
*  It was me. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=727.92s)]
*  The first group of people I trained was a car dealership just to see if I could do it. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=730.32s)]
*  I said, I'm going to go in there and do it for free. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=734.0s)]
*  And then I started training people in the military. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=737.12s)]
*  And these are US Navy and other branches. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=740.36s)]
*  And I'm training them in like these, I got obsessed with this interrogation stuff and [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=745.16s)]
*  how the brain works. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=749.96s)]
*  And I mostly got obsessed with if I'm an intelligence officer, my job is to convince somebody to [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=751.44s)]
*  do something that's not in their best interest. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=756.72s)]
*  Like I need to convince you to spy for your own country and give us intelligence. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=759.6s)]
*  Or if I'm an interrogator, I need to convince you to confess to a crime. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=763.6s)]
*  So I spent time hanging out with people that do cult recruiting out in California. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=767.52s)]
*  There's like official people? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=772.36s)]
*  Like human resources for cult recruiting? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=776.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=778.04s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=779.04s)]
*  Like how to do cults hire them? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=780.04s)]
*  No, I think they join the cult and the cult says, well, this guy's really charismatic. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=782.04s)]
*  Or he was a, I think half of these dudes were like ex club promoters. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=786.74s)]
*  They got that vibe, you know, like, which come by tonight. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=792.36s)]
*  And I spent time in San Bernardino with a couple of people, three or four people, three [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=796.48s)]
*  people that talked people, women into doing adult films, like young girls that were 19, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=801.76s)]
*  20 years old, just starting college. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=808.16s)]
*  And I talked and I asked them, what are the methods that you use? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=811.0s)]
*  What are the steps that you follow? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=814.88s)]
*  And I watched several of these interactions and then spent time with interrogators and [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=816.04s)]
*  people who do like timeshare sales and stuff like that, which I don't know if you've ever [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=821.08s)]
*  been at a timeshare sales. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=824.44s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=826.32s)]
*  They're hardcore. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=827.52s)]
*  So I spent time with all these people and I wanted to figure out what are the elements [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=830.2s)]
*  that make somebody willing to do something that is maybe not in their best interest. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=834.0s)]
*  And that transformed everything for me. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=839.2s)]
*  And then I said, we could use all of this stuff from Manchurian candidates, which we [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=841.84s)]
*  can get into if you want to, to whatever, to help people instead of to do the opposite. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=847.36s)]
*  So I could use the same technique to help a person instead of get them to confess to [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=853.4000000000001s)]
*  a crime, because it's just a brain. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=858.5200000000001s)]
*  I'm not learning about interrogation or cult recruiting or anything. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=860.84s)]
*  I'm just learning where are these little loopholes in the brain? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=863.36s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=866.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=868.4000000000001s)]
*  So what cults were these people recruiting people for? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=869.4000000000001s)]
*  I can't talk about it. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=873.2s)]
*  You can't say the name of the cults? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=874.4200000000001s)]
*  How many different people did you talk to that were cult recruiters? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=876.12s)]
*  Six. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=878.72s)]
*  Six. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=879.72s)]
*  So there's more than six. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=880.72s)]
*  How many cults are there active right now? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=881.72s)]
*  It was two. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=882.72s)]
*  There were two cults. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=883.72s)]
*  Two cults, six recruiters. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=884.72s)]
*  Yep. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=885.72s)]
*  I call them, I would call them cults, but. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=886.72s)]
*  I call a lot of things cults, so throw that word around freely. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=889.2s)]
*  And these guys were just, they had that little Bill Clinton energy. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=895.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=899.88s)]
*  They just kind of captivated the person they were talking to in this little bubble. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=900.88s)]
*  They were all about you. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=903.5600000000001s)]
*  They were really interested in you. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=904.84s)]
*  I heard Tom Cruise is awesome at that. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=906.48s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=909.12s)]
*  I heard when you talk to him, you're like the only person in the room. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=910.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=912.6s)]
*  And it's just that, tell me more. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=913.6s)]
*  Tell me more. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=915.6s)]
*  Tell me about your mom. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=916.6s)]
*  And you get that, they all had that quality to them. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=919.24s)]
*  But one of the things that all of them had, the one trait that I think all of those guys [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=923.8000000000001s)]
*  had was they could get you to deviate off of your baseline really quick. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=927.46s)]
*  So if you were, they can get you to curse. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=933.6s)]
*  That's step one. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=936.16s)]
*  They get you to say something that's a little bit outside of a social norm. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=937.16s)]
*  They would all do that as step one. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=941.22s)]
*  Every single time. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=945.2s)]
*  Huh. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=946.6s)]
*  So what would, like in the cults, how would they do that? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=947.6s)]
*  What would they try to get you to deviate from? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=950.44s)]
*  What would they try to get you to do? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=952.64s)]
*  So in the, their goal was to get you to agree to join the cult. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=955.5600000000001s)]
*  So if I can get you to do something that's outside of your norm. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=959.36s)]
*  So I use something called elicitation. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=962.0s)]
*  So instead of me asking questions, let's say we get into the back of an Uber and I want [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=965.12s)]
*  to ask the Uber driver to complain about his job. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=968.88s)]
*  Instead of using questions, which are weird, right? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=973.44s)]
*  So like, I'm like, hey, do you like your job? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=975.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=977.92s)]
*  That's weird. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=978.92s)]
*  Yeah, weird. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=979.92s)]
*  It's like saying, hey, how much do you guys make? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=980.92s)]
*  You say, hey, I just read this article the other day. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=982.76s)]
*  It said Uber drivers are the most highest respected people out there and they love their [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=984.6s)]
*  job. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=990.44s)]
*  They love their job satisfaction rating. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=991.8800000000001s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=992.8800000000001s)]
*  And they turn, the guy turns around like what? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=993.8800000000001s)]
*  So you bullshitted them. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=996.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=997.44s)]
*  So just that's called a triggering a need to correct the record. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=998.44s)]
*  It's one of the methods, but I very quickly get your brain to associate a mental script [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1002.44s)]
*  of friend mode because he doesn't talk about that with other writers. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1008.9200000000001s)]
*  He bitches about his job to his friends. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1013.5200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1015.6s)]
*  So I'm getting your brain to start shifting into this, I'm behaving as if I'm with a friend. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1016.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1021.6s)]
*  So I start getting that behavior out of a person very quickly. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1022.6s)]
*  So we're just activating a script in that person's mind that goes from I'm with a client [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1025.68s)]
*  to I'm with a friend. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1029.92s)]
*  And that's that first level deviation of behavior right there. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1031.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1035.96s)]
*  And once you get the script activated, you can start leading them in other directions. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1036.96s)]
*  So the second step usually, and this goes into Manchurian candidate stuff and if you [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1041.72s)]
*  want to talk about seer hand, seer hand and all that kind of stuff we can. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1046.12s)]
*  Sure. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1049.4799999999998s)]
*  But to get them to start making a little bit of an identity agreement, are you this type [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1050.4799999999998s)]
*  of person? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1054.4799999999998s)]
*  So in reality, if I wanted you to, let's say, join a cult, like are you the type of person? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1056.3999999999999s)]
*  And I'll just have an A, B question. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1064.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1065.8s)]
*  So, you know, in my life I've discovered there's two types of people. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1066.8s)]
*  There's people that take action when they know something's right and there's people [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1069.04s)]
*  that wait and wait and wait. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1071.84s)]
*  And I'm sure you know people that wait and wait and wait. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1073.6s)]
*  But I've got you to agree that you're type one. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1075.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1077.6000000000001s)]
*  Because I said, I'm sure you know people. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1078.6000000000001s)]
*  Even your head nodded. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1080.5600000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1081.5600000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1082.5600000000002s)]
*  So I've got this little agreement of identity. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1083.5600000000002s)]
*  I am a type of person who blank. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1085.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1088.0400000000002s)]
*  So you're influencing a person to sort of go along with whatever narrative you've already [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1089.0400000000002s)]
*  created about them. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1093.1200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1094.5200000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1095.5200000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1096.5200000000002s)]
*  And if the moment you get to identity, then you're guaranteeing that you can predict future [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1097.5200000000002s)]
*  behavior. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1101.96s)]
*  And this goes really deep. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1103.68s)]
*  You can get into hypnosis and all that stuff if you want to. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1104.8s)]
*  And once I get identity agreement, this is the same thing with politics. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1107.28s)]
*  You see the exact same thing. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1112.08s)]
*  The identity gets hijacked and then I can do anything I want because your identity is [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1114.84s)]
*  involved here. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1118.6399999999999s)]
*  It's not you're agreeing with my ideas. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1119.6399999999999s)]
*  You're agreeing because that's who you are. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1121.3999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1123.28s)]
*  But doesn't the person have to sort of respect you first in order to go along with this sort [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1124.28s)]
*  of social change? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1130.28s)]
*  They have to have some sort of an appreciation of you. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1131.8s)]
*  You have to be impressive. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1134.68s)]
*  At the very beginning, yes. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1136.5600000000002s)]
*  But the moment your identity is involved, they can lead it further and further and further. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1138.28s)]
*  And then, so one of the third steps, there's a million, but there's an experiment, if Jamie [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1143.0800000000002s)]
*  could pull it up, called the Lines experiment with Dr. Solomon Ash. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1148.52s)]
*  Lion, like the animal, or L-I-N-E? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1153.92s)]
*  Line. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1156.44s)]
*  Lines. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1157.44s)]
*  Line, L-I-N-E. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1158.44s)]
*  So where this guy, is that a table kind of like this, but there's, you're a volunteer [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1159.44s)]
*  in the Lines experiment. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1163.8799999999999s)]
*  There's like 15 people in the room. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1164.8799999999999s)]
*  Everybody else but you is in on the experiment. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1166.32s)]
*  You're the only volunteer in the room. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1171.0s)]
*  So they show you these lines that are three lines on one page, and they show one page [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1174.28s)]
*  that has one line on it. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1179.48s)]
*  So which line on this page is equal to this line over here? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1180.9399999999998s)]
*  So obviously, over here on the target line, you're going to pick C, right? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1185.56s)]
*  I mean, that's glaringly obvious. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1190.6399999999999s)]
*  So in this experiment, Dr. Ash is doing this conformity experiment. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1194.1599999999999s)]
*  So these other people in the room all go before you, and everybody in the room, one at a time, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1199.08s)]
*  says A, A, A, A, A, A. And it gets around to the person, and this was almost 100%, 100% [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1203.84s)]
*  of people in the experiment would say A. And it's right in front of their face. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1213.56s)]
*  The truth is right in front of their face, and they would go with the group because the [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1220.6399999999999s)]
*  group did it. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1224.6799999999998s)]
*  The group is telling them what to choose. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1225.8s)]
*  But it's not even slight. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1229.6799999999998s)]
*  Like the difference is so glaringly obvious. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1231.9599999999998s)]
*  It's kind of amazing. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1234.24s)]
*  How did they pre-pick the people that were going to be the test subjects? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1235.24s)]
*  Like did they have any specific things they were looking for? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1241.84s)]
*  Because I think there's a lot of people that even if you got 13 people to say A, they would [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1244.6999999999998s)]
*  go, what are you guys talking about? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1249.12s)]
*  It's C. Like was there anything about them that they picked? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1251.1999999999998s)]
*  Like were these people pre-selected for being? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1255.32s)]
*  No. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1258.36s)]
*  No. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1259.36s)]
*  And they ran the experiment. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1260.36s)]
*  Do you ever think about yourself in that room? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1261.36s)]
*  What would you do? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1262.4799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1263.4799999999998s)]
*  And I worry. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1264.4799999999998s)]
*  Do you? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1265.4799999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1266.4799999999998s)]
*  I think in reality, everybody that's listening right now would say, not me. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1267.4799999999998s)]
*  100% of people would say, I wouldn't do that. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1272.1999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think it kind of depends on your station in life. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1275.2399999999998s)]
*  Where you're at. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1279.12s)]
*  When I was young, I might have just said A, because everybody was saying A. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1280.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1284.08s)]
*  Because I didn't want to be an idiot. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1285.08s)]
*  So that's one of the things they did. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1286.52s)]
*  They replicated the experiment on college campuses. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1287.96s)]
*  People are highly suggestible. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1292.04s)]
*  They're young. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1293.48s)]
*  They're still trying to figure out who they are. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1294.48s)]
*  And so a lot more suggestible. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1296.32s)]
*  And this is if you think of the way that social media manipulates our brain, it falsifies tribal [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1297.8799999999999s)]
*  agreement and it makes us say A. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1304.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1307.36s)]
*  So we're willing to ignore everything that we see because we're seeing a tribe say that [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1308.7199999999998s)]
*  something else is happening. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1314.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1315.3999999999999s)]
*  So it will override our brain. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1316.3999999999999s)]
*  And if there's one thing, like if you just, one thing that matters a lot is that our brains [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1318.1599999999999s)]
*  are not capable of overcoming this technology. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1325.34s)]
*  We don't have a firewall. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1329.4799999999998s)]
*  And technology has outpaced our brain's ability to adapt to it. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1331.0s)]
*  So I can falsify a tribe around you that says, oh, this is all happening right now. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1334.96s)]
*  And Dr. Phil, you and I both are friends with Dr. Phil. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1341.04s)]
*  He calls this the tyranny of the fringe, where this fringe pretends to be a group of a million [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1344.56s)]
*  people when it's just a small group that gets over a lot of attention. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1351.28s)]
*  It's really inflated. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1355.94s)]
*  So it looks like it's more popular than it actually is. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1356.94s)]
*  And if your identity is already there, then that automatically makes sense. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1359.76s)]
*  And we'll ignore just basic facts. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1364.24s)]
*  And it's not about the right or the left. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1367.32s)]
*  It's both of those sides have been doing this stuff for a long time. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1369.32s)]
*  But if I can get you to think that most of your tribal members agree to X, then most [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1372.76s)]
*  people, like 90% of people will say, okay, X is true. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1379.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, especially with social media, right? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1383.16s)]
*  Because obviously it'd be about something about something that's a little bit more complex [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1386.44s)]
*  than the size of a line. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1389.96s)]
*  But you're so easily manipulated because it's not really just people that are responding. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1391.8s)]
*  It's a lot of bots. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1397.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1399.32s)]
*  And you're seeing that more and more lately. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1399.72s)]
*  I was watching this video today and somebody pointed out after the video, look how many [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1403.88s)]
*  bots have retweeted this video. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1408.68s)]
*  And it was astounding. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1411.16s)]
*  So it's like, oh, there's a narrative that someone's trying to push because of this [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1412.6000000000001s)]
*  selectively edited video. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1416.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1418.92s)]
*  Like, wow. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1419.32s)]
*  Well, you're a dragon believer. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1420.28s)]
*  I saw that. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1421.48s)]
*  I love that so much, man. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1422.84s)]
*  That's just the view ladies. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1426.28s)]
*  They're crazy. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1427.56s)]
*  They're the gift that keeps giving. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1429.0s)]
*  That's that poor lady Joy Reid or not Joy Reid, Joy Behar. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1430.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1435.3999999999999s)]
*  I said you believe in dragons. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1435.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1436.9199999999998s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1437.1599999999999s)]
*  And the next day, I think I checked your Twitter and it was just said Joe Rogan, dragon. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1437.96s)]
*  Yeah, I said I have to change it. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1443.56s)]
*  Now it's perfect. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1444.6799999999998s)]
*  For someone like me, that's like, it's a gift. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1446.6s)]
*  And what you were doing is not just, I mean, it was funny. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1449.96s)]
*  It was really funny. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1453.08s)]
*  But it helped to shine a light on the absurdity, the absurdity that some of these people will [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1454.4399999999998s)]
*  go to to just give people misinformation, like the most obvious misinformation. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1462.2s)]
*  Well, not only that, but it was after she was talking about the view being a great source [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1467.56s)]
*  of information because they're part of ABC News. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1473.72s)]
*  So they check things unlike me who believes in dragons. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1476.36s)]
*  So it was like, it was so perfect. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1482.76s)]
*  It's like fucking, did you even watch the video? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1484.52s)]
*  And then she said she double checked it. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1488.04s)]
*  Did you double check that? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1489.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I did. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1490.76s)]
*  I've checked it. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1492.36s)]
*  That was wonderful. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1494.6799999999998s)]
*  I made my day. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1496.4399999999998s)]
*  I was happy all day that day. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1497.24s)]
*  I was like, what a great day. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1498.52s)]
*  It made my day to see you change your Twitter. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1499.56s)]
*  It's funny when people are so, their approach is so simplistic. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1501.6399999999999s)]
*  It's so obvious to anyone else that it becomes fun. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1506.84s)]
*  It becomes, it doesn't work at all. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1512.44s)]
*  Not only does it not slander you, not only does it not disparage people's opinions, you, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1514.04s)]
*  it creates fun. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1518.76s)]
*  Comedy. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1520.52s)]
*  Yeah, it creates comedy. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1521.08s)]
*  It's like, it's so ridiculous. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1522.44s)]
*  But this is the problem, not just with bots and social media influence, but also with [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1524.6799999999998s)]
*  echo chambers, right? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1530.28s)]
*  Echo chambers that people create where they get a bunch of people that only agree with them [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1531.48s)]
*  and everybody disagrees with them. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1535.24s)]
*  Instead of looking at them, and you see that on that show all the time, instead of looking [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1537.24s)]
*  at someone else's perspective and going, okay, so tell me how you came to this conclusion. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1541.24s)]
*  Why do you think this? [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1546.6s)]
*  Letting them fully express, instead it's like, everything is interrupty. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1548.52s)]
*  Everything is shouty. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1554.36s)]
*  I disagree with everything you have said in the audience. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1555.3999999999999s)]
*  Claps, and they're going to stand up for this or for that. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1558.4399999999998s)]
*  Instead of having an actual conversation about opinions and ideas and how you formulate them [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1562.6799999999998s)]
*  and how your mind works and how you think about things and why you think about things. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1567.8s)]
*  Instead of that, it's just ideological battles every day. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1571.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1576.12s)]
*  And it's identity instead of ideas is what it is. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1576.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's tribal. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1580.9199999999998s)]
*  It's super, it's, well, it's a bunch of people that are afraid to be alone and are afraid to [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1581.8s)]
*  be on the outside. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1587.56s)]
*  And so whatever the group agrees to, they find some sort of mental gymnastics they can [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1588.6s)]
*  apply to these ideas that make them relevant. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1594.84s)]
*  And it will reverse rationalize a lot of those decisions. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1598.6799999999998s)]
*  So they're emotionally made and logically rationalized in our head. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1603.0s)]
*  But we think that it's a logical decision. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1606.76s)]
*  It's so easy to weaponize a human being from a Manchurian candidate to just getting someone [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1610.6s)]
*  to like something on Twitter because it makes them feel morally or intellectually superior [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1615.32s)]
*  because they shared it. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1619.56s)]
*  It also makes them feel like they're a part of a team, which people love. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1620.6s)]
*  We are tribal animals. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1624.04s)]
*  We do not like to be alone outcast. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1625.3999999999999s)]
*  We like to be a part of a team, which is why you see audience capture [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1627.72s)]
*  as a big thing that happens to people online. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1631.6399999999999s)]
*  They find people that agree with them and then they sort of lean into it. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1633.8799999999999s)]
*  Big time. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1637.8799999999999s)]
*  They lean maybe a little too hard. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1638.76s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of people do. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1640.76s)]
*  A lot of people, they kind of lose who they are. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1641.8s)]
*  And people love to accuse everybody of that. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1644.28s)]
*  It's interesting because everyone's kind of aware of it now that it's a thing, which is good. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1646.2s)]
*  You know, it keeps people on their toes. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1650.04s)]
*  But when bringing it back to the cults, so they would try to get you to do something [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1652.2s)]
*  and deviate from your normal patterns. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1658.6s)]
*  And then most of these most cults are like sex cults, right? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1661.8s)]
*  Like pretty much all of them, right? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1665.0s)]
*  They're just started by really sex obsessed dudes. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1666.36s)]
*  Like, you know what? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1671.4s)]
*  I need a bunch of 20 year olds in here. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1672.2s)]
*  There's a few cults that have been started by ladies, right? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1674.52s)]
*  Very few. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1677.56s)]
*  Yeah, a few. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1678.44s)]
*  And then there was that wild, wild country one, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1679.3200000000002s)]
*  Osho's one where the lady ran it and he was kind of like [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1681.96s)]
*  sort of just this very odd eccentric guru and she was an assassin. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1685.88s)]
*  I didn't know this. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1690.04s)]
*  Oh, you didn't watch that Netflix documentary? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1691.0s)]
*  No. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1693.0s)]
*  Oh, it's fantastic. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1693.4s)]
*  It's so good because like all cult documentaries, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1694.68s)]
*  it starts out like, oh, these people have it nailed. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1697.64s)]
*  It starts out so good. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1700.68s)]
*  They're cooking together and laughing and dancing and doing yoga [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1702.8400000000001s)]
*  and having a good old time and chanting. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1706.92s)]
*  And it seems like they're having a wonderful time. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1709.0s)]
*  But eventually they take over this town in, was it Oregon? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1710.8400000000001s)]
*  Is it Oregon, right? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1715.24s)]
*  I think so. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1716.68s)]
*  Somewhere in the Pacific Northwest, I believe it was Oregon. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1718.1200000000001s)]
*  So they take over a town and they actually bus in homeless people [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1719.96s)]
*  so that they can pump up their numbers and vote to take over the town. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1723.0800000000002s)]
*  Essentially what some people were accusing the Biden administration [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1730.3600000000001s)]
*  of doing with leaving the borders open for illegals and then allowing them to vote. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1734.1200000000001s)]
*  Same sort of deal. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1738.68s)]
*  So they took over this town and they poisoned a bunch of people. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1739.8s)]
*  It's like really crazy. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1743.4s)]
*  It's crazy documentary. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1744.6000000000001s)]
*  And then eventually it falls apart. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1747.08s)]
*  Isn't that most cults? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1749.08s)]
*  Like you look at it from the outside, you're like, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1750.2s)]
*  wow, they're barefoot walking on grass. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1752.6000000000001s)]
*  They're eating natural stuff, organic stuff. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1754.2s)]
*  How is it a good time? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1756.3600000000001s)]
*  They sing together. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1757.16s)]
*  They're having a good time. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1757.96s)]
*  Then they take you into the room and they say, you know what, Joe? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1759.4s)]
*  You've reached the level. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1762.2s)]
*  Aliens live in your butthole. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1763.72s)]
*  We got to get them out. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1765.72s)]
*  Something along those lines. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1767.5600000000002s)]
*  Something crazy. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1768.28s)]
*  It's a lot of our sex cults. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1769.24s)]
*  If they're not sex cults, they're like money cults or power cults [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1770.92s)]
*  or ideological cults, which I think progressivism is. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1775.4s)]
*  I think it's an ideological cult. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1778.6000000000001s)]
*  And I think that people, they enjoy being around people that are very confident [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1780.68s)]
*  they're correct. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1786.92s)]
*  When someone like most of us like, what is life all about? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1788.44s)]
*  So many questions. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1792.04s)]
*  And if you come across someone who has all the answers [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1793.08s)]
*  and they're so confident about it, it's very attractive. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1795.64s)]
*  This episode is brought to you by The Farmer's Dog. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1798.68s)]
*  We all want to do the best for our dogs, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1801.48s)]
*  but there's a lot of mixed messaging out there, especially around dog food. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1803.16s)]
*  Take kibble, for example. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1807.4s)]
*  You'd have to do a lot of digging to learn that kibble is actually ultra processed. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1809.24s)]
*  They put the words like premium on their bag [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1813.32s)]
*  next to pictures of real ingredients, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1815.88s)]
*  but food doesn't end up as burnt down pellets without extreme processing. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1817.72s)]
*  For decades, it was the default dog food, but not anymore. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1823.4s)]
*  The Farmer's Dog is healthy food made with real meat and vegetables [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1827.3200000000002s)]

*  The recipes are developed by board certified nutritionists [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1835.3200000000002s)]
*  to be complete and balanced. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1838.5200000000002s)]
*  And their food is made to the same safety standards as human food. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1840.2s)]
*  It's lightly cooked to retain vital nutrients, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1845.08s)]
*  and then it's pre-portioned to suit your dog's needs. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1847.72s)]

*  what are the, which may be the type of people that are joining these calls. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1871.24s)]
*  They're questioning things in their life. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1874.84s)]
*  Our brains are naturally attracted to certainty and authority. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1876.84s)]
*  And there's, we can talk about man, authority is what we really [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1881.16s)]
*  probably should talk about, but we're attracted to that. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1883.96s)]
*  And our brains, the mammalian part of our brain [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1887.16s)]
*  will simply follow somebody that is easily followed. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1890.12s)]
*  Like what is the clearest signal? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1893.96s)]
*  It's not the smartest person in the room, not the best idea. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1896.04s)]
*  What's the clearest signal that's pointing in a direction that I can follow? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1898.84s)]
*  And our brains will just default to, once we trust that authority figure, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1903.48s)]
*  we're automatically going to assign good traits to them. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1907.9599999999998s)]
*  We're going to think that they're a good person. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1910.52s)]
*  We're a good person because we're aligning with this person [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1912.52s)]
*  just because they were followable. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1915.08s)]
*  So it's a clear message. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1917.9599999999998s)]
*  And so these guys who were recruiting people for cults, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1919.3999999999999s)]
*  were they open with you about this stuff or did you kind of like figure it out by talking to them? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1923.24s)]
*  I signed a ridiculous non-disclosure agreement with each one of them individually. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1928.6000000000001s)]
*  The cults have NDAs? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1934.68s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1936.0400000000002s)]
*  The main organization did not know I was there. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1938.1200000000001s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1940.1200000000001s)]
*  And it was mostly they would go around the mall. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1941.16s)]
*  They spend time around these shopping mall areas and talk to people. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1943.64s)]
*  Yeah. And it was like, it was all kind of very basic at the beginning. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1947.16s)]
*  So cults indoctrination is a longer process. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1950.8400000000001s)]
*  It's not like, hey, let me talk to you for five minutes and you're like, yeah, yeah, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1953.64s)]
*  I'll join your cults and we'll worship aliens and stuff together. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1956.6s)]
*  It's a long process where like the deviation escalation continues to increase over time. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1960.9199999999998s)]
*  And it's the exact same way if you're programming some Manchurian candidate [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1967.1599999999999s)]
*  or if you're a hypnotist and you're seeing a client, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1971.24s)]
*  you want to get them to deviate from their normal behaviors, right? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1973.56s)]
*  To fix their behavior. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1976.12s)]
*  So it's not all bad. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1978.1999999999998s)]
*  So we can use a lot of those same techniques to help somebody instead of hurt them. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1979.3999999999999s)]
*  That's what I started discovering over the years. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1984.44s)]
*  And I've studied like how to access every loophole in the human brain. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1987.08s)]
*  And the fastest way to do that is through novelty and authority, number one. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1991.88s)]
*  And there is nothing faster in the human brain that will give you that kind of access. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=1997.32s)]
*  Novelty and authority. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2002.92s)]
*  Like, give me some examples of that. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2004.92s)]
*  So let's say you and I are living 10,000 years ago, 15,000 years ago. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2006.6000000000001s)]
*  The average tribe of people was like 150, 120. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2011.72s)]
*  And let's say your job and my job was to go and collect fish in a bag and fish [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2015.48s)]
*  and then kind of bring it back to the tribe at the end of the day. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2021.56s)]
*  And every day we went to the same spot. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2024.84s)]
*  It's a great spot. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2026.3600000000001s)]
*  We walked by this bush, this big-ass bush. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2027.16s)]
*  And one day we're going back and talking about the fish we got. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2030.1200000000001s)]
*  And you hear a stick snap behind that bush that we haven't heard before. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2033.48s)]
*  So it's an unexpected deviation from your mental script of what's going to happen. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2038.04s)]
*  Does this make sense so far? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2042.36s)]
*  So we're walking by the bush. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2044.92s)]
*  The stick snaps. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2046.12s)]
*  Now what's generated in that moment is a tremendous amount of focus. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2047.1599999999999s)]
*  Like there could be a threat. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2051.32s)]
*  It could be a rabbit that we can eat. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2052.6s)]
*  Right? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2054.68s)]
*  So a threat or a value is how our brain responds to something new and something unexpected. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2054.92s)]
*  Is it a threat? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2060.68s)]
*  Is it valuable socially or otherwise valuable? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2061.4s)]
*  So the stick breaks. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2065.48s)]
*  We're not thinking about our kids. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2066.84s)]
*  We're not thinking about how many fish are in the bag. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2068.44s)]
*  We're only thinking about this novel new thing that interrupted my brain's script [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2070.28s)]
*  of what I thought was going to happen. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2075.2400000000002s)]
*  You with me so far? [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2077.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2077.8s)]
*  So in our life, when we see something that's unexpected, something that we... [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2078.36s)]
*  I guess we're not expecting. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2085.4s)]
*  So we're driving a car. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2086.84s)]
*  Blue lights in your rear view mirror is a tremendous amount of novelty. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2088.36s)]
*  Threat, value. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2093.1600000000003s)]
*  Right? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2094.04s)]
*  So our brain says, this is how I tie my shoes. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2095.0s)]
*  This is how I go to work. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2098.1200000000003s)]
*  This is how I run the cash register at Starbucks. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2099.0s)]
*  Whatever it is, we develop these apps in our head. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2101.1600000000003s)]
*  And when something interrupts one of those programs, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2103.8s)]
*  our brain automatically says, this is different. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2107.96s)]
*  This is not expected. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2110.92s)]
*  I need all of my focus down on this one thing. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2111.96s)]
*  And that's how novelty starts to trigger our brain. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2115.1600000000003s)]
*  Makes sense so far? [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2117.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2118.52s)]
*  And authority is the second piece. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2119.2400000000002s)]
*  So what would be an example that someone would use as novelty to get... [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2121.48s)]
*  Novelty and authority, if you want to get someone to follow you, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2127.0s)]
*  what would be novelty that you would apply? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2129.32s)]
*  Give me any scenario and I'll tell you. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2131.56s)]
*  Okay. You're trying to get someone to join a cult. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2134.2s)]
*  Yeah. So the novelty right away is, I'm going to approach you and say something [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2135.96s)]
*  or ask you a question that you've never been asked before. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2140.2s)]
*  There's no possible way that your brain could have gotten ready for that scenario. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2142.6s)]
*  And it could be something ridiculously stupid. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2145.48s)]
*  It'd be like, hey, did you see these guys fighting outside here last week? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2148.7599999999998s)]
*  Or you're walking up and you say, hey, I'm going to ask you three questions, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2152.52s)]
*  but you only have 12 seconds to answer. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2155.88s)]
*  No one's ever said something like that. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2157.56s)]
*  Okay. So you're just getting them out of their comfort zone. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2159.08s)]
*  Getting them into like, whoa, what's going on? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2161.4s)]
*  Yeah. We're breaking a pattern. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2163.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2164.6s)]
*  So we're all running on patterns all the time. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2164.92s)]
*  The moment a pattern is broken, we have tremendous focus. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2168.04s)]
*  So focus is the first step to hacking the mammalian brain. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2171.0s)]
*  Authority is next. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2174.52s)]
*  And authority is like, if you look at the Milgram experiment, have you heard of this? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2176.36s)]
*  Oh my God. Have you gone deep on it? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2181.7200000000003s)]
*  Not really. I mean, but explain it to people so they know what you're talking about. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2185.0s)]
*  Jamie, can we bring up a picture of the box? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2188.28s)]
*  The shocking box from this experiment is just- [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2190.36s)]
*  Essentially, they told people that they had to keep shocking people, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2193.2400000000002s)]
*  and then they did it to the point where they thought the other person on the other side [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2197.48s)]
*  was actually dead and they kept shocking. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2200.52s)]
*  Yeah. What year was this? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2202.12s)]
*  62, 1962 at Yale University. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2204.9199999999996s)]
*  This is a variation of the experiment, but just go to the third one right there. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2209.7999999999997s)]
*  So that's Stanley Milgram standing over that machine right there. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2215.24s)]
*  So you'll notice on the bottom right, it says, danger, severe shock, right there. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2219.16s)]
*  So you're essentially told the guy's on the other side of a drywall wall. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2224.4399999999996s)]
*  He's in another room, but you can hear him yelling every time you shock. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2228.04s)]
*  And every time you're asking him these questions and he gets the answer wrong, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2231.16s)]
*  he's acting like a dumb ass. He's obviously in on the experiment. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2234.68s)]
*  But these people think they're shocking this guy. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2238.6s)]
*  And in real life- Man, I had that in airplane mode. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2241.0s)]
*  In real life, this guy is just- He's running a script. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2248.6s)]
*  He's a participant in the experiment. He's in on it. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2251.56s)]
*  But as the person's getting shocked, you hear him scream, you hear him say, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2255.7999999999997s)]
*  I want to get out of here. I don't want to do this anymore. I have a heart condition. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2259.08s)]
*  He's banging around. And then at around 300 volts, and it goes up to 450 on this machine. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2262.68s)]
*  300 volts, no more sound. He stops answering questions. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2268.36s)]
*  And these people are sitting there at the machine kind of turning around, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2272.52s)]
*  this guy in the lab coat that's running this experiment. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2274.7599999999998s)]
*  And the guy in the lab coat saying, well, it's important that you continue. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2278.04s)]
*  The experiment requires that you continue. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2281.08s)]
*  And they keep going. They keep delivering electric shocks to this guy. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2283.7999999999997s)]
*  That was screaming before and is now silent. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2288.92s)]
*  He's not even answering these questions on the test anymore. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2291.2400000000002s)]
*  Did everybody do it? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2294.52s)]
*  So before the experiment started, these bunch of psychologists got together and they said, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2296.28s)]
*  all right, who's going to go all the way through? Who's going to do everything? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2299.88s)]
*  And they thought 0.4%, something like that. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2303.88s)]
*  It would have to be a psychopath. It would have to be somebody that was malicious or [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2308.36s)]
*  wanted to hurt people. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2313.2400000000002s)]
*  And after the experiment was conducted, 67% of people went all the way. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2314.76s)]
*  And this is, so what we're really dealing with here is not an experiment. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2322.0400000000004s)]
*  It's a person being talked into murder in less than an hour. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2326.5200000000004s)]
*  A regular normal human being talked into murder. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2331.7200000000003s)]
*  67% of them. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2335.7200000000003s)]
*  67%. And 250 volts is enough to kill you. Would you agree if you have the right amps? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2337.0800000000004s)]
*  I don't know, but I believe you. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2342.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. 100% went to 250. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2345.08s)]
*  Geez. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2348.92s)]
*  100%. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2349.56s)]
*  So that could kill you. 100% at least attempted murder. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2353.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And I train sales teams all the time. They're like, oh, we have, you know, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2356.2000000000003s)]
*  it's hard to sell this product or this thing. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2359.6400000000003s)]
*  And I'm like, I show them this thing and like, where's the sales script these guys use at Yale [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2362.36s)]
*  University? There wasn't a script. It's not like, oh, let me get the perfect words on the [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2367.56s)]
*  phone for this telemarketing company. There's no script. There's no hypnosis. There's no like [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2372.2s)]
*  NLP stuff going on where I have to say these little magic words. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2377.24s)]
*  And I kind of view that aspect of persuasion, like the guys that are obsessed with sales scripts. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2382.12s)]
*  It's like Harry Potter. Like there's no magic words that are going to make someone take action. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2388.2799999999997s)]
*  We take action based on the mammalian brain. And what was present there at Yale University, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2392.4399999999996s)]
*  if you're the volunteer there, you respond to an ad in the paper you've never responded to before. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2397.3999999999996s)]
*  Novelty. At a university you've never been to. In a building you've never been in. With two people [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2401.96s)]
*  you've never met. In a room you've never been in. Sitting in front of a machine that's absolutely [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2407.08s)]
*  foreign to you. It's alien. Every single step of the way was novelty. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2411.56s)]
*  And then the guy in the lab coat, they made him like, I think he was six foot seven. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2416.52s)]
*  And he's running the experiment. And we have this stuff called white coat syndrome where we [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2422.52s)]
*  respond to doctors. And there's even research where people were given diagnoses [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2426.44s)]
*  and that they, for things they didn't have, and they developed the symptoms because a doctor has [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2432.68s)]
*  told them this. And that's how powerful novelty plus authority is. Is you, there are people talked [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2437.4s)]
*  into murder in under an hour. And there's no magic recipe to do it. It's authority and novelty. And [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2445.7200000000003s)]
*  authority has five components if you want to just go into them. So that's confidence. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2451.24s)]
*  Obviously somebody's got to be really confident to be an authority figure. And this is just a [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2457.3999999999996s)]
*  conviction in my belief and a generalized belief in my head that everything's going to be fine. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2461.3999999999996s)]
*  Everything's going to be okay. Discipline is number two. And discipline, I don't say discipline is [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2466.2799999999997s)]
*  part of authority because like if everybody, like when you were younger, you ever like go to a party [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2472.68s)]
*  and like put a really nice suit on and all that stuff and like you're, you're a seven foot pile [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2478.2s)]
*  of laundry back at home, like shit all over your bathroom counter. Like you were not put together. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2482.4399999999996s)]
*  I was there. But like there's a part of our brain that reminds us that we don't have everything [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2486.68s)]
*  together. So when we go out, we're not, other people aren't saying, oh, this guy's not disciplined. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2491.16s)]
*  No one's saying that, but they are getting a gut feeling that something's off because there's [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2496.04s)]
*  something disharmonic. There's something incongruent about our behavior because we know there's a part [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2501.48s)]
*  of our brain says, you know, I'm faking this right now. I'm not this put together. So having [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2506.6s)]
*  discipline off camera when nobody's looking makes gut feelings in people is, was one of those things [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2512.2s)]
*  where we're, we have this ancient brain that's judging whether or not everything's congruent. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2518.2799999999997s)]
*  So confidence, discipline, leadership, and leadership just means if I brought you back [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2523.16s)]
*  a thousand years, could you still, would people still follow you? Like your behavior is confident [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2529.64s)]
*  and certain enough and all of that, that people would follow you, not language and all that. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2534.52s)]
*  Do you say the right things and do you give people compliments? That's not, what I mean is tribal [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2537.96s)]
*  leadership from the mammalian perspective, not human. So confidence, discipline, leadership, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2543.48s)]
*  gratitude, and enjoyment are the final two. Gratitude, just not saying like I'm keeping this [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2549.64s)]
*  gratitude journal every day or anything like that, just I'm a grateful person and I have perspective [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2555.64s)]
*  in gratitude. So I'm able to zoom out and think of like the larger picture when I'm thinking of [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2560.68s)]
*  gratitude, not just like, oh, thank, I'm thankful for my health today, but I'm thankful. Like we [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2566.12s)]
*  didn't have a nuclear war yesterday. We didn't have all this stuff happen. And what the reason [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2570.2s)]
*  these things are effective is because they produce, having them when nobody's looking produces the [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2576.12s)]
*  precise gut feelings in another person that make them say that's an authority figure. So when you [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2582.7599999999998s)]
*  have authority, you can get away with anything you want. And I go to these companies, I train [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2590.12s)]
*  companies and people all over and how to increase sales and all that. And they're all like, well, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2595.16s)]
*  we have a good script. We've got this piece of paper right here that's really great. We spent [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2599.08s)]
*  $10 million developing the sales script. I'm like, give the script to somebody out here with social [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2603.16s)]
*  anxiety and have them get on the phone. They're going to bomb. It'd be the worst freaking salesman [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2609.16s)]
*  out there because the script is meaningless, but everybody puts so much value in these words. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2616.28s)]
*  It's who you are first, then what you say. And people just ignore the first part. I mean, if you [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2622.52s)]
*  think of, if I go off on a small rant here, I could tell a question bubble up in your head. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2629.2400000000002s)]
*  No, go ahead. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2636.28s)]
*  There's too many times people obsess over symptoms instead of causes. So you go on LinkedIn or [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2638.6000000000004s)]
*  whatever and it says how to be confident. Here are the 15 ways to be confident. Here's the 12 [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2645.32s)]
*  things that confident people do. They have great posture. They make good eye contact. It's a firm [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2649.7200000000003s)]
*  handshake. They use your name, they pat you on the shoulder, all this kind of shit. Those are symptoms [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2653.96s)]
*  of being confident. It's not confidence. So our culture today is obsessed with symptoms of things. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2659.48s)]
*  Let me get symptoms of wealth. I'm going to get this Porsche. I'm going to get this yacht. I'm [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2666.28s)]
*  going to get this plane, post it all over Instagram and show people that I have these symptoms. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2669.4s)]
*  So what we're really looking at is like when I'm trying to, somebody's trying to learn sales, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2673.64s)]
*  let me teach you the symptoms of what a good salesperson has instead of the cause of what makes [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2678.52s)]
*  them a good salesperson. That makes sense. So in order for someone to truly be confident, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2683.08s)]
*  they have to take all those steps to make, do you want some coffee? No, actually. Yeah. Okay. You [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2690.68s)]
*  want it in the crazy cup or regular one? I'll take the crazy cup. Crazy cup's a little hard to drink out of. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2696.2s)]
*  Crazy cup's a little hard to drink out of. Is it? Yeah. I'll switch. I don't want to dirty that one [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2699.48s)]
*  up. No, don't worry about it. So they have to have all those ducks in a row. If they don't, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2703.64s)]
*  people are going to sense it. They're going to know, even if they exhibit all the behavior [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2711.72s)]
*  characteristics of someone who's confident, there's going to be something off because we have [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2716.6s)]
*  some way, some ancient way of detecting bullshit in ourselves. Yeah. We get those gut feelings. Yeah. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2721.48s)]
*  We know when something's off, someone's a little full of it, someone's faking it. Yeah. I mean, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2730.2s)]
*  we've all had that experience. Everything looked right on the surface. Anybody who's watching it [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2734.8399999999997s)]
*  from a distance was like, wow, that guy's really confident. But in your gut, you're like, something's [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2739.48s)]
*  off. Well, particularly if you have all those bases covered. If you have all those bases covered, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2744.36s)]
*  I think it makes it far easier to see in other people when they don't. Yeah. Because I mean, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2751.48s)]
*  if you have confidence, that means I'm living in front of my eyes. Right. I'm not just stuck [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2757.4s)]
*  back here the whole time. So if you're going to teach people how to be confident, essentially, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2761.6400000000003s)]
*  you have to teach them how to get their shit together. Yeah. Unequivocably. Yeah. Like [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2767.2400000000002s)]
*  undoubtedly, you know, undebatably. Like you have to have your shit together, clearly. Absolutely. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2771.4s)]
*  Otherwise, you're not going to really be confident. It's always the back of your head. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2779.6400000000003s)]
*  It's always going to be fucking with you. Yeah. And there's five areas of your life that I've [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2783.0s)]
*  identified. This is not some self-help program or anything, but there's five areas of your life that [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2786.84s)]
*  create gut feelings in other people, and that's your environment, how you handle all these things, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2792.6800000000003s)]
*  your environment, your time, your appearance, your social skills, and your financial life. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2796.52s)]
*  It's like if I've got unpaid bills, I've got creditors knocking on my door all the time, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2801.32s)]
*  and then I go out and try to look like I've got my shit together, I'm going to send those [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2805.32s)]
*  signals that something's not right. To people that are aware, not to people that are willing [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2809.0800000000004s)]
*  to join cults. Right. Correct. That's the problem is that there's not really an operating manual [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2813.88s)]
*  for life or for the human mind. And we're dealing with these very complicated systems, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2821.32s)]
*  complicated systems of work and social life and hobbies and all the different things that people [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2829.24s)]
*  do. It's very complicated. And a lot of people are just kind of like stumbling through it, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2834.52s)]
*  learning along the way, hopefully every time they fuck up. Yeah. Yeah. So, and a lot of that is, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2840.52s)]
*  even with these cult recruiters, these people have an unconscious knack to spot suggestible people. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2848.52s)]
*  So, your level of suggestibility is how much will you think a person's an authority figure, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2855.1600000000003s)]
*  even if they're faking confidence? That's basically what that is. Will you accept a [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2860.0400000000004s)]
*  suggestion and act on it? And we've got guys like Sirhan Sirhan, who killed RFK in San Francisco, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2863.7200000000003s)]
*  this is 60s. I think it's Los Angeles. I think it was San Francisco. I think it's Los Angeles, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2873.0s)]
*  because I was at the actual hotel where they did it. They actually filmed Fear Factor there. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2878.6000000000004s)]
*  See, that's true. I don't doubt you at all. I'm pretty sure. I'm pretty sure it was Los Angeles. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2884.6s)]
*  And there's also some debate as to whether or not he did it. Oh, I did a whole video on this [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2889.0s)]
*  on my channel. Yeah. I don't know enough about it. But I know that there's some people that, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2893.64s)]
*  obviously, there's some people that think that like JFK's driver shot him. There's some like [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2899.4s)]
*  kooky conspiracies. Yeah. Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles shortly after Kennedy had finished. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2903.4s)]
*  Yeah. So that hotel, we filmed Fear Factor there once. That's the only reason why I know. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2909.64s)]
*  And we were in the kitchen where like, it happened in the kitchen. Yeah, we were in the spot. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2914.2799999999997s)]
*  This is crazy that we could film this stupid fucking show in a place where [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2919.72s)]
*  presidential candidate got murdered. Yeah. Was that the reason they filmed there? [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2922.92s)]
*  I think a lot of stuff filmed in that hotel. I think the hotel had been defunct. And a lot of [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2928.92s)]
*  the there's like abandoned buildings and things in Los Angeles that they use for filming stuff. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2935.96s)]
*  Okay. Because it's a big filming industry, like they film films and TV shows and stuff there. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2941.72s)]
*  If it's like a cool environment. And it was like, spooky rundown old hotel. I don't even [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2946.04s)]
*  remember the show the episode, but I just remember us being in that room going, weird feeling. Yeah. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2951.4s)]
*  So the Sir Hans Sirhan thing is like that people believe that's part of MK ultra that he was some [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2958.84s)]
*  sort of mind controlled person. I do. Yeah. And I mean, I may be the number one guy in the country [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2964.68s)]
*  on the mind control stuff. I think I probably am. And I definitely believe that was influenced by [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2970.7599999999998s)]
*  a guy named Dr. Joylen West. Which Olly West? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So and it's not about skill. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2978.44s)]
*  Something like if you're doing something like this. It's not much about skill level. It's [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2987.3999999999996s)]
*  can you find a good target that's highly suggestible? And it almost you have some basic [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2991.8s)]
*  skills in this. I give you like three or four days worth of training in how to do [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=2996.92s)]
*  covert hypnosis and all of this other stuff. And how to create amnesia in a person so where you can [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3001.7200000000003s)]
*  just tell them to forget something and they'll willingly forget it. It's I could train you in [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3007.32s)]
*  three days how to do something like that. It's terrifying how our brains do not have a firewall. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3015.32s)]
*  And the moment that our conscious filter that filters like is this information good for me? [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3021.64s)]
*  Should I accept this information? If I can bypass that filter, which is very easy to do, [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3026.92s)]
*  you can kind of just jam in whatever you want into somebody's head. And so what evidence do we have [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3032.12s)]
*  that Sirhan Sirhan was working with Jolly West? There's not a lot. It's a lot of anecdotal stuff. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3037.7999999999997s)]
*  But he met with this guy regularly. And I'm not an expert on the case. I wouldn't consider myself an [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3044.04s)]
*  expert. But he met with this guy at the shooting range on a regular basis. And this guy would talk [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3049.24s)]
*  to him privately, whisper in his ear in the shooting range. We all know this is this is [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3056.8399999999997s)]
*  from testimony. And later, when he was arrested after the shooting happened, he said, I thought [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3060.8399999999997s)]
*  I was at the shooting range. I thought I was shooting at a target at a paper target. And he [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3067.24s)]
*  on record saying this. And he has no memory of that actual event happening. To this day, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3072.6s)]
*  he went up for parole, I think a year or two ago. And man, all they did was ask him to kind of [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3078.12s)]
*  admit what you did and just say what you did. And he said, I still have no memory of this event. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3084.12s)]
*  He had to stay in prison. And RFK believes it too. Wow. And you've had RFK on. So Sirhan Sirhan is [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3088.7599999999998s)]
*  meeting with this guy. Who is this guy? Nobody really knows. Nobody fully knows. But the guy was [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3099.88s)]
*  involved and connected to Joylon. And they called him Radio Man. That's the only name [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3106.9199999999996s)]
*  that people have used to identify this guy. And he met Sirhan at a range and expressed like we're [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3114.12s)]
*  both interested in shortwave radio stuff and all that kind of ham radio. And they connected over [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3120.2s)]
*  that initially. And then this guy somehow looped him into the situation he was in. So the MK Ultra [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3126.3599999999997s)]
*  stuff, a lot of it was experimental. They didn't necessarily have proof that a lot of what they [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3133.48s)]
*  were trying to do was effective. They knew that they could experiment with LSD on people. That was [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3143.2400000000002s)]
*  Operation Midnight Climax where they took over the brothels, which is so wild. For people that don't [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3149.8s)]
*  know what this is, they took over brothels and they essentially had the prostitutes serve these [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3154.2s)]
*  Johns LSD without their knowledge. And then they observed them through two-way mirrors. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3160.36s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3165.1600000000003s)]
*  And filmed them. Yeah. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3165.56s)]
*  And filmed how they would act. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3167.32s)]
*  Yeah. So the CIA was running whorehouses. I don't even know if they had sex because they probably [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3168.76s)]
*  dosed these guys up with so much acid. They probably didn't want to. But they observed them [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3173.48s)]
*  and they did it for years. They also ran the Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic, which is wild. And [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3179.32s)]
*  until I think fairly recently, and there was a lot of hubbub about it after Tom O'Neill's book, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3186.28s)]
*  Chaos, came out. And I think it was right after that they closed the Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3193.2400000000002s)]
*  But the CIA was essentially a part of the Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic in the 1960s. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3198.2s)]
*  And that's where the Manson family came out of. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3205.64s)]
*  Yeah. And there's a lot of people, I'm not a researcher on this topic. I'm a researcher [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3209.0s)]
*  on the techniques. But there's guys like Sidney Gottlieb was crazy. He was running the CIA. It [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3213.56s)]
*  was called OSS back then, Office of Special Services. And it was crazy. They called him [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3222.36s)]
*  a cowboy, but they brought in all this LSD. In Canada, they were running, I think this was, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3229.16s)]
*  I think it was in Montreal. No, it was in Toronto. Montauk Institute, is that right? [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3236.52s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3242.44s)]
*  They were doing things called psychic driving. They would keep people awake. And it was like [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3243.72s)]
*  Clockwork Orange. And they would hold their eyes open and just play these videos to kind of like [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3249.16s)]
*  entrain them and really just drive their brains. And these were people that checked into the [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3255.64s)]
*  hospital with like postpartum depression. And they started doing this shit on them. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3261.24s)]
*  They just started experimenting on them. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3265.72s)]
*  Yeah. And I mean, the Canadian government admitted it so much that they paid these [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3267.48s)]
*  people for damages. So just one woman's case that I can remember, I don't remember her name, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3271.56s)]
*  but she went in for postpartum, I think. And she did the psychic driving. When she came out, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3277.4s)]
*  she had no real memories anymore. She wet herself. She had to relearn how to walk and [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3282.2799999999997s)]
*  communicate socially. She had to relearn how to hold her pee in. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3287.7999999999997s)]
*  How long was she there for? [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3292.04s)]
*  I think it was like a month and a half. Unbelievable. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3293.32s)]
*  I think back then they were trying to find a bunch of different methods of mind control, [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3297.8s)]
*  right? Like there's a very famous video from the 1950s of soldiers in the UK where they [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3305.88s)]
*  dosed them up with acid and you see them wandering around the woods laughing and giggling, falling [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3311.4s)]
*  down. And we had just got those videos from the Korean War where the Korean prisoners were making [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3315.7200000000003s)]
*  these videos like, I realize now that America is a horrible country. I renounce everything. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3322.28s)]
*  I hate America. These are all the bad things they've done. And the guys in the United States [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3328.1200000000003s)]
*  are watching this shit going, holy shit, they've got some secret technology and we're behind. So [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3333.1600000000003s)]
*  it was like a psychological arms race. They just went berserk on this stuff. So they figured out, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3337.8s)]
*  or they figured that there's some kind of secret chemical or secret technique or recipe that these [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3346.6800000000003s)]
*  people are using that we haven't figured out yet. And it was a madhouse race to figure out what was [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3351.0s)]
*  going on with these prisoners in North Korea. What was going on? What were they doing with the [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3357.32s)]
*  prisoners? Depriving them of sleep. It was super basic stuff. They were depriving them of sleep, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3361.8s)]
*  treating them really well. They're using these interrogation techniques that were developed by [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3366.6s)]
*  this German guy named Hans Scharf. And every interrogation system nowadays that's taught is [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3370.92s)]
*  a derivative of Hans Scharf's work. And funny enough, he's the most famous interrogator in [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3377.48s)]
*  history. And he was like the first guy that said, hey, what if we're not assholes? [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3382.6800000000003s)]
*  What if we're not just total assholes of these people and take them out on walks, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3387.6400000000003s)]
*  maybe give them a sandwich every once in a while. And the whole time pretend like we, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3391.2400000000002s)]
*  every piece of intelligence they give us, we pretend like we already knew it. And that was [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3395.32s)]
*  kind of his premise, like let's not be a dick. And he got famous for that. So everything is based on [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3398.92s)]
*  his work now. And funny enough, you ever been to Disneyland? Sure. You know the huge mosaic [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3405.48s)]
*  that you walk through? It's a huge like tile mosaic thing at the very entrance of Disneyland. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3411.32s)]
*  I don't recall it. Yeah, it probably wasn't paying attention. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3417.08s)]
*  Hans Scharf made that. Oh, really? By hand. Yeah. Whoa. Weird. How much time did that take? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3420.2s)]
*  I don't know. How big is this thing? It's huge. See if you can find it, Jamie. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3425.96s)]
*  How big is it? He made it by hand? Yeah. Is he on acid? [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3429.6400000000003s)]
*  Had to be. That thing. Wow. Left a permanent mark on Disney. A former Nazi interrogator. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3434.6000000000004s)]
*  Fuck. Like as if Disney doesn't have enough problems with Walt Disney being linked to [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3442.2000000000003s)]
*  anti-Semitism. The fact that they actually have a Nazi artist. If there was a competition where [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3448.6800000000003s)]
*  I said, Joe, I'll give me a million dollars if you can figure out what this Nazi interrogator [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3454.76s)]
*  did on the side. Not just on that. That's crazy. And it's almost bizarre. Yeah, it's like a DMT [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3459.0s)]
*  kind of visual going on. Well, that's just weird in and of itself that he was working with these [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3469.08s)]
*  people. Like how was Walt Disney connected to that guy? No idea. No clue. That's not good. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3475.48s)]
*  That doesn't do a lot to quell the rumors. Yeah. So these people that are... Is there documentation [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3482.92s)]
*  that shows the effectiveness of certain techniques? Do we have any of their work? Like the Jolly West, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3498.6000000000004s)]
*  did he publish anythings or did he leave behind documents explaining what worked and what didn't [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3506.6s)]
*  work? Yeah. Some. But this guy named, I don't remember his first name, Church, got really pissed [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3513.48s)]
*  off about all the CIA stuff. The Church Committee. The Church Committee. He said we're going to get [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3520.44s)]
*  it all. And then the CIA launched a destruction order and said we need to destroy... It was like [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3524.04s)]
*  Enron at the CIA then. The papers getting shredded and all this stuff. And some of the documents [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3528.6s)]
*  survived the destruction order because they were in a dude's attic. Yeah. This guy's name... He was [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3534.68s)]
*  a professor in New York at Colgate University and his name was Dr. George Estabrooks and not many [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3541.8799999999997s)]
*  people talk about him. But he was big into it. Him and Edgar Hoover had a plan to hypnotize a [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3547.48s)]
*  German submarine captain, split his personality, which is not hard to do, and send him back home [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3555.56s)]
*  and have him torpedo his entire fleet inside of his own harbor. And I have all of those documents. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3563.4s)]
*  So these professors and these scientists were working with the CIA while they were developing [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3573.32s)]
*  MKUltra. So they probably thought they were doing it for national security purposes. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3579.32s)]
*  Yeah. And so they were probably saying, look, North Korea is doing this. Germany's doing... All [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3584.36s)]
*  these countries are doing this. We need to do this as well. Yeah. I mean, they were at the bottom [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3590.04s)]
*  of the Maslow's pyramid. You'll do anything. Our country's going to go down. Did you read Chaos, [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3594.84s)]
*  the Tom O'Neill book? No. It's about the Manson family, how they did it with the Manson family. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3599.56s)]
*  It's essentially... I mean, he lays out a very compelling case for the CIA not only training [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3603.88s)]
*  Manson but supplying him with LSD and then getting him out of jail every time he got caught. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3612.2799999999997s)]
*  And that it was done to change the perception of the anti-war movement. The hippies were peace, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3618.28s)]
*  love, and psychedelic music, and people were dropping out of society. And instead, the narrative [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3625.72s)]
*  now became, no, they are murderers and psychopaths, and they're going to kill beautiful actresses and [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3632.44s)]
*  people in Hollywood. So they thought he would be like the vaccine for Timothy Leary and all the [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3638.36s)]
*  people. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good way to put it. Yeah. They took this guy who was a con man and [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3643.64s)]
*  had sort of a proclivity towards influencing people and being charismatic. And you ever heard [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3650.52s)]
*  his music? No. I didn't know he did music. Yeah. He actually recorded with Brian Wilson of the Beach [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3656.84s)]
*  Boys. And I think Brian Wilson and him, there was a real problem because his career didn't take off, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3664.7599999999998s)]
*  and he threatened him. It became very problematic, his relationship with Brian Wilson. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3672.04s)]
*  So you can find the song. You can listen to it a little bit. Can we play this? Does someone own [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3680.12s)]
*  this? How does that work? That was something we hadn't talked about. Guns N' Roses covered one of [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3685.0s)]
*  his songs. Did you know that? Oh yeah. Yeah, we talked about that. I think we did. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3689.56s)]
*  But he recorded some songs and, you know, they're not that bad. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3694.76s)]
*  Is that him singing? Yeah. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3704.2s)]
*  It's not bad. It's not bad. Yeah, it's decent. It's not bad. It's like, it's an okay, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3716.52s)]
*  shitty song from the 60s. Yeah. You know, it's not something you want to put on your Spotify [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3721.56s)]
*  playlist, but it's not bad. It's better than a third of guys that play at the bar. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3725.72s)]
*  It's better than a third of the guys on Sixth Street in Austin, Texas. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3732.6s)]
*  It's not bad. I mean, he was a charismatic person, right? And that's what you need to [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3738.7599999999998s)]
*  run a cult, and that's what you need to be a good rock star. And a lot of psychedelics. Yeah. And he [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3742.84s)]
*  apparently wouldn't take them. He would give them to people and pretend to take them. And then he [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3747.4s)]
*  would use these methods to manipulate them while they were under. So like he's sober and he's [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3751.56s)]
*  going through this CIA textbook of how to manipulate and control these people. And then he [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3757.32s)]
*  gets these people like Tex Watson and, you know, Squeaky Fromm and all these fucking psychopaths. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3762.84s)]
*  And he threw this sort of indoctrination and bringing them into the family and, you know, [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3768.92s)]
*  they're staying with him. And then he's committing murders and crimes and he keeps getting out. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3775.7999999999997s)]
*  He gets arrested and they let him out. And the sheriffs that let him out, they all have the [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3781.16s)]
*  same explanation. I was told it's above my pay grade and they just let him out. So the guy's [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3785.7999999999997s)]
*  violating parole and he's getting out like multiple times. Like it's very, yeah. And there's a real [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3789.9599999999996s)]
*  compelling case for Jolly West. First of all, there's anecdotal of it. Jolly West visited him [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3796.9199999999996s)]
*  in jail and they think that that's when it all started. Wow. Yeah. I don't doubt any of that. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3804.28s)]
*  It makes sense because like that's a really successful cult. Like as far as like the [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3811.6400000000003s)]
*  historical footprint. You know, like everybody knows about the Manson family. I mean, like [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3817.32s)]
*  that worked. That scared the shit out of everybody. It was weird. Like, oh my God, [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3821.8s)]
*  what if your children joined the Manson family? Oh my God, my kids are vulnerable. What if they [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3825.32s)]
*  want to be peace, love and flower children and they get wrapped up in the family? [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3829.48s)]
*  And that's, it just sort of changed the tone in society with people. And it was also at the same [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3833.48s)]
*  time when they passed that sweeping schedule one psychedelics act where they made everything [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3841.2400000000002s)]
*  illegal. It's all around the same time. And art goes to zero. Yeah. Art goes into the toilet. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3845.0s)]
*  Starts disappearing. Architecture. A lot of things went south. Yeah. Car design. But the [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3849.88s)]
*  the fact that there's real compelling evidence that this was the government and that this is [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3856.36s)]
*  the government's response to this immense cultural change that took place between 1950 and 1960. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3862.76s)]
*  And it's not like just guessing. It's like there's real programs that they were involved in that [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3868.1200000000003s)]
*  were absolutely doing that kind of work. A hundred percent. Yeah. And that's really crazy to think of. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3874.1200000000003s)]
*  And I, and it gets deeper. Like there are step by step programs they have for creating a [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3880.2s)]
*  Manchurian candidate. Okay. Like what's step one? How do you know when you can get a guy [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3886.4399999999996s)]
*  to be a Manchurian candidate? Can you do anybody or do you have to get a vulnerable guy? [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3891.16s)]
*  I don't want to say everything. I think some of this could be misused, but let me. Well, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3894.9199999999996s)]
*  I don't know if you know about Grok, but Grok's out there misusing information. So. All right. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3900.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. Let's put it out there. He can get anything from that. So like you're a very social guy. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3905.16s)]
*  And you've got lines in your forehead here from raising your eyebrows a lot. There's people that [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3909.88s)]
*  are your age that are not very socially connected to people that have the smooth foreheads. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3914.44s)]
*  So if you're smiling a lot your whole life, you're going to develop these little crow's feet and [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3919.8s)]
*  you'll do it by the age of 19. If you're a social happy person, you'll see the crow's feet. You're [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3923.56s)]
*  angry all the time. You're going to see this little muscle right here, the glabella. Yeah, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3928.36s)]
*  yeah. Yours is not that pronounced, but whatever emotion we experience on a very, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3933.96s)]
*  very regular basis, etches itself onto the face as a rule of thumb saying that this is science. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3939.48s)]
*  It's not. This is my observation. There's no study that I can send you, but we can see that. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3945.32s)]
*  I mean, you could see somebody who's lived a super happy life. They have these little [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3952.76s)]
*  smile lines around their eyes. Somebody who's raised their eyebrows a lot. This is our social, [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3955.96s)]
*  our forehead is a social billboard. So you're going to see those lines start coming on the face. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3959.96s)]
*  But what if I told you to make a skeptical facial expression? [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3965.08s)]
*  If you asked me to be skeptical, this is my skeptical face. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3971.32s)]
*  Okay, so like somebody's trying to feed you something, most people will kind of, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3975.2400000000002s)]
*  these lower eyelids are going to tighten up. I might do that too. I might do that. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3979.08s)]
*  So you're like, most of the time though I'm like, what? Yeah. It's my what bitch face. What bitch? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3983.48s)]
*  Yeah. If I have somebody who's been, who is not skeptical ever in their life, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3988.68s)]
*  they have the smoothest lower eyelids in the world. So to test this out, and this is anecdotal, [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=3997.64s)]
*  but I gave it to five guys who are stage hypnotists. They're out of these comedy clubs [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4004.6s)]
*  every night knocking people out and all that stuff. And I told them, test this theory over [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4010.52s)]
*  the course of five years. They all said it's a hundred percent accurate. Because you know, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4015.16s)]
*  like they bring people up and some guy doesn't go all the way in his hands and stuff together. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4019.3199999999997s)]
*  He's like, all right, sir, thanks. Thanks for coming. Go back to your seat. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4023.3999999999996s)]
*  We should explain what we're talking about. There's comedy hypnotists. And if you don't know, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4026.04s)]
*  and if you haven't seen it, you would think it's bullshit. But I was very fortunate when I was 21, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4032.12s)]
*  when I worked in Boston, there was a guy who was really good at it. He was an actual hypnotist. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4037.48s)]
*  His name was Frank Santos. And he did this show, this comedy hypnotism show, I think it was every [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4040.92s)]
*  Monday night at Stitch's comedy club. And it was insane. He would have people go on stage. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4045.48s)]
*  They thought they were having sex with Madonna. They thought they were in a rowboat, like in the [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4050.28s)]
*  rowboat was going to tip over. It was then they had a dance, you know, that a dance and if they [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4054.44s)]
*  they danced the best, they thought they're going to win a million dollars. And it was weird. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4059.2400000000002s)]
*  It was weird to watch because and he could tell when someone was under and someone wasn't under. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4063.48s)]
*  And it was weird. It was weird to watch because he it was I never believed in that. I was like, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4068.4399999999996s)]
*  well, I guess you have to be a dope. Like maybe you just have to be a dope. And that's the kind [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4075.3999999999996s)]
*  of people that he picks. He just finds that dumb people. But a lot of the people I talked to [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4079.3999999999996s)]
*  afterwards, I was like, what happened? And they're like, I don't know. It's just like he's snapping [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4082.6s)]
*  his fingers. And next thing you know, I'm fucking dancing. Yeah, weirdest thing I've ever experienced [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4087.3199999999997s)]
*  in my life. So I'm a hypnotist, certified hypnotist. And I've learned it just because [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4092.12s)]
*  of my brain obsession. And I didn't believe in it either. I had zero belief that it was real. And [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4098.2s)]
*  I went to my first comedy hypnosis show like five years ago. This guy's name is Rich Guzzi. And [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4103.64s)]
*  it's real. Like I saw this. I'm like, oh, my God, these people aren't just like, [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4109.72s)]
*  that's definitely real. And so if damn, what are we talking about? Hypnosis? Yeah, we were talking [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4114.5199999999995s)]
*  about so the suggestible. Yeah, suggestible people. Like, how do you pick someone to be a [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4123.24s)]
*  Manchurian candidate? Can you pick anybody? Yeah. Or does it have to be a person that has like [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4129.08s)]
*  something off about them? They would. I don't think they have to have something that's off. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4134.36s)]
*  You can pick a totally healthy person that's very highly suggestible. So I have a TV show coming out [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4138.68s)]
*  that's fiction, fiction. And the bad guy in the book gets access to some of these techniques, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4146.12s)]
*  and he doesn't know how to learn. They're not working. So he goes to these comedy hypnosis [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4151.96s)]
*  shows, and he just picks people that were called up on stage. And he wrecks their lives. Preselect. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4157.56s)]
*  Yeah. So he gets someone else to figure out who's smart. So and those people are highly [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4164.76s)]
*  suggestible. And they're always more open to fun. They're always better. You know, they live in [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4170.04s)]
*  front of their eyes a lot more. And so suggestibility doesn't mean stupid. It means that you're just more [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4174.5199999999995s)]
*  open to the things that are around you. Right. They're typically happier people. More suggestible [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4179.72s)]
*  people are typically happier people. That's interesting. Because they're just blissfully [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4185.0s)]
*  unaware. Yeah. I mean, it depends on if they're suggestible and addicted to like Instagram, [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4189.4s)]
*  horrifying stuff on Instagram, and they're watching it all the time. So they can get [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4197.32s)]
*  programmed easily for all these things. So this guy, George Esther Brooks, makes this formula [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4201.08s)]
*  to split the personality of an army officer. And they called him Smith. And they're going to split [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4206.04s)]
*  this guy, give his alter ego a bunch of secrets to take across enemy lines, and then deliver these [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4213.72s)]
*  secrets that are in his head to this person that's on the other side of this thing. And in this paper, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4220.6s)]
*  it's a hypothetical. It's written as a hypothetical. So they're going to split this guy [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4226.68s)]
*  with the goal being he gets captured. Somebody tortures him and put a drill in his knee or [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4234.04s)]
*  something. This other personality won't come out because there's a secret word and an anchor. They'll [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4238.84s)]
*  squeeze his arm and say moonlight or something like that. And it'll turn this other guy on. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4245.4800000000005s)]
*  Is that really possible to have a partition in your brain where you keep other memories? [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4249.64s)]
*  Absolutely. Really? Yeah. It's not a partition. I mean, there's no physical modification. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4254.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. Of course. Of course. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4260.360000000001s)]
*  It's happening. But I mean, like a partition. There's another you in there. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4261.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. And I'll tell you something scary when it comes to multiple personality stuff. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4266.360000000001s)]
*  If a slightly suggestible, not even high, slightly suggestible person goes to a psychiatrist [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4270.92s)]
*  and let's say I wanted to split somebody, I could make up a piece of paper that's got 10 questions [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4277.72s)]
*  on it. It's like, do you ever feel like you're at war with yourself? Like one person wants to eat [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4283.400000000001s)]
*  cake and the other one wants to eat broccoli. That's 100%. That's everybody. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4287.72s)]
*  Right. And then the next one is, do you ever [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4292.52s)]
*  feel like you're arguing with yourself about whether or not you should relax or worry about [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4295.08s)]
*  something? That's everybody. But it has a lot of these questions that talked about you having [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4298.68s)]
*  different parts. And then the psychiatrist takes this exam and he says, you know what? [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4303.72s)]
*  I'm looking at all these numbers and you scored in the 99th percentile from multiple personality [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4308.68s)]
*  disorder. Have you ever felt like you're at war with a part of yourself? That's everybody. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4314.12s)]
*  But now he says, like, well, what does that part want? If I could just talk to that part directly, [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4319.64s)]
*  so now we start having a conversation with this part. And then he says, well, it's not really nice [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4325.0s)]
*  for us to do that. Why don't we make a name for this part? They're almost done. That's almost the [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4329.48s)]
*  full creation. So that's called, they researched this in the seventies, called iatrogenic creation [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4336.36s)]
*  of dissociative identities. So if they wanted to do this and create a Manchurian candidate, [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4342.76s)]
*  there has to be like some proof that this is effective, right? So how would they, [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4348.84s)]
*  how would they, before they send someone out to do some assassination or something, [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4353.96s)]
*  how would they know that they got this guy on the program? Well, they tested it with hundreds of [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4358.92s)]
*  people first and they would all use colors. So like Mrs. White was a subject or Mrs. Red, [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4364.12s)]
*  whatever. And they would hypnotize a woman while she's, and then, you know, split all this [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4369.72s)]
*  personality stuff and develop that partition. And then with her eyes open in one personality, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4375.96s)]
*  she witnesses a, what she thinks is a real bomb getting put into a briefcase with a little timer [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4382.2s)]
*  thing on it, like an old movie dynamite thing that you'd see in a cartoon or something like, [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4388.84s)]
*  put into a briefcase, zip that thing up and she's holding it and they're telling her it's [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4393.08s)]
*  going to explode. And then they change her personality, the other one, and she's on heart [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4398.6s)]
*  rate monitors and all this other stuff. And they, and this is a CIA document they released [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4402.36s)]
*  and she's called Mrs. White in this document. There's many, many more, but the other personality's [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4407.16s)]
*  job is to not look in the briefcase because that personality doesn't know what's in it [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4413.88s)]
*  and sit in this waiting room with this briefcase beside you. Heart rate doesn't go up. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4417.799999999999s)]
*  And then another time they give somebody, they watch a gun being loaded, they split the [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4425.08s)]
*  personality and do some kind of sleight of hand to unload the firearm. And then they're told to [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4429.64s)]
*  pull this firearm out and go shoot this person in the face. And when the trigger is given to you, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4435.0s)]
*  like a guy tapping his pencil or something, and they do it. And this is just hypnosis that [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4440.6s)]
*  caused them? They're not using any psychedelic drugs or psychotropic medicine? You don't need it. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4445.64s)]
*  Nothing. Yeah. Wow. It's so, it's easier than you think. For some people, right? [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4450.68s)]
*  High authority on one end of the person doing the program and high suggestibility on the other, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4458.4400000000005s)]
*  then your skills don't need to be that good. You don't need to manufacture suggestibility. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4464.36s)]
*  If you, if they say, here's this guy, I need to split this guy and he's not very suggestible, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4468.36s)]
*  then your skills have to be high. But if I have high suggestibility in the target, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4472.4400000000005s)]
*  high authority in the person doing the programming, I have ultimate results. And it's not just this. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4476.92s)]
*  If I'm, if I'm a psychiatrist and I have high authority and I have a highly suggestible client, [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4482.4400000000005s)]
*  I can change their life for the better with the exact same things. So it's not just [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4487.639999999999s)]
*  Manchurian stuff. It's anybody trying to change another person needs that level of authority. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4492.92s)]
*  And I need to, my goal as a doctor, psychiatrist, coach, whatever, is to raise that person's [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4498.599999999999s)]
*  suggestibility so that my suggestions can change their life. Will you then let them be aware of [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4503.8s)]
*  what you did and how you did it and what the pathway is? If it's, if I'm helping someone? [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4509.96s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah. That's gotta be a mind fuck for them. You know, Roy Jones, junior, the boxer. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4515.88s)]
*  Of course. He's a friend of mine. Oh, I love that dude. Yeah, me too. And man, he's been through a [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4522.280000000001s)]
*  rough year. I don't know if you've heard or anything. No, he's been through a lot this year. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4528.92s)]
*  What, what happened? He lost his son. Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah, I think he was 21. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4532.52s)]
*  Oh, that's terrible. But Roy called me one day. I went down there to train Roy at Roy's house. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4537.4800000000005s)]
*  And he called me one day and he's like, Hey man, can you do this split personality thing on a [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4544.36s)]
*  fighter? And I said, Oh yeah. And as I'm telling him, yeah, I'm like, I've never done this. I [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4548.36s)]
*  didn't know if I could, but I was like, yeah, I'll get it done. He's like, I've got this guy going [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4553.799999999999s)]
*  into a fight in two days. It's in Vegas. Can you fly out and, and do the, do your work on this guy? [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4558.12s)]
*  So I essentially give him an alter ego, but it's not like created through massive trauma or anything [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4564.839999999999s)]
*  like that. It's kind of a fabricated, we use a little bit of like, a little bit of simulated [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4570.84s)]
*  trauma to make this thing happen. The dissociation part where it kind of separate from myself. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4576.360000000001s)]
*  And this guy had like the best fight of his life and this alter alter ego. You can ask Roy, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4581.96s)]
*  I told him not to get gassed out where you're not going to get gassed out or run out of air. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4588.280000000001s)]
*  Like you're going to always feel like you're satiated. Even if you're not, you're going to [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4594.12s)]
*  stay up and keep going. And the second is you're not going to feel any pain and you're going to be [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4597.32s)]
*  pure aggression and strategy and all this. Roy gave me this list of stuff. So this guy, this is [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4601.88s)]
*  a young fighter. He's like 28. I programmed him. It took me 48 hours total. Not with him, but like [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4607.08s)]
*  two days over the course of two days I programmed. And then he goes up. What's the thing where that [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4614.599999999999s)]
*  they take a picture looking at each other, whatever that's called. Yeah. So they go, they go to do that [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4619.08s)]
*  and his wife is off camera and somehow this being near the opponent turned on this thing. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4624.52s)]
*  And he just looks over at his wife, like just a glance at his wife and she picked their kid up [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4633.240000000001s)]
*  like there was a murderer in their house and they moved to another hotel temporarily. She's like, [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4641.080000000001s)]
*  that's not my husband, but we fix it to where we can turn it on and off anytime. But it scared her [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4647.160000000001s)]
*  because it's like that little altar part of that guy came on and looked at his wife and she did [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4653.08s)]
*  not recognize him. You know, Roy Jones Jr. had an alter ego. Really? Yeah. He didn't tell me about it. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4660.28s)]
*  Call himself RJ. He had Roy Jones and then RJ. RJ is when there's real problems. When RJ's out, [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4665.64s)]
*  you got real problems. Yeah. And when he fought Montel Griffin, you know, he had his first fight [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4675.24s)]
*  with Montel Griffin and Montel won by disqualification. Do you know that fight? [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4680.6s)]
*  No. So if something happened, I think it was a late punch or something happened. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4686.280000000001s)]
*  He might've been swinging when he went down and he hit him while he was going down or while he [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4694.04s)]
*  was down already. I don't remember exactly what happened, but I remember it was a disqualification [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4698.52s)]
*  and then Roy Jones was like, RJ's coming out. Wow. And then in the second fight, it was just [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4703.240000000001s)]
*  an obliteration. He just destroyed him quickly. Yeah. And when you would see Roy Jones, you know, [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4709.24s)]
*  like in his very best, he was like, first of all, he's probably the fastest super middleweight in [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4715.0s)]
*  the history of the sport and even light heavyweight. He was so fast, it didn't even make sense. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4725.639999999999s)]
*  There's some one-twos that he threw that you watch to this day and you swear they're sped up. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4730.679999999999s)]
*  No one moves that fast. He didn't even have a jab. He would throw a left hook off the lead hand. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4737.0s)]
*  He did everything different. He fucked everybody up because he didn't know what to do with it. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4743.16s)]
*  Everything was off. It was just different and he can move faster than everybody. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4748.2s)]
*  I remember him showing me, because I'm ignorant about the fighting world and all that, [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4754.36s)]
*  but he showed me how those punches look from a receiving end. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4758.44s)]
*  Those like that one, two, and then a couple more after that. It was terrifying. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4762.36s)]
*  Oh yeah, they're horrifying. You can't move quick enough. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4765.48s)]
*  It's done. Especially if you don't know what's happening. Your body has to be conditioned to [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4768.5199999999995s)]
*  movements. You see a movement, you react. You know if he's doing this, a punch is coming that way, [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4776.28s)]
*  I'm turning this way, I'm turning that way, if something's coming that way. If he throws the left, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4782.36s)]
*  the right is coming behind it, I'm ducking under. If you don't know what those patterns are, and [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4786.2s)]
*  then even if you do, Roy would move so fast it would fuck up your whole understanding of [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4792.28s)]
*  distance and timing. Everything would be off. He is. Yeah. It makes so much sense. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4799.16s)]
*  I see. In his prime, he was unstoppable. It was like every fight was an execution. He played a [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4805.48s)]
*  fucking full basketball game one day and then defended his title. Played a basketball game. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4811.639999999999s)]
*  And then after the basketball game, running around on the court, played, played well, [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4816.84s)]
*  and then defended his title. Just because he was playing with his food. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4821.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. He's a machine. He was truly a machine. He was so good, man. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4825.56s)]
*  And one of the nicest people I've ever met. Such a good guy. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4828.84s)]
*  Great guy. Great commentator as well. He's very good at boxing commentary. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4833.88s)]
*  But yeah, he had a split personality. Do you know the Mike Tyson story? [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4837.96s)]
*  No. So Mike Tyson, when he was 13, so Mike Tyson had a terrible childhood. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4841.88s)]
*  Bedford Stuyvesant in Brooklyn. It was just like horrible neighborhood crime and in and out of [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4847.16s)]
*  detention centers. He gets adopted when he's 13 by this guy, Custamato, who is one of the [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4854.280000000001s)]
*  greatest trainers of all time, but also a hypnotist. So Custamato starts hypnotizing Mike Tyson when [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4859.88s)]
*  he's 13 years old. Oh my gosh. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4866.280000000001s)]
*  And when he talks to him about fighting, he's like, you don't exist, only the task. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4868.52s)]
*  So all of the things like, what, maybe I'm not good enough. Maybe I'm not, maybe I'm this, [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4874.92s)]
*  maybe I'm that, maybe I'm a fraud. You don't exist. It's only the task. And you are going [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4879.56s)]
*  to be the greatest heavyweight champion of all time. That is such a great, great guy. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4886.52s)]
*  And if Cust didn't die, he had an unbelievable spectacular career, but you can tell the [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4891.64s)]
*  difference when Cust has gone. He doesn't have that mentor anymore. He doesn't have that [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4898.36s)]
*  leadership. And eventually it kind of falls apart for him. He wins the title when Cust had [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4902.12s)]
*  already been dead, but then defends the title. He was just unstoppable. He was so much better [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4908.28s)]
*  than everybody else, but slowly but surely up until the Buster Douglas fight, you see this [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4913.64s)]
*  deterioration of his discipline and he's sort of just resting on his laurels and fear. Everyone [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4920.76s)]
*  was so terrified of him. By the time they got into the ring, they were already beaten. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4926.44s)]
*  You'd see the look in their eye when he was staring at you. They'd be like, oh, fuck. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4930.360000000001s)]
*  And so if Cust was still alive, who knows what he would have accomplished? Who knows? He probably [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4934.12s)]
*  would have never lost. If Cust stayed alive, if Cust was slightly younger and was able to make it [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4942.12s)]
*  with him deep into his career, who knows? But hypnotized him when he was 13. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4947.08s)]
*  And that's early. I mean, you're still getting your formative identity and beliefs about the [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4953.0s)]
*  world. Also, you all of a sudden have love in your life. All of a sudden you have respect. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4957.64s)]
*  All of a sudden you have people who appreciate you for what you do. And so you really like dig [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4962.68s)]
*  into this thing. So Jim Jacobs was his manager and Jim Jacobs is also an archivist. He has [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4967.08s)]
*  the greatest archive of boxing films in the world, at the time. So he's got all the old fighters, [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4974.76s)]
*  Stanley Ketchel and Jack Johnson and Jack Dempsey. And so Mike Tyson, when he's not training, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4982.2s)]
*  is watching the greatest boxers of all time on film, which nobody has access to. Most boxers, [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4989.96s)]
*  you are as good as the gym you train in. If you're training in a gym with Tommy Hearns, [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=4996.679999999999s)]
*  like, damn, he is so good. And you learn by being around him and you see what he does and you try [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5000.36s)]
*  to emulate it. But the level of the best guys in the gym, it's always very top down. The best gyms [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5005.0s)]
*  always have some fucking assassins at the very top. World champions, top of the food chain guys, [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5011.08s)]
*  and everybody else sort of like follows their beat. And you absorb. Well, Mike Tyson was absorbing [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5017.8s)]
*  from everybody. He was absorbing from Joe Lewis and Sugar Ray Robinson. He was watching everybody. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5022.84s)]
*  Archie Moore, he was watching all the greats. Just hours and hours and hours and hours of studying [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5028.28s)]
*  films. So it was proximity. So it was everything. He got proximity and like exposure to all that [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5034.2s)]
*  nobody else and genetics. He was when he was 13 years old, he was 190 pounds. I had no idea. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5040.36s)]
*  Yeah. Teddy Atlas used to take him to what they call smokers. Smokers are like these amateur sort [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5048.04s)]
*  of unregulated fights. And they would say, how old is he? And you'd say 13, like bullshit. And you [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5053.48s)]
*  like, how old do you think he is? He's like 16. So they put him in with 16 year olds and he knocked [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5059.24s)]
*  them out. Oh my god. He was knocking everybody out. He was just a genetic freak on top of being [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5064.04s)]
*  very intelligent, but never really applied to anything other than boxing. Fully absorbed with [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5069.64s)]
*  boxing. Has a trainer who's one of the greatest trainers of all time. Trained Floyd Patterson, [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5075.400000000001s)]
*  Jose Torres. I mean, Custamato was a legendary world champion trainer. And then on top of that, [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5080.84s)]
*  he's a hypnotist. So he's like deeply involved in the psyche of his fighters. And he's a mentor [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5086.04s)]
*  figure to this kid. And so you have that combination of things and you have that guy, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5092.4400000000005s)]
*  the greatest. Mike Tyson at 79 at the age of 13. That's him at 13. Oh my gosh. Fuck. Look at the [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5096.52s)]
*  size of his biceps. Bro, look at his biceps. Look at his fucking right bicep at 13. That is insane. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5104.040000000001s)]
*  I know Muhammad Ali above that is 12 years old and Tyson's 13 and built like a tank. That is so crazy. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5111.0s)]
*  He's a monster. Oh, he was, everything was perfect. It was the perfect storm. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5117.96s)]
*  Intelligence, genetics, training, proximity. And he was around great fighters as well. He was in [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5123.240000000001s)]
*  gyms in the Catskills with some of the best fighters of his era. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5131.56s)]
*  Does he credit psychedelics for this transformation that he's made? [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5136.52s)]
*  He does talk about it. Yeah. He does talk about it. I'm sure it had an impact on him. That [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5141.160000000001s)]
*  marijuana, both those things had an impact on him. I mean, he's got to be, [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5146.200000000001s)]
*  not, I mean, just fighting for that long. Your brain's going through so much and you've got to [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5151.4800000000005s)]
*  come back to earth. It's like a dude coming off a five-year deployment or something over the Middle [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5157.400000000001s)]
*  East. You've got to reestablish yourself back to a normal. Yes. And I've heard him just talk about it [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5162.200000000001s)]
*  once where he talked about, I think it was just psilocybin. But that saved me from a lot of [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5167.64s)]
*  really crazy stuff as well. But I think he is just a guy who knows, I would be terrified. If I was a [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5176.04s)]
*  cop and pulled him over and he said, go ahead and get back in your car, I'd be like, okay. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5183.16s)]
*  When I first met him, well, I met him before this, but when he first did the podcast, [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5190.84s)]
*  he was not working out at all and he was smoking weed all day long. And he was silly and peaceful [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5195.48s)]
*  and relaxed. And he said he didn't want to work out because if he did, he would reignite his ego [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5203.72s)]
*  and he didn't want to do that. And then the second time I saw him was when he was preparing for the [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5208.92s)]
*  Roy Jones fight and he had lost like a hundred pounds. He was shredded and like all his muscles [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5213.16s)]
*  were just fucking big and thick and puffed up and he looked terrifying. It was like, and Jamie and [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5218.68s)]
*  I were like, that's a totally different person. Like from the first episode he did to the second [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5223.400000000001s)]
*  episode, completely different person, because he was Mike Tyson again. He was getting ready to [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5227.88s)]
*  fight again and he was fucking terrifying. And this is Mike Tyson again at 50. So imagine what [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5232.68s)]
*  Mike Tyson at 22 was like. I mean, it had to be fucking terrifying. I bet he won so many fights [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5239.8s)]
*  just psychologically. Just standing across the ring looking at that guy, even if I was a good [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5248.76s)]
*  fighter. I'm like, man. Yeah, everybody was terrified of him. You're standing there like, [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5253.96s)]
*  why am I doing this? Yeah. He had an aura and all the greats have auras like that. Roy Jones had [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5258.52s)]
*  that aura in his prime too, where you knew the fighter that he was facing was fucked. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5264.76s)]
*  And it, you know, eventually catches up with you. And it did with Mike, with Buster Douglas and [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5269.56s)]
*  then Vander Holyfield and some of the other fights after that. But, you know, when a fighter has that [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5273.88s)]
*  aura, it takes a very special, confident person to overcome that. And that's why winning a title is [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5279.0s)]
*  so difficult. It's so difficult to beat a champion. There's the psychological, especially if [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5286.76s)]
*  you've never had a championship fight and you're fighting someone like Anderson Silva in his prime [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5291.8s)]
*  who had just been dominating his division. This is your first world title fight. And you're fighting [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5297.16s)]
*  a guy who's been there, done that eight times, destroyed everybody in his path. And he's looking [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5302.2s)]
*  at you at the weigh-ins. He's not remotely nervous about you. And he's like smiling at you. And he [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5307.400000000001s)]
*  thinks he's just going to tear you apart. And it takes a person of very special psychological, [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5311.48s)]
*  you have to have a fortitude. Your mind has to be so fucking strong to be able to handle that [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5321.4s)]
*  moment. Because it's not just the physical fight of skills. It's also the moment. And the moment [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5328.759999999999s)]
*  is overwhelming. It's so different than everything else. You know, you want to talk about novelty. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5334.919999999999s)]
*  The novelty of a world title fight. Just imagine someone backstage at the UFC. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5340.28s)]
*  There's four fights before you get on. And you're watching people get knocked out and headkicked. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5346.84s)]
*  You're in the green room and you're in the locker rooms. And you're warming up. You're practicing. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5351.8s)]
*  You're hitting mitts. And you're thinking, what the fuck am I getting myself into? What am I doing? [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5356.759999999999s)]
*  And then you see Anderson Silva warming up. You're like, oh, Jesus Christ. What am I doing? You have [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5361.639999999999s)]
*  to have a very special mind to be able to overcome that. And I think it's one of the reasons why a [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5367.48s)]
*  lot of fighters today are seeking out mental coaches. It's very common. And I first found [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5374.12s)]
*  about it through my friend Vinny Shorman, who has worked with a lot of MMA fighters and a lot of [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5379.639999999999s)]
*  world championship kickboxers as well, and helped a lot of people with that. But there's quite a few [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5384.2s)]
*  different fighters now that utilize mental coaches and some sort of visualization coaching. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5390.12s)]
*  Where they have very specific goals in terms of how they want to walk out, what they want. They [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5399.08s)]
*  want to see the whole thing. There's guys like John Jones would famously walk out before the fight. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5405.8s)]
*  And he would move around the octagon. He would soak it all up. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5412.84s)]
*  Empty? Empty stadium? [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5417.08s)]
*  Yeah, when no one was there. Before everything. And we would get footage of it sometimes of him [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5418.2s)]
*  just moving around. He'd move around with his coaches. He just wanted to feel the floor under [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5422.2s)]
*  his feet. He wanted to see the cage. He wanted to get himself in that mindset. And John is, [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5426.44s)]
*  if not the greatest, one of the absolute greatest of all time. And he was meticulous and still is [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5432.36s)]
*  meticulous about his preparation. Meticulous about watching tape and footage and understanding who [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5439.08s)]
*  he's fighting, what their moves are, what they do, what their tells, what the mistakes they make, [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5444.84s)]
*  and then visualizing success. I think the visualization is so powerful. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5450.68s)]
*  Because he's winning 50, 100 times. He's winning that fight before it starts. And he's winning it [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5456.4400000000005s)]
*  so many times. And just going in the ring, you're programming that mammalian brain with the smells [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5463.08s)]
*  and the sounds and just the feel of everything. And it's such a great practice to establish for [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5469.0s)]
*  anybody. Yeah, as many bases as you can cover, right? Like the physical skills of fighting are [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5475.88s)]
*  so difficult to master. And you get to a certain level of ability where you do have confidence. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5482.04s)]
*  You do think you are the man and you could just dominate everybody. But the problem is when you're [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5488.68s)]
*  facing someone else who's also the man. He thinks he's the man too. And then you start questioning, [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5492.68s)]
*  maybe I'm wrong. Maybe what's happened to my opponents is now going to happen to me. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5497.4s)]
*  Maybe I'm going to get mine now. Fuck. And the doubts start creeping into your mind. And [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5501.64s)]
*  unless you have some sort of a system of how to organize your mind and how to mitigate all this [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5507.96s)]
*  anxiety and stress and how to think about things and concentrate only on the positive things, [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5515.88s)]
*  only on what you are going to do. Not all that bullshit. And I think that's it. It's about [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5521.8s)]
*  rehearsal. And it's the way that top CEOs do it and everybody is they're rehearsing all the [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5527.4800000000005s)]
*  good things happening in their head all the time. They have this general belief that things are [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5533.400000000001s)]
*  going to be great. And the guy that's psyching himself out before a fight, maybe it only takes [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5537.56s)]
*  a second, but he's rehearsing a loss. He's rehearsing these little bad things happening. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5543.56s)]
*  The mammalian brain doesn't speak English at all. So it's saying, okay, this is like we're [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5548.4400000000005s)]
*  preparing for this. I'm going to try to make this happen. It's the same thing when you're [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5554.04s)]
*  searching for a car on the internet and you finally go buy it after a month and you see it [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5557.96s)]
*  all over the place. You're telling your brain what to search for and seek out. It's so true. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5562.2s)]
*  And that's our particular formation inside of our brain. So with these fighters, if I'm rehearsing [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5568.2s)]
*  on purpose, then I'm more likely to win. If I'm rehearsing on accident by worrying, worrying is [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5574.2s)]
*  rehearsal. And that's one of the things I talked to Roy about with his guys that he trains. If I [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5579.96s)]
*  worry once, that's rehearsal. That's one rehearsal practice checked off the box. And I got to do one [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5586.5199999999995s)]
*  more to cancel that out. It's mental rehearsal. Rehearsal. That's interesting. Yeah. And just [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5592.76s)]
*  be, you have to also be aware of things that can go wrong. If you do drop your hands, can go wrong. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5600.6s)]
*  If you do not move your head off the center line, if there's something that you do that's a mistake, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5606.360000000001s)]
*  there's real consequences. So you probably, a little bit of fear is very good for you. Like [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5610.68s)]
*  one of the things that fighters talk about is having flat performances because they came in too [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5616.360000000001s)]
*  confident and then they start getting beat up and they can't shift gears. Like they can't get to the [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5620.52s)]
*  fear part because the fear is kind of over once you start fighting. Like when I was competing, [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5626.28s)]
*  I was always terrified up until the fight, but when the fight is happening, you're not scared at all. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5631.5599999999995s)]
*  You're just reacting. You're moving and you just, I mean, you probably get scared if you're getting [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5635.8s)]
*  hurt, if you're getting battered and you're against the ropes and you're getting fucked up. But [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5640.44s)]
*  for the most part, you're not scared. You're just, you're in this Zen state. You're in this state of [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5645.48s)]
*  just letting your training do the work. But the lead up to it, the lead up to it is where everybody [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5651.4s)]
*  freaks out. That's where the real fear comes. And it's just mitigating that until you can get in there. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5656.5199999999995s)]
*  And then once you get in there, you're really not scared. That makes perfect sense. It's the same [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5663.5599999999995s)]
*  thing in the military. Like if you're getting into a gunfight or something, there's fear before [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5668.759999999999s)]
*  and not during. And that's the same thing. And if, so I would imagine there'd be fear during as well, [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5673.4s)]
*  though, no? I've, I mean, I don't want to speak for myself. I've talked to a lot of dudes that just [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5678.44s)]
*  kind of everything goes quiet. It's a mental stillness because we go through a lot of training [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5683.48s)]
*  that gets you ready for a lot of those scenarios. I could, man, I could show you a video after this. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5690.12s)]
*  That'll be fun. But they had this program where like they put a black bag over your head [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5695.32s)]
*  and there's a bunch of dudes that are mostly like retired operators, dudes. And every few minutes, [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5700.36s)]
*  this black bag that you can't see through, and it's not like a plastic bag, it's just like a hood. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5707.56s)]
*  And you're sitting there just holding your gun and they rip this bag off your head. There's a [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5712.84s)]
*  circle on the ground. It's like five feet wide and you can't step out of it. You can't take a knee. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5716.68s)]
*  Those are the only rules. And for these, there's a scenario playing out in front of you. Every time [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5720.6s)]
*  the bag comes off and these guys are wearing like Arabic style clothes and the Middle Eastern style [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5727.64s)]
*  clothes, they're blaring crazy music and explosions in your head while the hood is on. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5733.72s)]
*  The hood gets ripped off. It's like 40 seconds long. You don't know what to expect. You have [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5739.400000000001s)]
*  no idea what's going to happen. And these guys, they're wearing little masks and you have simulated [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5743.240000000001s)]
*  ammunition. Some will try to kill you. Some might run up to you really fast and ask for directions. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5749.08s)]
*  And you never know what's going to happen. And for these dudes to go down, they're all going to try [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5757.400000000001s)]
*  to shoot you first. If they shoot you first, you start the day over. And it's like 11 hours. It's [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5761.8s)]
*  grueling process. So they keep- What is the purpose of this? What are they trying to achieve? [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5768.12s)]
*  There's a few things. Your aim, like I need to get better at target acquisition. So like I do [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5775.72s)]
*  something here and I know something over here and I'm going to rotate over to this next thing that [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5782.52s)]
*  I have to deal with. And after days and days and days of this, you get very good. Like it's [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5788.44s)]
*  nowhere near that level, but you walk out of there feeling like, yeah, I'm John Wick now. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5796.839999999999s)]
*  But they get you to a level and the instructors don't go down unless you hit them twice in the [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5801.0s)]
*  base of the nose. So like you can shoot them in the chest and they'll slow down or they'll take a knee. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5805.16s)]
*  What happened? My headphones stopped working. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5814.36s)]
*  Really? Yeah, they're good now. Okay. So like they'll slow down, but you hit them [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5816.76s)]
*  twice in the base of the nose and they go down. They'll drop. And that's like the brain stem. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5823.96s)]
*  You have to sever the brain stem. And it's days and days and days of this and you can't step out [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5828.76s)]
*  of the circle. And- What is the simulated ammunition? Like what are they using? It's a real bullet [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5834.44s)]
*  inside of a real gun. So it's like the Beretta I deployed with. But you take the barrel out and [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5839.72s)]
*  you put in this smaller barrel and it's a real bullet, but the tip of it's like wax and it's [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5845.72s)]
*  filled with like hot pink laundry detergent essentially. Like a little paintball, but it's [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5852.76s)]
*  inside of a bullet, inside of a real bullet. You're going to have a problem with that [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5858.360000000001s)]
*  fucking watch. I know. It's on airplane mode. I had one of those once. I wore it for one day [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5863.08s)]
*  and it was buzzing during a podcast. I was like, all right, fuck this thing. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5870.44s)]
*  Now it's going to go off over there and you're going to have to reach for it. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5875.16s)]
*  So these are the bullets that they use? Paintball training bullets. And so- Look at that, Joe. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5877.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, airplane mode. Maybe it's someone important calling you. Isn't there like people on your list? [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5883.879999999999s)]
*  Nope. Yeah, that's it. So those things, they just splatter on your face? Is that what it is? [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5888.12s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, the guys are wearing masks and stuff like that. Right. And- [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5895.32s)]
*  But if it hits that area, then you go down or you're done. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5899.0s)]
*  And then it's a lot of critical judgment and decision-making. There might be a guy that walks [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5904.6s)]
*  up to you and he's holding an axe over his shoulder, but it's just like a farmer. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5909.8s)]
*  Because maybe the younger guys are like, oh, there's a dude, there's a weapon, he needs to die. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5913.88s)]
*  Right. But he has no intent. Right? So you can't just shoot people because they have a weapon over [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5917.64s)]
*  there. So it's a really good training for judgment and just that fast decision-making. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5924.12s)]
*  Okay. And so this is just to sort of condition them so that when a battle takes place, [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5931.5599999999995s)]
*  it'll be sort of automatic to fall into these patterns that they've learned. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5936.68s)]
*  Yeah. And they may say this in other parts of the world, but they say you're going to default to [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5941.32s)]
*  the lowest level of your training. The lowest level that you've repeated thousands of times. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5945.8s)]
*  Right. That'll be your default. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5949.8s)]
*  So it's interesting that you worked with one fighter. Have you worked with any fighters since then? [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5951.32s)]
*  Two other guys I've worked with. Just through Roy. I mostly work with CEOs that need a break [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5959.32s)]
*  from a bunch of limiting crap that's holding them back or business people. But two other fighters [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5965.8s)]
*  that I've worked with. And you can watch this guy's fight. He's not gassed out. He's sitting [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5970.6s)]
*  in the corner and the other guy's just heaving and his chest is still. And you can see, [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5974.2s)]
*  the announcers even say it in the fight, that he's not making any facial expressions. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5979.56s)]
*  What's his name? Man, I can't remember. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5982.76s)]
*  Hold on. I'll find it. Okay. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5987.4800000000005s)]
*  But it's on YouTube. The fight is on YouTube. I'll bring it up. Bryant Perella. Bryant Perella [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5991.400000000001s)]
*  is his name. Jamie will find it. And the announcers are even saying he's not making [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=5999.08s)]
*  facial expressions when he's getting hit. It's like Terminator. His face was just [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6003.48s)]
*  completely straight. There's a guy that was one of the greatest heavyweights of all time out of [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6008.5199999999995s)]
*  Russia. His name was Fedor Emelianenko. And he fought in Pride, which was this enormous [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6013.639999999999s)]
*  organization in Japan in the early 2000s. And he was famous for having a completely stoic [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6018.36s)]
*  expression no matter what happened. That'd be terrifying to me. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6024.679999999999s)]
*  Oh, he was the most terrifying. And because he was so skillful as well. But I wonder what they [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6027.24s)]
*  taught him in terms of like, how to keep your mind in check in the middle of chaos. Because, [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6032.2s)]
*  I mean, he'd be in these fucking wars and just his facial expression never changed. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6040.2s)]
*  There's this famous fight with him and Kevin Randleman. Kevin Randleman was this elite [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6045.639999999999s)]
*  American wrestler. And he suplexes Fedor on his head, like on his neck and on his head. And his [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6050.92s)]
*  expression never changes. In the middle of getting thrown through the air, slammed onto the ground, [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6057.56s)]
*  then moments later, he catches Kevin in an arm bar. Wow. Yeah, it was crazy. He was just like, [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6063.0s)]
*  never changed. Never changed his face. Just calm. He might be having a cup of coffee at a local [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6068.92s)]
*  cafe. I bet it was what you were talking about earlier. Well, like you don't exist. You don't [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6075.88s)]
*  exist. And it was what I'm teaching to these fighters and what I'm programming these fighters [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6080.4400000000005s)]
*  to do is essentially the same thing. You don't exist. There's another part of you that's going [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6084.76s)]
*  to take over for this entire experience. And this part of you is more than capable. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6089.08s)]
*  So did you talk to Roy about like what fighters experience, like what to work on? [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6095.64s)]
*  So what did Roy tell you? Roy said that the three most important things are, I don't want him to [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6103.08s)]
*  get gassed out too fast, which is like when, maybe that's a common term. A lot of it. Yeah, [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6108.2s)]
*  there's a lot of his anxiety, adrenaline dump. Yeah. And feeling like you're running out of air. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6113.16s)]
*  Yeah. And I want him to be immune to pain, which is obviously not completely possible. We can get [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6118.2s)]
*  close to him feeling as so confident that the pain doesn't matter. And he wanted him to be [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6125.96s)]
*  completely hell bent on destroying this other guy. Those are like Roy's three things. And he said, [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6133.24s)]
*  you add in whatever you want. So I added in some, because a couple of those things are symptoms. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6139.96s)]
*  So I wanted to figure out what's the root cause of this. Like if I'm just hell bent on [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6144.76s)]
*  taking this guy out, the root cause of that might be anger and just being extremely mad [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6149.24s)]
*  and angry at somebody. Generally speaking, they tell you that that's not a good emotion to take [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6157.96s)]
*  inside the ring because anger will, anger is an emotion and emotions will cause you to, [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6162.28s)]
*  like Yuri Prochazka says, go into another line. So instead of doing what you should be doing in [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6168.84s)]
*  the flow, you might push things. So you might be a little too aggressive and open yourself up to [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6176.28s)]
*  counters. You might not be defensively responsible because you're really only thinking about offense, [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6182.4400000000005s)]
*  whereas you have to kind of be in the zone of both things at the same time and knowing when to attack [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6188.2s)]
*  and when not to attack. That makes a lot of sense. Yeah. A lot of people don't think, but then there's [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6193.400000000001s)]
*  fighters that fight angry and they're very successful. If you know a guy, I'll do it for you. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6198.44s)]
*  It'd be interesting. Anybody you want. Well, there's a lot of UFC fighters probably listening [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6203.48s)]
*  to this right now like, me? I'm sure you'll get people that are interested in it because everyone [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6206.5199999999995s)]
*  knows that there's a huge psychological aspect to fighting. Everyone knows that. No one denies that. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6212.36s)]
*  No one thinks you could just be skillful and just be, you know, and everyone knows there's a [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6218.919999999999s)]
*  psychological aspect of it that's very, very, very important. And if you could do something [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6224.04s)]
*  that would strengthen that the same way you do something that strengthens your cardio or [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6228.36s)]
*  strengthens your power, you would think that that would be very beneficial. Huge advantage. Tiger [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6232.28s)]
*  Woods had an on-call hypnotist. Did he? Really? Yeah. An on-call hypnotist. Yeah, like a guy that [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6237.96s)]
*  I think traveled with them many, many times. So he had a regular hypnotist that he saw. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6243.24s)]
*  And I think it's a tremendous advantage. And if you can get it to a point, so like I had been [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6249.16s)]
*  training all these CEOs, a couple of politicians that I've worked with that needed this breakthrough [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6255.88s)]
*  of confidence and authority and all this other stuff. So I always had this way to like turn this [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6262.679999999999s)]
*  thing on. There was like an on switch to activate this little alter ego thing. And for all the [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6267.96s)]
*  fighters, I had to figure out something else because they couldn't use their hands. Their [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6275.16s)]
*  hands are all, you know, gloved up and taped up and all that, all that kind of stuff. But I figured [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6278.12s)]
*  out with the fighter, like there was so much, it was almost like a little psychopath when this [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6283.16s)]
*  thing came on. And you can see it in Bryant's face on this fight. And you have footage of him, Jamie? [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6288.28s)]
*  I was looking at Tiger's. I got lost into that. I found the guy, but. Oh, you found who it was? [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6296.04s)]
*  Jay Brunza is his name. Jay Brunza? It was when he was younger. He also he catted for him. So he [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6301.72s)]
*  was around with him all the time. Oh, Tiger Woods. We were talking about Roy Jones, Jr. fighter. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6307.88s)]
*  That's like having your corner man, your hypnotist. That is kind of crazy. Every time in the corner. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6312.76s)]
*  All right. And sleep. So he traveled around with them all the time. Well, I would imagine, look, [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6316.360000000001s)]
*  if you're doing something like golf where there's millions of dollars on the line and that is [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6320.84s)]
*  clearly a very, very much a mental game. Yeah. There's a lot of thinking and calculating and [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6325.64s)]
*  being in the zone and golf that totally makes sense. That would be effective. And it's so [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6331.4800000000005s)]
*  different. It's so similar, though, to fighting. It's a very mental game. Like, can I stay here? [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6336.6s)]
*  Can I be present? Can I figure out what's going on? And keep in mind, I know nothing about [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6342.4400000000005s)]
*  fighting. But I know a whole lot about the brain and how people work. You know, it's interesting [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6348.280000000001s)]
*  because what you're saying kind of applies to standup comedy, too, because I have we've talked [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6353.72s)]
*  about this a bunch of times in the green room of the club. I think standup comedy is hypnosis. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6358.84s)]
*  I think it's kind of a mass hypnosis because I feel hypnotized when someone's really good. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6364.280000000001s)]
*  When someone's just as not even as a person who does it, but as an audience member, [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6368.92s)]
*  when someone's really good, I'm allowing them to kind of think for me. You know, I'm going with the [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6374.280000000001s)]
*  way they think about things. When someone's really funny and I really enjoy watching them, [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6380.04s)]
*  I'm in their mind. They're taking me on a journey. They're like holding my hand and telling me where [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6384.92s)]
*  we're going. And if someone's really good, you let them. I've never thought about that before. But [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6390.92s)]
*  that's it. That's you're you're bypassing your own critical factor where I'm not criticizing [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6396.6s)]
*  this information because it's funny. Right. I want to hear it. Yeah. That's why jokes work [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6400.84s)]
*  when you know the person doesn't really believe that they don't want to, you know, [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6406.36s)]
*  they're saying crazy shit, but you're laughing anyway because you know what they're doing. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6409.88s)]
*  They're just taking you on a fun ride. It's like a fun ride through jokes. And when you're [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6413.639999999999s)]
*  doing it, there's this moment that you want to achieve where you're essentially a passenger. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6420.36s)]
*  You're not even really the driver as the as the as a comedian. Yeah, you're kind of the passenger [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6428.92s)]
*  and the the set sort of takes over and you are just going with where it wants to go. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6435.240000000001s)]
*  And when the subjects come up, if you're not completely invested in what that subject is, [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6443.0s)]
*  the audience knows you can say the words the right way with the right timing and they won't work. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6450.120000000001s)]
*  There's like something about it. But if you're locked in, the audience gets locked in with you. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6456.04s)]
*  And it's the difference between someone who can't figure it out and someone who becomes [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6462.52s)]
*  successful. It's like realizing that you can't talk about something while you're not thinking [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6466.76s)]
*  about it. You have to be thinking about that thing and you have to be invested in it. It has [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6472.200000000001s)]
*  to be real to you. It has to be something you're really interested in. And then the audience gets [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6477.56s)]
*  interested in it as well. Yeah, that is so true. Yeah, it's a form of hypnosis, I think. In the [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6482.04s)]
*  second, I mean, one big part of hypnosis, something called fractionation. Are you familiar with this? [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6488.28s)]
*  No. So it's fractionation is where like I would put you into a trance and that would bring you [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6492.12s)]
*  almost all the way out to where your eyes are kind of opening again and then send you back down again [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6497.4s)]
*  and you go deeper. So in comedy and in conversations, you can do this to people where it's like a super [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6501.16s)]
*  fun thing, then really depressing or scary thing, fun thing, scary thing. Scroll through your social [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6506.679999999999s)]
*  media feed. It's fractionation as well. But it increases suggestibility. And one of the only, [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6511.64s)]
*  one of the best guys I've seen is like Mitch Hedberg could pull people in. Oh, yeah. Man, [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6519.72s)]
*  he was such an awesome dude when it came to that stuff. You know why he could pull people in though [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6525.72s)]
*  is because people knew what to expect when you went to see Mitch Hedberg. Mitch Hedberg's struggle was [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6530.76s)]
*  the early days when people didn't know who he was. And if you schedule the show badly, [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6537.64s)]
*  like say if you have like an opening act that's high energy and then a middle act, the worst is [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6544.120000000001s)]
*  like if a middle act does like singing and songs and stuff, and then he's very non sequitur, deadpan, [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6548.68s)]
*  one funny line after another absurdities. It's all absurd. And you know, sometimes it didn't [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6556.04s)]
*  catch on. Like he had to become famous. And then people wanted to go see him knowing what they were [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6561.320000000001s)]
*  going to go see. Yeah. That makes so much sense. Yeah. And then he's kind of like a Steven Wright. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6566.84s)]
*  Yes. Very similar. Non sequiturs and wacky observations. Yeah. Wow. I would have never [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6571.88s)]
*  considered that. So people have to have a degree of expectancy. Well, not always. I mean, sometimes [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6580.68s)]
*  people just appreciate it because it's funny. But the show has to be structured correctly. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6585.88s)]
*  Like if, like I said, if someone goes on before and it's a rowdy crowd and they're singing and [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6590.2s)]
*  they do some fucking backflips or something crazy and you get used to that person, like this big [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6594.84s)]
*  reaction from the audience. And then you got a guy there with sunglasses on that someone asked me if [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6599.32s)]
*  I want a frozen banana. I said, no, but I want a regular banana later. So yes. Like it's like, [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6603.56s)]
*  what the fuck are you talking about? Like you have to be a Mitch Hedberg fan or know what he's doing [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6609.64s)]
*  to appreciate that. Yeah. But once he became famous, then it was awesome because then he was [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6615.400000000001s)]
*  free. So then he could just be himself. He didn't have to worry about like they were coming to see [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6620.76s)]
*  him. So then he could just like really like excel. Yeah. So what I teach, I want to see if you can [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6625.400000000001s)]
*  relate this to comedy somehow. I teach, you know, we talked about what influences the mammalian brain, [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6633.400000000001s)]
*  focus, authority, tribe and emotion, those four things and no language involved whatsoever. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6638.92s)]
*  And then the human brain has six things and it seems like expectancy is one of those things. So [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6644.68s)]
*  it's focus, openness, connection, suggestibility, compliance and expectancy. And I think you only [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6650.76s)]
*  need three. If you get three, you can get compliance from anybody. Like the Milgram experiment, [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6658.44s)]
*  there's no openness, there's no connection and there's no expectancy. They don't know what to [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6663.24s)]
*  expect is next. So the Milgram experiment only got three and made people murderers. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6667.88s)]
*  Only three. So as a comic, if you're on stage, you have to generate that focus. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6673.72s)]
*  You want to create some level of openness with the people in the crowd so they're open to [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6680.68s)]
*  receiving and suggestibility, I guess would have to be in there. Right. And connection would be [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6684.92s)]
*  a huge one. Yeah. There's a lot of things going on. But there's so much that goes into planning [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6691.64s)]
*  a show that I never thought about until just when you said that. You have to keep the energy [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6697.32s)]
*  level at the right balance. You also have to have the right mindset before you go on stage. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6701.16s)]
*  The worst thing that can happen is before you go on stage, something happens that throws you off. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6706.679999999999s)]
*  You get a phone call from a loved one, something goes wrong at your house, you're in a car accident, [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6711.88s)]
*  something happens before you go on stage and you're fucked up. That's a bad one. Yeah. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6717.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. That happened to me yesterday. What happened? Because you've got the biggest show, [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6723.16s)]
*  I think, in the world, biggest podcast in the world. And for the first time in a year and a [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6727.88s)]
*  half, I had seizures yesterday. Oh my God. Just yesterday. You think it's because of this show? [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6732.12s)]
*  The show put you into a seizure? I forgot to take methylene blue for three days straight. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6736.5199999999995s)]
*  And the seizures came back. Wow. How bad was it? They were like a minute and a half. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6742.44s)]
*  But one of them, we were on the way to a restaurant and I was like holding our daughter, who's like [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6747.4s)]
*  13 months old. Oh Jesus. But it's not like a crazy seizure, it's just like your head falls down. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6752.44s)]
*  But I thought like, yeah, I'm going to have a seizure on Rogan. Oh no. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6759.719999999999s)]
*  If it happened, I would beg you to keep it in. Have there been studies on methylene blue and [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6765.879999999999s)]
*  seizures? Are doctors recommending this stuff? Absolutely. I've published papers on it. So [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6770.919999999999s)]
*  doctors are backing it up. There's tons and tons of studies. And these are major universities. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6777.32s)]
*  It's not like Jimbo's College down in Mexico City or something. These are major universities, [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6782.2s)]
*  neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's, Myasthenia Gravis, ALS, and epileptic disorders. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6787.88s)]
*  So anybody that's got epilepsy, this is neuroprotective and then it's also [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6795.88s)]
*  neurogenerative. It helps you to get to a point where you can make new neurons and it [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6801.5599999999995s)]
*  helps your mitochondria so much, your neuron mitochondria. Wow. And like mitochondria make [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6806.52s)]
*  up 6% of your body weight. It's like we got a lot. Really? Yeah. We have a ton. And they [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6812.52s)]
*  don't have human DNA. I thought you might like that. What does mitochondria have? It's its own DNA. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6819.96s)]
*  They think it was like original from bacteria and then formed a relationship with single [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6826.68s)]
*  celled organisms and then became human or became animals, mammals. And mitochondria do not have, [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6831.88s)]
*  do not share DNA with humans. Whoa. And they power ourselves. It's pretty cool. And methylene blue [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6839.0s)]
*  helps them. Yes. There's a whole lot. And the reason red light is effective is because of this [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6846.92s)]
*  chemical called cytochrome c oxidase. And it's absorbing so much of that red light to where [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6852.84s)]
*  there's photons going down into the mitochondria helping to generate ATP. I'm not like saying click [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6858.84s)]
*  the link down below or anything like that. It saved my life. Is there anything that people should [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6867.96s)]
*  be worried about with that stuff? Like other than taking SSRIs, what happens if you take too much of [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6872.92s)]
*  it? I'm not a doctor. But taking too much of it can be toxic. But I mean taking too much aspirin [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6879.08s)]
*  will do the same thing. Right. So it's hormesis is what they call this where like at the right [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6886.04s)]
*  amount it's helpful. So that's a hormetic effect. And what's the effect of dose again per body weight? [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6891.32s)]
*  My dose, I can't tell anybody what to do. But the dose I take is about one to two milligrams per [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6897.8s)]
*  kilogram per day. And then I'll take one day off like once a week. Maybe. Sometimes I just keep going. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6904.6s)]
*  So if I'm 70 kilograms and I'm taking two milligrams per kilogram, I'm gonna take 140 [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6911.0s)]
*  milligrams per day all at one time. Usually just in the morning. And it is so cool. I've heard people [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6920.84s)]
*  say that they feel a cognitive benefit from it as well. Oh yeah. Yeah. I think it's just generating a [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6930.04s)]
*  lot more energy in your brain because there's ATP just going out everywhere. This sounds like [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6936.68s)]
*  one of those things though where we're talking about this. I'm like man one day this is gonna [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6941.64s)]
*  bite everybody in the ass. Like this sounds like one of those ones where it's almost too good to be [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6945.56s)]
*  true. I know it's backed by 120 years of research. I was just googling the weight of them and this is [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6950.6s)]
*  the best I could find. Okay it says due to their tiny size individual mitochondria weigh an incredibly [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6957.16s)]
*  small amount, particularly negligible but collectively in the human body total weight of [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6961.72s)]
*  all mitochondria we estimate the range of a few milligrams. However the exact rate can be dependent [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6965.96s)]
*  on factors like body mass and cell type. Well that doesn't sound like six percent of your body. I [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6972.04s)]
*  don't think that's correct. But that's AI overview. It can't be wrong. Oh that's right. Sorry. Um [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6976.04s)]
*  interesting. Where did you hear this from? A professor of mine. So maybe. Maybe he's dealing [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6983.64s)]
*  with old information. Might be. Yeah a few milligrams definitely not six percent of your body weight. I think [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6987.8s)]
*  it's a lot more than that. Okay but either way it's a part of your body. And it's like the most [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6994.04s)]
*  important thing in our bodies is mitochondria. So we we get inflammation and we have all these [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=6999.72s)]
*  disorders. It starts with some kind of dysfunction with mitochondria most of the time as I understand [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7004.76s)]
*  it. So the doctor that got me on this mitochondria or mitochondrial health regimen which is [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7010.68s)]
*  is [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7016.92s)]
*  and this is like 200 milligrams. And do you take during the day? Oh no. Melatonin at night. Right around [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7020.52s)]
*  sunset where my body's kind of naturally wanting to get some. I've heard people talk about the side effects of [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7027.4800000000005s)]
*  melatonin and that the taking exogenous melatonin it might not be the best idea. Melatonin doesn't [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7032.84s)]
*  have a rebound. It doesn't. No. So it doesn't have an effect on your body's ability to produce it either? [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7039.72s)]
*  No. No. No. So there's no negative side effects? Well people think there's negative side effects of [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7045.4s)]
*  everything right? There could be. That's one of the problems with the muddy murky waters of health [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7050.5199999999995s)]
*  and nutrition. It's hard to know who's correct because there's a bunch of air quote experts on [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7055.719999999999s)]
*  both sides. There's yeah what I'm saying is it's correct for me because it's solving the problem of [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7061.639999999999s)]
*  me like when my daughter was born my daughter was born on Christmas Eve 2023 when I was driving my [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7068.28s)]
*  wife to the hospital at that time I didn't know who she was. Really? Yeah. So you had seized up? [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7076.28s)]
*  No I mean something was wrong. It my hippocampus was like eating itself at that time. I knew that [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7083.72s)]
*  she was a friend. I knew that she was important to me. What? You literally didn't know she was [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7090.12s)]
*  your wife? Didn't know she was my wife. I took selfies with her going into the hospital. She's [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7094.52s)]
*  pregnant going into labor and delivery but I knew that if I could fake it for 10 or 15 minutes when [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7099.320000000001s)]
*  this thing like wears off because I'd have these like weird phases that my brain went through. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7105.88s)]
*  If I could fake it for 10 or 15 minutes then it'll come back to me. Wow! What a mind fuck. It's [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7110.68s)]
*  terrifying in that like you won't like you're losing everything. You lose everything without [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7116.360000000001s)]
*  losing your life. Well also you're wondering what if this is permanent? What if I am like what is [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7122.44s)]
*  that movie Memento? Remember that movie? Oh yeah. The dude had to write everything down on his arms. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7128.12s)]
*  Tattoos across his chest. Because he didn't know what the fuck was going on. Yeah. Yeah. And he had [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7131.96s)]
*  that Polaroid camera that he carried around. Yeah. It's a good movie. Great movie. But it's scary in [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7136.36s)]
*  that like you were not there. It's like it's kind of like an Alzheimer's thing. Yeah. But it was [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7141.48s)]
*  different in that like I spent with this hippocampal problem sclerosis and this [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7146.76s)]
*  temporal lobe epilepsy. I thought my dog was fake. Fake. Jesus. Like I saw somebody like planted this [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7152.68s)]
*  animal here and it's not a real thing. Were you paranoid when someone did this? Not at all. Were [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7159.88s)]
*  you like why is this fake dog here? There is paranoia like we were before a temporal lobe seizure [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7166.2s)]
*  happens. There's so much deja vu that it feels like you're going down a roller coaster. Like [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7172.52s)]
*  you're falling off a building. That kind of pit of your stomach feeling. So you look around and [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7177.88s)]
*  you're like there's no way that all of this is not set up. Someone set this up. So there is paranoia [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7183.080000000001s)]
*  there like right as a seizure starts because everything starts looking like I've seen every [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7191.320000000001s)]
*  single detail right here before someone's setting me up and then boom seizure starts. Jesus. It's [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7196.360000000001s)]
*  horrible man. But mine stopped. If I stop taking methylene then seizures start. Now I'm not saying [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7201.88s)]
*  anybody's got to go to the same website as me. You can get it on Amazon. It's nice and cheap. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7207.4800000000005s)]
*  Is there anything else that affects it? Like your diet, drinking? Is there anything that? Yeah. If [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7211.08s)]
*  I eat a lot of carbs definitely. So like a low carb keto diet is what they recommend for Alzheimer's [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7216.68s)]
*  and all kinds of brain disorders. Cancer as well. Yeah. Yeah. It's so helpful for your body. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7224.2s)]
*  So I have a low carb, super low carb diet and try to remember that methylene blue every day. And I [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7231.4800000000005s)]
*  do red light therapy at home. I have a huge helmet thing that goes down. It's a red light laser [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7237.72s)]
*  system that's supposed to penetrate your skull and your body like four inches. So I do that about [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7242.92s)]
*  once a day for about 20 minutes. Jesus. It's badass. It's cool. It looks like one of those [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7248.92s)]
*  hairdryers from like an old hair salon. It sounds cool but I always think like how much [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7253.8s)]
*  electricity around your brain is a good thing. Like is people telling you not to have earbuds [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7259.4800000000005s)]
*  in anymore? Yeah. Yeah. Have you had Jack Cruz? No. Yeah I know he is. Yeah. I've heard so much [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7264.360000000001s)]
*  of what he said. It looks like I've stopped using. Have you heard him break down SV-40? Horrifying. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7273.400000000001s)]
*  That's very interesting. Yeah. Very interesting. I would love. A semi-invirus that's connected to [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7280.76s)]
*  some vaccines. I hope someone looks into it. Yeah. I talked to Brett Weinstein about it and he [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7286.04s)]
*  explained it to me. It's crazy. Like they used monkey kidney cells as the basis for certain [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7290.68s)]
*  vaccines not knowing that they were going to infect these vaccines with this SV-40 and it causes cancer. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7299.0s)]
*  Yeah. Awful. Yeah. And it's just like I'm so I'm not educated on medicine. So like I don't know like [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7306.76s)]
*  is that a common thing? Have they done it with a whole bunch of other stuff and we're just looking [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7314.360000000001s)]
*  at this one thing? I don't think I'm educated enough on that to know a lot about it but hearing [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7317.96s)]
*  Jack describe that was terrifying. Just terrifying. Yeah. And there's so many other things that are [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7324.280000000001s)]
*  coming out just one after the other with this stuff that was going on with the vaccines and all [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7332.92s)]
*  that. If I could even say that word. Well you can now that Robert F Kennedy Jr. is the head of HHS. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7337.8s)]
*  Yeah. It's going to be interesting to see what he uncovers. Can we do a P break? Yeah. Take a P break. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7344.36s)]
*  Okay. We'll be right back. So what are you saying about what you teach the government? [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7351.0s)]
*  So we teach the government guys like PSYOPs guys a lot and we teach them a system called [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7356.6s)]
*  neurocognitive intelligence. It's essentially how do I identify in a population or one person [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7364.68s)]
*  some behavioral patterns and if I can identify behavioral patterns then I can predict future [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7371.8s)]
*  behavior and if I can predict it I can influence it to another direction and it's pretty easy if [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7376.04s)]
*  you just kind of get these basics down and the like the first thing that we teach is this thing [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7380.84s)]
*  called the childhood triangle and this is what did I do around the age of eight for safety friends [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7385.72s)]
*  and rewards. So how did I what did I do to feel safe? What did I do to make or keep friends and [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7392.52s)]
*  what did I do to get some kind of reward for some kids a reward was like their parents complementing [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7398.04s)]
*  them some kids a reward was like water or food you know depending on your life how you were brought [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7403.400000000001s)]
*  up but if you look at adult behavior when you see these patterns of how adults deal with conflict [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7407.96s)]
*  you're seeing most of the time how they dealt with conflict as a kid because we're carrying [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7415.24s)]
*  all these childhood patterns into adulthood all the time it is so common so when we have a habit [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7420.2s)]
*  of dealing with conflict even in a relationship not even a work thing we're spotting these little [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7428.599999999999s)]
*  childhood patterns of safety friends and rewards almost all the time and if I can spot that that's [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7434.12s)]
*  like our step one of developing a pretty deep behavior profile of a human being [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7439.96s)]
*  does that make any sense? Yeah it does. Okay and then step two is identify social needs and this [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7446.04s)]
*  is like what what do we need from other people and there's six six of these and this is like [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7451.4800000000005s)]
*  significance acceptance approval intelligence pity and strength and of course that's not all [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7457.08s)]
*  human needs but those are the six that that you can spot pretty easily and that you can leverage [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7463.4800000000005s)]
*  pretty easily when it's persuasion and influence if I'm if I'm training an intelligence guy to go [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7469.56s)]

*  understanding what's being revealed in a conversation so if I hear a person speak [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7493.16s)]
*  you'll hear one of those six in almost every conversation even if it's a two minute conversation [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7499.0s)]
*  with an uber driver you're going to hear some of these statements come out and the acceptance would [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7504.36s)]
*  be like I'm I need to be part of groups I need to be I'm a member of things we they use a lot of [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7508.68s)]

*  approval seeking the intelligence seeking people or talking about the universities they went to the [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7530.28s)]
*  the grades that they got they're they'll display their intellect in all these ways and pity [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7535.8s)]
*  pity people is pretty obvious like in the way that we deal that the pity person is essentially [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7540.28s)]
*  asking to other people realize how bad I've had it or what I've been through and if I can spot that [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7545.24s)]
*  then I can start recognizing that and making this person see me as their type of person because now [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7550.28s)]
*  I'm not just a person or a friend they're getting neuropeptides from all this so I'm kind of a drug [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7556.04s)]

*  so this is like in the first two minutes of of an interaction you can spot these things [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7567.08s)]
*  in the strength and power person there's one that's leader and one that's like I need to [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7571.8s)]

*  agreement early on in that conversation you can do anything and if you just look at milgram all [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7809.16s)]

*  absolute compliance from that so if you can do that and then get somebody to make an identity [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7830.84s)]
*  agreement like what kind of person are you so as just to put this in practical terms like i'm [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7838.04s)]
*  training a real estate person one-on-one they're like well how do i get these clients to behave [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7844.36s)]
*  like this at the end so you get them to agree at the beginning and like so one of these lines would [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7850.12s)]
*  be like you know when i first started learning real estate they told me that i'm only ever going [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7854.759999999999s)]
*  to deal with three types of clients they're going to be like the first ones are the doubters and [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7859.08s)]
*  these are the people that doubt everything because they maybe they had a hard childhood or they got [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7864.04s)]
*  screwed over so many times that they doubt just everything which leads them to never taking action [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7868.679999999999s)]
*  the next ones are the delayers these people just push everything off in their life and [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7873.4800000000005s)]
*  blah blah and then we have the deciders and these people get all the information that they possibly [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7877.96s)]
*  need and they make a decision so without me even if i'm the real estate person without me even [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7883.16s)]
*  telling you or you agreeing or saying what you are i've got you to subconsciously or to privately [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7889.32s)]
*  make an agreement in your head that you're probably in category three and that's within [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7895.88s)]
*  the first like 10 minutes of meeting somebody so i've started to compromise identity in just a few [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7900.52s)]
*  minutes and if i also know that you have these behavioral patterns and also know that you seek [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7907.0s)]
*  significance right before i say that i might say you know joe it's it's obviously make a tremendous [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7913.72s)]

*  trap that's like 45 seconds where i've got you into i've got you hooked into identity and it's [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7939.56s)]
*  just a small piece but i've got you hooked in to begin with and i've got you to agree that you are [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7945.56s)]
*  a certain type of person that's the key am i the type of person who blank did you see a lot of the [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=7949.56s)]

*  the tribe right that's why public speaking is our number one fear for humans it's not a fear of [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8278.44s)]
*  speaking it's a fear of judgment right so i'm just putting the threat of judgment out there [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8284.36s)]
*  that is a sciop so if people have to be silenced and they were harvard doctors [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8289.560000000001s)]

*  exactly how the government was handling everything and they were silenced and they were treated like [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8309.320000000002s)]
*  fringe quacks instead of respected physicians and uh it was openly discussed in emails that's what's [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8313.560000000001s)]
*  really crazy they they they talked about the strategy of silencing these people and then you [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8323.560000000001s)]
*  had the actual government itself contacting twitter trying to get people removed which is [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8329.08s)]
*  wild yeah and didn't you didn't you have mark zuckerberg on he talked about yeah he talked [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8335.24s)]
*  about facebook doing it about uh the fbi contacting them it's um it's crazy to believe but my hope is [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8340.039999999999s)]
*  that people have learned from this past four years and that this is an eye-opener yeah and [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8347.56s)]
*  it one thing i could say like if if you want to know whether or not you have been lied to [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8354.2s)]
*  if you can't see anything wrong with the side you agree with and you can't see anything right [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8361.240000000002s)]
*  with the side that you disagree with you have been manipulated or you're very rigid in the way you [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8366.2s)]
*  look at things right yeah or i mean this this you've you're assuming someone's objective right [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8372.2s)]
*  because some people are just not objective right but that lack of objectivity can come from a [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8377.72s)]
*  manipulation a lot right i'm deleting your objectivity through psyops that's what i want [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8384.119999999999s)]
*  to do that's what psyops typically aim to do with some people again as you're talking about with [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8389.48s)]
*  suggestibility some people are more vulnerable to that sort of group think yeah way more way more [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8394.92s)]
*  yeah and that's like if you think of back to that childhood triangle again friends safety and rewards [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8402.44s)]
*  what did i do to get friends i listened to them and i agreed with them what did i do to feel safe [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8408.6s)]
*  because that my dad was a dickhead or an alcoholic or something i just went along with everything [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8412.68s)]
*  they said i'm just going to go along with it so you may and i'm not saying that's the recipe for [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8416.76s)]
*  suggestibility but that may be uh the the reason someone grows up that way that's just how i lived [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8421.08s)]
*  as a child those were my little scripts to survive as a kid an innocent little kid and [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8427.56s)]
*  there's so many psyops that are happening all the time some of them when you say psyops a really [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8433.96s)]

*  right um one of the things that i thought was fascinating about the psyop of the whole pandemic [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8444.92s)]
*  was that there were people that weren't even benefiting from being a part of it that were [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=8451.56s)]

*  yeah you became the media that like the the medium that they used for the psyop yeah i can't imagine [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9042.92s)]

*  that is anti-psyops like how to spot psyops in action and i copied that video that they made [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9083.720000000001s)]
*  a very very similar intro but the moment that i saw one doctor on youtube had to not use this was at [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9090.199999999999s)]
*  the very beginning he had to not use that word he couldn't say certain words on youtube like vaccine [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9099.96s)]
*  right right i was like 100 this is yeah this is well all the algorithms were searching for it so [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9105.24s)]
*  people would spell vax like v and then they would use like a dash and then an x you know they would [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9112.439999999999s)]
*  do something to try to skirt around the algorithm yeah so and then why is that's the one thing is [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9119.24s)]
*  someone credible being suppressed is a credible person being suppressed and then when you see it [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9126.68s)]
*  tenfold a hundred people all these people that are being suppressed if your idea is good nobody has [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9132.199999999999s)]
*  to be quiet and then it's going to catch on its own also the the counter the counter to that is if [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9139.4s)]
*  your idea is bad you can't just force it through people are going to figure it out eventually [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9145.0s)]
*  they're going to realize eventually if you keep calling this stuff horse paste [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9149.96s)]
*  veterinary medicine and people are going to find out oh wait a minute it actually won the noble [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9153.56s)]
*  prize the the inventor of it for humans for use in humans you know actually it's on the world [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9157.96s)]
*  health organization list of essential medicines actually it's been prescribed billions not millions [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9163.48s)]
*  billions of times like what the fuck is going on where you're saying this is horse paste 50 plus [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9169.4s)]
*  a hundred years it's been around quite a long time and it has a incredible safety profile which [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9174.12s)]
*  was the wildest thing about them going all in and calling it horse pace because like you are doing [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9180.2s)]
*  this at the expense of your credibility for people who just want short-term profits and you're you're [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9185.960000000001s)]
*  killing your business your business is people want to believe you when you're talking about the news [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9191.160000000002s)]
*  and now they don't yeah they don't know or something really stupid well you could have just ignored me [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9197.400000000001s)]
*  you didn't have to do that you could have just ignored me yeah it probably would have had very [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9204.28s)]
*  little effect but then my video probably would have had very little effect people probably [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9208.28s)]
*  wouldn't have believed me oh you bet he feels like shit and he's lying that would have been fine [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9212.04s)]
*  yeah but instead they went all in and too many people were paying attention to it and by that [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9215.480000000001s)]
*  time too many people had already had covid and gotten over it and going what the fuck is going [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9219.720000000001s)]
*  on and then there was the whole thing where they were saying you had to get vaccinated even if you [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9223.960000000001s)]
*  had suffered from covid and recovered where you had natural immunity that was proven to be seven [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9227.720000000001s)]
*  times stronger it was a pure psyop yeah so and the big thing there was when i when i can make [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9233.56s)]
*  fun of joe rogan and like i can shame joe rogan if i could do that to you one of the one of the more [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9241.32s)]

*  that a trickle down compliance effect yeah i can get millions of people to comply because if they're [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9252.68s)]
*  going to do that to rogan there that might happen to me well i'm sure it worked i'm sure it worked [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9258.359999999999s)]
*  i'm sure a lot of people complied after they saw that they saw those attacks and you know i met a [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9263.32s)]
*  lot of people that would accuse me of spreading misinformation like what did i say tell me what i [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9268.6s)]
*  said yeah what was misinformation what was wrong they can't even tell you they didn't even know [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9272.84s)]
*  what they were just like saying something because you were there like they felt like they had to say [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9277.64s)]
*  that it was a fascinating time and um what's interesting is coming out of that now you know [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9281.48s)]
*  the country coming out of that now i think people are way more skeptical way more skeptical [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9290.12s)]
*  believing the media and way more skeptical believing the government way more skeptical [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9295.560000000001s)]
*  i think that was a huge mistake for short-term profits i think they still would have made a ton [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9301.160000000002s)]
*  of money a lot of people are scared they would have taken it anyway they lied about all the [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9306.36s)]
*  fucking studies anyway they they were doing well they but they sacrificed their ability to do this [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9309.560000000001s)]
*  in the future yeah they gave their hand i don't know who said this quote man but it's i think it's [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9316.84s)]
*  the best quote about society is like a society that grows is when men and it's an old quote but [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9323.64s)]
*  men plant trees whose shade they will never enjoy thinking about the future and not this [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9330.2s)]
*  this one little spike in profit and that's when a society flourishes and when we're when we're [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9337.48s)]
*  doing that kind of stuff well i think it's essentially a symptom of a system that's been [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9342.52s)]
*  captured right it's the media works for them because they support the media financially you know [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9347.640000000001s)]
*  cally means has talked about this that the reason why they sponsor so many television shows is not [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9356.6s)]
*  that they want to sell more drugs it's to keep those shows from criticizing them [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9365.560000000001s)]
*  so that's terrifying it is terrifying it's terrifying that it's effective and it works [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9370.28s)]
*  and that we're one of only two countries on earth that allows them to advertise pharmaceutical drugs [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9375.640000000001s)]
*  yeah because we know that commercials are psyops i mean i mean when you see that lady and she's [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9382.28s)]
*  dancing with her daughter in the field and they're spinning around circles and now she's happy and [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9389.960000000001s)]

*  they've got a playbook written by edward bernays of all people wrote this book and the book's [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9416.12s)]
*  called crystallizing public opinion and he and you can see it in every one of these operations [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9421.720000000001s)]
*  and it's a short book you can read it in like two hours every one of these things follows that [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9427.8s)]
*  playbook of psyops which makes sense why he would change the name of the department of war to the [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9433.48s)]
*  department of defense yeah like it's way more palatable yeah he's also the reason that bacon [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9437.56s)]
*  became part of american breakfast well kudos to him for that yeah that was a good move yeah [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9443.48s)]
*  bacon's pretty solid funny he was sigman freud's nephew whoa yeah one of they did coke together [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9449.08s)]
*  so [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9457.88s)]
*  the father of propaganda is sigman freud's relative nephew that's crazy sigman freud helped [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9460.759999999998s)]
*  raise this guy so did you read his book oh yeah yeah what does it say in there so essentially it [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9467.8s)]
*  is it's capturing a mass public attention and making the desired outcome about identity [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9473.4s)]
*  belonging and being part of a tribe so to give you an example virginia slims hired him [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9481.48s)]
*  to say like hey it's just men that are smoking our cigarettes and he's like yeah well women need to [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=9488.92s)]

*  to be in them what the fuck are they what is it going to say we did it when is that going to happen [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10179.16s)]
*  do you i don't know cash patella's in you know um is he gonna do it we'll see he apparently wants to [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10182.84s)]
*  i mean i think there's probably a lot of sorting through to figure out what to say and how to say [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10188.52s)]
*  it and what to release i feel like they should just release it all and let the internet hounds [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10192.6s)]
*  go at it let them figure out they're the best at it anyway and they're the most psychotic [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10198.2s)]
*  they'll fucking they'll be working 16 hours a day until they figure it all out yeah you know so let [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10202.2s)]
*  me tell you when it when it comes to all these beliefs formation i'll tell you the formula for [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10207.48s)]
*  hypnosis okay and this and i don't think anybody's ever said this i've never said it out loud not [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10211.24s)]
*  even in my training it's enhanced a level of focus and then micro compliances so like if i'm uh have [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10215.72s)]
*  you seen the street performers that would hypnotize somebody in a bar or like you know like to do [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10224.119999999999s)]
*  something silly or maybe they're helping them so the first step is like if i'm hypnotizing you and [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10229.56s)]
*  it's in a social setting the first couple of steps are all right come over here now stand to the left [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10234.199999999999s)]
*  now move your legs just a little bit further now spread them further apart so you have some balance [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10238.68s)]
*  all right just make sure you have some range of motion go ahead and put your arms out on [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10242.36s)]
*  none of those are meaningful right they're all meaningless all i'm doing is get you to comply [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10246.76s)]
*  comply comply comply and that's just the first like 30 seconds i've got you to comply with me 15 times [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10251.32s)]
*  we haven't even started the hypnosis thing yet and so it's just you're you're not aware that [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10257.56s)]
*  you're becoming compliant you just think i'm going through some motions but it's just hijacking the [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10263.96s)]
*  mammal brain yeah so it's compliance compliance compliance and then it's just like go ahead and [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10270.119999999999s)]
*  stare over there i want you to look at that light up there and we're going to just focus on that [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10274.359999999999s)]
*  line up there and just let everything go so it's just a lot of focus right and i'm and i'll say [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10278.039999999999s)]
*  something like i can already tell i've been doing this for 20 years you're going to be really good [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10285.32s)]
*  at this and everything's going to be just fine you'll be able to hear my voice the whole time [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10288.199999999999s)]
*  it's not a coma you'll be able to stand and maintain perfect balance you'll be completely [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10291.0s)]
*  okay authority yeah and no matter what happens you're going to walk out of this a better person [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10294.76s)]
*  everybody's going to respect you more and and i'll frame it as like us hypnotists call the ability to [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10300.92s)]
*  go into hypnosis unconscious intelligence but i'll only say that if you're an intelligence person [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10307.64s)]
*  so if you're a significance driven person i'll say we call this unconscious power [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10313.48s)]
*  this ability to go into hypnosis so i'll make it about your identity right away yeah and then [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10317.08s)]
*  there's an increase in dissociation like there's one part of you doing this one part of you doing [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10323.88s)]
*  that so that's like the induction where they're saying oh all the way down that kind of stuff [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10328.12s)]
*  yeah but that's if you look at social media the final step of hypnosis is fractionation [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10332.76s)]
*  out a slightly out of trance back in and every time you go back down into that trance you go [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10339.48s)]
*  deeper you're go if you put an eeg on someone's head and you i think you've had dr david spiegel on [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10343.88s)]
*  here before or you've at least had darren brown yeah i've had darren brown [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10350.519999999999s)]
*  they've done studies on this like this fractionation process increases the amount of [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10355.4s)]
*  theta waves that are going on in your brain which is the theta waves of hypnosis so from the age of [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10359.16s)]
*  one to eight give or take your brain is in theta like 80 percent of the day that's why we learn so [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10363.56s)]
*  fast and we we can do all that stuff so up and down up and down and if you go back the next time [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10368.92s)]
*  for anybody watching this the next time you start scrolling through social media [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10375.88s)]
*  i want you to watch how it's going to peak a positive experience for two or three videos [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10380.44s)]
*  in a row and it's going to start going downhill and it's going to go back up and it's going to [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10386.28s)]
*  go downhill and every ad that you see the algorithm doesn't do this on purpose the algorithm does it [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10390.84s)]
*  because it's effective every time you see an ad is going to be at one of those down troughs [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10396.92s)]
*  they're not going to spike you up and have you feel good like with that guy putting on the color [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10403.08s)]
*  glasses that was colorblind and he can see and he's crying and all that they're not going to show [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10407.72s)]
*  you an ad after that they'll show you an ad at the bottom it's every time and i don't think that's [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10411.72s)]
*  programmed into the algorithm i think the algorithm adapted because that is the effective way to do it [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10416.84s)]
*  jesus it's listen here's your book behavior ops this is a fat book dude there's a lot going on in [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2JwJ0A1QE&t=10422.52s)]
