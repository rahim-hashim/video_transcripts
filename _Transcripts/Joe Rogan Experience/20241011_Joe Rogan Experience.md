# Joe Rogan Experience #2212 - Jelly Roll
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws2ZsG3NNQc)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by Dave, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  Let's go, let's go Jelly Roll.
*  I'm back with my bubba.
*  My man, I haven't seen you since Master Square Garden.
*  That was crazy.
*  What a great night that was, dude.
*  What an experience, man.
*  Dude, it was so, I was thinking about it pulling up here is that I think y'all just got out
*  of Vulcan and the club had just opened.
*  And I came that night to see Ron White and I went back that Monday to see Kill Tony.
*  And I could feel the Kill Tony thing happening over COVID at Vulcan.
*  So I had to go see it in person, you know?
*  And I could remember sitting in there and you know how like you can feel an energy shift?
*  Yeah.
*  I felt an energy shift in life in that room that night.
*  I was like, this is fixing to explode.
*  Yeah.
*  Like everything associated with this club, everything associated with Tony, everything
*  associated with Joe is fixing to fucking rocket ship.
*  And it felt like almost like I'm getting goosebumps, Joe.
*  I'm not even bullshitting.
*  I'm getting goosebumps too.
*  It's almost like, I swear, dude, it was like feeling the grunge movement in the 90s.
*  Like when you first heard a little something, you were like, this is different.
*  And you were like, this could be something.
*  And then it just turned out to be the explosion.
*  It's like, I felt that happening.
*  So to see Tony at fucking Madison Square Garden and then to see how y'all showed up for
*  Tony at Madison Square Garden, every fucking comedian on earth came to see that dude.
*  The fucking two nights.
*  Kiss him on his fucking cheek.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I had to be there.
*  I had to be there.
*  I was there in the beginning.
*  I was there when there was like 18 comedians in the crowd.
*  Is that not crazy?
*  It was crazy.
*  They were doing the belly room of the Comedy Store.
*  It was just like an afterthought.
*  They couldn't do any of the other rooms because they didn't have an audience.
*  And they would.
*  And Tony just had this weird idea that he just like a little pit bull just stuck with it.
*  One minute of comedy and he like honed it over time and figured it out.
*  And then he became the best host in all of entertainment.
*  There's no one better at hosting a comedy show than him.
*  The way he does that show, the speed of his comebacks, the speed of his like the roast lines.
*  I tell Tony all the time, I say, Tony, I love you.
*  And that panel is the coolest thing I've ever seen.
*  But you are the show, brother.
*  We would all tune in if you were sitting up there by yourself.
*  Like you are just so sharp.
*  I relate to it too, Joe.
*  I compare art forms.
*  It's just something I like to do.
*  I know some people don't.
*  But watching Tony, I feel a kinship to Tony and Andrew Schultz in a certain way.
*  Because I feel like we all kind of met each other right before it happened for all of us.
*  Like I remember me and Schultz doing the opener up song at the five, four.
*  You know, he was doing two nights at Zany's, two shows, one show, you know, one show a night.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And I was doing a thousand seat club in the South.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And Tony was still kill Tony.
*  And you know what I mean?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  And we're all fucking old.
*  Like the fact that it happened for all of us in our late 30s is even cooler.
*  So it's this double kinship.
*  Like when I was nominated for new artist of the year at almost 40, that's the first time that it ever happened in CMA history and country music.
*  But like this year, most of those kids are 27 and under.
*  Here I was a 40 year old fucking man.
*  You're a beautiful example that there's no rules.
*  There's no rules.
*  It's all bullshit.
*  Just be yourself.
*  Just be yourself.
*  Do your best.
*  Find find whatever it is inside you that you can express.
*  There's no rules.
*  There's no rules for age.
*  Like Ron White used to worry about that all the time.
*  I think I'm too old.
*  I mean, what do you do?
*  You're Ron motherfucking White.
*  You're a legend.
*  Period.
*  But it's like that humility that he has, even though he's got great confidence in his ability.
*  Ron is a very humble guy, as successful as he is.
*  But that humility that he is is also that constantly has him writing, constantly has him working.
*  He's 40 years in the game.
*  He never stops.
*  And he's better now than he's ever been before.
*  Now that he's sober, like he's a monster, a monster on stage.
*  Imagine hitting.
*  So to me, Ron White is on Mount Rushmore of comedy.
*  For me personally, I know it's subjective.
*  Some people are going to, you know, whatever.
*  But for me, because I judge comedy as a fan of like, I look at skits like, I mean, I look at specials like what songs stood out to me the most in the whole special.
*  Like your special was your album.
*  How many songs do you have that I tell my friends about?
*  Like it's my song.
*  Right, right, right.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like to me, Ron White has done more of that than I have more Ron White bits memorized than any other comedian.
*  Just by like default of how good he is at weaving these little quick two minute stories of just complete white trashery and drunkery.
*  Which is just my fucking specialty.
*  It's like I feel like he grew up on my street.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  So my mama likes Ron White.
*  You know what I mean?
*  He was the first guy out here.
*  You know, he was the first guy that came.
*  He moved here before the pandemic because he was always with us at the store.
*  And then one day I called him up.
*  I'm like, where the fuck you been, man?
*  He was, I moved to Austin.
*  Fuck it.
*  He just, he just loved it.
*  He's like, there's no traffic.
*  Everyone's nice.
*  And I started thinking about it then he planted like the first seeds in like 2018.
*  I was like, can I live in Austin?
*  Fuck.
*  I don't know.
*  Because my instinct has always been to move to the mountains.
*  Like I want to, I want to live somewhere where there's no people.
*  Like did you ever have a, did you have mountains in mind when you like romanticize it?
*  Did you ever think of what mountains you would move to if you did it?
*  I really liked the mountains above Boulder.
*  I really, I lived there for a little while in 2009.
*  But when I think about Montana, sometimes I think about just some place more peaceful, Wyoming.
*  Somewhere just a little more peaceful, cold as fuck in the winter, but just like more real.
*  And that was my thought when I was living in LA, but it was like a necessity to get the fuck out of there.
*  When, when the COVID stuff was going on, like they're not going to let this go.
*  They're going to keep us in control for once they have control of you, like they had during the pandemic, wear a mask, got to get a vaccine, can't go here, can't go there.
*  No businesses.
*  Everything shut down.
*  All the restaurants go under all the comedy clubs go under.
*  When they were doing that, I was like, they're not going to let this go.
*  I got to get the fuck out of here.
*  And when we came to Texas, it was wide open.
*  Like, you know, some places made you wear a mask, but it was a joke.
*  It was like, it was a goof.
*  It was weird.
*  It was like a completely different universe.
*  We can go to my kids were young, man.
*  They were 10 and 12 and like they wanted to go to restaurants.
*  Like we can go to a restaurant here and sit in doors like for everyone was terrified in LA and they just weren't here.
*  And the same results like the same the same thing happened to everybody.
*  But over here it was a way more peaceful experience.
*  And Ron, when we were out here, we started doing shows at the Vulcan.
*  And one night, the first time Ron had been on stage like eight months, he just grabbed me by my shoulders.
*  He's like, whatever the fuck we have to do, we're going to keep doing this.
*  He's like, you got to open up a club.
*  And I'm like, all right, that's it.
*  We're opening up a club.
*  And the process began.
*  God, all because we're on.
*  Ron led me to think about moving here.
*  Ron was already out here.
*  So I knew that if I did move to Austin, at least Ron's here.
*  You know, and then Tony moved here and then Brian Simpson moved here.
*  And then the fuck and just the train kept a rolling all night long.
*  It was nuts.
*  I think it was by default.
*  It was kind of a universe thing where there was a little bit of still water that needed to be stirred.
*  Yeah.
*  When you came, that still water stirred and it awakened everybody like, hold on.
*  There's choices outside of the same routine that we've been because I'm sure y'all's life was store, store, store, weekends out, store, store.
*  It was improv, too.
*  I did in the ice house.
*  There was a few clubs we did like on a regular, you know, because the more places to work out, the better.
*  You know, and when we were there were so many of us, too.
*  You know, we'd have shows.
*  It's like Bill Burz on me, Tom Segura, Bert Kreischer.
*  They're crazy shows.
*  Crazy shows.
*  Crazy shows because everybody was in L.A.
*  It was a beautiful thing up until they shut everything down.
*  It's that beautiful here now, though.
*  But that's what I'm saying.
*  The water is complete.
*  I mean, it is.
*  This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
*  It's a really healthy, good thing to talk about what you're going through with people, the good and the bad.
*  Don't keep it all bottled up.

*  And you know, the best thing is, too, there's an added element that we bring new people in every weekend.
*  So every weekend there's these big national headliners.
*  So they come in on Tuesday, Wednesday.
*  We're fucking around all week.
*  Yeah, we're just having a great time.
*  That's what I that's how I describe your club.
*  I was like, it's the gym for the greatest comedians in the world, Tuesday through Thursday.
*  And then the other greatest comedians in the world come and rent it from Friday to Sunday.
*  I was like, it's crazy, dude.
*  It's like no matter what day you have killed Tony, that's the anchor.
*  Every Monday, Kill Tony is the anchor of comedy in the known universe.
*  Really, that's a grandiose statement.
*  I know.
*  But what Kill Tony shows you is like every comic wants a reaction.
*  And some comics, unfortunately, if you're in specific areas, like very liberal areas, like Silver Lake has a problem with this, like those kind of places where everyone's like super woke and they want to let everyone else know that they're super woke.
*  It's like a kind of thing you have to do.
*  So you get ideologically captured and you you you make material that's bullshit.
*  You get claptor.
*  What Kill Tony makes you do is you have one fucking minute.
*  You have one minute and there's obviously no rules.
*  By the time you get on stage, you've seen Cam go crazy.
*  You've seen Hans Kim say some ridiculous shit.
*  Maybe you see William Montgomery or Brian Holtz, but you've seen maniacs on stage killing.
*  And so you got one minute just crack.
*  It's time to crack.
*  So it sets a tone for comedy.
*  The comedy is just entertaining.
*  No matter how you put it out, no matter what it is, what your style is, what you'd like to talk about, whether you're Nate Bargatze or whether you're Shane Gillis.
*  There's just a different way to do it.
*  Everybody's got their own way to do it.
*  But it's just just go try to find your way.
*  Don't try the tricks.
*  Don't try to sneak in some fucking ideological bullshit just because you think people are going to agree with you and like you more and clap and cheat.
*  And you're to say something profound.
*  Shut up.
*  You got one minute.
*  So that sets a tone for all the people coming up.
*  So real.
*  It's so real.
*  It's the most.
*  It's one of the most important things that ever happened.
*  Nobody's trying to impose their beliefs on you.
*  They're just trying to make they got 60 seconds to get a fucking laugh and the kill Tony Crowell will boo you.
*  You've got about 30 seconds with them in an arena in an arena.
*  Real dangerous grounds, dude.
*  Bro, they were especially New York.
*  The first show in New York.
*  They were rough.
*  They go hard.
*  You know, when I knew the arena thing was going to be huge for Tony, I flew down here for the first one he did because we were drunk at the bar that night.
*  And he was like, I'm going to play an arena.
*  I was like, I'm going to come sing the national anthem.
*  It was a joke because I don't sing the national anthem.
*  I have a rule.
*  I don't sing the national anthem.
*  But I told him I was going to do it.
*  So I came down and we're watching the first comedian this night at the H.E.B. center.
*  Right. The first bucket pull comes up and you could tell this bitch did not have any idea she was going to get called or anything to say.
*  This is the first you talking about a gift from God for Tony.
*  Right.
*  She's not up there.
*  18 seconds, Joe, before they realized that she's just, you know, falafel and the boo birds came.
*  They didn't start slowly and grow like they normally do.
*  It was like 13 or 12000 people made the decision at once.
*  Boo.
*  What a horrible feeling.
*  What a horrible feeling.
*  And I was like, oh, yeah, this is going to explode in arenas.
*  I was like, kill Tony's going to fucking arenas.
*  It's it's a bet.
*  It's the best show for that kind of an audience.
*  We watch it every Monday on the bus.
*  Chaotic.
*  Full disclosure, like as a bus.
*  Imagine like a bunch of music dudes every Monday that were like religiously.
*  It's something we have together.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's something that the whole band can agree on.
*  The other thing about Kill Tony was in the beginning, Tony wasn't famous.
*  No one was famous and they were just going hard.
*  And then as everyone got famous, they kept going hard, whereas it's very hard to just jump in and do something that wild now.
*  And there was nothing like it during COVID.
*  There is nothing like it.
*  You have this live show every week in front of a live audience and everybody else is locked down.
*  You have to wear your fucking mask where you're walking your dog.
*  You know, like what is going on?
*  Now you're having to bring it.
*  It was also just like this rejection of norm, you know, rejection of whatever is going, whatever people think the comedy industry is, because people think the comedy industry is like some group of people with power that control the being, give people special
*  that don't deserve it.
*  There's all this like weird, weird thoughts about the comedy business.
*  But when the comedy business is only comedians, it's a completely different experience.
*  And that's what Kill Tony is.
*  There's no business element behind it.
*  There's no networks.
*  There's no producers.
*  There's no there's no person, no executive worrying about their fucking mortgage.
*  You can't say that, Tony.
*  There's none of that.
*  So it's just wild.
*  No, it's complete chaos all the time.
*  The greatest show on the Internet.
*  Peered.
*  That's the truth.
*  It fucking rules.
*  And it's like I said, you're talking about people that do more when they get there.
*  And that mean you were talking off record, right?
*  I mean, off record, off the microphone.
*  We were walking in here about you hang around nine long enough.
*  You'll be the 10th.
*  Yeah.
*  And God bless me that in the last few years, in light of my success, I've been had really cool friends like Tony and I become really good friends.
*  You and I become really good friends.
*  And I've been able to watch like a student of the game guys like y'all Bert Tom and go, man, these dudes are turning the heat up as it matters.
*  Like the contents flowing like it's only getting bigger.
*  Last year, Joe, my most successful year of my career, I wrote more songs than I've ever wrote in a single year as a free man.
*  That's amazing.
*  Jail is a different concept because fuck what I wrote a song a day.
*  You know what I mean?
*  But I wrote a hundred and I turned in one hundred and seventy songs in my last year.
*  Shit.
*  I just couldn't quit writing them.
*  I was on the bus.
*  I just could not.
*  I could not at every corner.
*  I was getting done with show.
*  You know, I do five shows a week.
*  It's just how we tour.
*  I was getting straight on the bus and just grabbing a guitar and just pouring ideas.
*  I'm putting out twenty seven songs when this podcast is out.
*  My album beautifully broken is out right now.
*  I had twenty two on the album and I had five or six features that I was going to do for deluxe next week.
*  And my wife teased one of the songs that's kind of doing good.
*  So I think I'm going to drop them all tomorrow today, technically anyway.
*  So do you're so at home on stage?
*  It's crazy.
*  You know, when you did New York, New York at Madison Square Garden, I asked her, I'm like, how often do you just do this?
*  Just get up there and sing.
*  How often are you doing this?
*  It's a crazy thing because it's like just you.
*  You just are you up there, you know, fifteen thousand people, fifty thousand people.
*  It's just jelly roll.
*  It's that's when a guy's like, you know, you're you're just so in the zone.
*  So on top of your game, it's just beautiful to watch someone in the zone because you recognize that that feeling is a great feeling when you're just like totally in tune with what you're doing.
*  I love when I see a comic that's in there and you know, it's a flow.
*  Yeah.
*  Last time, David Tell was here was right before he filmed his special.
*  My God, it was magic.
*  He's so different.
*  Oh, my God. He's so good right now.
*  If you get a chance to see David Tell live, if you're a comedy fan, you have to see him.
*  He's and now I'm sure he's got a whole bunch of new stuff because the specials out.
*  God damn, he's in this fucking flow.
*  He's like a like a Zen master up there.
*  It's scary how comfortable he is.
*  I got so I've never been to the cellar.
*  It's been a dream of mine.
*  I had a night in New York.
*  I'd finished TV.
*  So I went to the cellar that night and I got David Tell's number on Burt's tour.
*  I went on Burt's fully fully loaded tour this year for fun.
*  That tell you the story.
*  I think so.
*  I think I told you, but just like to fuck off.
*  I called Bird and was like, yo, can I just park my bus and just come fuck off for like five or six shows?
*  He was like, what?
*  I was like, yeah.
*  He was like, will you sing?
*  I was like, fuck.
*  Yeah, whatever.
*  I'll come sing a song or two.
*  So I just go over to guitar every night between comedians.
*  That's amazing.
*  But me and Dave would hang out every night.
*  Me, Dave, Big Jay, Okerson, Soder, Morrell.
*  And we would all just Burt.
*  I'm just like having the cool.
*  I'm just like I'm rarely quiet as I am back there because I'm just listening because these dudes are telling the greatest storytellers.
*  They're greatest storytellers ever.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Telling old stories.
*  Great guys, too.
*  Soder.
*  He's the best.
*  Soder's the dude, son.
*  So I'm like.
*  Sam's fucking amazing.
*  They're just such good guys, too.
*  And such good real just different level comedians, too.
*  They're great comedians, but they're just great people, too.
*  They're fun to hang with.
*  There's a great crop.
*  There's a great crop of people coming up right now.
*  You know, Norman and Shane and all these guys coming up right now are so good.
*  It's so fun.
*  It's a different level.
*  David Till gives me his number.
*  Call me if you're ever in New York.
*  I know he has a flip phone, right?
*  Dave pulls the flip phone out.
*  So I'm in New York and I just like randomly and I say, Dave, when I call you, I'm going to be in New York City trying to find you.
*  OK, he said, he said, no problem.
*  I'll be at the cellar.
*  That's what he tells me.
*  Right.
*  I call this dude.
*  Me and Ian Finance are standing sitting at the bar and I say, I'm going to call Dave and see what time he's coming.
*  I call third ring.
*  Dave answers and go, you here?
*  I go, I am.
*  He goes, you need help getting in?
*  I was like, I'm in.
*  He said, see you in a few.
*  Flips phone.
*  It was the most David Till thing ever.
*  He's one of the only guys I know that stopped partying, got completely sober and got way better, way better.
*  A lot of guys, there's like this thing that they have when they're, you know, doing drugs, especially where they're just wild.
*  And sometimes that wildness is like a magical energy on stage.
*  Like, I couldn't imagine a sober kinesin.
*  That would have been really weird.
*  Like kinesin's whole thing was like, I'm here to fucking party.
*  Yes.
*  Like he was partying, dude, hard.
*  And that's why we didn't get much out of him.
*  We only got like really a couple of good albums out of kinesin because he's just going too hard.
*  His family came to my show in El Paso.
*  Polly sent them.
*  And they brought me Sam Kinesin's original gospel discs.
*  Oh, wow.
*  They gave me like five of them, Joe.
*  It's one of my most prized possessions now.
*  How is it? How's the music?
*  Oh, it's crazy.
*  Well, it's a lot of preaching on there too.
*  Is it preaching and singing?
*  Yeah, it was a lot of preaching on the first one.
*  I didn't get to the second one yet.
*  I hadn't had a disc player.
*  They brought all five of them.
*  I was so scared to fuck them up.
*  I immediately put them in a Pelican crate and sent them home.
*  Oh, wow.
*  I was like, this is crazy.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I mean, the whole kinesin family, there's like 10 of them in there sharing all these cool stories because I wanted them.
*  Polly said the kinesin family wants to come see your show.
*  I said I want them to see my show because I have so much of my show is derivative from Sam Kinnison.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like there's so much.
*  I'm a southern gospel man anyways.
*  I went to a southern church, so I just understood kinesin's inflections and that kind of thing.
*  It just spoke to me from where I'm from.
*  So it's like I have always tried to tell people I'm somewhere between Billy Graham and Sam Kinnison.
*  You know what I mean?
*  As far as like how you know when you got to come see I'll be I do the Moody Center in November.
*  OK, it's the middle of the week to you should be able to make it.
*  It'll be fun.
*  I'm trying to talk caring to putting a closed on Mitzi's door sign that says clothes gone to the Jellier Hall show.
*  Speaking of Mitzi's, can I tell you something?
*  I want to I've been waiting to talk to you about this person.
*  I was so inspired by the time I spent with you down here and more importantly, the time I spent at your club even without you.
*  Just they treat me.
*  I don't know if you hear the stories, but I've become a fixture of furniture there when I'm in town.
*  And I am opening up announcing this now right here that I'm opening my bar on Broadway in Nashville, Tennessee, which is a real big deal.
*  You've been to Broadway. It's all after country music stars.
*  I'm the first Nashville native to get a bar.
*  So like the first kid from the city to get a bar.
*  But I was so inspired by the way the mothership has Mitzi's and it's like an honor to Mitzi's and what y'all do that I have put my bar is going to be called Jelly Rolls.
*  Good night, Nashville.
*  But I have a back bar called buddies named after my late father and it was completely inspired from what you have done at Mitzi's.
*  Oh, that's great.
*  All the way down to the we're going to set his chair there for him.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like it's just so inspiring and it's going to be just like y'all.
*  Our rule is it's open to the public when it's open to the public and when it's not, it's not.
*  Right. You know what I mean?
*  Yeah. Like Mitzi's.
*  Yeah. It's like because that place has created such a safe place for me to party.
*  This is what me and Post Malone talk about when we're drunk by ourselves.
*  We're like we need to go back to Jolleston.
*  Let's just go hang out.
*  It's like the safest bar in the world.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  It's like I can say anything here.
*  I know I'm OK.
*  Everybody's cool.
*  The whole staff's cool.
*  The staff's mostly comedians.
*  But my question was can I send my buddies bartender to hang out with Carrie for a week and shadow her?
*  100 percent. Sure.
*  Carrie said she's into it.
*  She just said ask Joe.
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever you need.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's a great idea.
*  I think I'm going to send her down in November around my show here.
*  I'm going to bring her with me so she can meet Carrie that night because Carrie runs the ultimate celebrity bar to me.
*  Yeah.
*  Like she deals with complete chaos down there with them comedians.
*  I've watched it.
*  It is wild.
*  Well, Carrie learned how to do it at the store.
*  That's why I hired her.
*  She was one of the first hires because I told her I go, you know, she was like one of the first people I contacted.
*  I'm like I'm going to open up a club.
*  She's awesome.
*  I had to get her out here because she was like the mother of the back bar.
*  That's how I feel.
*  So the back bar at the store was it was completely removed.
*  There's no general public at all.
*  It's a very small.
*  You've ever been in the back bar of the store?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So Carrie ran that place.
*  So she kept everybody in line.
*  Punky was there too before Punky was on SNL.
*  It's hilarious.
*  She used to run that back bar too.
*  And we used to all hang out there like anybody, you know, you could be safe there.
*  All these celebrities, people from out of town, they'd all just find their way to that weird little private bar.
*  So I kind of knew and originally Mitzis was not going to be open to the public at all.
*  It was just going to be a private bar.
*  But then along the way we said, you know what?
*  It doesn't hurt to like have it open to the general public like up until a certain time.
*  And then from that time out, have it everybody after the shows are over because that's when everybody really wants to hang.
*  And that was like the best blending of both worlds.
*  You know, but it was that old bar in Hollywood was it had her bar from her home that they had moved and put there.
*  So the actual bar that you put drinks on was from her home.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's like that there was like a piece of her there with us all the time.
*  So when we decided to do this place, I'm like, we got to have a bar just for Mitzis.
*  Just the same kind of same kind of vibe.
*  Yeah. You know, I mean, it touched my soul in such a way that I wanted to do it for my father.
*  That's awesome. You know what I mean?
*  So I just want you to know that the Mitzis legacy has went even further and that what you all have creative there is spreading on to them.
*  You almost got me emotional talking about a woman I never met.
*  I just know she did so much for you.
*  She did so much for everybody. Yeah.
*  She's the most important person in the history of comedy that's not a comedian.
*  Polly's shared some really cool stories with me about her.
*  And it's just mad. It's just unreal.
*  I got to spend a little time with Polly because I went to that back bar there.
*  The cool thing is because of you all, I've now found you all's community embraces me everywhere now.
*  So I'm safe. If I'm in a city now, if I'm in L.A., I'm like, where's the comedy club?
*  I bet they got a back bar. Call Adam Ray.
*  You know what I'm saying? Adam Ray's like, hey, I'm at the back bar at the store. Come on.
*  I'm like, yes, on the way.
*  Yeah. It's a fun group of people. Contrary to popular belief.
*  Yeah. Popular belief is comedians are all like miserable.
*  No, dude, it's actually the greatest storytellers ever.
*  I could I could listen to guys like Bert talk all night. Yeah.
*  I could listen to Joey Diaz talk all night. I've known Joey for 30 years.
*  He still tells me new stories. Yeah. It's crazy. No, dude, it's crazy.
*  Because Joey, how do you still have stories? It's crazy, dude.
*  Because Joey could go to the store today and have a story. Oh, yeah.
*  You know what I mean? It'd just be fucking one of the one of the best stories ever.
*  I think we're all in the storytelling business, right? That's what I do, too.
*  I'm telling stories. I'm not doing it in a comedic way, but I'm I'm still telling a story.
*  You know what I mean? Like it's all that kind of story.
*  I'm attracted to storytellers. You know, I think we all are.
*  I mean, that's why you love a good movie. That's why you love a good book.
*  Especially when there's somebody that can tell a story that can capture you in a certain way.
*  I think it was probably the oldest form of entertainment. Right.
*  Once people when they first started learning language about the oldest form of entertainment
*  was probably recreating a thing they saw. Right. Yeah. Had to be right.
*  Yeah, for sure. But think about the old let's sit around the campfire.
*  Sure. I mean, that's sure. I'm sure they were telling tales.
*  Tall tales is what they used to call them.
*  Think about how long we've been hearing these kind of stories of people just telling stories.
*  Also, back then, that was the only time in your day that you got to relax.
*  When you're sitting around the campfire, that was the only time it was dark out.
*  There was nothing to do. You found all the food you're going to find.
*  And you're going to get up in the morning and go right back at it all day long again.
*  And then eventually find your way back to the campfire.
*  So the campfire was like the time where people would sit around and entertain each other in prehistory.
*  Yeah. Because you're thinking about it like from a hunting perspective, too.
*  They had to go out all day and find the food. Yeah.
*  You can only do that when the sun was out. You can only do it when the sun was out.
*  And at night time, it's fucking dangerous because there's predators out there.
*  So the fire is the best thing to keep off the predators.
*  You need a fire and everybody gathers around the fire because the predators don't want to come to the fire.
*  Fuck, man. And that's where people learn how to tell stories.
*  That's why we're so attracted to it.
*  And they were doing fucking drugs back then, too, I'm sure.
*  Oh, 100%. They were smoking pot and doing all kinds of things.
*  Somebody had already figured out that cow shit mushrooms could make you feel great.
*  Yeah. 100%. 100%. They tried everything. They were starving.
*  They tried a little bit of eating everything and they figured out what you can eat and what kills you.
*  Imagine going through mushrooms and trying to figure out which ones kill you and which ones get you to see God.
*  They had to figure that out trial and error.
*  How many times they had to go through it and go back and go, listen, y'all, I've done this a few times and I'm pretty confident that there is this thing that grates in the power of shit that makes me feel fucking like God.
*  You know what I'm saying? It's crazy, dude. Somebody had to be that guy.
*  Did you ever hear about John Marco Allegro in the book The Sacred Mushroom and the Scrolls?
*  It's a sacred mushroom. No, it's a sacred mushroom in the Christian myth.
*  And what was there's two different sacred mushroom in the Dead Sea Scrolls, I think is one of them.
*  What is what are the titles of his book?
*  The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross.
*  Sacred Mushroom and the Cross. And then there is another one.
*  There's another one that he released after the Catholic Church allegedly bought out all the copies of the first one to get rid of it.
*  Wow. Something in the Christian myth.
*  The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth.
*  I read the Dead Sea Scrolls.
*  So this guy thinks that all of religion is stories about mushrooms.
*  He thinks that the entire Christian religion was about psychedelic mushrooms and fertility rituals.
*  He thinks that what they were doing was they would have these stories, especially when they're conquered by the Romans,
*  they'd have these stories so they would hide the truth in stories and in allegories and all these different tales.
*  But he thinks that the entire Christian religion was based on the consumption of psychedelic mushrooms.
*  I can tell you this on brand. I mean, I'm a man of faith.
*  But on brand with that is Jesus told stories and he taught in stories.
*  Jesus never gave a direct direction.
*  He always was just like, well, and then he'd tell a story and you would have to figure out, you know what I mean?
*  It was like, OK, the story would show the it was always in story form to maybe they knew that was the best way to ensure
*  that people would tell it the same way every time.
*  You know, because if you have a story in the story, Noah has an ark and he brings the animals in the ark and God tells him he's going to do this and he's going to do that.
*  And he does it. And then, you know, if you have a story, then that information keeps getting told essentially the same way over and over and over again.
*  Like we can read the Epic of Gilgamesh today. That's a six thousand year old story.
*  Something like that. Five thousand. We can read that today.
*  That's nuts. That's right. That's crazy because it's a story.
*  But if it was just people talking about what what you should do or what happened and, you know, like when it's history, man, we can't trust history from the 60s.
*  History from the 60s. We're finding out new shit every day about the Kennedy assassination.
*  Yeah, that was fucking sixty three, man. Sixty three.
*  That's fifty one fucking years ago. That's insane.
*  And we're still trying to figure out what the fuck happened.
*  And this is like with modern like they had television, they had printing press, they had all these different things.
*  They had accountability, they had elected officials, they had democracy.
*  Still can't figure out what the fuck happened. And that's sixty three.
*  So imagine trying to figure out what the fuck happened five thousand years ago.
*  You know, it's like who knows who's telling the truth?
*  Who knows that you've got to like sort through the rubble and figure out what the fucking the facts show.
*  But if you have a story, even if it's like there's something hidden in that story.
*  Right. And he thinks that that's what the the apple was in the Garden of Eden.
*  That's deep. That's all that all that was in story.
*  Think about stories, too, as they said, I've never been in the pyramids, but they said that all that stuff on the inside of it is just a story.
*  Right. It's all telling a story to the hieroglyphics.
*  Sure. Like telling stories or when they have the guys chasing these things with the spears, they're like trying to show a story.
*  It's all trying to tell a story. A lot of mushrooms, too.
*  Yeah. There's a lot of images then with mushrooms.
*  I might do mushrooms today. It's my album release today. I'm thinking about it.
*  I don't know if I want to do much. God, they should be legal.
*  I know, right? God, they should be legal and regulated and people should figure out what the fuck they do.
*  Yeah. Should do a lot of research. Figure out what this says.
*  Figure out what this says. This might be the thing that gets us out of there. Just a micro dosing nation that connects together.
*  I know every time I've went deep, it was life changing for me.
*  Like I'll do a lot of mushrooms every now and then just like, you know, whoo, let's get, but anytime I was like, let's go, it was a life changing experience every time.
*  It's funny that people want to reject that as not being important.
*  That's what's really important is to keep people from like losing their mind and losing their ambition and becoming like the hippies were in the 1960s following Timothy Leary.
*  That's what everybody's worried about. Everybody's worried about like this collapse of society because people, they give up on capitalism.
*  They tune in and drop out, you know, that whole thing.
*  I don't think that's real. I don't think we should be worried about that.
*  I think those people are always going to want to drop out.
*  People that want to fuck off are always going to want to fuck off.
*  And if you give them an excuse, yeah, they're going to do it. But that's just a style of person.
*  That's not going to affect most people.
*  Most people would benefit, especially if they're not crazy. They don't have like mental health problems.
*  You'll probably get something out of it.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's helped me in some of my most depressed moments.
*  If I'm really in a dark, dark spot and can't get out of it, my wife will encourage me to go trip.
*  She'd be like, why don't you go? Could we like we got this called the Buffalo River back in Tennessee?
*  It's out outside of a little town called Hornwall, Tennessee.
*  Look, old country river, man. I mean, look, country Creek River.
*  I mean, it's a river, but it's kind of shallow. You can see the bottom of it.
*  We'll go. It's called floating the Buffalo. We'll go out there and just float the Buffalo.
*  And every now about twice a year, me and the buddies will go out there and we'll just take six or seven day and just float the Buffalo.
*  So if I haven't got to do it in a year because of the schedule, my wife will feel that on me and be like, no, you might need to go to the Buffalo.
*  You know what I'm saying? She's like, she'll say it really cool.
*  She'll be like, when's the last time you floated the Buffalo?
*  And I'll be like, it's been a year, hadn't it?
*  She'll be like, I think you and scary Larry is one of my best friends.
*  And he's I've known that we met each other in juvenile hall.
*  He's just wild character. So he goes, you and scary should go float the Buffalo.
*  So it's like, encourage me. Like she knows I'm going to come back a way better husband, way better father.
*  You know what the wildest theory I've ever heard about psilocybin is, is that it came from outer space.
*  That's an organism from another planet.
*  And the reason for this is that they know that spores can survive in the vacuum of space.
*  And there's a thing called panspermia.
*  What panspermia is, is the idea of that, like an asteroid slams into a planet and it takes amino acids and biological organisms that can survive in space and a bunch of different elements from that planet and then introduces those new elements to another planet by way of an asteroid.
*  And that's that's a real thing that we know for sure happens. Right.
*  And they know that that's how we get a riddium.
*  There's a lot of a riddium on Earth, like in places where there's been an impact because it's really rare on Earth, but really common in space.
*  So we know that some shit gets to us.
*  And apparently I'm too stupid to understand this, but the way botanists describe it and see if you can find any information on this, there's something very unusual about the compound psilocybin and psilocybin mushrooms, psilocybin cubensis mushrooms.
*  They're very weird and they're not really connected to a lot of the other fungus that's here in some strange way.
*  Like the way they work is like also very tied into human neurochemistry.
*  Like it's really close to like dimethyltryptamine, which is a part of human neurochemistry.
*  And so the craziest theory is that it's come from space.
*  Living spores have been found and collected in every level of Earth's atmosphere.
*  Mushroom spores are electron dense and can survive in the vacuum of space.
*  Additionally, their outer layer is actually metallic and of a purple hue, which naturally allows the spore to deflect ultraviolet light.
*  And as if all this wasn't unique enough, the outer shell of the spore is the hardest organic compound to exist in nature.
*  So this is one of the weirder theories.
*  So this was this Terrence McKenna's theory.
*  Our mushrooms from outer space is the bad.
*  It breaks them up.
*  I don't know if it's officially his theory, but the late ethnobotanist Terrence McKenna suggested that.
*  Mushrooms are responsible for human intelligence.
*  Yeah, yeah, theory.
*  It's called the stoned ape theory.
*  Yeah, I heard about that.
*  His theory hypothesized that mushroom spores possess all the necessary requirements to travel on space currents.
*  Furthermore, they could have settled in the brain matter of primitive hominoids and following the lines of modern day hallucinogenic mushrooms directly contributed to our modern day intelligence and self awareness.
*  Yeah, it's fucking wild.
*  Yeah, his theories.
*  That's why I mean, if you could see it there, click on that back again, you could see where it was talking about his theory.
*  So his theory is very, very bizarre.
*  So we went on to theorize that mushrooms are the reason there's human life on Earth.
*  Yeah.
*  So while it may seem like material from space from a science fiction novel, rather, there is no avoiding the fact that mushrooms possess many traits that are unique to their kingdom alone.
*  Fungi build cell walls of I don't know how to say that word chitin chitin chitin are the same material that makes up the hard outer shell of insects and other arthropods.
*  I'm so country.
*  I said chitin chitin could be chitin chitin like chitlins.
*  These cell walls contain similar chemicals found in butterfly and beetle wings as well as the plumage of some colorful bird such as peacocks living spores.
*  OK, so we've read that.
*  But what is it?
*  There was something about his theory where he's explaining his theory of how it would have worked.
*  That's it.
*  Well, his is essentially his theory was that they experimented with mushrooms and it made him better hunters and made him more creative and it made him figure out language.
*  And he thinks it's responsible for this like this weird mystery of the human brain size.
*  It doubled over a period of two million years and there's no real solid explanation.
*  It's a very strange thing.
*  And the apparently the biggest mystery in all the fossil record when it comes to animals and evolution.
*  Yeah.
*  How the human brain double over two million years.
*  Oh, dude, had to been so sad.
*  Probably had a part of it or aliens.
*  Right.
*  Maybe aliens.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe both.
*  Maybe they are.
*  You know, maybe they are aliens.
*  Maybe we're just looking the wrong way.
*  Maybe we're fucking aliens, right?
*  I think we probably are.
*  I think we probably are.
*  We doesn't seem like we belong here.
*  You know, I tell somebody all the time, my new theory is because my life turned out in such a way I never dreamed that this is a simulation and that there is an overweight nerdy alien that plays me and that during my time I think about this all the time when I'm high and that my sleeping hours are like when he's doing his normal stuff and my waking hours are his two hours a day.
*  And I just imagine this like kid that's looking back like, Mom, you won't believe what I've done with that fat dude the last nine months.
*  It's fucking crazy.
*  He's one of the most famous artists in the world.
*  And she's like, you got to get off.
*  He's like, but he's going to the Grammy.
*  Yeah, it's like a super hype version of Red Dead Redemption.
*  My dude's telling people like, y'all remember that dude we thought wasn't going to do it.
*  He did it.
*  It's like a figured it out.
*  If it's a simulation, it's a really good one.
*  We're in a good timeline, brother.
*  Oh, it couldn't be.
*  We're in a really good episode.
*  We got a good group of writers.
*  It couldn't have got any color.
*  It's like if you're on a show and you got writers like this, fuck, these writers are amazing.
*  This fucking show is always entertaining.
*  Every day there's drama.
*  Yeah.
*  Especially right now.
*  We're in the middle of the drama.
*  Oh, my goodness.
*  There's so much.
*  There's so much you could get overwhelmed just looking at the fucking news every day.
*  It's a great time for me to be in the middle of a tour because I have missed it all.
*  I'm doing five shows a week and I'm so in the vortex of touring.
*  Yeah, good.
*  We do that old school rock and roll shit.
*  So we really do play five shows a week for 12, 13 weeks.
*  That's amazing.
*  It's awesome, dude.
*  But again, that's why you're so comfortable up there.
*  You're so just.
*  It reeks of a man has done a thousand shows.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's like when you see a comedian up there really comfortable.
*  It's like when I watched the tell at the Comedy Cellar when he leaned back on the wall, I was like,
*  Oh, he's fitting to kill.
*  But he just walked straight up and lean back.
*  And then he calls Ian up and he ends up just throwing, you know, just shit at him.
*  And he's just lightening in on fire.
*  It was just so good, man.
*  Yeah, they that's a good hammer and nail.
*  The two of those guys together, too.
*  He did that at the club here.
*  Yeah, I feel like it's it reminds me of like the early phases of like a bumping likes thing,
*  like a new version of that.
*  Right.
*  Which because when him and Jeff Ross are together, it's like when David Lucas and Tony are firing on each other.
*  I feel the exact same way when Jeff Ross and David Teller near each other.
*  Yeah, I get that same excited feeling of like, oh, some shit's going to pop off.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like, yeah, when David and Tony go after each other, there's like hours on the Internet of just David and Tony shit on each other.
*  It's a hundred thousand ways David can call Tony gay.
*  Yeah, and he's called David a hundred thousand ways to be fat.
*  It's also the way they laugh at each other doing it.
*  Like if this is a simulation, man, we picked a really good one.
*  Yeah, it's getting cooler and cooler.
*  Elon believes it's a simulation.
*  He's a lot smarter than me.
*  Yeah, he thinks the odds that it's not a simulation are in the billions.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, in the billions, he said.
*  Wow.
*  I'm telling you, dude, there's a little dude just nobody believes that he's going to school every day like my Minecraft dude is killing it.
*  Do you get that imposter syndrome thing ever?
*  Oh, man, so much.
*  I'm somewhere between feeling extremely uncomfortable where I'm at in my career right now or overly comfortable where I'm out of my career.
*  So I'm either having to catch myself and go, whoa, big fella.
*  Right.
*  Come on now, dawg.
*  You were just in jail, Tim.
*  You were.
*  People that knew you six years ago hate you still.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  It's like.
*  And then I have situations where I'm like, I don't belong here.
*  I'm having that moment right now.
*  This is this is my first album, Joe, that is going to be in a fight for the number one album in the world.
*  Never dream.
*  Now, this is like, what the fuck am I doing here?
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like, do you think that's a different world?
*  Do you think that's maybe something that you shouldn't even think about?
*  Because, like, your music's amazing.
*  You're amazing.
*  Maybe all that.
*  Just let it just exist.
*  No, that's what I that's what I've been.
*  And that's how I so big now.
*  It's almost like if you pay attention to it, you're going to go blind.
*  Oh, you know what I'm saying?
*  Like, you're kind of staring at the sun.
*  Yeah, you're kind of staring at the sun.
*  Like it used to be you had a little campfire and you're warming your hands because it's cold outside.
*  But now you're kind of staring at the sun and maybe just be Jelly Roll.
*  That's that's what I.
*  Yeah.
*  But what's getting being Jelly Roll got me to the point that they're now saying I might have a number one album.
*  You probably know what I'm saying?
*  And then you're in a place where you're like, holy fuck.
*  And that's where the imposter syndrome comes in, because you're like, you know, I wasn't even.
*  That's where friends are bored.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  I didn't have a Billboard Hot 100 song.
*  Right.
*  Until twenty four thirty six months ago.
*  Yeah.
*  You exploded.
*  But you handle it beautifully.
*  You really do.
*  You because you feel like genuine gratitude, genuine gratitude comes off you.
*  Thank you.
*  I am true.
*  You feel it.
*  I mean, you know me.
*  I can't believe this is happening.
*  I know you can't.
*  But it's the wildest thing ever.
*  It is.
*  Every corner.
*  We deserve it.
*  I was just with our boy Brigham doing some blood work and getting some getting some some some shit to make my feel better.
*  Broke my broke my heel.
*  And we were talking about that of like living in the gratitude of it to the end, realizing even you saying that we're such a special simulation.
*  Yeah.
*  This the time of this.
*  I know I keep going back to the same point, but it's where my heart is right now is watching me and a bunch of guys that were all at this kind of same thing at the same time three or four years ago that you could feel the teapot bubbling and all of us being like a little left of center.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like I wasn't supposed to be in country music the way that they've embraced me outside looking in you to never guess.
*  Right.
*  And you know, I mean, you could have never said that kill Tony would be the number one live podcast on the Internet.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Or that Schultz's podcast would be or that me and Zach Brian would have this similar.
*  Of course, he wound up being way bigger than me.
*  But just like similar kind of we're writing songs our whole life that nobody really heard.
*  And all of a sudden they got just it's probably the craziest synergies that could have ever happened in any scenario for me in any way.
*  And it's inspired me to get healthy.
*  It's like gave me purpose and I've never felt more loved.
*  I've never felt more warmed or welcome.
*  I spent so much time feeling the opposite of loved.
*  You know, even walking in here and playing with Carl, there was a time in my life where I would have walked in here and that dog would let y'all know I was not a good person.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  You would have just looked at me like, why is Carl acting weird with this big guy?
*  You know what I mean?
*  Yeah. What's up with kids were the same way.
*  Do kids would look at me and squall.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And it's really inspired me to start focusing on my health to do.
*  And I'm down 100 pounds now, officially down 100 fucking pounds.
*  That's amazing. Congratulations.
*  That's really huge.
*  That's a massive accomplishment.
*  Thank you, brother. It's been all food.
*  I'm working out.
*  I'm walking.
*  But what I've learned is as I'm losing the weight, it's inspiring me to just keep going by nature.
*  I want to go walk and do more stuff because I fucking I'm lighter.
*  I feel better.
*  So when the army is like, you want to go play basketball?
*  We're playing basketball three days a week now.
*  Wow. You want to hear the coolest act of love, Joe?
*  I'll try not to get emotional talking about this, but.
*  My whole band.
*  Has watched me fight.
*  Cocaine addiction.
*  They watch me get off coke.
*  They watch me get off lean.
*  They've watched me figure my life out slowly, and they knew that the last mountain for me was food.
*  So we started putting a real structure around.
*  I hired a real nutritionist.
*  He's out here with me now.
*  I mean, like, I'm only eating his food.
*  I'm just like super with it.
*  We're getting anything that could, you know, out of the green room for just.
*  So I'm working out every day walking around the arenas.
*  And one day they have a basketball court.
*  We're fucking playing it up.
*  This is insane, by the way, that I'm playing fucking NBA arenas and like I'm playing where the fucking Orlando.
*  I'm on Orlando Magic Court like what the fuck?
*  I'm talking about a fucking fat shack.
*  But so the first day it's just like me and like three or four dudes.
*  The crew heard do the next day.
*  Thirty.
*  The whole crew showed up for me and they don't you know, these dudes are just they're just there because they know it's helping me kind of.
*  So now three days a week we're written basketball courts and having full blown fucking tournaments.
*  And it's been so good for me because it's like reconnecting to my childhood in this really weird way of like I grew up in a community where there were basketball courts and we would all go play.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's like it's been really like it's been the best experience ever.
*  And I'm getting to do it in like back to that weird shit.
*  Not only are you experiencing this with your friends and people you love and then you're doing it at the San Antonio Spurs Court and the San Antonio Spurs coaches out there giving you pointers and fucking being the referee.
*  That's amazing.
*  You're the Sacramento Kings coaches fucking shooting with you.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Yeah.
*  Elon's right.
*  This is not this ain't real life.
*  No, it can't be.
*  It's unreal, dude.
*  Leaving nationwide arena.
*  But I was also telling Brigham talking about the humility too is that I'm still nervous walking in here.
*  We're friends.
*  And you know what you tell us all the time is what you told Brigham.
*  Nobody's going to tell you we're just two friends talking.
*  I was like, I know with 20 million motherfuckers listening dog.
*  I fucking I'm not falling for that.
*  We're just two buddies talking to it.
*  Don't look at the sun.
*  That's it.
*  You're right.
*  You know how much I needed to hear that?
*  Yeah.
*  Especially like because I don't get in my head about stuff.
*  But just this week was the first time the label called and said, hey, we don't want to we want to put this on your radar because it might make you want to promote the record.
*  You might have a number one album.
*  And I was like, whoa, dude, this shit wasn't even in my mind.
*  When I had a number five album last year, you couldn't have told me I didn't have a number one album.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I was like, fuck you.
*  Crazy.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  What's in that?
*  What's water?
*  This is coffee.
*  That's water.
*  OK.
*  Yeah, it's it's a wild experience, man.
*  And if it's not real, boy, we picked a really good simulation.
*  It's been great, though, man.
*  It's been great to hear that you're on this positive track because it's all now just about momentum.
*  It's just about staying on the course.
*  That's what's hard for people is getting the good momentum.
*  Yeah, I'm building the momentum.
*  I had a moment the other day.
*  I was telling Schultz this.
*  It was a really small win.
*  But for a food lifelong food addict, Joe, I was up to five hundred and fifty some pounds.
*  I was having to weigh myself at meat places, you know, and I was telling him that I used to walk in and like a drug addict.
*  I would scan the room and make a count of everything I could eat.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like if you had like the little baby Snickers and a little thing or did it does and like the other day I was in my green room and somebody was in the green room and they picked up a piece of candy and said, did you eat?
*  You want one of these?
*  Because we just got hit to hit a dab or something.
*  I didn't even know the candy was in there.
*  Because normally they get the candy.
*  They don't put shit like that in my room.
*  And that was the first time I was like, oh, I'm on to something like I'm fucking winning right now.
*  Right. Like I didn't even notice that I could have been eating for five hours.
*  No, you know, I would have eaten them all.
*  I didn't even scan for candy.
*  It wasn't even it's not even a thought now when I walk into places is is there a candy dish here?
*  You know what I mean?
*  That used to be literally one of the first things I would look for.
*  You know, is there a candy dish here?
*  I've had to make so many different small habit changes, but it's been the fucking I was just telling Bob out there
*  and I was telling Bruce on the way in here, I feel this good just losing 100 pounds, Joe.
*  And I'm still I've never told my weight, but I'm gonna tell it here because I want some accountability from people.
*  I'm four twenty something now, four twenty.
*  And imagine I'm talking I'm walking around different talking different.
*  My shoulders are setting different.
*  I'm fucking my wife different.
*  I'm just kind of you know, I'm moving different.
*  But you probably have crazy powerful legs, dude.
*  It's crazy.
*  But you have massive.
*  I've been going to the gym now.
*  Listen, dude, what as much as you can fit on that thing, I'm throwing, of course, throwing.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  You've been carrying around 500 pounds.
*  Yeah, 500 plus.
*  Your legs must be sturdy as fuck.
*  And if you could lose weight now, you can have like super legs.
*  You should like keep going.
*  No, Joe.
*  Man, my goal is when I come back and do this next year, it's going to be fucking insane.
*  Like I've never been more dialed in.
*  I've never cared more about it.
*  I've never been happier.
*  What are you eating?
*  Like what does he got you eating?
*  Oh, dude, man, he's here.
*  He's he's actually been really killing it for me.
*  So I had from eating bad for so many years.
*  My gut has just been fucked.
*  So we've just been focusing on slowing down the gut.
*  I'm only twice a day.
*  I'm eating a fruit snack in between.
*  You ever do any fasting?
*  Mm hmm.
*  Yeah, I'm trying to fast one day a week now just to work on like the autophagy.
*  So some of these skin cells.
*  So I won't be as I don't want to be saggy.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Because I'm going to lose that kind of weight.
*  You know that story about that one dude that went on nothing but a vitamin IV drip for a year.
*  And lost 200 something pounds.
*  I think he lost 300 pounds.
*  Didn't he lose like 300 pounds?
*  Something crazy like that.
*  The dude had no food for you just and his fat shrunk, but his skin shrunk too.
*  Yeah, that's what happens.
*  Somebody told me, and I could have the name wrong here, but it's called autophagy.
*  Have you heard of this?
*  I think autophagy is when your body gets rid of all bad cells.
*  This is like something that comes with fasting.
*  Bad cells is definitely a scientific version of it.
*  I think the way they explain it to me is that it has something to do with the elastics of the skin.
*  And that is what helps.
*  So that's why one day a week, at least every other week, I'm just taking a full 24 hours.
*  But I'm only eating probably eight or nine hours a day now anyway.
*  So I'm kind of intermittent anyways.
*  That's the real bummer when people lose a lot of weight is that you got all this extra skin.
*  Like Ethan Souplis, he had to have all that shit cut and stitched up.
*  I've listened to that podcast with him twice in the last 90 days.
*  Y'all's full three hour podcast is first here.
*  Just to kind of, I love the way he thinks.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just, you know.
*  He's a brilliant guy.
*  I love, for me, I'm always looking for like inspiration.
*  As a songwriter, we're always writing a song.
*  You know, as a comedian, you're always looking for a joke.
*  You know what I mean?
*  So that kind of, I'm always looking for that.
*  So when I found that pod, I was like, oh, this dude.
*  And he kind of did what I would, how he looks now is a dream scenario for me.
*  He didn't get like crazy big, but he doesn't look like saggy sick.
*  Because sometimes when you go from being as big as we've gotten,
*  you get down to 300 pounds and people start looking at you like, are you okay?
*  And you're like, I'm fucking better than I've ever been.
*  You know what I mean?
*  They're worried.
*  Yeah, they're worried, you know, because, but they just couldn't imagine.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Even when I just told, I always forget his name,
*  but your guy out there, the Archer guy, worked at the archery store, great guy.
*  But I was just telling him that I, yeah, same thing, same concept.
*  Yeah, if you just keep going, you know, it'll become normal for you to not eat candy,
*  normal for you to eat healthy food.
*  It'll be what you crave.
*  Lots of protein, lots of bone broth kind of potatoes.
*  Anything that we're doing, whether it's rice or bone broth, we're not doing a lot of it.
*  But when we do it, we're soaking it in bone broth,
*  keeping it really clean protein style, kind of going low on fats,
*  kind of let my liver kind of reset from just years of me eating foods,
*  fatty foods and shitty greasies.
*  You know what I mean?
*  So just been kind of taking it slow, man.
*  I'm enjoying it though.
*  The cool thing is he did Bilal Muhammad's weight cut.
*  He's worked with DC.
*  I found him from that world.
*  So he really gets it.
*  And that's a complicated science.
*  Yeah.
*  You get those guys like Bilal's way over 170.
*  I don't know what he weighs, but I got to guess he's close to 200 pounds.
*  Yeah.
*  And he cuts down to 170 perfectly.
*  Yeah, Ian does it every time.
*  Said it's pretty effortless, man.
*  Ian says it out of everybody that Bilal is just insanely disciplined.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like when he goes into camp, he's like a different dude.
*  Well, that dude does, he's done camp in Ramadan.
*  And you know, you can't eat or drink anything during the daylight hours at Ramadan.
*  So he would have to get up in the morning while it's dark out,
*  have a morning breakfast, go to training, not eat anything.
*  Do it to a day probably.
*  And no water in your training.
*  And then at the end of the day, then you get to eat.
*  No, he's a machine.
*  That dude is complete.
*  That Leon Edwards fight was crazy.
*  I get to see him tomorrow.
*  He's a great guy, man.
*  He's a great guy.
*  He really is.
*  And you know, the fact that he's that devout a Muslim that he, you know,
*  prays five times a day, like he doesn't fuck around.
*  Like he's really by the book.
*  He doesn't even swear.
*  No, he says fudge.
*  Yeah.
*  Jelly, jelly, jelly.
*  What the fudge are you doing?
*  Yeah.
*  When are you coming to fudge in Chicago?
*  It's ridiculous.
*  It's ridiculous.
*  He's like this assassin and he, you know, I'm going to get to see the two champs tomorrow
*  or I'll get to see him and I'll get to see the Venezuelan vixen.
*  They're both coming.
*  So him and Julian are coming out to the show.
*  Chicago.
*  Yeah, I'm super excited, man.
*  Nice.
*  Album release night, Chicago United Center.
*  First time at the United Center.
*  Big deal for me.
*  Chicago is always a great fucking town.
*  It's such what's the comedy club down there?
*  Well, they have a few.
*  They have what do they have?
*  Zanies in Chicago.
*  They have another one in Rosemont.
*  The Dorfman brothers don't have nothing to do with that one though, do they?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  They never know.
*  That doesn't make sense if they don't.
*  Did you hear what they did to the Nashville Zanies?
*  So, you know, Brian and them own that building and the, through the back bar, the, so, you
*  know, Zanies doors here, the front door, not the door we go through, the front door,
*  whatever that place was right here, he's turned that into a place called the lab now.
*  And it's like a 50 person small, it would be like the little boy.
*  Oh.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Yeah.
*  Like the little boy.
*  So he calls it the lab at Zanies now.
*  Oh, that's nice.
*  Yeah, it's super.
*  It's really, really cool.
*  They used to have a really good room at the improv in Hollywood they called the lab.
*  And that's where Ari started, This Is Not Happening, which became that Comedy Central
*  show.
*  You know, the storyteller show.
*  That all started in that lab.
*  That was Ari's little baby that he created.
*  The old way the improv rather used to be set up was amazing.
*  You have the big room, and then you have this tucked away small room in the back with a
*  very small bar.
*  But then they expanded it and made the bar bigger and made the stage by the door.
*  They fucked the whole thing up.
*  The whole thing's fucked now.
*  It used to be the stage was in the back.
*  There wasn't a lot of noise in the room.
*  And then they turned it into a bar and fucked it up.
*  But at that time, that was what it was called.
*  It was called the lab.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the place they call the lab.
*  It's beautiful.
*  Speaking of that show, God, I'd love to see that show back.
*  This is not happening?
*  That show was so good.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what happened with that?
*  You know how it all went down?
*  Please?
*  Ari got an offer from Netflix to do a special.
*  He actually filmed his special.
*  And Comedy Central wanted it because he was on Comedy Central.
*  But Netflix was better for him.
*  And they were pissed that he was going to do the special on Netflix.
*  So they fired him.
*  And he stuck to his guns.
*  And then Roy Wood took over.
*  And he did it for a while.
*  And that was the end of it.
*  That's why.
*  It was because Ari wouldn't listen to that.
*  They were trying to force him into doing his special on Comedy Central.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's like, no.
*  I don't have a contract that I have to do it on Comedy Central.
*  This is crazy.
*  And they tried to use the show.
*  They did use the show.
*  They fired him.
*  How fucking petty is that?
*  They fired him.
*  It was crazy.
*  And not to say Roy Wood didn't do great with the show.
*  Roy Wood is great.
*  Ari was happy that Roy Wood took over.
*  First of all, Roy is hilarious.
*  Great comic.
*  But also, that meant all the people that were working on the show got to work.
*  Ari was going to take out a loan.
*  And he was going to pay all the people.
*  All the camera people, all the crew.
*  He was going to pay everybody their salary.
*  Just because he felt bad.
*  He felt bad.
*  And he was like, this is not what I want.
*  This is not my fault.
*  But they're forcing me into it.
*  And by principle, I can't just give in and say, okay, I'm going to do this at Comedy Central.
*  But just for us having fun today purposes, imagine if that show came back right now with Ari.
*  It could.
*  It could come back.
*  In the explosion that's happening right now?
*  Well, Ari should do the show on Netflix.
*  It's his show.
*  I would.
*  He called it, now he calls it Ari Shafir's Renamed Storyteller Show.
*  I think that's what he calls it.
*  He still does it.
*  It's on Netflix now?
*  No.
*  No, no.
*  I said he should do it on Netflix.
*  But he'll still do live ones every now and then.
*  He does live storyteller shows.
*  No, he should do it, man.
*  I think about guys like Brian.
*  I would cry laughing to hear whatever his story was.
*  I think about the Joey Diaz, the Mother Mary story.
*  If you know what I'm going to that.
*  You know, like there are stories on there that.
*  Yeah.
*  Everybody's got good stories too.
*  People have stories of some fucking nutty thing that happened on the road or what have you.
*  No, it's crazy.
*  I'd love to start seeing people in my genre try stuff like that more.
*  If they ever did it, just try to like, I'd love to hear, you know, Jason Aldean tell a story.
*  You know what I mean?
*  If he really, if he got with somebody backstage, like one of the homies, you know what I'm saying?
*  Like if Rosebud was back there with him and was like, all right, tell me your best story and I'll punch it up.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I think Jason Aldean would at least kill a six minute story.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Everybody's got at least one good story.
*  One that you could concoct.
*  Yeah, I think that's probably the really is probably the oldest form of human entertainment.
*  Funny house.
*  I love when I love when anything you talk about has a theme and this one has been storytelling.
*  And that's it's it's all I ever wanted to do before I was writing songs because I knew that music could be written that way.
*  I would just write these kind of stories for my mother.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I would just try to, you know, the story we've talked about a lot.
*  But it was a way to connect with her even before music.
*  And then when I found out music was her shit, I was like, oh, this is the double connection.
*  Like, oh, this is doubling down on this.
*  And I still to this day think I'm writing for my mama.
*  Wow.
*  Like to this day, I'm still like when I'm really finishing a song, I'm thinking to myself, I wonder what my mama would think about this, you know, in this really weird way.
*  Like first thought, like I want her mama like this, you know, does this represent?
*  And then the second thought is, why does this song exist?
*  That's always my second following thought is first of all, is like, well, my mama dig it.
*  And then the second is, you know what I mean?
*  It's like the second is like, why is this exist?
*  You know what I mean? What could it do?
*  What purpose could it actually serve?
*  Right.
*  And if it's a it could be anything as much as it's just, you know, it just makes me happy or it could make people happy or it could make people move is enough of a reason.
*  Out of these one hundred plus songs you've written recently, how many of them you think you'll ever record?
*  I recorded probably 30 something of them.
*  Wow. I'm going to put out probably 28.
*  And I think four or five will probably end up circulating next year through other artists that'll just cut some of the songs.
*  Because sometimes I'll write a song show, but I'm just not the vessel.
*  And I know it when I'm writing it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Do you hear it in a different voice?
*  Sometimes, sometimes, but sometimes you just know that it's like I couldn't sing this with a certain amount of conviction.
*  You know, like for me personally, you know, it's not that I couldn't, you know, it's I don't know.
*  I don't know if this is a good comparison, but it'd be like I could write a song about hating my wife, but I could never sing it because I don't really hate my wife.
*  Right.
*  I could never sing it with conviction.
*  Now, as an as a songwriter, do I have the skill set to write a song about hating my wife?
*  For sure.
*  But would I ever sing one and represent myself that way?
*  And it's just not just I couldn't sing it with conviction, but there might be a guy in Nashville who just got his heart broke.
*  Well, you know, Coulter Walls, Kate McKinnon.
*  That's the mother of all I hate my wife songs.
*  Insane.
*  That's a crazy song.
*  When the fact the fact that dude was 21 when he sang that you're like, what?
*  It sounds like he's 58.
*  I believe in reincarnation.
*  I'm telling you, man.
*  There's no other way.
*  That doesn't make sense.
*  And if his story couldn't get any cooler, it's that he just doesn't give a fuck.
*  Don't give a fuck.
*  Won't do podcasts.
*  For sure.
*  I tried so hard.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's crazy.
*  He told Post Malone Post Malone hit him up and Post was like, hey, man, I'd love to work.
*  And pretty much he was like, yeah, if you ever want to come to the ranch, we can maybe write a song or something.
*  He's like, Post is like, if you want to fly to the middle of Canada, we can write a song.
*  But if you think I'm getting off this ranch to write with you, fuck no.
*  Yeah, he really works on a ranch.
*  Yeah, that's how Cody Johnson is too, though.
*  Cody Johnson flies out on the way.
*  He's a it's a joke with him all the time.
*  I'm like, you're a cowboy that plays a country music singer on the weekends.
*  You like because, you know, I mean, he plays music for real, but he literally goes home and ranches Monday through Thursday.
*  You'll FaceTime this dude and he'll be out just in his ranch somewhere tagging cattle.
*  That's amazing. You know what I mean?
*  And then Friday night, he'll fly and go sell out, you know, two nights at the Staples Center.
*  I have not experienced any of that, but I swear to God, it's so it resonates with you when you watch it on Yellowstone.
*  Yeah, right.
*  I want to live like that.
*  So bad.
*  I want to hang out with the horses.
*  Seems like a good time.
*  Seems like everybody's all peaceful and shit.
*  We'll stay and watch the rodeo late at night because PBR plays on TV or whatever.
*  And I'll watch that stuff.
*  I don't know much about it, but I just can't quit watching.
*  I think it's the wildest shit ever.
*  Yeah, I watch it for bursts.
*  But then my knowledge of orthopedic surgeries that these people are going to be receiving and injuries and concussions, they're just like, I got to stop watching this.
*  I love watching stuff that doesn't seem real though, right?
*  Have you seen the J.B. Mooney? Is that how you say his name? Is it Mooney? Mooney, right?
*  I think it's Mooney. Is it Mooney or Mooney? You got me thinking now.
*  Yeah, me too. But he is.
*  But that dude, he owns the cow that retired him.
*  It's crazy. How cool is that?
*  Yeah, it's pretty cool.
*  Yeah, but we're talking about a dude that, you know, with no helmet, cigarette lit in his mouth.
*  Animal.
*  Like, oh, just when you look at...
*  Animal.
*  Those dudes riding bulls with no helmet on is the craziest fucking American thing that anyone's ever done.
*  That is so dumb and so amazing at the same time.
*  Like, what the fuck are you doing?
*  It is so American, dude.
*  And especially when you had the cigarette, you're just like, it almost looked like it was out of a movie.
*  Like somebody overcooked it.
*  And at the end, those guys are always broken. Everything's broken.
*  We had a dude on Fear Factor that was a bull rider and one of his arms, his shoulder had like just giant scars all over the place.
*  City had like five or six shoulder reconstructions.
*  It pops out sometimes. He has to pop it back in.
*  That is...
*  Jeez.
*  Sick.
*  It's crazy.
*  All from riding a...
*  A giant 2,000 pound animal that doesn't want you riding it.
*  With horns.
*  Yeah. And when it gets you off of it, it wants to hurt you afterwards.
*  It wants to stomp you.
*  Yeah, it's pissed off.
*  Yeah, man. Fuck all that noise.
*  I can't quit watching them, though. I don't know why. I'm just so attracted. I've always been attracted.
*  I loved songs about rodeos, though, is what did it. We talked about it before, too.
*  There was 90s music, had all these like old school, really cool rodeo records.
*  And I feel like somewhere, it's kind of like everything goes in themes and then country music went through like, you know, the hunting and fishing era.
*  But in the 70s, it was more of the storytelling era, like the poncho and lefty style stuff. You know what I mean?
*  But to me, the 90s cowboy music was like still some of the best country music ever made.
*  Bro, you know who's got the best rodeo song for my money? Zach Brown. Open the Gate.
*  Oh, it's one of the best rodeo songs ever written.
*  Oh, my God.
*  One hundred percent.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Meanwhile, I'm listening to him going, get off that bull. Don't ride that bull.
*  Don't do it. Your dad's dead.
*  Don't ride the same goddamn bull that killed your dad. Jesus Christ.
*  You want to hear a cool rodeo story? Reba McIntyre got discovered at one.
*  At a rodeo?
*  Let's talk about a real cowgirl. Reba McIntyre was like Oklahoma or somewhere,
*  and she would sing the national anthem at all the local rodeos because they knew she was a local singer, but she was a real cowboy.
*  So one night she was she was singing.
*  And this is, you know, back in the day when it was old school, like a record exec discovered you.
*  Wow.
*  You know what I mean? And like flew you to Nashville and signed you to a record deal.
*  That's a true story.
*  The Reba was just like, did it because she loved it.
*  Like like if you were singing in church, you just every weekend, they'd have the rodeo in town and she'd go sing the national anthem for.
*  Wow.
*  How many people are like that out there?
*  When you think about yourself becoming like artist of the year at thirty nine.
*  How many people are like that out there that are just super talented?
*  They just never get that crack.
*  It's cool. It's man.
*  There's a thing that's inside some people.
*  There's a thing that's inside some people.
*  And it's different in everybody.
*  Like you're different is different than Colter Walls.
*  Different is different than Reba's different different than Johnny Cash is different.
*  Everybody's got that thing.
*  Everybody's got a thing.
*  But there's so many people out there that we never get to see that thing.
*  I wonder how much of it is the ones that just jump ship early to the they quit.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of people quit. It's hard.
*  I think I think about doing something for ten years to no avail.
*  Right. It's really, really hard.
*  You've all just what I tell people.
*  I was a desperate delusional dreamer job and everything I regret I did out of desperation.
*  But I don't regret one thing I did as a delusional dreamer.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Because there was moments we were we were I did this.
*  I went to the juvenile yesterday in Columbus, Ohio.
*  I went to go play cards with the kids in their units before my show.
*  I try to do stuff like that all the time.
*  And we were all talking about, you know, time energy stuff into this and songs and I talk about writing one hundred and seventy songs last year.
*  And I was like, do you all know that there was so many moments in my life where I in hindsight, I'm glad nobody sat me down really, that I had to have looked fucking crazy.
*  You know, that kid asked me, he said, when did you feel like you made it?
*  I was like, I think that's why God kept blessing me is that me and DJ highlight is my DJ from Columbus, Ohio.
*  He was there with me. We did the one o'clock slot at Rock on the Range 12 years ago.
*  Right. The festival, you know, Rock on the Range, Jamie.
*  This is a big deal of where Jamie's from.
*  We played the fifth stage of five stages.
*  So we played the smallest states there.
*  Thirty minutes after they opened the gates.
*  Joe, we started drinking at 10 o'clock that morning because we were rock stars in our minds.
*  We had made it. There was we were that delusional.
*  We were backstage, full blown shooting shots and celebrating.
*  There was 40 people there.
*  There was thousands of people just walking right past our stage to the stage they were going to.
*  We didn't care. We had made it.
*  You know what I mean? Like we'd made you're telling me we got fifteen hundred bucks to do this.
*  This is insane.
*  We have arrived and I'd go home.
*  I'll beat up Ben and my whole neighborhood probably had to look like I was fucking nuts.
*  You know what I'm saying? But nobody said that to me.
*  I look like the crazy person kind of right at this point.
*  I'm in my early 30s, mid 30s even.
*  And they're like, all right, big guy, but you're at Rock on the Range.
*  Yeah, you actually are performing there.
*  That's how I think you're correct. Yeah.
*  I think you should be celebrating. Yeah.
*  You're supposed to be. Yeah.
*  And when I told that kid that it was cool to see his face kind of light up, he was like, man, that's perspective.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I was like, dude, I was I would celebrate whenever I would get a clap in here when I was in juvenile, when we'd have Freestyle Fridays in juvenile.
*  And if I had if I spit one line that got a oh, man, I went to my cell, did push ups and started looking in the mirror.
*  You know what I'm saying? I was like, it's fucking fixing to happen.
*  You know, that kind of delusional just celebrate every every moment I had.
*  I made a moment.
*  What is this?
*  This is the day. Look at you up there.
*  Mm hmm. Yeah, this is us.
*  This is a true story.
*  Definitely. Rock on the Range. This is Rock on the Range, dude.
*  This is 2017, probably. Wow.
*  This was our second time. I think we've made it to the second stage by then.
*  Yeah, this is 16. Yep. This is the second time.
*  It's weird doing shows when it's bright out.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm just getting used to doing shows when it's dark.
*  I know. Shows when it's bright out are kind of crazy.
*  It's a dude. It is unforgiving.
*  Yeah. Especially when you're you know, you're trying to you're what you're working.
*  You're trying to build something. You're looking out.
*  There's a lot of people that are coming to give you a chance.
*  Yeah. But they don't know anything about you.
*  Well, the thing is, if you could figure it out, right, people figure out everything.
*  They figure out how to write books. They figure out how to play baseball.
*  People figure it out. But not everybody figures it out.
*  That's why it's so exciting when you do.
*  That's why it's so exciting when you make it.
*  Because you know it's not just that a bunch of lucky things had to happen to you
*  because they all do with all of us.
*  There's a lot of good circumstances to happen your way just to keep you alive.
*  Right. You have to get lucky.
*  But then you also have to have that thing.
*  Like what is that thing inside you that you got to get out
*  and you can figure out a way to get the best version of it and display it for people.
*  Or you quit. A lot of people quit.
*  Man. I tell you, there's a line in the song, Joe, that's an old song called Just Breathe.
*  And she goes into the song, she ends the song by going,
*  2 a.m. and I'm still awake writing this song.
*  Because if I get it all out on paper, it's no longer inside of me,
*  threatening the life it belongs to.
*  Mmm.
*  I almost get emotional when I tell people that.
*  Because to me that is the greatest line ever written as to how I feel.
*  You know what I mean?
*  This idea that I have to get this out of me.
*  When I write, it's not like I have to.
*  It's like a thing in me that's burning in me.
*  It's like I have to get this out of me.
*  I wrote Somebody Saved Me on a Sheet of Paper out of a Dead Sleep.
*  Really?
*  Notebook side of the bed.
*  Just like I wrote notes here with you when you'd say something that would inspire me.
*  One of these is a song title right here, right now.
*  You said it earlier.
*  Tell you off camera.
*  In case you got to negotiate a publishing thing.
*  But it's...
*  I wrote a song on the album, it didn't make the album,
*  but Burt one night said something.
*  He was like, yeah man, this is where dreams go to die.
*  And he was talking about a bar he used to go to.
*  Where everybody would talk about what they would do but never did.
*  So he quit talking about what he was going to do.
*  But what he don't know is I just quietly grabbed my phone and wrote,
*  Dreams Die Here.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I went and wrote the song.
*  It sucked.
*  I'm going to send it to him.
*  But I tried.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  It never made me revisit it in a year or two.
*  But I connect with that in a way that's...
*  Writing is an outlet for me.
*  It always was.
*  It was always a way to express and to tell stories around me.
*  It's also a connection to some strange realm where ideas come from.
*  Ideas that come to you, they just come to you out of nowhere.
*  They just feel like gifts.
*  They really do.
*  Like when you're sitting in front of the computer and an idea just comes to you
*  and you start writing it down.
*  Or when you wake up in the middle of the night, take a leak
*  and you can't get this idea out of your head and you've got to grab a notebook.
*  Man, those things are gifts.
*  They're gifts from the universe.
*  You've had that happen too where you find yourself at the kitchen table at 3 a.m.?
*  The worst one is I try to convince myself that I'll remember it.
*  And you go back to sleep and you'll blow it.
*  Yeah, because I'm lazy.
*  I'm like, you're going to be okay.
*  I'm like, you're going to remember.
*  Don't worry about it.
*  You'll definitely remember that.
*  You don't remember it?
*  No, no, no.
*  I remember like one of them ever.
*  But I write them down now.
*  I do too.
*  I got a small legal pad beside my bed, like the little one.
*  And I got one.
*  This is a crazy place.
*  But I have one on top of my commode.
*  That's a good place for it.
*  So in case I'm going in there to pee or something and on the way there just.
*  Yeah.
*  Sometimes too I have to grab my phone and do melodies in the middle of the night
*  because I have dreamed of melodies before.
*  Like you hear it.
*  Like stone cold melodies in my dreams.
*  Like the somebody saved me melody was in my dream.
*  The first words.
*  The problem was me and DeRay joke about it.
*  It took us two hours to write the song that would have took us 20 minutes to write
*  because I was convinced somebody saved me was supposed to be the chorus.
*  Oh, interesting.
*  I know I'm weird when I talk about stuff like this, Joe,
*  but this is how the universe works.
*  I don't think I was wrong.
*  Because when Eminem ended up taking that song, you know, Eminem redid that song.
*  Oh, you got to hear it.
*  It's crazy. Eminem redid the song and he took the verse from somebody saved me
*  the first verse and made it the chorus.
*  So his version of it is he's rapping and then my first verse is the chorus.
*  And then he raps again and my first verse is the chorus again.
*  So maybe I was kind of right in the groom.
*  I kept going back to like you should tell him.
*  Did you ever tell him that before you never even told him the story?
*  It gets Joe. I'm fucking flippin. It gets even deeper, dog.
*  John Manili, my manager calls me and goes, he says, Paul Rosenberg just called me.
*  That's his manager. He says, I think Eminem wants to do something to save me.
*  I didn't ask John Manili right then.
*  Joe, I said, man, I hope he takes the first verse and samples it.
*  That's all I said.
*  And John said, whatever. I don't know what he wants to do with it.
*  We just sent it over because, you know, Eminem is the greatest ever.
*  You don't send him instructions or notes or ideas.
*  You know what I'm saying? You're just like, yo.
*  And we didn't talk about that until we met.
*  And he was just as whipped out too, because the funny part about him was
*  he was struggling with whether or not he was going to keep the original chorus
*  and do somebody save me at the end or do somebody save me as the chorus
*  and put the original chorus at the end.
*  And he ended up doing somebody save me in the original chorus at the end.
*  So he fought the battle the opposite of the way I fought it.
*  It's crazy, right? How art works that way.
*  It is crazy. It's crazy where those things come from.
*  The muse, you know?
*  And you've got to respect the muse, you know?
*  And I think when you're writing a lot like you are, that muse is ready to go.
*  You're tuned into whatever that is that gives you those ideas for songs.
*  You're in the mode of searching for it.
*  You're right. I'm in that space. I'm in my stride.
*  I'm in my quest. I'm looking for it at every angle right now.
*  I wrote a song. I wrote so many.
*  Talking about storytelling again, sorry I keep going here.
*  It's my fucking storytelling podcast.
*  I probably have four songs on this podcast that I wrote.
*  Just very old school storytelling.
*  Like the music I grew up loving.
*  Like how Willie Nelson would tell these stories of these characters.
*  And it has been so...
*  Talking about muses, I wasn't sure if I was going to tell this story, but I will.
*  As a part of my journey of my mental health and with things I struggle with,
*  I will pop into when I'm home, NA or AA meetings.
*  Even though I still drink and smoke pot.
*  I don't claim to be a part of the program because I have so much respect for those who are sober.
*  Like can really live the clean sober life by the program.
*  But it's helped me so much not to go back to some of my demons.
*  It's taught me about gratitude lists. It's just helped me a lot.
*  And I go to a few a year.
*  Never say nothing, just sit in the back quietly.
*  I'm just sitting there trying to learn.
*  Never went in there thinking like an artist.
*  Just kind of going there thinking like an addict.
*  So I just want to be an addict in here. That's why I don't talk.
*  And I watched a man having a breakdown in there.
*  And this happens. You know what I mean?
*  People are coming to here and it's an AA meeting, right?
*  And he's shaking.
*  And at the end they go, does anybody want to get a 24 hour chip or a desire to change?
*  And the guy said, I drank this morning, but I do have a desire.
*  And he was already shaking. We hadn't drinking five, six hours.
*  And the guy goes, old hair walks over most gangster shit I ever seen.
*  Puts his arm around him and says, it's all right, baby.
*  None of us came in here on Wednesday.
*  Dude, I was like, I had no intention of going to this meeting.
*  The only reason I even went, believe it or not, wasn't because I was having a craving even.
*  I had an hour to kill on the way to a writing session.
*  And I was like, well, fuck it.
*  I could either spend this hour scrolling on fucking TikTok and thinking about how fucking Ukraine is going to kill us or you know what I mean?
*  And I went into the meeting and I left and I walked in the writer's room and they was like, you know, it's fun when we write together because everybody's got an idea.
*  I said, boys, I don't know if this is the idea, but I want to tell you what just happened to me.
*  I just seen one of the most beautiful acts of humanity I've ever seen.
*  Just the most because this guy's shaking. He's crying.
*  And this dude's walk. I'm getting emotional because I'm watching it.
*  The whole room's getting emotional. This dude just super cool.
*  Just kind of walks over to look like almost like I've seen this before.
*  He was he was the only one that all of us were sad.
*  This dude was happy. He walked over to smile like he'd seen it.
*  He was like, Oh, don't worry, baby. Nobody comes in here on a winning streak.
*  And so I did some I went back to the meeting a week later.
*  We started the song. The guy ended up being like 25, 30 years clean.
*  They came in to help the other guy. Wow. So we wrote the song.
*  It's called Winning Streak. It's fucking I'm sung on Saturday Night Live.
*  Wow. It was cool. It's not even out. It'll be on my album today.
*  But imagine if you didn't walk into that place. Imagine if you didn't walk into that place.
*  Yeah. Just old church basement.
*  How much time have you lost on your phone where you could have been walking into a place talking to people and getting winning streak?
*  Yeah. You know what I mean? It's like just, you know, especially as an artist,
*  it deals in, you know, to say it again, stories and just, you know,
*  you find things out about people when you see them interact with each other.
*  And sometimes it just lights, lights a spark. Yeah. It's just, man, you.
*  Yeah. Anytime I see anything that makes me feel something, I feel the need to try to write it.
*  Whether it makes me happy or sad or you know what I mean?
*  If you really think about like old school rock and roll, I think like classic rock, there's great songs.
*  But then there's these story songs, you know, like Shooting Star, that Bad Company song.
*  You know, Johnny was a schoolboy when he heard his first Beatles song.
*  That's one of those songs that like everybody listens to the words, you know, you just get caught up in the story.
*  There's a difference between that and, you know, just fun songs.
*  Just fun songs back in black, you know, fun.
*  It's not like a story that like an emotional story that gets you.
*  There's some of those songs, you know, American Pie, American Pie. Oh my God. Oh my God.
*  I listen to it once a week in the cold plunge because the original version is like seven minutes.
*  Yeah. So if I start it while I'm getting into my skibbies, songs over, I get out of the cold plunge. Yeah.
*  But it's that song.
*  That song.
*  Talk about dude. How about James Taylor? I've seen fire and I've seen rain.
*  The greatest song ever written, Joe.
*  The greatest song ever written. Don't listen to that song when you're sad.
*  I'll cry if I'm happy, but that song will get you. Every time. That song will get you.
*  And that's a story too. And that motherfucker had a voice. Man, he had a voice.
*  What a special voice. And it was so effortless, Joe. Yeah.
*  When he opened his mouth, it was almost like he was just talking to you like me and you, but he would sing like an angel.
*  And you know, he was self-taught guitarist, so he plays like shapes and chords that don't really technically exist.
*  Really? Yeah. He literally, because he self-taught himself, they'd be like, well, that's kind of a, it looks like a G, but you're doing this and not that.
*  It's like, it was crazy. He's authentic.
*  My father, who I named Buddies after in my bar, was, we were driving down to Gulf Shores, Alabama one time.
*  And I was a kid and we started listening to Fire and Rain.
*  And he starts, my family would tell these stories about music. I don't know what it was, but before they would play a song, it was like, they would take, and I'm like this to this day,
*  I would take great pride in being like, oh, I'm fixing to show you something. So I'd give you the setup, you know?
*  So my dad goes, I'm not going to set this song up. I'm going to tell you about it afterwards. We're going to listen to it again.
*  There he goes. Give me it from the beginning, Jamie. This motherfucker.
*  So, look at him, all his long hair. That was before he went bald. When he went bald, he said, fuck it.
*  Yeah, that was, hey, Mr. Jukebox, James.
*  Oh, bro, that guy could not have a fly swatter big enough to swat those panties that were flying at him.
*  What? He could not. Just whack. At every corner, dude.
*  Oh my God. And listen. Voice like an angel. All sensitive.
*  In hot take, he was married to a woman that is arguably a better songwriter than him.
*  Carly Simon. Carly Simon was so beautiful. God, when she was young, she was like one of the most beautiful women that's ever lived.
*  I love that none of that mattered to him though. Watch this.
*  So my dad tells me this story, Joe, and we are riding down I-65. I've only seen my father cry three times.
*  Give me some words, Jamie.
*  And we are crying. We are going down I-65 and we are squalling. I mean like two children, Joe.
*  Just authentic. You know what I mean? There's no bullshit in this song.
*  The third verse when he goes, yeah, you got to let this rip then. It's a core memory I'll have forever though.
*  When I watch this. To me, this is some of the best, the whole song, but right here.
*  So simple but real.
*  Now watch him take it up right here.
*  Damn.
*  So good.
*  It's crazy. What a team, him and Carly Simon. Think about that.
*  What was?
*  Bro, You're So Vain.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  Pull that shit up. Give me a yourself. And seeing her sing it with that bass. Oh my God.
*  God.
*  Oh my God.
*  He toured with Carole King forever, right? Do they ever have a relationship?
*  Hopefully.
*  Right? You're talking about another great songwriter. God, dude.
*  Here we go.
*  While she's playing the piano, son.
*  With her hair blowing. So 80s.
*  In the wind.
*  Yes.
*  This pre-chorus is crazy.
*  But hold on, hold on. Because if the song was about him, he's right. Yeah, right. For sure.
*  You know, Warren Beatty. I was listening to that song going, I think this song is about me.
*  Yeah. I knew I was him.
*  And that's live back when they were like, you know, that was live, live.
*  That might be one of the first diss songs.
*  Right?
*  Right. I think that's the first diss track.
*  Hold on, hold on. When was the song put out?
*  Is it officially about Warren Beatty? I thought it rumors that it was about James Taylor too.
*  Oh, really?
*  I thought it's unconfirmed who it's written about.
*  James Taylor?
*  How dare they talk about the king that way?
*  You know what, man? It wouldn't shock you, right? If you found out that the guy was like the sweetheart, super nice guy was actually a fucking psycho.
*  Dude, I've had, talking about James Taylor, I've had fans come up to me and they would be crying.
*  And they go, I'm so sorry, I'm crying. And every time I tell them the same thing, I say, don't worry. If I ever meet James Taylor, I'm going to cry.
*  For sure. I know it. So I'd be like 100%. I'm going to cry.
*  Ever since the singer released her accusatory track in 1972, the identity of you has remained one of the greatest mysteries in music history.
*  But she did date Warren Beatty, right?
*  What year? It came out in 72?
*  Well, here's the thing. When did Sweet Home Alabama come out?
*  Look at all the possibilities.
*  Warren Beatty, Michael Crichton, Jack Nicholson, Cat Stevens, James Taylor, or John Travolta, even rumored flings with Sean Connery.
*  Marvin Gaye.
*  Marvin Gaye? Mick Jagger? The possibility of Mick Jagger.
*  I bet Marvin Gaye did something different with that.
*  That lady got around, she got around with all the talented motherfuckers. She got around.
*  I bet Marvin Gaye was a monster.
*  When did Sweet Home Alabama come out? So you know Sweet Home Alabama was a clapback track.
*  Yeah.
*  It was in the diss world too. So I think it was right around that early 70s era too.
*  74?
*  So it was after that. Your Sylvain came out before it.
*  Yeah. I think that was the first.
*  But when did Southern Man come out?
*  It was probably the same time, right? It was just a year before.
*  So that was 1970?
*  Yeah. Oh, no. So it was a few years before.
*  So they wrote it about Southern Man? Is that what they wrote it about?
*  Yeah. The idea was, and Neil Young was speaking a lot about what was happening down there in the South at the time.
*  Ronnie's position was just simply like, hey man, we stay the fuck out of your business, stay out of ours.
*  You know, a Southern Man don't need them around anyhow.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, it's kind of how he came back up.
*  What a banger of a song.
*  What a banger? What a diss.
*  You're talking about...
*  That is a sweet home Alabama banger. Give me some of that.
*  Yeah, please.
*  God damn, that's a good song.
*  I mean, all respect to Neil Young. That's better than anything he's ever done in his life.
*  No, no. Neil Young apologized later. It was really cool. He owned it. He publicly said Ronnie was right.
*  Well, you know, Neil Young is name checked and dissed. Yeah, I don't think they thought about it that way back then.
*  It reached number eight, the Billboard Hot 100. Give me some Sweet Home Alabama.
*  That's a song that you hear in the bar in the first couple of chords play and you go, oh yeah.
*  You just immediately stand up. You're like, oh, we're from the party.
*  Oh baby.
*  And I hate to be this guy, but I immediately look around and I'm like, everybody in here who doesn't know this song, I don't know that we can be friends.
*  You can't at least sing the chorus or if you don't go down.
*  This might be one of the most recognizable songs ever.
*  What? It's gonna be a live video to use like the live one, especially this one.
*  Once again, look at these bad motherfuckers.
*  Oh, they were so funny. You want to talk about people that couldn't get the pussy away from them.
*  And they're from Florida.
*  Yeah.
*  What 77? So that's Ronnie.
*  Or no, that's Johnny.
*  Once again, how great Gary Rossington was.
*  To me, he's the greatest guitarist that ever lived.
*  Up there with Hendrix and him. He's on Mount Russmore guitars because I can't name another guitarist, Clapton, of course, that has more riffs that you want to go, you want to hum.
*  Right.
*  Right? Because like,
*  Don't do it.
*  You know, the free bird solo.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Dude, think about it.
*  Yeah.
*  Give me three steps.
*  Yeah.
*  You're like, you can. There has not been that since, if you ask me.
*  You know what I mean? Like, him, Clapton, Hendrix, like they had those kind of guitars.
*  But this was different because it was riffs.
*  Right. It wasn't like a solo. They were singing over these riffs.
*  Right. And the riffs were bigger than the melody sometimes.
*  They captured you.
*  If you tell somebody right now, like, have you ever heard the song Sweet Home Alabama? And they go, how's it go? You wouldn't go sweet. You'd go, dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
*  Yeah.
*  It's crazy. That's how good Gary was, man.
*  That solo in Free Bird is insane.
*  Oh, it's the best solo ever.
*  Ever. It's hard to say because of Hendrix and Steve Ray Vaughn, a bunch of other people, Eddie Van Halen.
*  But that solo was the same every time they did it.
*  Oh, the story about Sweet Home Alabama.
*  They're sitting at a sound check and it's just Ronnie and Gary.
*  And Gary's holding electric. And he goes, man, I got this. I just don't know what to do with it.
*  It's dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
*  And Ronnie goes, well, hell, just keep playing it. Let me fuck with it.
*  Fuck with it. So they just looped that and that's how they wrote the song just them. Yeah, dude. I'm so I'm such a I have like
*  Skinner to me is like Jesus
*  I'm a giant Skinner fan and you know what I love about Skinner to they came out of Florida
*  Who would have saw that?
*  That straight out of Jacksonville what Jacksonville's not amazing bands, dude
*  How's this band come out of Jacksonville and every song is about running away from girls. I gotta go ladies
*  Yeah, I gotta be free
*  Steps I love you, but I gotta go. It's crazy
*  Dude they were the best man when Gary when Gary's family gave me that guitar after he passed away
*  It still is up there with like my top
*  Probably ten possessions that I've ever been gifted
*  you know what I mean of I
*  have it in my studio now and I hung it in a case with the note that his family wrote me with the picture that
*  We took the night he played the guitar and I put a lock on the case instead of just casing it forever
*  I put a lock on it so I can still play it
*  So when we do the album, there's a couple of tracks that we played a Gary Rossington guitar
*  Oh, wow, you know what I mean? Because it was a Gary Rossington played guitar
*  Wow, and his family gave the estate gave it to me right after he passed. Does it sound different?
*  It's got well, it's it's um, it's an old Les Paul and it's older. So it's got a different pickup on it
*  So it's got some different tunes and textures to it. What's the difference in like the older pickups and the newer ones?
*  I don't know. I'm not as educated in it as most like real guitarist
*  I'm a campfire guitarist, but it's you know over the years they always found different ways to make them
*  So they were as they were improving them, but the sounds and textures were getting different
*  So but I forgot exactly what he does because he takes a pickup from another guitar and puts it in to I think in a most
*  Of his guitar because there's a lot of real guitarists that'll like they'll want to play this guitar
*  But they'll want to put this from this guitar on this guitar is that their shit
*  Yeah, cuz they like the way well
*  I like to pick up on this or I like this and this or I like the way this you know
*  Whatever makes sense and then they'll have a kind of hodgepodge like that
*  But uh, you know something else when Gary survived that plane crash. Let's think about him playing guitar
*  He had a rod that went from right here Joe to his elbow
*  Oh my god and still played the guitar that way. So if you ever watched Gary play the guitar
*  He always kind of played it high like Charlie Crockett
*  But it was or down here like this because he couldn't he couldn't full-blown get full extension on the wrist
*  Yeah, so he was playing all those
*  From 70 whatever the 70 what when was the plane crash?
*  Jamie, you know, I figured you might know off the top. How many people died in the crash? I
*  Know Ronnie did for sure. I think it was two or three wasn't Ronnie standing up
*  So that video you just so might have been one of Ronnie's last performance he was standing up when the plane crashed right?
*  He went and sat down. He was drinking. Yeah, they were just partying. They were just Leonard Skinner dude
*  Put a seat belt on you might be still be here. It's crazy day. It is it is crazy, man
*  Damn was it when you said it was 77 three days after their fifth album was released. Yeah Street Survivors
*  Wow, just totally different man. I've I've gotten so far into there
*  We've been covering Skinner on the road for years and years. Anyways, just that's probably not a Skinner song
*  I can't play
*  You know, right if we were to go to a bar tonight
*  You probably just randomly pick a Skinner song and I'd go up there and be able to just kill
*  They were gone too quick, you know, and I know they toured after he died and
*  The same yeah, you know the reason they still touring one thing. I don't as a die-hard fan
*  I don't object to it a lot now that Gary's gone
*  It's a little rougher because he was the last living one
*  But Johnny van Zandt which and who how are him and Ronnie K and I always confuse it their cousins, right?
*  Are they brothers because remember the three van Zantz don't want to talk about a family Joe
*  Johnny Ronnie van Zantt created Leonard Skinner. It was the first lead singer
*  Johnny van Zantt took his plot when he died and the other van Zantt brothers the lead singer 38 special crazy
*  Yeah, it's the younger brother. So his younger brother took right over and
*  Like I tell people is there's the average Leonard Skinner fan
*  That's not like me and you like obsessed with him to a degree
*  They don't know anybody other than him to be their singer because he's been their singer
*  44 years longer than Ronnie was that band was only been out for four years when Ronnie died
*  Right, you know what? I mean, it's like an AC DC type thing exactly
*  You know what I mean? So it's like and the fact that it's a true van Zant and Johnny's still the lead man to this day
*  So when I go see him, I still feel like I'm watching Ronnie a little bit
*  It looks just like I'm still got the same long hair. He's Johnny van Zantt day
*  Why he was a fucking psycho though, no, he was that's the difference Johnny's like a really really calm cool man a guy he's also
*  Older now, you know, these dudes are all Ricky medlock and now he was with the original group too pretty much
*  He's still there them dudes are all in their 70s
*  Yeah, and then that's too cuz when we were kids, we never thought the rock stars be touring in their 70s
*  They're gonna come out from my Jacksonville show. They came in some really last time. Yeah, that's me
*  Johnny and Ricky always come out and sing man. They're fun. That's awesome. Yeah, dude still it never gets any dude
*  Look at you. You're living the life. It's fucking weird. You're living the life
*  It's the shit we grew up listening to say it's like I don't know man
*  It's weird when you meet people that you that were real famous when you're a kid that to me is always gonna be the weirdest
*  One it's the one Steven Tyler that meeting that dude meeting people like that. It's just like
*  You just feel weirded out. I met Tarantino's
*  This is weird. Yeah, this is weird, especially people you watched back in your childhood. Yeah
*  Out of all the comedians I met the only one I've probably ever been made an ass of myself to is Ron White
*  Because I literally have watched him since I was a teenager because he was such a voice for
*  I
*  Don't want this to come off disrespectful, but being from the south of my household
*  We thought Jeff Foxworthy was incredibly funny
*  We liked his books more than his comedy though because we felt like his comedy almost felt a little forced to us as southern people
*  It just didn't sit right. It's you know in my household in what way?
*  In this way of like there's you might be a redneck. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah, you know what I mean if your family tree does not fork
*  It was hilarious about we know all the books we religiously
*  But when we're watching the blue collar special as a family and I know this wasn't the way to watch it in hindsight
*  We're all waiting on you know what I mean cuz like he's the voice of our household
*  But I'm also in a household full of drunks by the way my father's a raging alcoholic
*  My mother does drugs all my brothers do drugs, but it was like you know we loved we'd love Jeff
*  We love we love bill Larry the cable guy, but man when we just Ron was argued. You know he just spoke to
*  What our household was doing you know what I mean so when I met him it was kind of like man
*  I gotta tell my fucking mama. Well when he first started hanging out the store about like I guess it was about ten years ago
*  He never had like a club like that before where it was like a home base
*  You know he was always a successful touring comedian, so he'd bring guys to open up for him on the road
*  But it was basically the Ron White show
*  Then he started hanging out with us at the store. He was like man. This is what I've been missing
*  You know been missing like a real camaraderie like the base the the home base where everybody goes and just hangs out
*  Makes all the difference in the world it is if no well iron sharpens iron, too. Yeah
*  When you're in Nashville, too
*  I mean think about how many different amazing artists there are that you go see live in Nashville
*  Just fucking around on a regular night for sure yeah, Dirk Bentley goes and plays this like
*  With his bluegrass band like a 200 person bar every week. That's amazing
*  You know like his little subversion of a bluegrass band. It's uh
*  Talking about that's how I feel about our songwriting community, too
*  I've wrote in LA, and I've had big songs come out of LA
*  But Nashville is just managed to killers
*  You know what I mean is the dudes that are just the the dudes and girls down there
*  They're in those rooms every day are snipers
*  They've been doing it forever that's the same thing like you do in all those shows
*  It's the same thing like them right you just get real good at your fucking for sure and you get to know how to pivot
*  You know what I mean like that's something else that comes with being on that stage of much is like the more you do it the more
*  Circumstances you've been up against nothing starts to scare you no more right like even if I walk out to a crowd
*  Like if I'm opening for somebody still and I walk out, and I'm like I'm gonna have to I'm not really work for this
*  When I'm not panicked I've done it enough now. I'll even watch some guys in my band get a little panic
*  We'll be on the second song and you'll see them going like are they're not just so excited. We're here. I'm like just relax
*  It's okay. We're gonna get there. You know what I'm saying. Let's just have fun. The hardest spot is opening on a comedy show
*  It's brutal. I tell every comedian opens for me. This is like running what waits on yeah
*  You know talk about like the one of three not the feature slot the numbers guy first guy on stage
*  That's the hardest gig and it's the gig for the guys that are the youngest. Yeah, they're the learners. They're learning it
*  They don't really know how to do it yet
*  You know and you're kind of responsible for getting the first laugh of the night you are 100% responsible
*  That's a man you got to break the room
*  Yeah, that's why Hans Kim was like our best opener because Hans Kim has structure all jokes have structure
*  So he puts you in this
*  Mode of laughing at ridiculous shit, and he puts you in this like it's like a very structured set
*  So it gets people into like the hypnosis of comedy right you get locked into laughing and then boom next comedian goes up
*  And the bars already set. Yeah, you're already loose and everybody's running but that first spot man
*  You got to like it's the same with us that you if you're one of three
*  Alexander Kaye's doing on this tour and she's killing it
*  But it is a rough one because you've won
*  You've got your fans that knew you were one of three and they showed up early
*  So that's what that's the only thing you have to advantage
*  The rest of it is people literally walking in with popcorn and beer in their hand
*  Wondering why the show's already started
*  You know I've had I tell people all the time you're not gonna be a good performer until you performed in a place where people
*  Looked at you like you were interrupting them right you know what I mean you ever been to place where you're like hey
*  I'm sorry. I'm bothering y'all about playing loud music up here. You fucking knew you were coming to a bar bitch
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  But those are the funnest two though
*  I got to open up for Morgan Wallen this year a few times and it was really fun because in the last few years
*  We've just been headlining
*  We haven't got to really you know go out and do something that was so much
*  Dramatically bigger than us that it made sense for us to do it, and I love Morgan
*  So I was like I'm in and uh and we went out there, and it was cool because you feel it immediately
*  You're like even with the hits
*  I have you know there's 70,000 people here that bought a ticket to see Morgan Wallen for they knew my name was on the bill
*  Right you know so there's a lot of people here that are with me
*  But I'm still having to tell you I'm still up here like oh, okay tonight
*  You know I say there's three scenarios in my business, and I don't know this is probably different for y'alls, but in mine
*  My three scenarios are this one is the you're welcome. We're here right which is the simple like thank y'all
*  We thank each other you came to see me. I'm gonna give you a great show. Thank you. It's the easy one right?
*  The the other one is the thank you for listening
*  I appreciate that you gave me enough respect that you sat here and listened to me
*  And the third one is the one that makes me in it's the hey motherfucker. I'm singing
*  Yeah, and you have to go through a couple hundred of those before you get good
*  You know what I mean like I don't care, and that's what's been so about like the tick-tock explosion
*  Is you have these kids that will have this big hit Joe and they'll have five or six hits in a row and they can start
*  Selling 2,000 seats at a theater overnight
*  It's kind of like the podcasters that have a quick quick flip and they go to the comedy clubs on a Friday
*  Yeah, but can't make nobody laugh or stay
*  These kids go straight into 2,000 seat rooms and then stand up there like I've never done a fucking show
*  I've never stood in front of anybody. Oh my imagine getting a big tick-tock hit Joe never doing a show in your life
*  It's showing up. You know what I mean or imagine. It's even worse. They put you on an opening tour for somebody
*  They're like we got an amphitheater act that'll let you be two of four this will be great
*  You're going out there looking at 6,000 people. Oh my god. You've never stood up in a bar
*  I'm watching it happen to people all the time
*  I'm having to grab these kids and kind of mentor them now
*  And it's the flip side of it where like booking agents are dragging them to the slaughter, of course
*  Cuz you know what to make money. They don't give a fuck and and here's the problem. Imagine your kid
*  You're 20 years old 22 years old. You've got a big successful record and you're going to meet booking agents. You're excited
*  I've been there, you know, and the first one's like we're gonna push you right in 2,000 seat rooms
*  You're gonna get $22,000 a night. You're like, whoa
*  What a night and we're gonna do it three nights every weekend. Oh my god. I'm rich. I'm buying a Corvette
*  Immediately and then you go to the next book and they're like now hear me out my plan is
*  For you to go play these 200 cap rooms like the high fine, Indianapolis the end in Nashville
*  We're gonna go do that for six months. We're gonna get like 40 shows under your belt
*  you'll get like
*  1300 bucks a night 1200 bucks a night and they're like fuck you the other guy just said I'm getting
*  $25,000 a night immediately. Yeah, but this guy actually knows what he's doing
*  You know what I mean this guy actually is doing it right but he always go they go back to the money
*  Yeah, and then they end up having a circle back and they got to refigure it out anyways
*  You can't tell people all the time you might be able to skip the line a little bit, but you can't cheat the game
*  You know what? I mean, you had to put them hours in one way or the other but the same thing with fighters
*  Mmm, you know, I see fighters that come out and they compete in the UFC and like their first fight
*  They look fantastic and they're fast-tracked and sometimes guys get broken because they they meet top flight competition before they're really
*  They're really like an up-and-coming fighter honing their skills and they run into a wily veteran
*  Who's like a top 15 guy and they get fucked up and they're kind of never the same
*  Yeah
*  Because they really shouldn't been fighting that guy whereas boxing is a lot more clever
*  If they have a guy who's like a Terrence Crawford or someone's a really good fighter
*  They'll match him up correctly until they can make the big money and until their skills are at a very very high level
*  And then they start challenging for a world title
*  But they prepare them they get them they put them that the thing about the UFC is sometimes you just get thrown right to
*  The wolves and if you're John Jones, that's fine. Yeah, you know John Jones wins the title at 22
*  Yeah, you know, but most guys are not John Jones. Most guys could be like an elite fighter, but the circumstances just
*  Derailed them before they ever get there it burned them too early, man. Yeah, they burn them too early
*  You know and it's like what the perfect example of this in the USC to me is one guy could be sugar Sean
*  Who went on to be that guy right immediately?
*  I know he just had his loss, but I mean he still looks like sugar to me
*  You know that kids tough and the other one could be that kid that we all love but well
*  I always confuse it was a Hooper or Hopper
*  The 19 year old kid he had a sugar Sean kind of thing going
*  I was a he was a contender series guy to a super to per that was yeah
*  Yeah, and to me that's kind of the tale of the same kid
*  You know what I mean where it's like for sugar it kind of work, but he's I tell this what I tell my
*  Chase still has a shot. He's still super talented. He just had a really get better at striking. Yeah, he's just young and has to
*  He got a lot better. He got a lot better at everything. He's really good on the ground. Yeah, no the kid the kids great
*  He also went up to 55 which I think was big because he was he was killing himself. Yeah good
*  Yeah, no, you could tell it was a big way cuz especially for such a kid his frames. Oh, they're kids. Mm-hmm
*  I think we still haven't seen what Sean's real man body is gonna look like yet completely
*  He's just not turning is he 30 now? Okay, so we see him
*  But what they say it's 25 or 26 now before you actually see a full development
*  Well, you definitely see some of these guys that are coming in that are 22 that are still growing
*  They're still getting bigger like Roe Roseau's jr. He's 19 years old and that kids still growing every time
*  He looks more muscular more jacked, you know, he's still in his prime. I mean not even close to his prime
*  He's just still growing up. Yeah, there's still um, that's a
*  Yeah, that's a that's a there's a growing thing. That's
*  Yeah, I guess it's different too man
*  I'm thinking about that kid like Chase is that getting put into that national spotlight at the biggest fighting organization in the world at 19
*  You know what I mean? Yeah, and you're like
*  Tavandre sweat is the defensive end for the Tennessee Titans. I'm a huge Titans fan. He was our first round
*  first round pick this year defensive end I
*  Went to go hang out with him because I just think he's great. I think he's gonna be a superstar
*  He's 22 years old. He's probably six five three hundred something pounds and
*  He can't grow a full beer jet
*  You know what I mean? You know what I'm saying? Like he it's still it's patchy, you know
*  I just when you're in your early 20s
*  It's still patchy and I'm looking like and I'm looking at Jeffrey Simmons who's our veteran defensive end who's six six
*  Just cut like a and I was like oh
*  That's where you're gonna be at
*  In four years three years, you know what I mean? Because we picked up Jeffrey Simmons as a rookie too
*  It's like even at 22 years old. They haven't fully
*  Developed in yet, right? No that dude. I'm looking at the boundary sweat right now and I'm like
*  You still got a baby face like you still got a you know what I mean? Look at big baby
*  Look at baby face sweat. You know what I mean? Look, but you see this face of him right here
*  That's all you need to know about his personality at big face. That's who he is as a human
*  He's the sweetest dude ever but you can still tell by the look of his face
*  You know what I mean? That face is gonna slim down and get a little more
*  You know, that's the craziest job. Yeah being a pro football players the craziest job
*  It's cuz you're you're literally in a car wreck every day, especially guys for their position. They're in a car wreck every play
*  Yeah, I think about this offensive lineman defensive lineman
*  Guaranteed full contact every snap hundred percent
*  Every time we snap the ball cuz like the ride receivers, they're gonna hand fight
*  Backfield they're gonna there's gonna be some action but not full contact every play
*  Every single play as soon as they say that these two linemen are fucking collision course and
*  And they're both hitting each other with the intention to try to knock the other one down first, right?
*  The goal is like if I could hit you and knock you down and go right past you after that
*  I just gotta fight my way and they're all 300 plus pounds of solid muscle huge full-blown athletes their whole life been playing since
*  They were eight
*  And
*  That's the American sport
*  It's a totally at full I mean in full speed any kind of crazy that that is the American sport
*  I mean, what other countries even played other than Canada who else plays football?
*  American style football. They don't even play it overseas
*  They don't even touch it. No, that was when they could when Nate Bargassi hosted Saturday Night Live not this time
*  but last year he did that skit that skit joke about it coming from
*  The UK and he was like and we will have a sport named football and they were like
*  Oh, well, you'll kick a ball. They'll go no and they'll go so you never kick the ball. They go sometimes
*  It's so funny about
*  Trying to explain football to somebody not from here. It's bizarre that we didn't call it a different thing
*  Mm-hmm, they were calling it football and it was soccer and we just said no, we're gonna change the name of that
*  We're gonna call it soccer. Yeah, and this is football now. What are you talking about? It's the American way, dude
*  Yeah, it's like hey, we don't care how y'all do temperature everywhere else
*  Fuck you. We go with degrees
*  Fahrenheit bitch. Yeah, fuck you were to create one fuck your metric system
*  Metric system is so much more efficient like nah, no
*  You'll love that Nate's get there cuz that's what he does. He just kind of goes through trash and all these ideas
*  The best part is Keenan looks at him at the new skin and goes what about my people?
*  Will the slaves be freed after the war? He said they will be freed after a war
*  But not this one
*  Second that was a good skip man. It's really funny. He's a funny dude another Nashville guy. Love him man big big
*  Have you ever seen Theo thinking in Nashville speaking in Nashville guys? You've seen Theo do his impression to you? Oh, yeah
*  It's the fucking bad. It's my favorite thing ever
*  Every acceptance be see you fight it. I want to thank the concrete
*  He did it with him and Joey
*  I
*  Just simulation Joe, yeah, I think it might be I could I just couldn't believe that I'd be in a place where
*  The over on would one be my buddy. He came to my LA show. It just made me so happy
*  I've almost cry when I see them. I'm so excited but then to have him, you know, just fuck dude. I was um, I
*  Said this a lot. There's a dream for an artist
*  There's nothing more pop culture than being brought up in a comedy special
*  Like if you was an artist back in the old days and you got brought up on an HBO special
*  You were on fucking fire. You could not be bigger. You know what I'm saying?
*  So it's like I have those that's to me is like those unreal moments when you watch a guy like Theo with his platform
*  Impersonating me to do a tee and we're friends too. And it's just like I would have never even I never thought I'd win an award to give
*  A speech or more or less that the speech would be so viral that a comedian would have a impression of it
*  You know what I mean? Yeah, it's like it's the I don't know. It's the greatest
*  That's the greatest compliment you can be paid in pop culture is if a comedian will burn on you a little bit
*  That's hilarious. That one was perfect
*  I'm still like that's mine like the first time I get dropped in a special. I'm gonna lose my shit
*  It's gonna remind me of little me
*  Watching HBO specials, you know, someone's listeners right now some comics probably gonna write a bit put you in there
*  Don't be mean not just be funny just for fun. Yeah
*  Maybe it's Theo. Yeah, maybe the field do that in a special Theo Theo such as I'm
*  Be I'm trying to steal him from natural
*  Deal. Well listen for what it's worth. I don't I think the wife and I are on the way to really
*  You know, my wife my wife was born in Houston. Oh, okay. She's always had Texas in her heart
*  I went out on the river up here and this just
*  Just love the city I love the space I
*  Before I got here last night
*  Just the few people that knew I was coming out already got text from my friends down here from Carrie to Bruce the people that
*  do you know just
*  Just I was even my wife was like you love it there. I was like she loves Texas anyway, so she's all in we're talking about
*  It's real beautiful. Yeah, well always be back and forth because Nashville's always Nashville to me. Are you friends of Gary Clark?
*  Yes, I love Gary Clark
*  Clark's a wizard
*  He's a wizard something else. I was talking to his man his manager's name scooter your met scooter
*  Yeah scooters the best and I was like I think if I came down there
*  We would get you know, if I brought the culture the way I approach songwriting in Nashville here
*  I think we could have a little paradigm shift down here to why not you know what I mean?
*  A musical mothership
*  Let's go. I've told you this before drunk and I'm in it then I mean it now
*  I'm going to come to you one day and you're not gonna surprise you
*  I hope and I'm gonna with a concept about doing the mother
*  You just give me the right to call it the the music mothership in Nashville. I give you the right right now
*  All right, cool. I got a plan man because what y'all do for comedy we have singer
*  Have you ever been to a writers round? No Joe when you come to Nashville, please, please come a little early
*  Let me take you to a writer's room. Okay, you will have a ball
*  So what happens is the songwriters who are writing all these big hit records in town?
*  Come and they go to these bars and they do writers rounds
*  they'll set up three or four bar stools and
*  Every songwriter have a guitar and they'll sing a song they wrote and tell you the story about the song
*  and it's the coolest it's the coolest thing ever because
*  It's a dude don't not being funny
*  But a dude that looks like me if I wasn't you me or a dude that looks like young Jamie and then he sings live
*  Like I'm dying by Tim McGraw
*  And he tells the most heartfelt story about where he was at in his life when he wrote the song and how he came up
*  With the concept for it. Oh wow, and it's this beautiful thing and there's only one place in town
*  that's really famous for it's called the Bluebird Cafe they happen everywhere and
*  The first time I left the mothership I was like I'm doing this for music
*  I'm gonna create this same culture for our songwriters because what happens is if you can create a place where people feel safe
*  They show up
*  Yeah
*  So what happens is cuz like I don't go to the Bluebird Cafe a lot because it's a pain in the ass to get in
*  So if one of my friends calls like hey, I'm at the Bluebird it's a legendary spot and I love it
*  Like we come sing something with me. It's like
*  You know what I mean?
*  There's no structure. It was you built your club for comedy
*  You knew that if the comedians were happy they would show the fuck up and then if you did everything you could to cater it to
*  The comedians first that they would come and bring their best and the best comedians would be there
*  Which means that people were gonna come see the best art, right?
*  Same concept I'm gonna try to do with music. It's my next move dude
*  Let me open my bar first, but I'm gonna circle back about this. That's a great idea
*  I just want your right to call it. I don't want no no do it. I just want to call it the music mothership
*  It's a great and I'm gonna and we'll talk about the logo because I want to kind of do a music
*  I want to be like a guitar version of the alien. You know what I'm saying? Do it do it up do it up
*  Imagine your little alien with a guitar, you know
*  It called the music mothership. Why not? Well the the idea behind it you could have definitely applied to music
*  Yeah, pretty an idea take the phone
*  So we can you know what else what happens to I thought about this if I take the phones like y'all do
*  Then it becomes a laboratory. Yeah, right cuz then it goes from like not only will I sing me the hit I just wrote
*  How about I got a song Morgan Wallen's gonna put out next month that nobody's heard
*  You see what I'm saying yeah, yeah, yeah, and it's a safe place Morgan shows up to sing it nobody's video and nobody's picture
*  People know it's a laboratory too
*  And that's another exciting thing about it like when you go to the mothership you go to that bottom of the barrel show
*  That's a full laboratory show my favorite show I've seen there
*  Nobody knows what the fuck it's gonna be about you just reach into a barrel and pulling out suggestions
*  Yeah, that a bunch of people that are
*  Mothership fans wrote on paper. Yeah, I've it gets wild immediately
*  There wasn't a warm-up question. It's automatically to the Brian Simpson is so good at it. Yeah, what's his show?
*  But the reason why it's so good is because it's like a premise factory
*  like you just get ignited by this thought that you didn't think of
*  Before that like in that moment someone says something about fire trucks
*  And then you like you know about fire trucks and then all of a sudden
*  There's a bit right like all of a sudden because of necessity because you're forced into the situation
*  We're trying to like it's literally like you're calling on the muse on the stage
*  And you know a lot of times it's nothing like seven out of ten times
*  You ain't got shit for that bit, but every now and then you catch fire and that becomes like a bit
*  Have you ever had one birth into a bit
*  I'll tell you which ones off stage. Okay, or off camera. I'm a bunch of them. Yeah a bunch of them
*  Cuz it's just like that that that little room too is like so
*  Like you can't bullshit anybody in that little room. I like it feels like we're all sitting Indian style together
*  Yeah, there's only a hundred people in there 110. I think is when it's fully packed
*  Dave was the first person who wants Dave there really? Yeah. Well actually Shane first Shane open for
*  Gillis open for Chappelle. We didn't even tell the audience who was going on stage
*  We just said it's a special intimate show show sold out like that
*  Nobody knew who it was and then Gillis goes on stage does 15 minutes
*  He brings up Dave and David like an hour and a half and he just fully writes on stage
*  Like he had just done a special he fully writes on stage like he has ideas and he just like lets him breathe
*  Just fucks around on stage gets a little tipsy
*  Just fucks around on stage
*  Can I tell us you can cut this if you don't want to be tell it but my favorite story
*  I tell about you is my time at the comedy club with you was one of the first times I did this pot
*  I think you had shows at night
*  I went to both of them and the first one was killer
*  But the second one you had gotten a little slippery and it was fun
*  It was it was it was like because I remember right before you walked out there
*  You even looked at me. That's the word you said I felt a little slippery. It's just a little loose
*  It's just a little loose you had your cup in your hand and I just seen a twinkle in you
*  I was like, oh I'm staying because I was gonna leave I'd already seen the show, you know, and you did two shows
*  I was like, oh, I gotta see this. I think this is gonna be a little different
*  It was the fun ones. Yeah, it was fun man
*  Cuz I got to watch the same set but you fuck around a little more and kind of get lost in it
*  Sometimes just having fun with it
*  Yeah, you know like you could tell you were like you did the first one
*  Like this is what I know I got and the second one you had a couple cocktails like I'm gonna riff on this point
*  Just off sometimes you do that you have the best part of the joke and that's when you'll find probably the shit that closes it
*  Out. Mm-hmm. I was sometimes like taglines just come to you in the moment and you're like, wow
*  I never even thought of that one before you get straight off stage and write them down. No, I record all my sets
*  Oh, wow. So then after I'm done, I'll listen to the recording then I write
*  Yeah, I sit down from the laptop and just actually sit down and put them out
*  Does it help you to see your ideas like that?
*  It helps me to expand on them because it takes longer to type of thought than does to think it
*  Right. So like I'm thinking a coffee cup
*  I'm thinking of it instantly
*  But it takes a couple of seconds for me to write it and that gives me chances to like explore left rights down
*  Up all these different ways you can go with an idea
*  So and then I'll usually like try to write it out like an essay form
*  So if I have an idea and it's funny and it does really well in like bottom of the barrel or a riff out of
*  Then I take that idea and I just write out like a essay just I'm not even trying to be funny
*  I just try to think about all the different angles of this
*  Idea, and then I'll extract like little pieces of it and try these little pieces on stage
*  Wow, and then you go and test them and chew the meat at the fact
*  Sometimes in the middle of it like this sounds wrong. This sounds disingenuous. I'll take a totally different approach
*  Sometimes I contradict myself like in the middle of it
*  Why would I think that I know the answer to that and then that becomes the bit right then it turns into yeah
*  Yeah, you never know man in the whole thing is just numbers
*  You just got to put a lot of numbers in a lot of numbers in front of the computer numbers on stage
*  It's just it's like this constant process of like building a mountain one layer of paint at a time
*  Just constant time under pressure. Yeah, my daughter. She wants to write she writes songs
*  She's already so much better than I was at 16
*  But um, she would come to me a couple years ago and she'd be like, hey, I want to put some of this stuff out
*  I've been writing all this stuff and I was torn because I was like well, you should have the right to put out whatever you want
*  That's the freedom that exists
*  But I know something you don't know that you just wrote your first 30 songs and they're incredible
*  for your first 30 songs, you know, I mean like yeah
*  You go go write a hundred and let's see if we can find five that are worth rewriting
*  Rework and refiguring out, you know what I mean?
*  And and I was cool. It taught me a lot about her personality because she was like I get it
*  She got it immediately. I wouldn't got it at 15. You know what I mean? She got it. She was like cool
*  No problem. She probably sees what you do, you know
*  And that's the beautiful thing about having an example whether it's your peers or for her your dad
*  You get to see an example of how someone does a process
*  Because if you don't around anybody that's trying to get good at something you don't really know how to do it, right?
*  That's one of the cool things about a conversation like this because there's people out there that are listening that don't have anybody around them
*  That's doing cool shit, right?
*  and they think it's impossible and they hear about this dude that was in jail for half his fucking life and you know, this other dude was a
*  cage fighting committee Kate a cage fighting commentator and stand-up comedian like these fucking guys are not they're not normal either
*  Right, like maybe I'm not normal. Maybe like this
*  Maybe there is something out there for me
*  But I don't hear it from anybody in my neighborhood. I don't hear from my parents. I don't hear from my teachers
*  I don't hear from my boss, right and I'm fucking lost, you know
*  and then they hear people talk about like
*  The love of writing songs that you have the the passion you have for creating a thing
*  How you piece it how you jump up and write down the premise you write down an idea for a lyric and then in their head
*  They're like I can do that with something. I can do that with something. I just have to find a thing
*  I said just find a thing man. Just just there was
*  My daddy I sat down with him at a bar called the tin roof on the memory street one night Joe
*  And I looked my dad and I and I said I'm done. I
*  Said I've done everything I can I remember I was probably 29 years old probably a decade ago
*  and I said
*  Dad, I've been out of jail five years or four years. Whatever. I've done everything I can in this business
*  You know how hard I've worked. Do you think our brother Roger will give me a job on a meat truck?
*  Because my father sold me so to my brother
*  He said I know your brother will give you a job on the meat truck, but I want to give you some perspective
*  I said I'm open for a healthy dose of that
*  He said you've only been out here trying this as hard as you possibly can for five years
*  Just five four years four and a five years. I said dad, that's five years
*  He said if you went to Vanderbilt you still wouldn't have your bachelor's degree
*  Joe it's true
*  Right. It's so true. Yeah, it covered me and he said
*  Jason if you're working as hard as you really is
*  I know you are if you're really writing every day if you're doing shows every week and I was opening up 50 bucks a night
*  I mean, yeah
*  You know, yeah
*  My story is that old school get in the van and go do a thousand shows for fucking gas money
*  You know what I mean? He was like if you're really doing that there's no way
*  It's not gonna work if you're really doing it not you're faking it not your half-ass and if you're really
*  This is all that matters to you
*  If you were going to Vanderbilt right now and you did it for another five years, you'd finally be a brain surgeon
*  He said if I was you I'd wait and see if I was a brain surgeon
*  I'll never forget and I'll never forget calling him crying the first time I moved into a neighborhood with a surgeon
*  You know what I mean, you know when you call like you won't fucking believe I just met my neighbor guess what he does
*  What the fucking plastic surgeon?
*  That's crazy yeah that old man knew something though, but he just knew that the law of work would never work against us
*  You know what I mean? Yeah, if you keep going, that's the thing we were talking about before about people bailing out
*  Yeah, it's hard. You just gotta sit man. Yeah, you just gotta sit man
*  You also got to recognize when you're making the right moves of the wrong moves
*  you know with what you're doing and sometimes people don't want to course correct, they don't want to course correct and
*  Then it could be a bad relationship
*  That one that one's tank more guys than anything. Yeah, I've seen and gals
*  I've seen the bad relationship one that'll tank you
*  No, that'll become everything in your life is that thing and then you have very little resources for your art
*  Yeah, cuz your life is just a storm
*  There's a storm of confusion and chaos and fucking emotions every day
*  Yeah, and then trying to block it out to make the art exactly
*  You know yeah, if you can't allow it to be the muse for for me
*  It was a little different because it became the muse
*  The chaos that was happening around me just became I had a moment where and this is such a cool epiphany I had Joe
*  For the longest time I thought I was special
*  Because I was from Antioch, Tennessee
*  And I grew up in a certain kind of way around certain kind of people and that I was special because that was that I
*  Hung onto that like I'm different and then I realized what was happening was I was just like everybody else
*  That's what the superpower really was is that every fucking neighborhood in America is like Antioch almost you know what I mean?
*  So it was like a totally different thing so I started realizing. Oh, this isn't this is the muse
*  I'm speaking for every man when I'm writing just the chaos that's happening around me right now. This is the every man story
*  Isn't it crazy that everybody wants to be special mmm, but every special person wants to be in every man
*  Yeah, I like being in every man, that's what I like being me too
*  Yeah
*  But when your kid you want to be different you want to pretend that you're different than other people because that'll make success more attainable
*  You want to pretend that there you have some special quality and ability that other people don't possess
*  So that's why you can get to this bizarre position that everybody wants but where everybody in our business wants to be successful and famous
*  So you have to be bizarre you have to and then once you get there you like oh shit
*  I'm everybody's just the same everybody's the same I gotta get make sure that I keep that
*  Yeah, make sure that I keep we're all the same. That's it was it was in my songwriting
*  I'm gonna say 2015 16 is I
*  Realized that I was trying to tell special stories and that God had put me in a situation
*  He was screaming at me to tell a story of a group of people that had never had their story told
*  But I was just going out of my way to try to come up with a special story
*  You know what I mean, and then when I started being like, you know what?
*  No, I'm just gonna write about my neighbor who's struggling with drug addiction
*  I'm just gonna write a song about my baby mother because I'm infuriated that she left our daughter high and dry like this because of drugs
*  You know what I mean? Like I just started writing from that perspective
*  And then I realized that it was connecting with people because it was the everyman story
*  You know what I mean? Um, I almost called this album Cinderella man
*  Right, and I'll tell you why I didn't but I thought I watched the movie and I was like I had a moment in that movie where
*  When he's walking you've seen the movie right y'all don't see moves
*  He's walking in a for those who haven't it's about an old boxer who in the depression it kind of
*  Was on a losing streak kind of long in the tooth. They call him Brad. James Pratt. They would call him a journeyman
*  It's what we call him now just do look like you're never gonna work out for
*  Working couldn't get a job on a loading dock almost family could family split and bred one of the greatest movies ever Russell Crowe, right?
*  Yep, and he comes out and towards the end ends up fighting his championship fight and it's a crazy movie to watch
*  But when he's running he goes by the old dock and they're all cheering for him
*  And I relate to this because this happened to me and he didn't understand it
*  So he looks at his manager. You remember this scene? This is the scene that I related to the most
*  He looks at his manager goes. Why are they cheering for me? He goes because you're them I
*  Was like I'm the fucking Cinderella man, that's why this worked for me at 40, you know what I mean?
*  Yeah, and but I ended up calling it beautifully broken
*  Because as I started really writing because that was my idea going into the project I'm gonna write the Cinderella man story and
*  All I could think about was other people
*  Every time I'd pick up a pen
*  I would think about this young lady at a show who told me that saved me helped her because she was raped by her uncle
*  So I'm like, what do I write for her I
*  See
*  Winning streak I watched this moment I
*  Got to write that for him, you know now I might write some of them from first perspective
*  But it changed everything and all of a sudden I was like this album ain't about me
*  You know what I mean? Right? This album is about finding beauty and broken things
*  You know, yeah
*  And instantly it was like once again how God works as soon as I took me out of it
*  The album blossomed
*  Immediately I wrote a hump broke 80 songs that sucked just couldn't find my way to what story I was trying to tell
*  You know and just as soon as I was like
*  Let's go back to where's the muse coming from what who am I writing for?
*  I say I'm the voice of the voiceless when I when I had the opportunity to go
*  Talk about fentanyl down at Capitol Hill. I didn't hesitate
*  I knew I was going to talk for a bunch of people that couldn't talk
*  You know what I mean? It's like who am I writing this for and dude it changed that whole writing style dog
*  And then I got lost and wrote another 80
*  But now I'm having fun. I got a direction. I feel like I've heard from God. I'm Moses
*  You know what I'm saying? The burning bushes spoke. I know what I'm supposed to be writing about, you know
*  It took me eight to 16 months to get there
*  But that's just how it works what you're saying to about taking yourself out of it soon as I took me out of it
*  You know what I mean?
*  As soon as I took me out of it
*  It's that easy
*  Snap that fast. It's almost like a trap like that's the you're so vain song. Yeah
*  It's like a trap like that trap of thinking about yourself. You you waste so much of your resources
*  So much of your resources like thinking about how you want to come off
*  How you want people to react to it how you want to like get out there and kill it in front of everybody?
*  And you miss all the beautiful magic. Hmm all the magic. It's right there
*  Yeah, you know and you're just missing and we get lost in the heart and when you're at your best you are them
*  You are one of them you like singing for them, you know when when I'm at my best
*  It's when I didn't know they were cheering. I didn't know they were even cheering for me, right?
*  It's cuz I'm one of them. You know what I mean? It's kind of like the yeah, it's that it's that same kind
*  Yeah, this album was the most fun I've ever had getting to an album. I learned so much about myself
*  I think that's one of the things that people really dislike about stars
*  Like famous people like people that you think of as stars that they somehow know to think they're better than everybody else
*  That's the thing that people like dislike the most like oh, they think they're better than us
*  They live in Beverly Hills. They think they're better than us because they're a star
*  You know better than us
*  It's like when someone can do what you do and stay the same person and stay them just a better version of who you used
*  To be but stay stay normal. Yeah, and actually getting better every day because I'm doing the work
*  You know, I was telling the Titans when I went talk to him at the game
*  I was like I focus and I don't focus on winning anything but life
*  Like I know that everything else is gonna be good as long as I'm focused on being a good father
*  Like priority number one is like am I good husband what I've learned is if I'm winning as a husband and I'm winning as a father
*  I am fucking kicking ass in business. Yeah, the last one is a home dramas. Yeah, you don't want no home drama
*  Crazy but it's also that's something we talked about things that distracted people I was in so many bad relationships early or even times in my life
*  I was single courting multiple women and that's such a distraction
*  like when I got with my wife and fell of like to the point of being like I don't want to
*  Spend time with any woman, but you when I have the time I have to spend I want to spend it with you
*  And all my it's like my whole world
*  Suddenly went from feeling like it was this big to this big and when it got that small I was like
*  Man, this is it. We're in a foxhole
*  And then I just started kicking ass outside
*  You know what I'm saying? My wife just starts winning and I'm like, oh dude, it's cuz I'm fucking winning at home
*  It's also what you're saying to about your resources like you have so much more to give, you know, and everything's positive
*  About a happy home life like feeds off your happy business life and your happy performing life
*  That's what we all want. You know, we all want a beautiful community of people that are like
*  Enjoying life and experiencing life together your family and your friends and the people you fuck around with
*  You just want a beautiful community of people having a good time
*  That's possible, but it's hard and that's why it's so wonderful when you get it because you know that there's a lot of people
*  Out there that are never gonna get it
*  Hmm man, that's deep. That's the probably the hardest part. It's a lot of work towards it to though, man
*  A lot of a lot of it's a lot of work on yourself. Yeah. Yeah, a lot of lots of lots of work
*  That's working relationships though
*  Just think about the arc that you've gone through from being a kid getting arrested as a kid
*  Spending all that time in juvenile and jail and then getting free and then figuring out that you're talented and then
*  Pursuing this crazy impossible dream, you know to where you are now. It's nuts
*  So none of the biggest podcast in the world my bubble
*  It's an amazing story. I mean, it's an amazing if it was in a movie you'd have a hard time believe it
*  Yeah, that movie's nuts
*  I'm telling you dude that little fat nerdy alien is playing me on the game every day is fucking killing it
*  He's killing it my brother. I appreciate you very much. Yeah, I love you. I love you very much
*  I gotta I gotta put Jamie on blast before we go though
*  Me and Jamie had some cocktails one night
