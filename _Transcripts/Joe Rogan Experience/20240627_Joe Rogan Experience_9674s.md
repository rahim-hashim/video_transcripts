# Joe Rogan Experience #1967 - Mike Vecchione
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6.0s)]
*  What's up? How are you man? Pleasure to meet you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=12.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me on Joe, it's a pleasure to meet you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=15.0s)]
*  Hey, my pleasure. You're a funny motherfucker man. I enjoy your shit. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=17.0s)]
*  Thank you man. How long you doing it? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=20.0s)]
*  23. Nice. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=22.0s)]
*  I started in October of 2000, did about 3 and a half years in Philly with DeRosa, Big J, those guys, and then moved to New York at the end of 2003. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=24.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=37.0s)]
*  I was a teacher, I got a masters in special education. I was working with kids who had behavioral problems for about 8 years. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=38.0s)]
*  You seem like a guy who would work with kids with behavioral problems. You're very calm. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=45.0s)]
*  Yeah, very calming, very calming, but it was very, very challenging. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=49.0s)]
*  I can imagine that. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=53.0s)]
*  Kids would flip a lot. Every day at work was something different. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=54.0s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=58.0s)]
*  I worked in a behavioral school for a while and then went back at night and got my masters because I figured if I'm going to do this I might as well teach. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=59.0s)]
*  And then taught in a classroom in three different public school systems. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=66.0s)]
*  When did you decide to leave to go comedy full time? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=70.0s)]
*  I did about, I started going to open mics. I was in a relationship and I thought we were going to get married and it broke up. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=76.0s)]
*  I think a lot of comics have this story, you know, where it's like a heartbreak situation and then I was just on my own kind of out there finishing up my masters. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=83.0s)]
*  So I started just going to open mics at the Laugh House, which is not there anymore. It's a comedy club on South Street. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=91.0s)]
*  And I just started going every Wednesday and then I started going on Thursdays and a little bit more. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=98.0s)]
*  And then I wasn't funny at first, you know, at bomb. I would do okay, bomb, do okay, bomb. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=103.0s)]
*  But I was like, you know, I'm probably not going to be able to do this, but it's going to help me public speaking wise. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=108.0s)]
*  It's going to help me somewhere down the line. You know, I got a good vibe for it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=113.0s)]
*  So I was like, let me just keep doing it. And at that point, you know, I was, you know, alone and I was going through a tough time. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=117.0s)]
*  So I was like, I kind of don't care if I fail. I kind of just don't care. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=123.0s)]
*  I'm going to just fail and just figure it out and just keep coming at it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=127.0s)]
*  And because I'm a sensitive guy, so it's like, you know, failure has been tough to take. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=131.0s)]
*  So I just just kept doing it. I just kind of it kind of dropped off because I was going through a tough time. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=138.0s)]
*  I didn't care about failure. So I just kept doing it and doing it and doing it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=143.0s)]
*  And then at the end of 2003, I was working a job I didn't didn't want to do anymore. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=147.0s)]
*  And I just decided to move to New York. And that's when it really like I'm a really I don't know how much time you spent. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=152.0s)]
*  I don't know how much time you spent in New York. I know you're a Boston guy, but I'm a product of the New York City comedy clubs. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=156.0s)]
*  Really is what I like to say. Just hopping going from just hopping. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=162.0s)]
*  I mean, it's not so much like that anymore, but it used to be I don't know how much time you spent there, but it was like you would just run from club to club to club to club to make money. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=166.0s)]
*  Yeah. And that's how I would do it. You know, and the big club was a comedy seller. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=174.0s)]
*  Still is. But it's like the Boston Comedy Club. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=178.0s)]
*  I started in New York the last days of the Boston Comedy Club with Nate and Dustin Shafin, a lot of these guys. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=181.0s)]
*  So I started there. And then what we do is I go to an open mic first to make sure you got stage time. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=188.0s)]
*  And then I would go to the Boston and the Boston different comics would run the weeknights. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=196.0s)]
*  So you would go and hang out and see if you could get on. So then I would do that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=201.0s)]
*  And then at the end of the night, you would go to the cellar and just hang out and just hanging out was a big thing back then because you just get your face around, get people to know who you are. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=205.0s)]
*  And every club had their different every city has their different scene. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=215.0s)]
*  And in New York, we'd end up at the cellar with Patrice, Keith Robinson, Jim Norton, those guys. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=219.0s)]
*  And you'd hang out and they would just break balls at the table. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=225.0s)]
*  Different time, you know, everybody would break balls and then people would get to know you slowly. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=229.0s)]
*  Isn't it crazy you say 2003 is a different time? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=234.0s)]
*  Different time. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=237.0s)]
*  You're talking about the 20s. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=238.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it was a very different landscape back then. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=239.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=243.0s)]
*  And that's what you had to do. You had to hang and get your face around so people would know. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=244.0s)]
*  You know, maybe Mike would be good to open or maybe so-and-so would be good to open for you on the road. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=247.0s)]
*  You know, and that's how you would get work. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=252.0s)]
*  Yeah, I moved to New York in 91, I think, 91 or 92, somewhere around there. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=254.0s)]
*  And I did the clubs. I did Boston. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=259.0s)]
*  But mostly I did the road because like I lived in New Rochelle. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=262.0s)]
*  I couldn't afford to live in Manhattan because I couldn't afford a parking spot. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=267.0s)]
*  And I did road gigs so much. I had a car. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=270.0s)]
*  And my thought was like, I could do these little clubs, but I don't make any money. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=273.0s)]
*  Or I could do like Long Island and Connecticut and Jersey. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=278.0s)]
*  I could make, you know, 150 bucks, 200 bucks for a show. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=282.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=285.0s)]
*  And I'd have money. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=286.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=287.0s)]
*  And I'd do long sets. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=288.0s)]
*  And I was always a big fan of Hicks. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=289.0s)]
*  And I knew that Hicks, he did mostly the road. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=291.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=294.0s)]
*  And he did like these real shitholes. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=295.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=297.0s)]
*  As good as he was. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=298.0s)]
*  I always thought that like shitholes made shitty comics. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=299.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=301.0s)]
*  But Hicks kind of changed my mind about that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=302.0s)]
*  Like you could do great comedy in front of shitty rooms. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=304.0s)]
*  Right. And win them over. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=306.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=308.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's really something. That's really what it is. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=309.0s)]
*  Because if you let the room change you, you can become a shitty comic that way. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=311.0s)]
*  You can. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=314.0s)]
*  And you go, no, I'm going to flip them, but on my terms. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=315.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=317.0s)]
*  That's a lost art also. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=318.0s)]
*  Because if you're big, you know, you have your own fans and stuff that doesn't come into play. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=319.0s)]
*  But if you're good and you're on the road, you don't have your own fans. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=323.0s)]
*  It's like you have to like keep just working them. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=326.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=329.0s)]
*  Working them, working them. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=330.0s)]
*  I was at the Atlanta punchline and this happened where it was the crowd, you know, they didn't know me. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=331.0s)]
*  And there was a drunk woman. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=335.0s)]
*  It's my birthday. It's my birthday. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=336.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=338.0s)]
*  Like making it about her. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=339.0s)]
*  And like younger in comedy, I would have just bailed and just tried to score off of her and win and just, you know, do a penalty kill. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=340.0s)]
*  You know, just play the set out that way and walk away with the victory. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=350.0s)]
*  But I decided, you know, you know what, let me neutralize her. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=353.0s)]
*  I don't want to make it about her. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=356.0s)]
*  She's being selfish, you know, stay in the pocket because I hadn't won the other people over yet. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=357.0s)]
*  They were still on the fence about this guy. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=362.0s)]
*  So it's like just keep, just keep coming, just keep coming and then working them and bringing them to you and bringing them to you and neutralize her because she's a distraction and just keep bringing them, bringing them, bringing them. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=364.0s)]
*  And at the end, like it was good. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=376.0s)]
*  It was a good set. But I got off stage. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=379.0s)]
*  I was like, oh my God, that was so much work and nobody's going to know about it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=380.0s)]
*  No one's going to know what happened here. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=385.0s)]
*  And I walked to the bar and there's a couple of comics at the bar and one guy looks at me and goes, I saw what happened. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=387.0s)]
*  He goes, I saw what you did. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=394.0s)]
*  That was great. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=396.0s)]
*  That was masterful. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=397.0s)]
*  I go thank at least one witness. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=398.0s)]
*  I got one witness who saw what it was. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=400.0s)]
*  Who knows like what it is and how hard it is to do. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=402.0s)]
*  It's my birthday. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=405.0s)]
*  Oh God, there's so many of them out there. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=406.0s)]
*  It's really something you just go to. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=408.0s)]
*  Just go to karaoke. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=410.0s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=411.0s)]
*  Just go to karaoke. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=412.0s)]
*  Some lady was fucking up Ron Whitesat the other night in our club. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=413.0s)]
*  She yelled out, can I get a picture with you? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=417.0s)]
*  She kept saying that in the middle of his fucking bits. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=421.0s)]
*  Like he'd be in the middle of the setup. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=424.0s)]
*  You hear, can I get a picture with you? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=426.0s)]
*  Oh, it's the worst. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=429.0s)]
*  And it's really something because the crowd's not on your side and you come too hard at her. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=432.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=437.0s)]
*  Then they're going to be like, whoa, what is this guy? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=438.0s)]
*  This guy's angry now. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=440.0s)]
*  It's like they kind of don't get the dynamic of what's happening, but if you just stay and they're like, Miss, I love you. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=441.0s)]
*  I don't want you to get kicked out. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=446.0s)]
*  You know, just like, you know, and eventually she just went to the bathroom anyway and just whatever. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=447.0s)]
*  Did coke. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=452.0s)]
*  Something. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=453.0s)]
*  I think she was on it before. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=454.0s)]
*  Maybe did more coke. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=455.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=456.0s)]
*  It's funny how you remember those sets like that. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=457.0s)]
*  Like one set that you could like, that was a breakthrough moment. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=460.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=463.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=464.0s)]
*  But it's like the fact that it's like, oh, I know it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=465.0s)]
*  I know it. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=467.0s)]
*  I know it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=468.0s)]
*  And I doubt anybody else is going to know it, but whatever. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=469.0s)]
*  I know it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=471.0s)]
*  Do you ever stop and think like, what if you didn't break up with that girl? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=472.0s)]
*  Like, what if you were still in that relationship and you'd never pursued comedy? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=476.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=480.0s)]
*  All the time. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=481.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=482.0s)]
*  All the time. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=483.0s)]
*  And I just, but you know what? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=484.0s)]
*  I could have, I would have been married. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=485.0s)]
*  I would have had kids, you know, whatever. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=486.0s)]
*  And I just would have lived that life. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=488.0s)]
*  It was a fork in the road. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=490.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=491.0s)]
*  It was really sad because I was teaching at times, working at a behavioral school and I was with her and I was like, oh, this is probably how this is going to be. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=492.0s)]
*  This is probably how this is going to play out. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=497.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=499.0s)]
*  I don't, I don't have that in the, the thing in me to go out and get spots because going out and get spot getting spots is like, you have to go out and you have to hustle. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=500.0s)]
*  I was already working hard and my job and you're trying to get my masters. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=510.0s)]
*  I was on a different path. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=514.0s)]
*  So I didn't have that extra in me to go and try to get, you know, spots at clubs and stuff. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=515.0s)]
*  So when you say that, like you, when, when, at that moment, did you kind of were, you weren't in a good place, right? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=520.0s)]
*  She broke up with me. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=529.0s)]
*  I was really, really, we were, we dated in college and then we, she's from Philadelphia. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=530.0s)]
*  So I had no ties to Philadelphia. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=536.0s)]
*  So I moved to Philadelphia to try to find a job, be with her. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=538.0s)]
*  She was in law school. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=542.0s)]
*  And so, yeah, that's, that's what it was. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=543.0s)]
*  I hope she watches YouTube now. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=547.0s)]
*  I mean, I think she's got a good life. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=550.0s)]
*  She had a good, she was a good person. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=552.0s)]
*  She had her head on her shoulders and she was a good. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=553.0s)]
*  It wasn't a deal. It's okay. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=555.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=556.0s)]
*  It hurt though, man. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=557.0s)]
*  It hurt. And it's heartbreak like that that causes you to go, oh yeah, I got a, it makes you raw. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=558.0s)]
*  You know, it makes you raw and it makes you go like, I'm going to go out and take some chances and. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=564.0s)]
*  Do what I really want to do. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=569.0s)]
*  Figure my life out. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=570.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=571.0s)]
*  Now, if it would have been a thing where I would have been successful right away, then it would have been, oh my God, yeah, it's different. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=572.0s)]
*  But it's been 20, I've had wins along the way. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=577.0s)]
*  This is a big win by the way. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=580.0s)]
*  But it's like wins along the way. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=582.0s)]
*  It's like that gradual. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=584.0s)]
*  I thought I'd moved to New York and it's like, I'll be a star or I'll just get a job. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=585.0s)]
*  I didn't realize that it was going to be this incremental thing where it's like, get a tonight show. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=589.0s)]
*  That's good. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=594.0s)]
*  Last comic standing. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=595.0s)]
*  That's good. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=596.0s)]
*  NBC time, you know, it's like this happens. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=597.0s)]
*  Montreal Comedy Festival. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=599.0s)]
*  It's like gradual throughout the years. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=600.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=602.0s)]
*  So that becomes your life. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=603.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=605.0s)]
*  I describe it to people like making a mountain one layer of paint at a time. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=606.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=610.0s)]
*  That's what it's like. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=611.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=612.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=613.0s)]
*  That really is. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=614.0s)]
*  Build it, build it, build it out. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=615.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=616.0s)]
*  It's so slow. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=617.0s)]
*  But you don't think that. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=618.0s)]
*  I didn't think that at the beginning. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=619.0s)]
*  I thought, oh, I'll just go and I'll win or I'll fail. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=620.0s)]
*  Either way, it's like, even if I fail, I'm in New York, I'll figure it out in New York. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=622.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=626.0s)]
*  But yeah, I didn't see this. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=627.0s)]
*  I didn't see that incremental, the incremental steps that it takes. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=629.0s)]
*  And you know, as a comic after that, like any girl I'd have so protective, so protective. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=633.0s)]
*  And I think a lot of comics are that way over my career. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=638.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=641.0s)]
*  Like I don't, nothing comes in the way of this. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=642.0s)]
*  Nothing comes in the way. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=643.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, I'm not going to sacrifice any of my time for anything else. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=644.0s)]
*  I'm in this. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=649.0s)]
*  Well, because it's so fun when it works. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=650.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=652.0s)]
*  And the idea of making a living off of doing that is so exciting. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=653.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=656.0s)]
*  That you think like, I can't let anything get in the way of this. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=657.0s)]
*  And relationships will get in the way of this. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=661.0s)]
*  Like the early days I dated girls were like, you don't have to go up tonight. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=663.0s)]
*  I was like, oh, I don't? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=666.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=668.0s)]
*  Like, yes, I do. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=669.0s)]
*  Like, you don't know what you're talking about. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=670.0s)]
*  Like if you could kill, you would know this. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=671.0s)]
*  If you know what it feels like to go up there and hit a punch line and have the whole room fall out. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=674.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=680.0s)]
*  That's a wild feeling. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=681.0s)]
*  Yeah, it really is. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=682.0s)]
*  And not a lot of people ever get to experience that. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=683.0s)]
*  No. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=685.0s)]
*  And it is an art. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=686.0s)]
*  It's an art form. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=687.0s)]
*  It's an art form to be able to do that, especially over an hour. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=688.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a real art form. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=690.0s)]
*  It's an art form that sounds like you're just talking. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=692.0s)]
*  So it's kind of underappreciated because everybody can just talk. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=694.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=697.0s)]
*  And most people are funny sometimes. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=698.0s)]
*  So you see somebody up there and you're like, I could kind of do that. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=700.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=702.0s)]
*  And so you don't really respect it unless someone's just fucking murdering you. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=703.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=706.0s)]
*  It's a funny thing to do with your life. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=707.0s)]
*  And man, it tests the shit out of you in the beginning. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=710.0s)]
*  Because in the beginning, it just doesn't – there was many times where I was like, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=713.0s)]
*  this is never going to happen. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=716.0s)]
*  Like, I'd bomb. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=718.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=719.0s)]
*  I'd go back home fucking massively depressed in whatever shitty apartment I was in going, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=720.0s)]
*  what the fuck am I doing? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=723.0s)]
*  Todd Lynn, who was a comic back in the day, passed away since, but he used to say, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=725.0s)]
*  it's like dating a really hot girl with really bad breath. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=729.0s)]
*  That's what I'm like, God, he really described it perfectly. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=735.0s)]
*  Sort of, but you could brush her teeth. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=740.0s)]
*  Say, hey baby, I love you to death. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=742.0s)]
*  Your fucking breath is whack. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=744.0s)]
*  There's something you could do about that. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=746.0s)]
*  But comedy, it's just like, it's the whims. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=748.0s)]
*  It's the crowd. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=750.0s)]
*  It's who's on before you. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=751.0s)]
*  It's where you're at in your life. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=753.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=755.0s)]
*  That's all true. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=756.0s)]
*  And it's a process. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=757.0s)]
*  I learned that from wrestling too. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=759.0s)]
*  Like, wrestling, I was good for my area. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=761.0s)]
*  I learned to wrestle in Ohio, which is a great state. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=763.0s)]
*  We had a great program. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=767.0s)]
*  And then I moved to Florida. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=768.0s)]
*  And I finished high school in Florida. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=769.0s)]
*  So I wrestled down there. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=771.0s)]
*  And it's like, I was so focused. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=772.0s)]
*  I don't know how you were as a competitor, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=775.0s)]
*  but I was so focused on the win. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=777.0s)]
*  I wanted to get the win. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=779.0s)]
*  I wanted to get, it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=781.0s)]
*  And I would psych myself out before matches a lot of times [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=783.0s)]
*  by overthinking it, you know? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=787.0s)]
*  And it's like, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=789.0s)]
*  It's about the process. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=790.0s)]
*  It's about the process. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=792.0s)]
*  Train hard. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=794.0s)]
*  But when it's time to compete then, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=795.0s)]
*  I wish I would have had this back then. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=796.0s)]
*  It's like, you have to just get yourself up and go out there [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=798.0s)]
*  and just do the things that you train to do. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=802.0s)]
*  And I was too focused on the, oh, I want to win. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=805.0s)]
*  I want to feel the victory. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=808.0s)]
*  It's like, I want to win. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=810.0s)]
*  It's like, no, no, no. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=811.0s)]
*  It's the process. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=812.0s)]
*  Stick to the process. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=813.0s)]
*  But I wish I would have had that before I went out [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=814.0s)]
*  and competed, like, go out there and just cut through this guy. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=817.0s)]
*  I didn't have that attitude. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=820.0s)]
*  I was tired from cutting weight. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=821.0s)]
*  And, you know, when you go to these tournaments, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=822.0s)]
*  when you wrestle, you weigh in. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=824.0s)]
*  You weigh in and then you would go have breakfast. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=826.0s)]
*  And then there's a time where you digest [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=828.0s)]
*  and lay around on the mat a little bit [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=830.0s)]
*  and then start slowly drilling and getting ready for the match. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=832.0s)]
*  And during that time is when you should be getting your mind right [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=835.0s)]
*  to go out there and, like, take it to them. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=838.0s)]
*  And the guys who were successful did that. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=840.0s)]
*  And I couldn't see it back then. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=842.0s)]
*  But looking back and having perspective on it, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=844.0s)]
*  it's like, I wish I was that. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=846.0s)]
*  So now I keep that in mind in standup, you know, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=848.0s)]
*  because a lot of standup is that, you know, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=850.0s)]
*  being mentally prepared to go up. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=853.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=855.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=856.0s)]
*  Yeah, I always tell comics, like, don't go up. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=857.0s)]
*  Don't just go cold. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=859.0s)]
*  Like, warm your mind up. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=860.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=861.0s)]
*  I pace around. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=862.0s)]
*  I breathe deep. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=863.0s)]
*  I stretch out. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=864.0s)]
*  I go over my notes. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=865.0s)]
*  Like, maybe you don't need to do that, but you should. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=866.0s)]
*  It's just, like, good for the head. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=868.0s)]
*  Just get your mind right. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=870.0s)]
*  What do you think about before you go up? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=872.0s)]
*  I mean, you're working these arenas now, these gigantic venues. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=874.0s)]
*  So what do you think about before you go up? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=877.0s)]
*  Well, arenas, one of the things that I do is I have index cards. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=880.0s)]
*  So I write out, I'll get there early, and I'll write out, like, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=883.0s)]
*  just bullet points of all the sets or all the bits, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=887.0s)]
*  and I'll put them on cards. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=892.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=893.0s)]
*  Like, this is on this subject. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=894.0s)]
*  This is on that subject. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=895.0s)]
*  And I'll lay them out on a coffee table. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=896.0s)]
*  And writing that out just, like, cements it all in my head, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=898.0s)]
*  solidifies it all in my head. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=901.0s)]
*  And then it's just about getting fired up. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=903.0s)]
*  By the time I'm getting to an arena, though, my set is rock solid. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=905.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=908.0s)]
*  That means I've done the clubs, I developed the hour, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=909.0s)]
*  and then I went to theaters, and I started feeling it. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=912.0s)]
*  That's a great way to do it. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=915.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=916.0s)]
*  By the time, you can't just go up in front of 16,000 people [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=917.0s)]
*  not knowing whether or not it's going to go well. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=920.0s)]
*  You have to be fucking, you have to be tuned in and ready to go. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=923.0s)]
*  And you got to go out there with a lot of energy, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=927.0s)]
*  because, you know, these people, like, they got fucking babysitters. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=930.0s)]
*  They bought the tickets a long time in advance. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=933.0s)]
*  It's a big deal for them. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=936.0s)]
*  You can't, you got to treat it like it's very important. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=938.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=941.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=942.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=943.0s)]
*  And just opening for Nate, Nate Bargatze, my friend who put my special on. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=944.0s)]
*  Yeah, you got, theater is a different, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=947.0s)]
*  especially than the New York City clubs, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=950.0s)]
*  because it's intimate in New York. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=952.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=953.0s)]
*  And on the road even. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=954.0s)]
*  But it's like those theaters, it's like, it can be overwhelming. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=955.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of space to fill, it feels like. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=958.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a different timing. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=960.0s)]
*  You know, with the low ceilings, it's like a different, it's a different vibe. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=961.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a different vibe with more people. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=965.0s)]
*  It's a different vibe with the bigger, bigger area. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=967.0s)]
*  It's a different vibe with the high ceilings. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=970.0s)]
*  And it's just, it's also you're not connected to them. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=972.0s)]
*  It's a show, you're up there. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=974.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=976.0s)]
*  You know, one of the things that I really like is the round. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=977.0s)]
*  When you do arenas in the round, because believe it or not, it's kind of intimate. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=979.0s)]
*  Because even though there's like 16,000 people, you're, you're, there's people all around you. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=983.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=989.0s)]
*  And you're looking at them and they're looking at the other people on the other side too. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=990.0s)]
*  So it's this like big circle of people. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=993.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=995.0s)]
*  It's oddly intimate, you know, it's as weird as that sounds. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=996.0s)]
*  That's really something. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=999.0s)]
*  That's really something. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1000.0s)]
*  I know when I go, I was very connected to my jokes. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1001.0s)]
*  I'm like, this is all about these jokes. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1004.0s)]
*  It's all about these jokes. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1006.0s)]
*  I fine tune them and everything. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1007.0s)]
*  But then I started to realize it's, it is the preparation is about your jokes, but it's [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1009.0s)]
*  also about two things. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1015.0s)]
*  One, going up and having a good time. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1017.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1020.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1021.0s)]
*  Like have fun with it. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1022.0s)]
*  You did all the preparation. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1023.0s)]
*  Now go up and be playful with them. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1024.0s)]
*  Go up and be playful and be loose. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1026.0s)]
*  I have to tell myself that because I'm connected to that. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1028.0s)]
*  I'm just like, let's go to the jokes. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1030.0s)]
*  And the other thing I started doing before I would go up is what you said, love the crowd, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1032.0s)]
*  love them, like love them because they have hard lives. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1039.0s)]
*  They're going through divorce, bankruptcy, all kinds of like problems. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1044.0s)]
*  And they came out to get a break from that. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1049.0s)]
*  And like in my joke writing, I would forget that. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1052.0s)]
*  I was like, this is about the joke. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1055.0s)]
*  It's about me. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1056.0s)]
*  You know, connect with them because they maybe need a break in their life, you know, and [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1057.0s)]
*  be playful and, you know, love them before you go up. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1062.0s)]
*  That always helps. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1065.0s)]
*  Even if the set goes bad and you have that mindset going up, it's much easier. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1066.0s)]
*  It's much easier to deal with. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1071.0s)]
*  Isn't it interesting that standup is such a big thing in terms of like how many people [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1072.0s)]
*  go to see it and how many people love it and you know, how many shows there are on the [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1077.0s)]
*  country at any given time. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1082.0s)]
*  It's a huge art form in terms of like how many people pay for it. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1084.0s)]
*  But very few people share how they do it and no one teaches it. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1088.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1095.0s)]
*  It's like no one can teach you how to do your way because your way is different than Nate's [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1096.0s)]
*  way. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1100.0s)]
*  Nate's way is different than Ari Shafir's way. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1101.0s)]
*  Everybody's got their own style and their own thing. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1103.0s)]
*  And you kind of got to teach yourself and all these things you're saying, like knowing [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1106.0s)]
*  how to just go out and love those people, have a good time, be playful. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1110.0s)]
*  You got to learn that on your own. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1113.0s)]
*  But that's my thing because I'm connected to the jokes. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1115.0s)]
*  Like if you're a guy with a ton of charisma and no act, like you have a different set [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1117.0s)]
*  of struggles. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1123.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1124.0s)]
*  So it's like, yeah, my thing is like don't be too connected. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1125.0s)]
*  Be loose with the jokes. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1128.0s)]
*  And as I've had more experience, it's easier. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1130.0s)]
*  You know, obviously get your stage presence down. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1132.0s)]
*  It's a long, brutal process. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1134.0s)]
*  And it's funny that the mindset of a competitor, like your mindset of that can kind of get [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1137.0s)]
*  in the way sometimes. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1143.0s)]
*  You think? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1144.0s)]
*  Because you get so focused on, you know, like you're saying, like the jokes, the jokes. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1145.0s)]
*  And you got to realize like, no, this is like, this is a fun thing that you're doing. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1150.0s)]
*  Like you can't get too intense about it. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1154.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1157.0s)]
*  That's absolutely true. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1158.0s)]
*  And the guys, but the guys I've seen, the top level wrestlers that I've seen, the discipline [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1159.0s)]
*  I came from, the guys who are super, super good, like Kale Sanderson, that guy, it's [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1162.0s)]
*  like when he wrestles, I just watched, I went down to rabbit holes watching his NCAA finals [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1167.0s)]
*  matches. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1172.0s)]
*  He just looks fluid. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1173.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1176.0s)]
*  So it's like, I'm thinking that intense, intense, intense. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1177.0s)]
*  But when a guy at that level goes out and wrestles, it just, he just looks like he's [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1179.0s)]
*  flowing. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1184.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1185.0s)]
*  There doesn't seem to be any tension in his body whatsoever. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1186.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1189.0s)]
*  And the guys who are really good, I found, do that. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1190.0s)]
*  They're just, they just flow. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1193.0s)]
*  They're efficient. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1195.0s)]
*  They're efficient. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1196.0s)]
*  And they're, and he was like, and the guys who are really good, offensive machines, like [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1197.0s)]
*  they'll set something up, set something up, and then, and then just go to another thing. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1201.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1205.0s)]
*  Fluid, like water, you know? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1206.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1208.0s)]
*  I feel like wrestling is one of those things that is one of the most difficult sports to [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1209.0s)]
*  compete in. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1213.0s)]
*  And yet one of the most underappreciated in terms of like public perception, there's no [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1214.0s)]
*  professional avenue other than like MMA or pro wrestling, which is like entertainment. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1219.0s)]
*  There's no, but it's so hard to do. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1224.0s)]
*  It's kind of interesting how many sports become really popular and in terms of like being [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1227.0s)]
*  something that people pay to see. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1233.0s)]
*  But wrestling never did that. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1235.0s)]
*  It never connected. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1237.0s)]
*  No, I could see that. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1238.0s)]
*  I could see why though. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1240.0s)]
*  I could see it just because if you don't, if you, to the untrained eye, it just looks [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1241.0s)]
*  like two guys just, and especially if the two guys are at the high, at a high, high [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1244.0s)]
*  level, it's very like strategic what they're doing. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1249.0s)]
*  And there's not, sometimes there could be not much action because they're just trying [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1252.0s)]
*  to get position. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1255.0s)]
*  And the other guy's so good at staying in position. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1256.0s)]
*  It's like, it can be like a standoff that way. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1259.0s)]
*  So I understand why it's not entertaining to the eye a lot of times. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1261.0s)]
*  I kind of do, but I kind of feel like it could have been. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1264.0s)]
*  It feels like, I mean, how's baseball popular? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1268.0s)]
*  I do not. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1270.0s)]
*  I'm not a baseball guy at all. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1271.0s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1272.0s)]
*  I appreciate it if people play it. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1273.0s)]
*  I appreciate it if you love it. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1274.0s)]
*  But for me, I just do not understand why that's entertaining. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1275.0s)]
*  And yet it's the big American pastime. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1279.0s)]
*  It's a funny thing. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1282.0s)]
*  Like wrestling is way more exciting. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1284.0s)]
*  Well, I root for all the wrestlers in the MMA, the UFC. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1286.0s)]
*  It's like, because it's like entertainment, I root for all the standups. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1289.0s)]
*  If a standup guy is going against an improv guy for a job, I'm rooting standup. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1294.0s)]
*  You got to root for the discipline that you came from. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1298.0s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1301.0s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1302.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1303.0s)]
*  And wrestling is the most important discipline for MMA. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1304.0s)]
*  You think? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1306.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's the foundation. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1307.0s)]
*  Because the wrestler can dictate where the fight takes place. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1308.0s)]
*  You know, if the wrestler chooses to stand, he can stand. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1311.0s)]
*  If the wrestler wants to get back up, he can get back up. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1314.0s)]
*  And the wrestler knows how to take the guy down. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1316.0s)]
*  Whereas, like, even though every fight starts standing up, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1318.0s)]
*  and it's a big advantage for the striker while they're standing up, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1322.0s)]
*  but the wrestler, the wrestler knows how to strike, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1324.0s)]
*  the striker has to think about two different things simultaneously. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1327.0s)]
*  He has to think, maybe this guy's going to shoot, and what if this guy punches me? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1330.0s)]
*  What if this guy kicks me? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1333.0s)]
*  So there's, like, so many more options that the wrestler has, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1334.0s)]
*  and there's that threat of the takedown that looms large, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1337.0s)]
*  that, like, paralyzes guys with anticipation. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1340.0s)]
*  It's the most important foundation. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1343.0s)]
*  It's everything in MMA. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1345.0s)]
*  If you can't wrestle, good luck. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1347.0s)]
*  Because unless you can land a wild shot, like, you know, Jorge Masvidal and Ben Askren, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1350.0s)]
*  unless you get that wild shot off right away and knock the guy out, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1354.0s)]
*  it's a long night against one of the best wrestlers. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1357.0s)]
*  Right, and that wild shot, are you going to be able to do that every time? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1360.0s)]
*  Most likely no. Yeah. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1363.0s)]
*  If you look at, like, overall success rate, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1365.0s)]
*  wrestlers have a huge percentage of wins in MMA. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1367.0s)]
*  And the really good guys, like Bo Nicol, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1371.0s)]
*  like, right away you see him dominating guys with, like, all this experience. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1374.0s)]
*  Because his skill set, that one skill that he has wrestling, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1378.0s)]
*  he's so much better than everybody else, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1381.0s)]
*  that it's just a massive, massive advantage. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1383.0s)]
*  And the training. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1386.0s)]
*  Like, I took taekwondo when I was young. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1387.0s)]
*  And it's, like, forms and, you know, punches and kicks and forms. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1389.0s)]
*  But when I started wrestling in eighth grade, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1393.0s)]
*  eighth grade wrestling practice was so intense [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1396.0s)]
*  that I thought that the coach was punishing the football players on the... [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1400.0s)]
*  I thought, are we being punished for, like, two months? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1405.0s)]
*  I had to check in on my friends and say, no, no, no, this is just what it is. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1408.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it's, so... [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1411.0s)]
*  I wrestled one year in high school, and I couldn't believe how hard it was. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1413.0s)]
*  I would remember going home, and my legs were so sore after running stadium stairs [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1416.0s)]
*  that I could barely walk. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1421.0s)]
*  And I was like, this is fucking horrible. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1423.0s)]
*  And, like, didn't want to go to class. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1425.0s)]
*  And I was so tired from wrestling that I was like, Jesus Christ, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1427.0s)]
*  like, how does anybody do this? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1431.0s)]
*  Yeah. It was nuts. And then the cutting weight also, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1432.0s)]
*  which I'm sure you had to make weight for competition. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1434.0s)]
*  It just... It's like... And we didn't know anything back then. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1437.0s)]
*  It's just like, go eat pasta! And just, like, eat less. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1439.0s)]
*  There was no, like, science behind any of it. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1442.0s)]
*  Right. And you weighed in the day of the match, too, which is terrible. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1444.0s)]
*  Terrible. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1447.0s)]
*  One of the best things about the UFC is that they cut weight the day before. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1448.0s)]
*  I hate cutting weight, period. Right. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1451.0s)]
*  My opinion on cutting weight for fighting is that it's sanctioned cheating. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1453.0s)]
*  Like, you're not really 170 pounds. Right. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1457.0s)]
*  You're 200 pounds. Yeah. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1460.0s)]
*  But you dry yourself out the week of, and then 24 hours in, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1461.0s)]
*  you're losing 12, 13 pounds. Right. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1465.0s)]
*  And then you rehydrate like crazy. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1467.0s)]
*  Like, what is this stupid thing that they're doing 24 hours before a cage fight? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1469.0s)]
*  Yeah. You're literally almost dying. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1473.0s)]
*  Well, some guys are just naturally close to their weight. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1475.0s)]
*  I wrestle with guys like that, who are just, like, three or four pounds above the weight. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1477.0s)]
*  Yeah. Because they have very low body fat. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1481.0s)]
*  I wasn't like that. I was like a bulky guy and husky. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1483.0s)]
*  And it's like, that means, yeah, you got to cut a lot of weight [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1486.0s)]
*  to get that muscle mass that the other guys might have naturally. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1489.0s)]
*  Yeah, to make the optimal weight, you know, body weight for competing. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1492.0s)]
*  Right. Because if you wrestle at a high, people just go, wrestle at a higher weight. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1498.0s)]
*  It's like, then you're wrestling guys who've cut down from a higher weight, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1501.0s)]
*  and they're going to just be stronger. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1505.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a big advantage if you can do it right. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1507.0s)]
*  Like, this weekend is Israel Adesanya versus Alex Paheda. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1509.0s)]
*  And Paheda, who beat Adesanya in the last fight, is fucking huge for 185. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1513.0s)]
*  Like, I stand next to him, like, how the fuck is this guy 15 pounds lighter than me? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1518.0s)]
*  That doesn't even make any sense. It's fucking huge. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1523.0s)]
*  He gets into the cage on fight day. He's 225. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1526.0s)]
*  It's in boxing, too. I'm a huge boxing fan. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1529.0s)]
*  Me too. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1532.0s)]
*  And I go see, I live by the garden. I go see Lomachenko. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1533.0s)]
*  Anytime he's at the garden, I go see him fight. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1536.0s)]
*  He's unreal, but it's like, he's going to fight Devin Haney. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1538.0s)]
*  That's a great fight. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1541.0s)]
*  But he's like, it's a great fight. I'm so happy it's happening. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1543.0s)]
*  I'm so excited about that. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1546.0s)]
*  At 135, but Haney, I think, cuts down from 150, 160, something like that. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1547.0s)]
*  He's walking around. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1551.0s)]
*  Loma's tiny. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1553.0s)]
*  Loma's a smaller guy. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1554.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's much smaller than those guys. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1555.0s)]
*  And you saw that in the Tiafimo Lopez fight. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1557.0s)]
*  Lopez is big. He's scary. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1560.0s)]
*  It's just that power. It's just such a big advantage for a big guy who cuts a lot of weight to get to 35. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1563.0s)]
*  But Loma won't go down. He won't go down to 130. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1569.0s)]
*  He's like, nah, I want the challenge. I think he wants the challenge. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1572.0s)]
*  A lot of these Ukraine, the Eastern Bloc guys, they want the smoke, man. They want the challenge. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1575.0s)]
*  They do, but I was a little disappointed in his perceptions of the Lopez fight after he lost. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1581.0s)]
*  He thought he won that fight. I was like, that's crazy. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1587.0s)]
*  You could see halfway through the fight, his corner must have been telling him, you're in trouble. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1590.0s)]
*  Because he picked up the pace halfway through that fight. It was too late. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1595.0s)]
*  He made adjustments and he had a big 11th round. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1601.0s)]
*  I remember in the 11th, he was really putting it on him. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1604.0s)]
*  I was like, oh man, maybe Loma's going to take this. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1606.0s)]
*  Then the 12th, Lopez came out strong. That kid had such a hard jab, too. It's such a dangerous jab to get through. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1608.0s)]
*  He came out at the beginning of the fight and established it. I remember that. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1615.0s)]
*  It's like, wow. Loma takes him two, three rounds to download what the guy's doing. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1619.0s)]
*  He's a slower starter because he's measuring him. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1625.0s)]
*  Almost to the point, you're like, what's happening? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1630.0s)]
*  If you're unskilled, I'm just a fan. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1632.0s)]
*  He does that for two or three rounds and then he's like, oh, I figured it out. Then picks it up and picks the guy apart. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1636.0s)]
*  It's too bad that he's so small. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1641.0s)]
*  If he was larger in a natural 135 or natural 140 or something like that, there's so many big fights for him. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1643.0s)]
*  It would be really exciting to see. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1650.0s)]
*  To see a guy like that, we really should be fighting 130. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1652.0s)]
*  Going up against these guys that are cutting down from 150, 155, it's just a big advantage. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1655.0s)]
*  There's a lot of guys at 135 who are very, very tough. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1660.0s)]
*  The Tank-Ryan fight. Can't wait to see that. I'm so happy that got made. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1664.0s)]
*  Yeah, me too. I'm really interested. I'm a giant Gervonta fan. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1668.0s)]
*  I think that guy is so unusual. His style is so unusual and his patience. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1673.0s)]
*  Yes. The Leo Santa Cruz fight was really something for me because Leo Santa Cruz is a technician. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1679.0s)]
*  He's great, Mexican style, but he's also a technician. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1684.0s)]
*  That fight was very close before Tank stopped him. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1688.0s)]
*  But he has that power that can end it. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1692.0s)]
*  He finds these openings and he sees them, but he doesn't go after them right away. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1695.0s)]
*  He waits for the right time. He's so patient. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1700.0s)]
*  When you watch the early rounds of his fights, he's at world champions that are competing today at the highest level. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1703.0s)]
*  He probably has the lowest punch count in the early rounds. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1709.0s)]
*  But he also knows he's got that nuclear option that if he can fucking crack you, most likely he's going to take you out. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1713.0s)]
*  He's got massive confidence in that. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1719.0s)]
*  Can you rely on that? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1721.0s)]
*  Because at the end, that Pitbull Cruz fight, that was very close. Pitbull Cruz is a tough guy, Mexican, just staying in the pocket with him. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1723.0s)]
*  It's like a Deontay Wilder thing where you're just waiting on that one punch, but you can't lose every round up to that either. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1733.0s)]
*  Right. It's interesting. You don't know whether someone's ever going to be able to figure that out or whether or not he's just going to keep cracking people. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1741.0s)]
*  It's part of the fun of watching it. I've talked to a lot of real boxing purists. You can't rely on that style. He's got to be busier. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1750.0s)]
*  When he gets to the best guys, it's not going to work out. Well, we'll see. We'll see because there's so many good guys. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1757.0s)]
*  Shakur Stevenson, Devin Paine. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1764.0s)]
*  Shakur Stevenson was a 130. I'd like to see him and Lomachenko. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1766.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1768.0s)]
*  Even the guy that Lomachenko just beat, Ortiz, which was a sparring partner years ago, he looked great. I was at that fight. He looked unreal. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1769.0s)]
*  Yeah, he looked unreal. For Lomachenko, that was a great adjustment after the Lopez fight too, right? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1777.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1781.0s)]
*  He really looked like he's coming. He apparently had some shoulder surgery too. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1782.0s)]
*  Yes, he was hurt. I think he got hurt halfway through the Tiafimo fight, to be honest. I think he hurt a hand or a shoulder. He wasn't himself. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1785.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1794.0s)]
*  Not that Tiafimo fought, unbelievably. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1795.0s)]
*  Yeah. Then you see what Kambosas did to Tiafimo. Then you see what Devin Haney did to Kambosas. Two fights in a row. Jesus Christ, there's a level. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1797.0s)]
*  He went to Australia. I think he deserves a lot of credit for that. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1806.0s)]
*  Fuck yeah. He's so good. He's so good. Him and Lomachenko is going to be very interesting. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1809.0s)]
*  It's a great fight. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1816.0s)]
*  Very, very interesting. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1817.0s)]
*  Very technical fight. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1818.0s)]
*  Yeah. There's so many good fighters now. It's a really good time for boxing. Finally, they're making the Terrence Crawford-Earls-Spence fight. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1819.0s)]
*  For June 17th, right? I'm following that like crazy. It's like they tried to do that before, so I don't get too excited. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1826.0s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1833.0s)]
*  Until they actually make it. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1834.0s)]
*  What's going on with that? That was weird. When Terrence decided to fight that other dude for his last fight, everyone was like, what the fuck? I thought you were going to fight Earls-Spence. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1835.0s)]
*  Now it's all falling apart. Luckily, they made it though. If it's signed and ready to go for June. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1844.0s)]
*  But it's not signed yet, is it? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1851.0s)]
*  I don't know. They're announcing it. They're talking about it. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1852.0s)]
*  They're announcing it. They're announcing they have plans for it. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1854.0s)]
*  Like Usyk and Tyson Fury. I thought it was a done deal. Look, it's happening. Now it gets to this point where Tyson Fury is like, I want 70%. I'm the fucking gypsy king. I want 70%. Usyk's like, okay, 70%. It still fell apart. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1857.0s)]
*  He offered him 70-30. I didn't think that Usyk... No one thought Usyk was going to take that. He goes, no, I'll take it. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1874.0s)]
*  He wants to win. He wants to fight. He wants the legacy. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1881.0s)]
*  Unreal. I mean, yeah, Tyson is more of a draw. So I understand that. But Usyk has three belts. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1884.0s)]
*  Yeah, but Tyson's more of a draw. Like if you can do 70-30 and you'll still make a shit ton of money. I mean, that's a fucking big fight. That's a worldwide, gigantic, you know, $200 million fight. So he'll make 30% of that. Fine. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1889.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I think the sticking point was the rematch clause. Tyson wanted 50-50 on the rematch clause. So you lose the fight and then the rematch clause is 50-50. You don't have any belts. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1904.0s)]
*  I would take it. I think it's still worth it because the name... It's like what brings asses in seats, right? It's the name. If they have the rematch and Usyk instead decides to fight, you know, whether it's Wilder or whoever, it's not going to be as big a fight. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1914.0s)]
*  It's not going to be as big a fight, Anthony Joshua. It's not going to be as big a fight. The big fight is Tyson Fury. I think that's reasonable. 70-30, if you could beat me, 50-50. I think it's reasonable. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1930.0s)]
*  Yeah, but after the 70-30, you're going, all right, you're pushing me. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1940.0s)]
*  But he's the gypsy king. He's the fucking... [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1945.0s)]
*  No, I know he's a huge draw. I know he's a huge draw. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1947.0s)]
*  He's the biggest fucking draw in heavyweight boxing. And he might be the best heavyweight ever. He's a fucking freak of nature. I mean, he really is. And he's such a personality. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1949.0s)]
*  Yeah, he sings that song after the... He sings after the fight. I'm like, this is pretty good. The song is pretty good. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1958.0s)]
*  Buy a Miss American pie. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1964.0s)]
*  It's unbelievable. Yeah, he's like an entertainer. That's like Pacquiao. Pacquiao used to fight. He used to go out and do karaoke after the fights. It's like, that's bananas. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1965.0s)]
*  You know, Manny Pacquiao is like a professional level pool player. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1973.0s)]
*  Is he really? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1976.0s)]
*  Yeah, like really good. Like if he decided to stop fighting and never box again, he can compete as a professional pool player. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1977.0s)]
*  That's nuts. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1984.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's really good, man. I've watched him play. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1985.0s)]
*  I'd watch him and Mayweather do like one-on-one basketball. Because they both like play basketball, you know, like in their spare time. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1988.0s)]
*  Because it's so competitive. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1995.0s)]
*  So competitive. Mayweather's unbelievable. I mean, watching him fight. And some people don't get it. They just like... I had a friend and he was like, he's boring. No knockouts. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=1996.0s)]
*  I go, but he's a top level guy, multiple time world champion. And he's dismantling other multiple time world champions. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2006.0s)]
*  And not getting hit. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2014.0s)]
*  Yeah. Is there anything there? Yeah, I don't know. I go, it's just, he's boring. I don't like him. I go, okay, maybe is it possible that you don't know what you're watching? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2015.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2027.0s)]
*  Maybe. Is it, could it be that? I don't know. I like knockouts. I go, then you should watch Butterbean. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2028.0s)]
*  And he goes, yeah, I like Butterbean. I go, good. Watch Butterbean. And is it being like a five-year-old argument? Good. I will. I go, you should. I will. Good. Good. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2035.0s)]
*  It ends up being that. You know what I mean? But for him to like just have that run is dismantling guys. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2045.0s)]
*  You're always going to have casuals like that. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2051.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2054.0s)]
*  In every sport, in MMA, that's a big thing. People only like knockouts. They boo and fights go to the ground. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2055.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2060.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2061.0s)]
*  But is there a thing in MMA where it's like, are they calling stalemates faster? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2062.0s)]
*  You mean getting people back up? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2065.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like if the guy's on top and he's not making progress or the guy on bottom isn't getting a wrist or working towards submission, will they stop them and stand them up faster? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2067.0s)]
*  I think that's better for the sport. In wrestling, they'll hit guys with stalling quick to keep the action moving. I know that's not a thing in MMA, but it does help the optics of it. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2078.0s)]
*  It used to be in Pride, they would give them a yellow card and it would take 10% of your purse. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2088.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2092.0s)]
*  So if you got a yellow card in Pride, that meant you weren't trying to win or you were stalling. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2093.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2097.0s)]
*  And if the referee pulled that yellow card out, people were fucking freaking out. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2098.0s)]
*  Like, you know, if you're getting paid a million dollars, $100,000 is now gone for that yellow card. You're like, fuck. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2101.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2107.0s)]
*  And that's a big deal. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2108.0s)]
*  Is it a warning first? They give a warning before they put the yellow card? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2109.0s)]
*  I think it was up to the referee's discretion in Pride. I don't remember exactly how they did it, but when they did it, it was a big fucking deal and the crowd would cheer and then the guy would adjust accordingly. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2113.0s)]
*  Because if you got two yellow cards, you're fucked. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2123.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2125.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't even know if they gave two yellow cards. I don't remember that ever happening. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2126.0s)]
*  I'm sure it did, but I don't remember it ever happening in a fight. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2130.0s)]
*  But in MMA, the controversy is about whether or not you should stand someone up because you have five minutes. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2133.0s)]
*  And if someone takes someone down and they're on top of them, it's up to the person who's on the bottom to get back up. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2140.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2146.0s)]
*  Like that, that's your job. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2147.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2148.0s)]
*  And the guy on top, it's up to him to hold you down. I don't believe in standups. It might be more entertaining for the audience. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2149.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2154.0s)]
*  But I'm a purist in terms of like, I think you should control your own destiny in there. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2155.0s)]
*  And if a guy can hold you down and just punch you in the face while you're on the, even if it's boring. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2160.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2165.0s)]
*  He's doing what he wants to do. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2166.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2167.0s)]
*  And you can't do anything about that. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2168.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2169.0s)]
*  That means he's winning. And I think that any interference of that is against the purity of the sport. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2170.0s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2175.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I do understand that it could be boring if a guy can hold a guy down and control them. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2176.0s)]
*  Not so much boring, but is the guy on top initiating action? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2181.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2186.0s)]
*  I think that's the key. Is he initiating action? Is he trying to win the, is he advancing his position in wrestling? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2187.0s)]
*  It's advancing your position. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2191.0s)]
*  Yes. It is an enemy too. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2192.0s)]
*  But punching in the face is advancing, it's a way of advancing your position in terms of winning the fight. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2193.0s)]
*  Yeah. But it's open to interpretation. Like say if like he's inside control and he's only occasionally hammer fisting the guy. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2198.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2204.0s)]
*  But the guy's in no danger of being stopped. There's an argument that that's stalling. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2205.0s)]
*  But I don't buy that argument because it's only a five minute round. And for a grappler, it's really hard to take someone down. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2209.0s)]
*  Like you're dealing with kicks and knees and punches and you're trying to find the opening and then you level change. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2215.0s)]
*  You get the shot, maybe you switch from a double to a single. You know, you run the pipe, you get the guy on the ground. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2220.0s)]
*  All that took a minute and a half. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2226.0s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2227.0s)]
*  And if you're holding the guy down and then the referee comes like keep moving, action, you know, like advance your position. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2228.0s)]
*  And then they stand him back up. But what the fuck is that? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2235.0s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2237.0s)]
*  If you couldn't get up, if it was no one here to stop that, if this was just a fight out in a field somewhere, that guy on top controls the fight. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2238.0s)]
*  He does what the fuck he wants to do. And if that guy gets tired, eventually he'll move to mount and just start beating the fuck out of him. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2247.0s)]
*  But it's important that his skill set is expressed. His skill set is his ability to control the guy. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2254.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2260.0s)]
*  And if you're on the bottom and you can't get back up, I don't care if it's boring, tough shit. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2261.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2265.0s)]
*  You gotta get back up. And if you can't get back up, that guy wins. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2266.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2268.0s)]
*  Even if he wins a boring ass fight where he just takes you down and gives you noogies for five rounds, it's tough shit. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2269.0s)]
*  You gotta figure out how to not get taken down or get back up or submit him off your back or find some kind of scramble or you can get on top. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2274.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2281.0s)]
*  And if you can't do that, then you lose because that's what the fight's all about. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2282.0s)]
*  And of course, in terms of like the people that go to pay, they are going to pay more to see the exciting people. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2285.0s)]
*  The Conor McGregors, the John Joneses, the people that stop people and finish people. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2292.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2295.0s)]
*  And they're the big draws. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2296.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2297.0s)]
*  But if you can Ben Askren your way to a career and Ben did it for a long time. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2298.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2301.0s)]
*  We just took guys down and fucking noogied them into a coma. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2302.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2304.0s)]
*  Like tough shit. That's my feeling. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2305.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2306.0s)]
*  I don't like stand ups. I'd hate them. I wouldn't especially like sometimes they'll stand someone up from a dominant position. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2307.0s)]
*  Like someone will get to side control and the referee will stand them up and I'm just going, what the fuck are you doing? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2313.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2318.0s)]
*  It's so hard to get there. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2319.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2320.0s)]
*  You've got five minutes to work and you got to think it probably took a minute or so to get the guy down. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2321.0s)]
*  Yeah. Not just a minute or so, but it is a lot of energy. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2325.0s)]
*  A lot of energy. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2328.0s)]
*  You're a lot of energy to take a guy down. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2329.0s)]
*  And then if you get taken out of that and stood back up again, now you're tired and this guy, his striking is probably a strong suit. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2330.0s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2339.0s)]
*  And now you're in his realm and you expended all this energy and it's taken away from you by a bad referee. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2340.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2346.0s)]
*  I fucking hate it. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2347.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2348.0s)]
*  I think it's dumb. I think it should be eliminated. I really do. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2349.0s)]
*  I don't like it at all. I don't think there's ever a time that they should stand people up. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2350.0s)]
*  I don't think there's ever a time they should separate someone if they got someone pressed up against the cage and their knee in them and the body and elbow in them. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2354.0s)]
*  Sometimes referees will decide there's not enough action and they separate them. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2360.0s)]
*  I hate that too. I don't believe in any of it. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2363.0s)]
*  I don't think you should do anything to make it more exciting for the casuals. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2365.0s)]
*  Not really. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2369.0s)]
*  Zero. Yeah, because the best guys are always going to be exciting. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2370.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2373.0s)]
*  It's just you're going to have, it's just like everybody's like, I want blood all the time. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2374.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2378.0s)]
*  You don't always get blood. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2379.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2380.0s)]
*  Action movies aren't always action. Sometimes the hero and the woman kiss. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2381.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. That's right. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2384.0s)]
*  That's how it is. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2386.0s)]
*  But that's why Dana stacks the cards in case you have a fight that's not as exciting. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2387.0s)]
*  Well, they're very, I mean, it's obviously they're different than me because they're promoters and they're selling a product. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2395.0s)]
*  I'm a martial artist. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2400.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2401.0s)]
*  And so what I want to see is someone compete to the full ability, the full extent of their abilities. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2402.0s)]
*  And something that gets in the way of that is standups. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2407.0s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2409.0s)]
*  But I'm not, it's not like a universal opinion. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2410.0s)]
*  Most people don't agree with me. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2414.0s)]
*  A lot of people don't agree with me. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2415.0s)]
*  Right, because they're casuals. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2417.0s)]
*  Not even casuals. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2418.0s)]
*  They're not understanding the technical. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2419.0s)]
*  Even fans. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2420.0s)]
*  The technical aspect of what you just said. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2421.0s)]
*  Yeah, but even. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2423.0s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2424.0s)]
*  Yeah, even hardcore, there's a lot of hardcore fans that don't agree with me. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2425.0s)]
*  They say, no, no, no, you can't just hold the guy down. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2428.0s)]
*  You got to advance position. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2430.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2432.0s)]
*  Okay, why? Tell me why. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2433.0s)]
*  Because the guy wants to win. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2434.0s)]
*  And if he could just win by taking guys down and if the audience booze and he doesn't get popular because of it, okay. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2435.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2441.0s)]
*  So what? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2442.0s)]
*  Willie Pepp won fights without throwing a punch. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2443.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2444.0s)]
*  He won a whole round once without throwing a punch. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2445.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2447.0s)]
*  Just moving and dancing. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2448.0s)]
*  It was so masterful. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2449.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2450.0s)]
*  That people had to agree. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2451.0s)]
*  It's like, what do you want them to do? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2452.0s)]
*  Just a Turogati and fucking just stand right in front of them and just throw bombs like Mickey Ward. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2453.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2458.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2459.0s)]
*  Sometimes it's fun. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2460.0s)]
*  That's unreal. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2461.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2462.0s)]
*  And then the Turogati fought Floyd Melvin. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2463.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2464.0s)]
*  Like that shit didn't work. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2465.0s)]
*  No. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2466.0s)]
*  Against a master. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2467.0s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2468.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2469.0s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2470.0s)]
*  It was great. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2471.0s)]
*  Diego Corrales versus Julia Luiz Castillo. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2472.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2473.0s)]
*  That fight was crazy. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2474.0s)]
*  I mean, I love the Godi Ward fights, but that fight for me is the greatest fight in history [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2475.0s)]
*  that I've seen in the modern era. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2481.56s)]
*  Because he came back? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2483.36s)]
*  It just, the first 10, they're just, you expected Diego because of his reach to keep him on [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2484.36s)]
*  the outside and he didn't. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2488.84s)]
*  He just stood in a phone booth with them and they just traded. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2491.8s)]
*  And it was as the round, like you're like, oh my God, this, can this continue? [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2494.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2498.2400000000002s)]
*  They're just in a phone booth and just at a high, high skill level working on the inside, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2499.2400000000002s)]
*  both of them and just trading brutal shots and nobody taking a step backwards. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2506.1600000000003s)]
*  And it was unreal. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2510.52s)]
*  And then the 10th round where he gets knocked down and Goose and he spits the mouthpiece [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2511.52s)]
*  out, Goose and puts it back in. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2515.88s)]
*  And then, and then he stops. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2517.94s)]
*  I mean, it was just insane. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2520.5600000000004s)]
*  I think they play that. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2522.28s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2524.32s)]
*  I think they play that at corporate retreats. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2525.32s)]
*  They play round 10 of that. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2528.2400000000002s)]
*  They should play the whole fight, but they play round 10 of that fight in corporate retreats [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2529.84s)]
*  to be like, just never give up. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2536.52s)]
*  You never give up. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2539.2000000000003s)]
*  Sometimes you should give up. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2540.2000000000003s)]
*  That round 10, I mean, it's almost like it's what it's like watching a Rocky movie. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2545.2400000000002s)]
*  It's emotional to watch. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2549.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2552.12s)]
*  It was an incredible fight. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2553.12s)]
*  And look at his eye. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2554.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2555.12s)]
*  It was an incredible fight. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2556.12s)]
*  And he was in real trouble multiple times in that fight. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2557.12s)]
*  When he got dropped, I mean, there's several times where it looked like the end. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2560.52s)]
*  Look at that left hook. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2563.6s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2564.6s)]
*  I mean, did you see the Caleb plant, Benavides fight last weekend? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2565.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2569.92s)]
*  Fucking, hey man. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2570.92s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2571.92s)]
*  And that's a good stoppage. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2572.92s)]
*  That's a good stoppage too. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2573.92s)]
*  He looked like he was out on his feet. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2575.4s)]
*  You could make an argument that Corrales could have got stopped earlier than that. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2577.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2580.2s)]
*  I mean, it's one of those things. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2581.2s)]
*  It's very subjective. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2582.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2583.2s)]
*  Referees have stopped fights for way less before. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2584.2s)]
*  Well, the Fury-Deontay Wilder fight where he's down and he opens his eyes. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2585.64s)]
*  The famous, he opens his eyes and gets back up. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2590.44s)]
*  Jack Reese is the ref, I think. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2593.4s)]
*  And Deontay's camp was complaining that he wasn't counting whatever, but it's like Jack [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2596.32s)]
*  Reese is great. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2600.16s)]
*  He's a great ref. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2601.16s)]
*  He always gives the guy the opportunity. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2602.24s)]
*  He's like, I'm going to count to 10. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2603.52s)]
*  He gives the opportunity for the guy to get up. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2604.52s)]
*  Just you never thought Fury was getting up. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2606.56s)]
*  No way. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2608.56s)]
*  His eyes were closed on the ground. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2609.56s)]
*  He's laying on his back with his arms above his head like he's just flatlined. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2611.56s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2615.96s)]
*  And then he rises and wins the rest of the round, which is crazy. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2616.96s)]
*  And that win for the rest of the round made the blueprint for the second fight because [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2620.12s)]
*  he realized like Wilder has a hard time when people put him on his heels. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2624.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2627.52s)]
*  When people back him up. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2628.52s)]
*  And so then he came out the second fight just backing him up and stopped him. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2629.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2631.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2632.88s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2633.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2634.88s)]
*  He's flailed to the side. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2636.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2637.36s)]
*  His eyes are rolled back. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2638.36s)]
*  And he looks like he's done. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2639.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2642.6800000000003s)]
*  He really does. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2643.6800000000003s)]
*  And he looks at the referee. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2644.6800000000003s)]
*  The referee's counting. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2645.6800000000003s)]
*  He goes, okay, back to work. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2646.6800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2647.6800000000003s)]
*  And I was watching at home. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2648.6800000000003s)]
*  I remember screaming, oh my God. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2649.6800000000003s)]
*  I was by myself screaming, oh my God. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2651.6800000000003s)]
*  And then he got back up. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2655.8s)]
*  I was like, wait, no way. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2656.8s)]
*  No way. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2658.6s)]
*  And he's like, I'm fine. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2659.84s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2661.36s)]
*  And the referee says, okay, walk to here. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2662.36s)]
*  That's great. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2664.08s)]
*  And he does this fucking shot too. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2665.2799999999997s)]
*  My God. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2666.2799999999997s)]
*  And the right hand before it too. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2667.2799999999997s)]
*  So he cracks him with the right hand. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2669.24s)]
*  Boom. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2671.04s)]
*  And nobody punches harder than Deontay Wilder. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2672.04s)]
*  He's unreal. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2674.04s)]
*  He's got the touch of God in his hands. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2675.04s)]
*  I mean, those two, I didn't see the first, those two punches are unbelievable. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2676.04s)]
*  And look, Wilder's 100% convinced as he walks off that it's over. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2680.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2683.68s)]
*  And he makes the throat cut thing. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2684.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2685.88s)]
*  He does a little dance. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2686.88s)]
*  And then you see the look in his eyes when Tyson gets up. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2687.88s)]
*  He's like, oh shit. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2690.24s)]
*  How? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2691.96s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2692.96s)]
*  He does the throat cut thing. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2693.96s)]
*  I mean, nobody on earth other than Tyson Fury is getting up there. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2695.84s)]
*  Which is so crazy. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2700.0s)]
*  Deontay Wilder is the greatest knockout artist in the history of the heavyweight division. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2701.0s)]
*  There's no one that's had one punch knockouts like that guy. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2705.36s)]
*  The Louis Ortiz fight just catches him on the forehead. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2708.68s)]
*  And was losing. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2711.48s)]
*  Was losing every round. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2712.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2713.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2714.48s)]
*  I mean, and then you see Deontay is like, I can't believe this motherfucker is still [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2715.48s)]
*  up. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2719.16s)]
*  And then there's also like an emotional thing that happened. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2720.16s)]
*  Look at the wildest of Deontay. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2722.96s)]
*  To be able to survive that. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2725.4s)]
*  First of all, I mean, I have a huge respect for mental toughness. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2727.2s)]
*  And the mental toughness it took, it takes to get up. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2730.36s)]
*  And then, and then you know the guy who just did that to you is waiting on the other side [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2733.2s)]
*  of the ring to come and do it again. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2738.76s)]
*  And then he moves forward. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2740.88s)]
*  He survives the initial barrage and then he starts moving forward. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2742.48s)]
*  Then he dings Deontay. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2745.4s)]
*  And you see Deontay got rocked in one important time. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2746.4s)]
*  And he starts pushing him back. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2749.28s)]
*  Oh my god, he won the rest of the round. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2751.08s)]
*  Like he literally made it like a 9-9 round. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2753.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2756.48s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2757.48s)]
*  I love that. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2758.48s)]
*  But I love the fortitude that it takes in that moment to composure. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2759.48s)]
*  First of all, the mental toughness to get up. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2763.0s)]
*  And then the fortitude. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2764.84s)]
*  All of these intangibles. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2766.36s)]
*  Like I'm a boxing guy, but it's all of these underlying things which makes me love the [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2767.36s)]
*  sport. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2771.28s)]
*  You know, the composure that it takes. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2772.28s)]
*  You know, it's just, it's really unbelievable. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2774.72s)]
*  That's why I love the sport so much. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2777.12s)]
*  Well, you're not a casual. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2778.52s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2780.12s)]
*  He's dancing. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2781.56s)]
*  He thought it was... [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2782.56s)]
*  Now walk through, look at his face when he sees Tyson get up. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2783.56s)]
*  They start counting and he's like, this fight is fucking over. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2787.2s)]
*  I don't know if they're going to show it here, but there's a look where you see Deontay's [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2791.12s)]
*  face. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2794.12s)]
*  Right there, he's like, oh shit. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2795.12s)]
*  I don't believe this. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2796.44s)]
*  Let me start breathing differently. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2798.04s)]
*  Let me start breathing differently because I got to go finish the job here. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2799.64s)]
*  And then he gets up and Deontay, I'm sure, thought he was going to put him away. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2803.56s)]
*  He puts everybody away. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2807.0s)]
*  But they're talking now about Deontay versus, I think they're talking about Andy Ruiz. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2808.8s)]
*  That's a great one too. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2813.76s)]
*  That's a great one. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2815.24s)]
*  But they might be also talking about Deontay and Usyk because I think Usyk is open now. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2816.24s)]
*  I just hope they put that fight together. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2822.08s)]
*  Just figure it out, boys. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2824.36s)]
*  That's the fight. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2826.0s)]
*  The fight's Tyson Fury and Usyk. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2827.0s)]
*  It's the undisputed World Heavyweight Championship. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2828.72s)]
*  Deontay, while they're training as promoter, cancels another Vegas date. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2831.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2835.56s)]
*  So Andy Ruiz Jr. potentially is now canceled. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2836.56s)]
*  See, that's the thing that boxing does that drives me nuts. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2839.2799999999997s)]
*  They set these fights up, they get your dick hard, and then they pull them away from you [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2842.32s)]
*  like fucking Lucy with this football. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2846.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2848.96s)]
*  That's right. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2849.96s)]
*  That's right. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2850.96s)]
*  But I think the thing is, like the Crawford Spence date, it's like we're floating the [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2851.96s)]
*  date of June 17th. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2855.7599999999998s)]
*  It's like, all right, because that gets everybody's hopes up for it. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2857.4s)]
*  And then they go, well, now we got to negotiate. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2861.2799999999997s)]
*  We got to come to the table. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2863.04s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, how's that going to go? [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2864.68s)]
*  It didn't go well last time. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2867.16s)]
*  And as a result, Terrence, I think, just got frustrated with the negotiations. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2869.3199999999997s)]
*  He's like, I'm just going to fight somebody. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2872.72s)]
*  You don't think I'm, I'll walk away. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2873.96s)]
*  I'll go fight somebody else. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2875.48s)]
*  He's saying he's April Fools because they reported on April 1st. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2876.96s)]
*  Is that what they're saying? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2879.7599999999998s)]
*  I was trying to figure it out too. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2880.7599999999998s)]
*  This is the best I could get was that he, last he said is, it's April Fools. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2882.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, what does that mean? [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2886.56s)]
*  So they announced April 22nd during Javante Davis. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2888.12s)]
*  Oh, so it will be announced. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2891.2799999999997s)]
*  So they're hoping it will be announced. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2893.4s)]
*  If Crawford isn't playing around, it will disappoint many fans who want to see him fight [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2894.6800000000003s)]
*  Spence. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2897.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's the big fight at Walterweight. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2898.44s)]
*  That's a big fight. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2900.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2901.32s)]
*  But I think if they don't make the fight, then they have to fight, like, they have to [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2902.32s)]
*  fight the number one contender then. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2906.28s)]
*  There's Virgil Ortiz at 147, there's Boots Ennis, who's a guy who's unreal. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2908.0s)]
*  Boots Ennis is amazing. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2911.44s)]
*  Okay, so you got to fight that. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2912.44s)]
*  Why are the mandatories not being forced, is my question. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2915.04s)]
*  I think it's just money. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2918.0s)]
*  They're just trying to make the biggest fights possible. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2919.0s)]
*  Well, the problem is that you have these individual promoters and you have these, there's too [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2920.56s)]
*  many IBF, WBC, these sanctioning organizations. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2923.88s)]
*  And it's like, you have to force, you have to force these fights. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2927.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2931.2400000000002s)]
*  You can't, I understand that ticket sales and all that stuff is important, but if you [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2932.2400000000002s)]
*  want to maintain your integrity as a sport, you have to, you have to force these fights. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2935.08s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2939.96s)]
*  Boots Ennis should not be sitting there as the number one contender for five years. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2940.96s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2944.28s)]
*  Good point. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2945.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2946.28s)]
*  And also the world needs to know how good Boots Ennis is. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2947.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2949.28s)]
*  I mean, I think I fight and switch stances. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2951.0800000000004s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2952.0800000000004s)]
*  And ooh, he's such an artist in there. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2953.0800000000004s)]
*  He's so exciting. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2954.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2955.7200000000003s)]
*  And hopefully people will catch on, but you do run the risk of a guy like that not being [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2956.7200000000003s)]
*  recognized because he's in this sort of weird situation where other people are getting shots [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2961.52s)]
*  and he doesn't. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2965.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2966.78s)]
*  But it's a weird situation because I think Teddy Atlas has said this on multiple occasions, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2967.78s)]
*  it's structured badly. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2971.46s)]
*  The sport is structured badly. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2972.46s)]
*  Whereas in UFC, it's Dana making the decisions. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2975.0s)]
*  And you need that. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2978.6800000000003s)]
*  You need a guy at the top going, no, this is going to happen. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2980.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2983.08s)]
*  And if you don't want it to happen, or if a guy's having personal problems like John [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2984.08s)]
*  Jones or whatever that was, like, okay, I mean, you're still a legend and you will get [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2987.52s)]
*  the shot when you're ready to come back. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2991.3999999999996s)]
*  But the show goes on. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2994.2s)]
*  Tom Brady, you know, gets hurt, rips his knee, football doesn't stop. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=2995.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3000.8799999999997s)]
*  You know? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3001.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3002.8799999999997s)]
*  There's a great advantage that the UFC has in being the promoter. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3003.8799999999997s)]
*  And so it's the organization, it's the sanctioning body, and it's also the promoter. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3006.68s)]
*  But it does take away leverage from the fighters. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3010.22s)]
*  Like, you can't say, I want 70-30. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3012.74s)]
*  You can't say, like, the way that boxing is, there's too many promoters and there's too [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3015.2599999999998s)]
*  many world titles. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3019.94s)]
*  But the opposite is the UFC where it's like, there's really only one title that means something. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3021.3199999999997s)]
*  There's Bellator titles and 1FC titles, but what everybody wants to be is the UFC champion [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3026.3999999999996s)]
*  of the world. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3032.74s)]
*  That's what everybody wants to be. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3033.74s)]
*  Everybody. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3034.74s)]
*  Everybody says, I'd rather be the Bellator champion. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3036.2999999999997s)]
*  No disrespect to Bellator. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3037.8999999999996s)]
*  But the reality is, that's not the same. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3039.4199999999996s)]
*  And the real reality is, there's fighters in Bellator that are world championship UFC [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3042.9799999999996s)]
*  caliber fighters. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3047.74s)]
*  And they might not ever get their due. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3049.5s)]
*  And they might lose their competitive prime competing against other people in an organization [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3051.9799999999996s)]
*  where less people are going to watch, and maybe even more importantly, less people are [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3057.06s)]
*  going to respect. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3060.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3061.74s)]
*  But in boxing, you know, you can't fight once a year. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3063.74s)]
*  You can't fight once every 18 months and expect me to still be interested in what you're doing. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3068.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3072.3799999999997s)]
*  Like, you have to fight more. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3073.3799999999997s)]
*  You have to fight, like, three, to Canelo's credit, three, four times a year. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3074.3799999999997s)]
*  I understand these camps are like 12 weeks now, and that's brutal. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3079.8199999999997s)]
*  It's brutal, the preparation. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3083.9799999999996s)]
*  But you know, three, four times a year. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3085.54s)]
*  I mean, if you're fighting every two years, it's like, it holds up the division. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3088.54s)]
*  And it's, you know, it's less competition. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3093.5s)]
*  It does. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3095.58s)]
*  And there's so many big fights. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3096.58s)]
*  The Canelo thing is very interesting, right? [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3097.58s)]
*  Because he loses to Beval, and then he comes back and beats Triple G and looks pretty good. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3099.58s)]
*  But then he had to get wrist surgery. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3103.58s)]
*  And you know, then you see what Benavidez did to Plant. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3105.7799999999997s)]
*  Like, Benavidez beat the fuck out of Caleb Plant. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3107.98s)]
*  And how tough is Caleb Plant? [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3111.02s)]
*  Caleb Plant is so tough, and he's a very, very skilled guy. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3112.66s)]
*  Damn, he's tough. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3115.2599999999998s)]
*  He's so skilled guy. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3116.2599999999998s)]
*  He's an Olympian. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3117.38s)]
*  You know, he's an Olympian. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3118.38s)]
*  So very skilled guy. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3119.38s)]
*  And for David to do that, it was really impressive. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3120.38s)]
*  He's a murderous buncher, man. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3122.98s)]
*  But Caleb has a fucking chin on him, man. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3124.5800000000004s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3127.2200000000003s)]
*  He stayed in it and refused to get knocked out and really tried to win the fight. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3128.2200000000003s)]
*  Battered. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3131.38s)]
*  I mean, he got fucking battered. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3132.38s)]
*  I'm super impressed with Benavidez. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3133.38s)]
*  That was a big test for him. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3136.6600000000003s)]
*  And Caleb in the beginning was very slick. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3137.78s)]
*  But Benavidez just kept pressing and putting on him and towards the latter half of the fight. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3140.26s)]
*  It's traditionally been a problem with Caleb that he starts to fade in the later rounds. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3144.58s)]
*  It's so much energy to keep a guy like that off you, I think. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3149.02s)]
*  You gotta have power to keep a guy like that off you. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3151.82s)]
*  Because that guy has a, Benavidez has a, and many guys like to have a suffocating style. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3153.82s)]
*  You can hit him. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3159.1s)]
*  And that does something to you mentally, I think. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3160.1800000000003s)]
*  Where you hit a guy twice, you hit him with your best stuff, and he just walks, he's walking [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3162.42s)]
*  through it. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3166.42s)]
*  Walking forward, walking you down. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3167.78s)]
*  It's like, all right, I guess this is gonna be, I'm gonna have to move. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3169.1s)]
*  It's a tremendous amount of energy. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3175.1000000000004s)]
*  I feel like, I wonder if Caleb could do something about his strength and conditioning that takes [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3176.1000000000004s)]
*  it to another level. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3180.78s)]
*  Because I feel like if he could maintain the kind of pace that he has in the early rounds [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3181.78s)]
*  of the Canelo fight, the early rounds of the Benavidez fight, if he can do that, like man, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3186.28s)]
*  it's gonna be really hard for people to fuck with him. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3190.78s)]
*  But he has a mark, there's a noticeable slowing down that happens. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3194.0200000000004s)]
*  I wonder if that's psychological. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3199.6600000000003s)]
*  I don't know how you would mimic that pressure. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3200.6600000000003s)]
*  Like, I've never been in a fight camp before, so I don't know how you would mimic that pressure [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3203.86s)]
*  in sparring. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3207.06s)]
*  I think it would have to be in strength and conditioning. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3209.2999999999997s)]
*  I think you would have to all out dedicate yourself to taking your VO2 max to a completely [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3212.66s)]
*  new level. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3218.4s)]
*  And you would have to really dedicate yourself in that regard to just absolutely annihilating [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3219.74s)]
*  your boundaries and pushing your strength and conditioning to the point where you can [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3226.6s)]
*  get... [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3229.92s)]
*  There was this guy, BJ Penn, who's one of the greatest MMA fighters of all time. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3231.78s)]
*  And there's one point in time where BJ Penn, he started training with Marv Marinovich. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3235.44s)]
*  And Marv Marinovich was a fucking... [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3240.6s)]
*  The Marinoviches, they had a style of training where they believed that you already have [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3244.44s)]
*  the skill. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3252.44s)]
*  And what's more important than anything is cardio. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3253.66s)]
*  And so they would do just ruthless plyometrics. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3256.36s)]
*  That was the entire camp for whatever amount of weeks that you're doing it. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3260.92s)]
*  Most of your time was dedicated to strength and conditioning. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3266.34s)]
*  And it was very systematic and it was very scientific. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3269.38s)]
*  Checking your resting heart rate, your heart rate variability, monitoring your recovery, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3273.94s)]
*  and making sure you're getting the right nutrients and rest and rehydration and all that stuff. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3279.82s)]
*  But the most important thing was the gas tank. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3284.64s)]
*  Because you already know how to fight. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3287.1800000000003s)]
*  And what happens in fights, you still know how to fight, but your gas tank starts to [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3289.3s)]
*  fail. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3292.1s)]
*  And so when BJ Penn was at his prime in like the... [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3293.1s)]
*  If you look at, there's a bunch of different fights like Diego Sanchez, Sean Shirk, where [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3298.2000000000003s)]
*  he was just destroying these guys. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3302.44s)]
*  He had an limitless gas tank. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3304.4s)]
*  And he had this incredible skill set that he already had. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3307.1600000000003s)]
*  And there's a good argument for that, that at a certain level, what's most important [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3310.1800000000003s)]
*  is cardio. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3314.34s)]
*  So there's several schools of thought when it comes to that. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3315.34s)]
*  But even with the plyometric and strength, you have to mimic that in sparring. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3319.2000000000003s)]
*  You have to mimic that in training so that you can utilize it. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3324.5600000000004s)]
*  Well, they did all that too. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3327.28s)]
*  I mean, it wasn't like you only did strength and conditioning, but strength and conditioning [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3328.52s)]
*  was primary. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3332.76s)]
*  But what's that look like? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3333.76s)]
*  Is that like a shark bait type situation? [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3334.92s)]
*  We call it in wrestling, shark bait, where one guy in the middle and they just keep sending [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3336.6400000000003s)]
*  you fresh guys. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3340.0400000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3341.0400000000004s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3342.0400000000004s)]
*  They certainly did that. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3343.0400000000004s)]
*  Honestly, most of it was work like plyos, box jumps, all these different things where [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3344.8s)]
*  you just had your ability to work. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3350.08s)]
*  It was all about your cardio, all about your ability to constantly work. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3353.36s)]
*  And you already had efficiency in your striking and your grappling, all these different things. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3358.48s)]
*  And so you would do drills for those things. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3362.96s)]
*  So you keep all your weapons sharp. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3365.24s)]
*  But the primary focus was strength and conditioning. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3367.86s)]
*  I'm always intrigued by that because it's the most brutal way to do it. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3370.62s)]
*  It's so hard to stay motivated because sparring is fun. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3374.62s)]
*  If you're in there sparring, there's something exciting about it. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3378.02s)]
*  There is nothing fun about box jumps. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3381.34s)]
*  There's nothing fun about running hills. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3383.98s)]
*  Box jumps and running hills till fail. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3386.98s)]
*  Till fail is the key there because everybody thinks, oh, it's like, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3390.5s)]
*  It's like the goal is to throw up. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3394.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3397.94s)]
*  The goal is to break your body. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3398.94s)]
*  And then have it right there where it's broken and then recover. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3399.98s)]
*  And then get yourself right back there again and recover. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3403.9s)]
*  And now all of a sudden your threshold bumps up a little more. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3406.52s)]
*  And so now you can go an extra round. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3409.46s)]
*  Now you can go an extra minute. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3411.28s)]
*  Now you can go an extra minute 30. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3412.28s)]
*  Now you're really pushing it. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3414.14s)]
*  And now you're seeing these things that used to kill you. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3416.1s)]
*  Now you can get through them. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3419.66s)]
*  And at the end you're recovering quicker. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3420.94s)]
*  And that's the idea. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3423.18s)]
*  And I wonder if a guy like Caleb Plant, if you could get him to an insane level of cardio [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3424.2999999999997s)]
*  where he could compete at that pace that he does in the early fight, because in the early [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3430.06s)]
*  part of the fight, that guy is slick. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3434.8999999999996s)]
*  He's so slick. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3437.3399999999997s)]
*  Very slick guy. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3438.3399999999997s)]
*  And he's moving nice. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3439.3399999999997s)]
*  But then he starts standing in front of Benavidez. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3440.8599999999997s)]
*  And then Benavidez is, he's so accurate. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3443.46s)]
*  And he gets his punches around your guard and up the front and uppercuts and jabs. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3446.46s)]
*  I love his style. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3453.8599999999997s)]
*  He throws punches in bunches too. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3454.8599999999997s)]
*  He's not throwing one punch. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3456.06s)]
*  No, smothers you. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3457.06s)]
*  Stays on you. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3459.74s)]
*  And he's a brutal puncher too. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3460.74s)]
*  And at the end of the fight, he didn't even have a scratch on him. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3462.2999999999997s)]
*  No he didn't. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3464.2599999999998s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3465.2599999999998s)]
*  Caleb looked like he'd been through a meat grinder. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3466.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's really something. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3467.2599999999998s)]
*  So I think that's the fight at 168. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3469.14s)]
*  Yeah I think so too. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3470.98s)]
*  With Benavidez Canelo. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3471.98s)]
*  But everybody's calling for that Bival Canelo rematch. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3472.98s)]
*  And I just don't see it. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3475.94s)]
*  I think we saw it. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3479.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3480.7799999999997s)]
*  After these fights, I think we saw it. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3481.9s)]
*  We don't need a trilogy. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3483.5400000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3484.5400000000004s)]
*  I think we saw it. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3485.5400000000004s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3486.5400000000004s)]
*  But when you've got a champion like Canelo, he thinks he can do it better. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3487.5400000000004s)]
*  And he thinks he's like, okay, I understand what he did. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3491.2200000000003s)]
*  And maybe he knew coming into that fight. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3494.46s)]
*  Because he did have a wrist problem that he had in the GGG fight too. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3496.26s)]
*  So he probably had that problem already. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3500.02s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3502.94s)]
*  But I think for Bival, the big fight is better be of. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3503.94s)]
*  Arthur better be of is a fucking monster. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3508.1000000000004s)]
*  I saw him fight at the Garden, Joe Smith. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3510.38s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3512.26s)]
*  It was a pro Joe Smith. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3513.26s)]
*  I was rooting for Joe Smith, New York guy, Long Island, Union, all the Union guys out. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3514.26s)]
*  Yeah, but the atmosphere is just like, Joe, yeah, let's go Joe. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3518.78s)]
*  And then better be comes in the ring and the fight starts. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3522.98s)]
*  And it's just no disrespect to Joe Smith. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3527.86s)]
*  He's unbelievable. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3529.34s)]
*  But it looked like just a man fighting a small child. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3530.34s)]
*  It was just brutal, man. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3534.6600000000003s)]
*  Better be of is. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3537.7000000000003s)]
*  He gets no headlines. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3539.06s)]
*  He gets no headlines. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3540.06s)]
*  I know. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3541.06s)]
*  What is he like? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3542.06s)]
*  19 and 0 at 19 knockouts? [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3543.06s)]
*  I think it's 19. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3545.06s)]
*  He's the only boxer at a world championship level that stopped every single one of his [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3547.7799999999997s)]
*  opponents in every fight he's ever been in. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3552.8999999999996s)]
*  And he's super skillful, but he fights like a fucking destroyer. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3555.46s)]
*  Just moves straight towards you. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3559.02s)]
*  That Russian style. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3560.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, 19 and 0 with 19 knockouts. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3561.8999999999996s)]
*  Fucking crazy. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3565.1s)]
*  The Anthony Yard fight. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3566.46s)]
*  Like, holy fuck, man. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3567.5s)]
*  I think Anthony Yard was happy just to go that far into the fight. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3568.62s)]
*  He considers that a win, probably. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3572.9s)]
*  Because better be of is so tough. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3575.82s)]
*  Nobody knows who he is. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3577.38s)]
*  It wasn't for people talking about him in YouTube clips. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3578.38s)]
*  He gets zero press. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3581.3s)]
*  He gets zero press and they ask him about, have you seen this guy fight? [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3582.86s)]
*  What about this guy? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3587.12s)]
*  He's like, I'm not really a boxing fan. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3588.12s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3589.62s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3590.62s)]
*  He goes, I'm not really a boxing fan. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3591.62s)]
*  I just like to focus on my family. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3593.9s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3595.38s)]
*  And that accent is like, man, just kind of focus on my family. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3596.42s)]
*  Boxing is my job. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3600.1800000000003s)]
*  It's funny when you hear him talk. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3601.1800000000003s)]
*  A lot of those guys have that mentality where it's like, boxing is my job. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3602.1800000000003s)]
*  I guess he kind of, it's how it keeps him sane because his work rate is fucking preposterous. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3605.26s)]
*  I mean, you ever see that guy train? [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3609.94s)]
*  Holy shit, man. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3612.46s)]
*  He's a monster. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3613.82s)]
*  He's a monster. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3615.06s)]
*  And then when you hear him talk, he's so like respectful and low key. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3616.06s)]
*  It's weird watching that demon come out when he gets inside the ring. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3620.7000000000003s)]
*  It just looks like he doesn't, and a lot of these Russians have that, where it looks [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3624.48s)]
*  like it's just workmanlike. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3627.6s)]
*  They don't have the emotion that we do here in the West. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3630.06s)]
*  It looks like they're just in there. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3633.4s)]
*  And regardless of what you throw at them, it's just workmanlike what they're going to [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3635.52s)]
*  do. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3638.8s)]
*  It's pretty crazy. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3639.92s)]
*  Well, they're coming from a hard world. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3640.92s)]
*  He's from Chechnya. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3643.2400000000002s)]
*  That is a fucking hard world. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3644.96s)]
*  There's something about those European or Eastern bloc, like from Soviet Union, former [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3648.0s)]
*  Soviet Union guys, and from Russia and Dagestan. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3653.2400000000002s)]
*  They're so tough. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3657.12s)]
*  So tough. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3658.12s)]
*  And there's something to be said for like, I mean, it's just like kids from the ghetto [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3659.12s)]
*  in the United States. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3662.8s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3663.8s)]
*  Those are the best fighters. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3664.8s)]
*  People just come from the heart, like Mike Tyson coming from Brownsville. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3665.8s)]
*  Those are the people from Bedford-Stuy. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3669.88s)]
*  Those are the people that are just the fucking monsters in there. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3670.88s)]
*  And then with the training, with the training also, it hones that. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3673.7200000000003s)]
*  I think there should be something that would help boxing is you watch Showtime has all [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3677.96s)]
*  access now. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3683.7200000000003s)]
*  HBO used to have 24-7, the documentary series. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3684.7200000000003s)]
*  I think that should be for every fight. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3689.4s)]
*  It would make boxing far more popular because these guys have such impressive stories. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3691.48s)]
*  And to tell that story, it's like there's documentaries about everything now, about [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3699.92s)]
*  nonsense. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3703.96s)]
*  They should have a documentary for each fight because you want to see their journey, like [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3705.48s)]
*  where they came from. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3709.44s)]
*  It's really something to see a kid who has nothing born into extreme poverty become a [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3712.44s)]
*  world champion, like Gervonta Davis. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3716.44s)]
*  Coming from poverty, like his story to being a world champion. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3718.48s)]
*  It's an inspiring story. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3722.6s)]
*  It is and it's great for everyone because it gives you fuel. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3723.88s)]
*  For a person who's coming up in life, even if you're not a fighter, you see what someone's [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3727.6s)]
*  gone through and you see the success that hard work has created. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3732.56s)]
*  It can be a roadmap for your own life. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3736.68s)]
*  It really can be. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3738.96s)]
*  It translates. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3739.96s)]
*  Oh man, for sure. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3740.96s)]
*  And that's what Goggins, Goggins is my favorite guy, man. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3742.24s)]
*  I watch all this stuff. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3747.2s)]
*  There's this thing on YouTube called Goggins Motivation. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3749.12s)]
*  So I'll be stretching and it's just him talking. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3751.96s)]
*  He's unreal, man. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3755.04s)]
*  No, he's unreal. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3756.04s)]
*  And that guy, you want to talk about mental toughness. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3757.04s)]
*  That guy has destroyed knees. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3759.92s)]
*  He runs thousands of miles. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3762.64s)]
*  It's just like every day he's running 15, 20 miles every day. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3764.0s)]
*  Destroyed knees. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3768.16s)]
*  But he's taken his life where he came from, which is a terrible, terrible situation and [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3769.16s)]
*  transformed himself. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3775.04s)]
*  That's what I love about him. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3776.84s)]
*  And he's able to articulate it. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3778.96s)]
*  And he does it very well. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3781.36s)]
*  And he also talks about mental toughness in a way that I've never heard anybody talk about [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3782.36s)]
*  mental toughness. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3785.88s)]
*  When I was growing up, maybe it's the same for you. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3786.88s)]
*  It's like, you got to be mentally tough. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3789.24s)]
*  You got to be mentally tough. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3790.24s)]
*  You got to suck it up, suck it up. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3791.3999999999996s)]
*  And it's like, you're processing that, but he breaks down what does that actually mean [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3792.9599999999996s)]
*  in the suck, which is what he called, you know what I mean? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3797.8799999999997s)]
*  It's that conversation that you're having with yourself that we all have with ourselves [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3800.6s)]
*  when we're suffering. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3804.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, what Dave does is he does it in silence. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3805.3599999999997s)]
*  There's no one around and he's doing it. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3808.4399999999996s)]
*  No one's forced him to do it. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3810.12s)]
*  And he does it because he wants to learn about himself. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3812.0s)]
*  And the way I've had conversations with him about it where he goes, I'm getting that deep [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3815.4799999999996s)]
*  knowledge when I'm suffering, when I'm out there running those miles, I get that deep [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3819.04s)]
*  knowledge. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3823.04s)]
*  I'm downloading information. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3824.04s)]
*  The way he's thinking about it, his fucking heart is pounding, his knees are aching. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3826.4s)]
*  He doesn't want to keep going, but he's finding his own threshold, finding his own limitations. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3831.52s)]
*  And then knowing that he can push through that because he's done it before. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3837.24s)]
*  I mean, he's almost died multiple times. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3840.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3844.72s)]
*  Doing those 200 mile races and pissing fucking Diet Coke out of his dick. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3845.72s)]
*  So that's what it looks like. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3849.48s)]
*  It's like your body's breaking down, your kidneys are breaking down. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3850.48s)]
*  And you know, the guy goes to the hospital, he ran, I think it was the Moab 240. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3853.68s)]
*  They had to take him out of the race because he got rabdo. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3858.16s)]
*  So he goes to the hospital, recovers, goes back to the spot where they had to pull him [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3860.8799999999997s)]
*  and finishes the race. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3865.7599999999998s)]
*  God, I love that. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3867.08s)]
*  God, I love that. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3868.56s)]
*  He's like, you're not beating me. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3869.72s)]
*  That's so great. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3871.56s)]
*  I'm going to complete this fucking race, even if it's two weeks later. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3872.6s)]
*  Drop me off at the spot where I stopped. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3877.4s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3879.08s)]
*  It's inspiring. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3880.08s)]
*  It's very, very inspiring. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3881.08s)]
*  It's also him also talking about shutting out the noise because that's the society we [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3882.08s)]
*  live in now. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3886.72s)]
*  There's a lot of noise around, there's a lot of things that can addict you. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3887.72s)]
*  And I think you have to be more disciplined now than ever. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3891.08s)]
*  For the kids coming up too, all this stuff wasn't around when we were coming up. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3894.64s)]
*  It's like social media and all this other stuff that's just not good for you. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3899.2799999999997s)]
*  And he talks about going silent and just quieting your mind and focusing. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3903.52s)]
*  On the other hand, for fighters, the good aspect of the digital world that we live in [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3908.24s)]
*  now is you have access to like Marvin Hagler versus Tommy Hearns. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3913.52s)]
*  You could watch Vito Anifirmo fight. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3918.3999999999996s)]
*  You can watch all these people from bygone days where you could see their technique and [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3920.56s)]
*  their movement and what they did. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3925.68s)]
*  And you can get inspiration from that instantaneously off your phone. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3928.12s)]
*  Yes, I do love that. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3931.68s)]
*  Fuck, it's incredible. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3933.48s)]
*  And that's why people are so good today in everything. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3934.48s)]
*  In everything. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3937.6s)]
*  Comedy. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3938.6s)]
*  You're seeing these comedies. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3939.6s)]
*  I'm watching these fucking door guys that we have hired at the mothership. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3940.6s)]
*  And these fucking guys are like three years in and they're like, I just watch comedy on [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3943.72s)]
*  YouTube and constantly watch comedy. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3947.54s)]
*  And you're watching them on stage like, these guys are kind of advanced. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3949.3999999999996s)]
*  For three years in, I was fucking terrible. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3952.56s)]
*  I was terrible three years in. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3954.8399999999997s)]
*  And these guys are doing really well. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3957.04s)]
*  They have good structure. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3958.6s)]
*  Their jokes are written well. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3960.12s)]
*  Good stage presence. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3961.7999999999997s)]
*  They have an understanding of it that's a next level because they've seen the Rodney [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3962.7999999999997s)]
*  Dangerfields, the Eddie Murphy, the Chris Rock. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3967.2s)]
*  They've seen all these people and they get a sense of what it's all about. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3969.8399999999997s)]
*  Whereas those guys had to get it from being in the clubs, only from being in the clubs. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3973.7999999999997s)]
*  These guys, before they even step into a club, have an education in stand up comedy. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3978.96s)]
*  And that's the beautiful thing about the digital world. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3985.08s)]
*  This thing requires discipline. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3987.88s)]
*  It requires a lot of fucking discipline. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3988.88s)]
*  And if you don't have that, you're going to get sucked in. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3991.56s)]
*  I see it. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3995.28s)]
*  I see it with my own kids. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3996.28s)]
*  We have to take their phones away when we eat dinner. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3997.92s)]
*  Come on, put the phone over here. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=3999.76s)]
*  On the counter, we're all going to sit down and have a meal together. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4001.36s)]
*  We take it away from them on Sundays. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4004.0s)]
*  No phones. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4005.88s)]
*  We're all hanging out. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4006.88s)]
*  Let's just do it this way. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4007.96s)]
*  But if you leave them a phone, I'm just going to put it on my chair. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4008.96s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4011.6s)]
*  And then you see them checking TikTok. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4012.6s)]
*  Get out of there. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4013.6s)]
*  Get out of there, you little fuck. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4014.6s)]
*  Stop looking at that. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4015.6s)]
*  You'd be surprised how many families don't have those rules. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4016.6s)]
*  Yeah, you got to have those rules. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4020.48s)]
*  And they have to see it with you. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4022.84s)]
*  That's what's important. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4024.92s)]
*  They have to see the parents. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4025.92s)]
*  You can leave it alone. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4026.92s)]
*  If the parents are hanging out with them and they're not paying attention, that's a problem. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4028.56s)]
*  It's easy to do. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4033.2000000000003s)]
*  With me, I would make excuses like, I got to work. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4035.2s)]
*  I got to answer these emails. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4037.48s)]
*  I got to do this. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4038.48s)]
*  Which is true, but still not. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4039.7599999999998s)]
*  Don't do it. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4042.9199999999996s)]
*  We all have problems. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4044.7599999999998s)]
*  These are the most addictive things in terms of attention that anybody's ever experienced [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4045.7599999999998s)]
*  in history. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4049.7999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4050.7999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4051.7999999999997s)]
*  Because you're doing your job, whatever. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4052.7999999999997s)]
*  It's a little vacation to go and scroll and take your mind off everything. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4054.64s)]
*  But you're right. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4058.8799999999997s)]
*  What you said, you nailed it. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4060.4399999999996s)]
*  It sucks you in. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4061.56s)]
*  It sucks you in. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4062.96s)]
*  But there's so much good information out there. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4063.96s)]
*  That's really true. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4066.08s)]
*  On how to improve your life. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4067.08s)]
*  It's right there. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4069.0s)]
*  And then references on books you can read and all kinds of other stuff where you can [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4070.0s)]
*  like, oh no, let me get focused here. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4073.68s)]
*  And there's also plenty of people talking about the dangers of addiction to social media. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4075.48s)]
*  Where you really can get an understanding of it. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4080.6s)]
*  It's not like it's just sneaking up on you. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4083.7999999999997s)]
*  Everybody kind of knows what's happening while it's happening. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4085.84s)]
*  And then it's up to you. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4088.12s)]
*  Either you set up a screen time thing where you only have an hour on this app and after [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4089.84s)]
*  a while it just shuts you out. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4096.72s)]
*  Or you just decide, I'm going to get things done. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4099.2s)]
*  And if I'm going to look at social media for 10 minutes or whatever the fuck it is, that's [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4103.0s)]
*  my little reward. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4107.16s)]
*  Just don't get sucked in. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4108.16s)]
*  I do it in the morning. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4110.24s)]
*  It's a real problem in the morning for me. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4111.24s)]
*  Because I take a shit when I wake up. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4113.96s)]
*  So I take a shit, I got that phone. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4115.84s)]
*  The next thing you know, I'm like, it doesn't take 20 minutes to take a shit, stupid. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4117.76s)]
*  What are you doing in here? [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4121.4400000000005s)]
*  You're just pretending to be going to the bathroom while you're scrolling through social [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4122.68s)]
*  media. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4127.24s)]
*  Isn't that something that you have to have that truthful conversation with yourself? [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4128.24s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4131.2s)]
*  Still to this day. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4132.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4133.2s)]
*  And it's good that you can call yourself out on that. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4134.2s)]
*  I was like lying to myself in there. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4135.2s)]
*  I was lying to myself. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4137.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4138.88s)]
*  I lie to myself every morning. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4139.88s)]
*  I'm like, I'm just going to check it real quick. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4140.88s)]
*  See my email. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4142.88s)]
*  But don't you do a cold plunge? [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4143.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4144.88s)]
*  Yeah, man, do that thing first. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4145.88s)]
*  That cold plunge, you're not thinking about anything else. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4147.0s)]
*  Yeah, I do the cold plunge, but I usually have to go to the bathroom first. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4149.24s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4152.84s)]
*  I don't go to the bathroom without my phone. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4153.84s)]
*  So sometimes I wake up at 8 o'clock and it's 8.40 before I get in the water. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4155.96s)]
*  Why did it take so long? [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4161.68s)]
*  Well, because I had to say hi to the dog. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4162.68s)]
*  I had to get up. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4165.400000000001s)]
*  Plus you're not rushing to get to that water either. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4166.400000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4169.04s)]
*  I do it every day, but I don't want to do it every day. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4170.04s)]
*  As I'm walking towards, there's all this self-talk where my brain's like, come on, man, you don't [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4173.72s)]
*  have to do this. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4178.4800000000005s)]
*  And then there's the other part of me that's going, shut the fuck up. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4179.4800000000005s)]
*  Just get in there. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4183.28s)]
*  And I always do it. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4184.28s)]
*  But that talk, it's never like I'm looking forward to it. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4185.6s)]
*  It's a smooth walk there. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4189.88s)]
*  There's no mental hiccups. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4191.84s)]
*  That's happened zero fucking times. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4193.88s)]
*  I love that. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4196.08s)]
*  Every fucking time I've gone walk toward that thing, pick up the lid, I'm like, oh my God, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4197.08s)]
*  are you really doing this? [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4200.96s)]
*  I set the timer on and my foot hits the water. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4202.2s)]
*  I'm like, OK, we're in. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4204.88s)]
*  And then, but once I'm in, it's fine. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4206.48s)]
*  Once I'm in, it's fine. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4208.84s)]
*  But there's always that moment, like 30 seconds in, where your body's like, let's get the [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4210.5599999999995s)]
*  fuck out of here. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4214.28s)]
*  And you're like, hey, shut up, pussy. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4215.28s)]
*  We're in here. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4217.24s)]
*  I love that. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4218.24s)]
*  We're in here for three minutes no matter what happens. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4219.24s)]
*  So just fucking deal with it. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4220.599999999999s)]
*  And then when I get out, I'm always happier. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4222.599999999999s)]
*  But it's just that fucking talk that you have to have in your brain while you get up there. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4224.76s)]
*  I know I'm not going to listen. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4231.28s)]
*  I know that inner bitch is not going to win. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4233.12s)]
*  That's power, though, man. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4236.36s)]
*  But that motherfucker is so persistent. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4237.36s)]
*  I love it, though. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4239.5199999999995s)]
*  Every day, he's like, come on. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4240.5199999999995s)]
*  We don't have to do this. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4242.0s)]
*  That's the power, man, overcoming it, not listening to it. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4243.0s)]
*  Like, no, we're going to do this. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4246.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4247.08s)]
*  We're going to do this. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4248.08s)]
*  And I think that lends you power to other parts of your life. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4249.08s)]
*  Oh, it definitely does. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4250.679999999999s)]
*  It really does. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4251.96s)]
*  I do cold showers. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4252.96s)]
*  I don't have a plunge, but I do cold showers and it's never pleasant. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4253.96s)]
*  Cold showers in the East Coast are rough. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4256.92s)]
*  I do the steam and then I just, no matter what, I put it on and I just do the Wim Hof, [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4260.36s)]
*  do the breathing in the cold. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4265.04s)]
*  The problem with Texas is the water never really gets cold enough. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4267.5599999999995s)]
*  It does in the winter. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4271.0s)]
*  It gets pretty cold. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4272.0s)]
*  I've taken some cold showers in the winter. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4273.0s)]
*  I'm like, ooh, this is pretty cold. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4274.36s)]
*  But it's not enough. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4276.0s)]
*  Cold shower here is mildly unpleasant. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4279.0s)]
*  I want brutal. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4281.88s)]
*  I know. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4282.88s)]
*  I want brutal. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4283.88s)]
*  And it's like getting through that at the beginning of the day. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4284.88s)]
*  First of all, it raises up your dopamine. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4288.14s)]
*  Like Andrew Huberman and Susanna Solberg have put out all these scientific papers and podcasts [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4289.820000000001s)]
*  and have all these discussions about the benefits for your dopamine increases. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4295.900000000001s)]
*  200% of last for hours, norepinephrine, all these like real tangible benefits. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4300.58s)]
*  But the resilience, like having the ability to say to that inner bitch, fuck you. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4306.06s)]
*  If you watched me, you would think, oh my God, this guy's so stoic. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4312.26s)]
*  He's a soldier. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4315.54s)]
*  He just walks in that thing every day. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4316.54s)]
*  But you don't know what's going on in my head. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4317.7s)]
*  In my head, I'm like, come on, pussy. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4319.18s)]
*  I love that. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4321.1s)]
*  Let's go have a coffee first. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4322.1s)]
*  That's so great. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4323.38s)]
*  That's like Goggett looking at his shoes for four hours. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4324.38s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4326.3s)]
*  Looking at his shoes for four hours. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4327.3s)]
*  Sometimes I stare at those motherfuckers for a half hour before I put them on. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4328.3s)]
*  But he just lets you know. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4332.34s)]
*  You're never going to win that battle. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4335.0199999999995s)]
*  You always win. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4337.38s)]
*  But you're never going to not have that inner conversation where the comfort, everybody [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4338.7s)]
*  wants that comfort. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4343.5s)]
*  It's just being the boss. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4344.94s)]
*  My friend John Joseph always says, when it's time to tell, your mind tells your body who [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4347.1s)]
*  the fuck's the boss. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4351.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4352.9800000000005s)]
*  I love that. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4353.9800000000005s)]
*  That's really what it is. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4354.9800000000005s)]
*  It's a philosophy. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4355.9800000000005s)]
*  It's a mental philosophy that you have to have and you have to implement. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4356.9800000000005s)]
*  But if you have the philosophy, that's the first. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4360.26s)]
*  That's it. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4362.620000000001s)]
*  As long as you adhere to it. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4363.620000000001s)]
*  As long as you adhere to it. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4364.620000000001s)]
*  But boy, it's so easy to not do it. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4366.1s)]
*  Today I got some stem cells shot in my knee and I can't do the cold plunge for 72 hours. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4368.860000000001s)]
*  So for 72 hours, I get to be a bitch. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4374.06s)]
*  But the problem is, in my head, I know three days from now that fucking cold plunge is [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4376.5s)]
*  like, hey pussy, remember me? [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4381.66s)]
*  It's even colder now. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4383.66s)]
*  That's great. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4384.66s)]
*  I'm feeling that too when I'm in a warm climate like this and then go back to New York and [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4385.66s)]
*  hit those cold showers there. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4389.06s)]
*  I'm going to feel it. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4390.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to be a wake up. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4391.58s)]
*  If you get to a point where you've got a yard and you can get a cold plunge, I can't recommend [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4393.82s)]
*  it enough. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4398.1s)]
*  It's so, in a sauna, if you have the two of them, because they both test you in a different [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4399.1s)]
*  way. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4403.34s)]
*  Sauna's 20 minutes. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4404.34s)]
*  At 189 degrees, which is my sweet spot, when I get to 15 minutes and I check my watch, [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4405.74s)]
*  I'm like, fuck. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4412.02s)]
*  Those last five minutes are rough. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4413.54s)]
*  They're rough. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4416.1s)]
*  But I think it does elevate your mood and it really does fight depression. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4417.1s)]
*  100%. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4419.7s)]
*  It really does fight depression. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4420.7s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4421.7s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4422.7s)]
*  It's kind of crazy that struggle fights depression. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4423.7s)]
*  But it really does. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4426.3s)]
*  If you don't have any physical struggle in your life and you're just dealing with the [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4428.1s)]
*  anxiety of existence, that's what I find when I get hurt. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4432.14s)]
*  When I get injured and I have to take a few days off, I'm like, boy, do I rely on that [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4436.42s)]
*  for my mood and to just overcome adversity and just deal with all the bullshit of pressure [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4440.820000000001s)]
*  of life. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4447.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4448.02s)]
*  But adversity is necessary. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4449.02s)]
*  And that's the thing that's been kind of overrun today in society, the society that we live [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4450.02s)]
*  in now. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4454.820000000001s)]
*  People don't recognize that, I don't think. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4455.820000000001s)]
*  All of my friends who don't do anything physical, they're the ones who struggle the most mentally. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4458.22s)]
*  I have so many friends that have so many weird mental problems, anxiety problems, especially [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4464.14s)]
*  comics, that don't do anything physically. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4470.34s)]
*  But the ones that do something physically, they have such an advantage. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4473.3s)]
*  Because you're calmer. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4477.46s)]
*  It's like you're taking a drug that allows you to deal with the bullshit. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4478.46s)]
*  Mind-body connection is huge. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4482.820000000001s)]
*  It is real. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4484.740000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately, a lot of smart people don't recognize that because they're so concentrated [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4486.62s)]
*  on the mind that they think of the body and concentrating on the body being frivolous. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4490.0199999999995s)]
*  But it's not. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4494.379999999999s)]
*  It's actually the mind that you're strengthening by concentrating on the body. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4495.379999999999s)]
*  Because it's your will, which is a part of your mind. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4499.82s)]
*  Everyone thinks your mind is just calculus and learning how to write and learning language. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4502.86s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4507.54s)]
*  The mind is also will. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4508.54s)]
*  It's also dedication. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4510.7s)]
*  It's also discipline. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4512.099999999999s)]
*  And that is your mind. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4513.86s)]
*  The mental strength you get from physical activities applies to mental pursuits and [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4515.94s)]
*  to intellectual pursuits. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4521.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4522.78s)]
*  I could feel it. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4523.78s)]
*  I could feel my mood change when I do those right things. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4525.339999999999s)]
*  Green juice in the morning, that's another big thing. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4529.099999999999s)]
*  NutriBullet, spinach, celery, cucumber, a lemon, ginger. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4530.94s)]
*  You've got to be careful with that stuff, though. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4536.94s)]
*  One of the things that I've found that I didn't know when I used to drink a lot of kale shakes [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4539.139999999999s)]
*  is you get a high level of oxalates from that stuff, from non-cooked vegetables. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4542.7s)]
*  And some people, not everyone, but some people develop kidney stones and things along those [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4548.22s)]
*  lines. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4554.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4555.34s)]
*  Oxalates can be a problem. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4556.34s)]
*  When you're grinding up kale and spinach and eating it raw, you're taking an exorbitant [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4557.62s)]
*  amount of oxalates. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4563.22s)]
*  I just love those raw vegetables. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4565.38s)]
*  That lemon just kicks you, too, man. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4566.74s)]
*  It just sets the tone to eat better for the rest of the day, too. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4568.66s)]
*  I generally just take athletic greens. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4571.86s)]
*  Most of my diet is just meat. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4575.78s)]
*  That's the majority of my diet is meat and fruit. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4577.94s)]
*  I would say occasionally I'll have a piece of bread, occasionally I'll have a dessert, [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4580.74s)]
*  occasionally I allow myself little treats. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4585.94s)]
*  The vast bulk, probably 90% of what I eat is just wild game meat, ribeye steaks, and [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4588.139999999999s)]
*  fruit. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4595.38s)]
*  That's it. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4596.38s)]
*  What about olive oil? [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4597.38s)]
*  I love olive oil. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4598.38s)]
*  Love it. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4599.38s)]
*  I made that mistake on a keto diet, too, not satiating myself enough with enough fats. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4600.38s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4605.66s)]
*  Make that mistake and then you stray off it and people go, well, if you start eating about [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4607.82s)]
*  the keto diet, you start eating carbs again, you gain the weight right back. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4611.66s)]
*  It's like, go figure. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4615.02s)]
*  Well, the keto diet is a weird one because it seems very culty to me. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4616.42s)]
*  All the people that are into keto, there's something about it. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4620.78s)]
*  There's great benefits to it. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4625.38s)]
*  There's great benefits to elevating your ketones for mental clarity, for your energy levels [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4627.14s)]

*  I've had Dom DiAgostino on the podcast who's a scientist out of Florida who's a very interesting [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4634.58s)]
*  guy because he's super fit, really very strong, very athletic, and adheres to a keto diet, [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4639.660000000001s)]
*  which is unusual for a scientist to be that jacked and that dedicated to working out, [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4647.1s)]
*  but also very, very educated in the pros and benefits and the studies that show that there's [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4653.3s)]
*  real benefits to just living off of fats. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4660.1s)]
*  That's probably what most of our ancestors did back in the day before agriculture and [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4662.9800000000005s)]
*  grains and things like that. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4668.46s)]
*  Cutting sugars is huge. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4670.42s)]
*  It is. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4671.54s)]
*  It really is. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4672.54s)]
*  It slows you down. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4673.54s)]
*  I used to get ferociously hungry. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4674.54s)]
*  I was like, is it because I'm lifting too much? [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4676.34s)]
*  It's like, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4678.74s)]
*  Your sugars are too high. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4679.74s)]
*  You got to cut. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4681.94s)]
*  We're all addicted to sugar. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4682.94s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen those pictures of people from the 1960s on the beach versus 2020 on [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4684.259999999999s)]
*  the beach. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4690.42s)]
*  It's like, what the fuck happened? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4691.42s)]
*  Sugar happened. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4693.259999999999s)]
*  Corn syrup happened. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4694.42s)]

*  The high fructose corn syrup is the worst, man. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4698.219999999999s)]
*  Kills you. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4700.42s)]
*  It's in everything. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4701.42s)]
*  It's so nuts how many things have corn in it. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4702.42s)]
*  Have you ever seen that documentary, King Corn? [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4703.9s)]
*  No. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4706.139999999999s)]
*  Great fucking documentary. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4707.139999999999s)]
*  The documentary goes over all the different things that have corn in them. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4708.62s)]
*  Corn is subsidized because corn is a cheap substitute for things. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4714.42s)]
*  You can add it to stuff for corn sweetener. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4717.860000000001s)]
*  It's just in everything. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4721.780000000001s)]

*  When you look at corn in the toilet, that's because your body's like, the fuck is this? [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4728.06s)]

*  It just gets absorbed by your body. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4736.18s)]
*  Your body knows what to do with it. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4738.34s)]
*  It's normal. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4739.62s)]

*  That's something that, unfortunately with comics, you want some coffee? [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4754.3s)]
*  Yeah, I'll take some. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4757.1s)]
*  The thing about comics is a lot of us are fucking impulsive and you're spending the [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4758.1s)]
*  clubs drinking and partying and hanging out with a bunch of other assholes and everybody's [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4763.78s)]
*  having fun. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4768.7s)]
*  It's easy to just ... [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4769.7s)]
*  Also, you're a creative. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4771.14s)]
*  You're a creative type and creative types tend to be, by nature, less disciplined. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4772.9400000000005s)]
*  And more indulgent. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4777.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4778.74s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4780.74s)]
*  They're not mutually exclusive. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4781.74s)]
*  People want to think that creativity and discipline, they fight against each other, but they don't. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4783.6s)]
*  It's just impulsive people, they tend to fuck things off and not do them. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4790.5s)]
*  It's also why you got into comedy in the first place, because you didn't want a job. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4795.34s)]
*  You didn't want to grind. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4798.62s)]
*  You figured out, well, I'm not being a garbage man. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4800.54s)]
*  That sucks. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4804.02s)]

*  That's the weirdest thing, right? [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4812.38s)]
*  And then there's the other thing. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4814.22s)]
*  That's the thing that happens when you get famous. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4815.9s)]
*  You have to fight that demon now. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4817.94s)]
*  I'm sure. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4819.7s)]
*  I'm sure that's a whole other thing. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4820.7s)]
*  It's a whole other thing. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4821.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4822.7s)]
*  And a lot of people crack. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4823.7s)]
*  There's a lot of Chris Tuckers out there in the world that got really famous and then [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4824.7s)]
*  just like, ah, Martin Lawrence cracked. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4827.42s)]
*  A lot of people crack. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4830.26s)]
*  And some of them it's like legit mental health issues. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4831.42s)]
*  And some of them it's just the overwhelming pressure of fame and maintaining focus and [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4834.58s)]
*  discipline. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4840.9s)]
*  And also you got everybody around you that's kissing your ass. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4841.9s)]
*  That's a big thing. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4844.099999999999s)]

*  I mean, I think it's just people not telling you the truth and calling yourself out on [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4848.18s)]
*  stuff. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4851.58s)]
*  Are you ready for that? [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4852.58s)]

*  Back in the day, maybe not. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4861.58s)]
*  I was always pretty disciplined, but yeah. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4862.58s)]

*  You know what I mean? [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4870.42s)]
*  If you're raised with that discipline. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4871.42s)]
*  Like my father never let me get too out of control. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4872.42s)]

*  You know what I mean? [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4881.54s)]
*  A hotel? [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4882.54s)]

*  The demon of fame. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4901.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4902.860000000001s)]
*  Look at Elvis. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4903.860000000001s)]
*  Everybody. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4904.860000000001s)]
*  Everybody cracks. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4905.860000000001s)]
*  When you think about people like Elvis or Michael Jackson, when they got famous like [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4907.42s)]
*  that, there had been no roadmap. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4912.339999999999s)]
*  There was no one that famous before them. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4914.66s)]
*  So it's like all of a sudden you're Elvis Presley. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4917.219999999999s)]
*  Did you see the movie? [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4918.98s)]
*  I didn't see it. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4920.38s)]
*  It's fucking good. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4921.38s)]
*  I didn't see it. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4922.38s)]
*  It's really good. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4923.38s)]
*  It's like television, because there was no television. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4924.38s)]
*  So television changed the game and made these guys international stars. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4926.219999999999s)]
*  And they weren't used to that. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4932.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4933.86s)]
*  They were doing all these late night talk shows and they're performing in front of millions [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4934.86s)]
*  of people. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4939.139999999999s)]
*  No one's ever, like before Elvis came along, no one had ever been really that famous. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4940.139999999999s)]
*  I don't think there was anybody like that before. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4946.62s)]
*  And then this guy's got to figure it out. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4951.5s)]
*  He's got people handing him pills and he's banging all these broads. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4952.98s)]
*  It's like, good luck. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4956.86s)]
*  Good luck sorting that out. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4959.179999999999s)]
*  My favorite Elvis is Elvis on pills doing karate. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4960.94s)]
*  Those are my favorite Elvis's. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4964.42s)]
*  I fucking love those videos. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4966.42s)]
*  Have you seen those videos? [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4968.42s)]
*  No. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4970.42s)]
*  I've seen him do karate, like to a montage songs, but I've never seen him actually just [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4971.42s)]
*  a long stretch of it. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4977.700000000001s)]
*  I've seen him in a karate outfit doing it. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4978.740000000001s)]
*  Well he would wear a karate outfit with one of those big collared shirts on under the [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4981.02s)]
*  geek. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4986.02s)]
*  That's great, in case he had to perform. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4987.02s)]
*  I don't even know why he was doing it. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4988.02s)]
*  I think he didn't want to be anywhere without his collared shirt. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4989.5s)]
*  He's clearly high as fuck and he's doing kind of fake karate. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4993.58s)]
*  Look at him. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4998.78s)]
*  He's all peeled up, sweating like a pig. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=4999.78s)]
*  And this was like, look, sunglasses on. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5002.78s)]
*  Elvis, why do you have sunglasses on? [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5005.099999999999s)]
*  What the fuck is going on? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5007.66s)]
*  And he was training under a legitimate karate guy in Ed Parker. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5009.78s)]
*  Ed Parker was the fucking man. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5015.94s)]
*  He was like the absolute legit karate guy and that's who Elvis got his black belt from. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5017.82s)]
*  Was it a real black belt? [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5025.099999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5026.099999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5027.099999999999s)]
*  But you see like these demonstrations. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5028.099999999999s)]
*  Was that entertainment black belt? [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5029.099999999999s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5030.099999999999s)]

*  Back that up a little bit. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5032.099999999999s)]
*  This is what I'm going to do, man. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5033.099999999999s)]
*  I'm going to put a gun on my back. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5034.099999999999s)]
*  I'm going to turn him on like this. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5035.099999999999s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5036.099999999999s)]

*  I mean, it's the dumbest shit of all time. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5038.099999999999s)]
*  And then I'm going to get him right in the face because he's not even going to notice [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5039.099999999999s)]
*  coming on my elbow and I'm going to trip him here. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5044.860000000001s)]
*  Like this is so bad. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5047.58s)]
*  This is so dumb. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5049.26s)]
*  By the way, that guy shot you five times already. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5050.26s)]
*  Your liver has four holes in it. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5053.54s)]
*  You're dead. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5055.46s)]
*  It's so dumb. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5056.46s)]
*  I'll hit him in the hand and I'll grab him by the face. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5057.46s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5059.46s)]
*  I mean, and if you listen to him talk back then, he's like clearly intoxicated. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5060.46s)]
*  He's just fucked up on downers, just doing karate, feeling like a champ. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5066.3s)]
*  Now the other side of it is Gary Coleman. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5072.86s)]
*  Gary Coleman who, that's great. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5075.0199999999995s)]
*  Gary Coleman loses everything and becomes a security guard. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5077.78s)]
*  And then like he's working as a security guard protecting like on a set where Pamela Anderson [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5081.54s)]
*  and a bunch of TMZ guys come in and Gary Coleman launches on, there's video of it, where he [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5087.5s)]
*  launches onto the car and is like, yeah, you're not going anywhere. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5092.82s)]
*  I actually love that. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5096.46s)]
*  I love a person, especially a famous person, who's not doing a menial job, but is doing [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5098.7s)]

*  I love that. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5105.139999999999s)]

*  People do get really interested in those people when they do do that. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5109.62s)]
*  Like, look, he's like one of us again. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5112.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5114.66s)]
*  Look. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5115.66s)]
*  But everybody loves to shame that guy. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5116.66s)]
*  Everybody loves to shame him, but I actually, I love that. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5117.98s)]

*  Isn't that fucked? [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5122.099999999999s)]
*  Because if you just saw a security guy, you'd be like, hey man, what's up? [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5123.099999999999s)]

*  But if you're like, hey, you're that fucking guy, you fucking loser. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5130.179999999999s)]
*  Look at you now. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5133.66s)]
*  Nobody thinks that about a regular security guy. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5134.66s)]
*  See, a regular security guy is just a guy, but a regular security guy who's on like Falcon [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5137.62s)]

*  You don't want to be a has-been. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5148.82s)]
*  A has-been is worse than it never was, which is very strange. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5150.419999999999s)]
*  At least the guy fucking made it for a little while. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5155.9s)]

*  There's no reason really to excel, but I love there's people who go above and beyond in [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5171.22s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5209.780000000001s)]
*  Pictures that I think they're AI generated of him standing in the street, walking down [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5211.0199999999995s)]
*  the street with a giant crowd of people behind him with American flags. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5215.46s)]
*  I'm like, that's got to be fake. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5218.099999999999s)]
*  Is that fake? [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5219.7s)]
*  There was only like he just he was barely seen walking in and out of a building, I think, [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5220.7s)]
*  like officially. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5224.98s)]
*  So I don't know what the AI picture you saw was. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5225.98s)]
*  It was like him on the street in public and there's a throng of fans behind him. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5228.66s)]
*  He's walking on the center of the street. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5233.139999999999s)]
*  I'm like, that looks fake. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5234.139999999999s)]
*  You can't tell anymore. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5235.82s)]
*  No, it's well, you saw the fake images of Trump being arrested. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5236.82s)]
*  You see those? [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5240.42s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5241.42s)]
*  There's like all these fake images of them like grabbing him. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5242.42s)]
*  He's screaming and it's like they can. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5244.58s)]
*  There's fake images of him in the orange jumpsuit. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5246.9400000000005s)]
*  Wow. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5249.26s)]
*  AI can do such insane things now. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5250.26s)]
*  It can do our jokes. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5253.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5254.58s)]
*  You see that? [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5255.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5256.58s)]
*  It's like you could just put in a comic. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5257.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5258.58s)]
*  And then it just can write a joke. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5259.58s)]
*  And Nate Barghazi style talking about going to a baseball game. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5260.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5263.86s)]
*  And it'll do it. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5264.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5265.86s)]
*  I mean, that's eventually going to get better. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5266.86s)]
*  It'll get so good that shitty comics can have chat GPT write their premises and write their [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5267.94s)]
*  material, which is, I guess, I mean, I mean, I mean, am I against that? [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5274.139999999999s)]
*  I don't know if I'm against that. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5280.259999999999s)]
*  I kind of am because I don't think you get like a really unique creative style, like [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5281.7s)]
*  a Jim Gaffigan, a weird, like very specific style. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5288.0199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5291.9s)]
*  Unless you learn how to do that in front of crowds over and over and over again for years. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5292.9s)]
*  And that guy, like, he's writing, he's performing, he's trying it, he's fucking around, he's [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5297.580000000001s)]
*  doing all these different things. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5303.700000000001s)]
*  Like David Tell, every morning that motherfucker gets up with a pack of cigarettes and a fucking [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5305.02s)]
*  newspaper and a cup of coffee and he's just like writing things down, going over stuff [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5309.46s)]
*  and fucking with it in his head. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5313.540000000001s)]
*  The idea that chat GPT could do that for him, I don't like it. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5315.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't like it either at all. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5319.76s)]
*  Where does that leave us? [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5321.3s)]
*  But if I was an open mic'er and I needed some premises, which are, that's the one thing [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5323.0199999999995s)]
*  that drives me fucking crazy when people steal premises. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5328.86s)]
*  It's so hard to come up with a premise. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5332.139999999999s)]
*  It is fruit that you've like climbed to the top of a tree and risked your life to grab [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5334.62s)]
*  that apple. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5339.66s)]
*  And someone goes, oh, I'll take that apple. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5340.82s)]
*  And then I'll write my own thing on that apple. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5342.9s)]
*  Okay, you motherfucker, you saw that guy grab that apple. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5344.58s)]
*  That's his apple. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5348.94s)]
*  And people go, whoa, I could write a joke on the subject too. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5350.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, sorta, but your joke is completely derivative of his. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5353.1s)]
*  That's a great thing about a Tell. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5359.02s)]
*  You'll get a text from him at 3 in the morning. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5361.1s)]
*  He's like, give a joke about a clown on a tricycle who's on meth. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5362.9400000000005s)]
*  It's like, Dave, not only do I not have that, I've never. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5367.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, he thinks when things come to him too easy. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5372.14s)]
*  Because I've had that happen to me too. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5376.22s)]
*  I'm like, God, have I heard this before? [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5378.14s)]
*  Because my memory is really good and also really bad. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5380.02s)]
*  It's really good, but sometimes it sucks. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5383.620000000001s)]
*  It's so inconsistent sometimes. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5386.34s)]
*  Because if something's important to me, I can remember everything about it. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5388.820000000001s)]
*  But if it's something like, I kinda remember it. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5392.1s)]
*  Am I remembering that wrong? [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5394.1s)]
*  We did it yesterday. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5396.22s)]
*  There's this video that I had that I was like, oh, that's that Bob Seska video. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5397.22s)]
*  And then I'm watching, I'm like, no, it's not. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5400.620000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that was different. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5402.620000000001s)]
*  And then we corrected it. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5404.580000000001s)]
*  I'm like, oh, no, no, no, his was different. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5405.580000000001s)]
*  I can't even find the. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5407.26s)]
*  Have you found that Bob Seska video? [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5408.34s)]
*  I found a few. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5409.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, there's become a lot of videos on that topic. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5410.9800000000005s)]
*  On that topic, yeah. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5413.66s)]
*  Well, McKenna made it so, the stoned ape theory. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5414.66s)]
*  It's a theory that when chimpanzees ate mushrooms or lower primates ate mushrooms, [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5418.02s)]
*  it advanced their intelligence and that's how they became human. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5423.26s)]
*  It's a very interesting theory. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5426.06s)]
*  Because it's scientific. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5427.5s)]
*  It really is, believe it or not. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5428.860000000001s)]
*  Like, there's actual scientists that believe like this guy, Dennis McKenna, who believes [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5430.34s)]
*  that that is probably how human beings evolve. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5434.62s)]
*  It's really funny. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5437.54s)]
*  It's really crazy. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5438.54s)]
*  It's really something. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5439.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5440.54s)]
*  But there was a video about it and I couldn't remember. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5441.54s)]
*  I saw the video and I had conflated them in my head and I had this other video that Bob [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5444.14s)]
*  Seska did a long time ago about aliens fucking with monkeys and turning them into people [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5449.98s)]
*  and I had fucked them up and I realized while I was watching, no, no, no, this is not it. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5456.02s)]
*  So like my memory is really good and also sucks. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5459.94s)]
*  So when I come up with a bit too easy, it comes to me, I'm like, god damn it, have I [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5463.18s)]
*  heard that before? [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5467.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5468.22s)]
*  And then you got to Google it or figure it out. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5469.22s)]
*  Google is nice though because you can Google that joke on something and then it's like, [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5470.7s)]
*  oh, look, Mitch Hedberg got a joke on that. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5475.1s)]
*  Like, oh, that's where it came from. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5477.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5479.820000000001s)]
*  Well, with TikTok now, it's kind of crazy because it just seems like everything is just [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5480.820000000001s)]
*  fair game. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5484.62s)]
*  I'm not even on TikTok, but I'm on TikTok. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5485.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5487.62s)]
*  I don't have TikTok. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5488.62s)]
*  You know, my thought was that's Chinese spyware. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5489.62s)]
*  I don't want to get in my fucking passwords and all of a sudden my email gets compromised. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5492.38s)]
*  And there's a balloon over your house. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5496.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5497.700000000001s)]
*  Just for the weather. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5500.700000000001s)]
*  What was the deal with those fucking balloons? [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5502.1s)]
*  Did they ever figure out whose balloons those were? [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5504.22s)]
*  That had to have been them timing our response. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5506.38s)]
*  I thought of something yesterday. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5508.26s)]
*  That's a response time thing. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5509.26s)]
*  That's not actually a weather balloon thing. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5510.42s)]
*  Maybe, but I had heard also that those balloons were flying around when Trump was president. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5512.18s)]
*  They didn't tell him about it because they didn't want Trump going crazy and like shooting [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5515.900000000001s)]
*  nukes at the fucking balloons. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5519.26s)]
*  Like a nuclear bomb blow off a balloon. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5521.06s)]
*  They nuked a balloon. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5525.3s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's just fucking wild, man. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5526.3s)]
*  With TikTok being from China, which it is, the last, I don't know how I was thinking [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5528.5s)]

*  They're shipped from China. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5536.740000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5537.740000000001s)]
*  TikTok's already on them? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5538.740000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5539.740000000001s)]
*  But the phone. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5540.740000000001s)]
*  It's shipped right from there. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5541.740000000001s)]
*  So like, how do we know that they're not intercepting? [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5542.740000000001s)]
*  This is one you have to think of. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5546.02s)]
*  According to Gavin De Becker, who's a security expert, like a legitimate genius, he told me [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5549.02s)]
*  that there was an original Pegasus application that was invented by the Israelis and it was [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5554.179999999999s)]
*  a spy program and it required you to click a link. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5558.179999999999s)]
*  And this is how MBS got Jeff Bezos. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5560.98s)]
*  Remember when Jeff Bezos had some dick pics get leaked? [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5562.98s)]
*  I don't remember that. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5565.66s)]
*  Well what happened was, allegedly, someone sent him a link on WhatsApp. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5567.98s)]
*  He clicked on that WhatsApp link and then it downloaded this spyware onto his phone [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5573.5s)]
*  that he wasn't aware of. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5578.76s)]
*  But apparently now, with Pegasus 2, all they need is your phone number. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5580.78s)]
*  So all these security companies, I'm sure the NSA, anybody else, they just need your [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5585.86s)]
*  ... I got a conversation with a friend of mine about this last night. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5589.74s)]
*  He's like, how do you handle that? [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5591.98s)]
*  I go, I assume that the government or someone is listening to everything I say, every email. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5593.219999999999s)]
*  So I just don't say anything that stupid. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5599.46s)]
*  If you go through- [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5602.7s)]
*  That's good to live by, just in general. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5605.0599999999995s)]
*  If they wanted to go through my meme collection, the things that I ... I have a chat with Shane [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5607.139999999999s)]

*  We have a group chat. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5617.419999999999s)]
*  And it's the most fucking ridiculous shit. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5618.419999999999s)]
*  It's constant chaos. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5620.5s)]
*  It's like, you can take any one of those things, it looks horrible. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5621.5s)]
*  You pull it out. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5624.259999999999s)]
*  But it's not for you. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5625.259999999999s)]
*  It's for us. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5626.94s)]
*  It's four comics talking shit to each other, having fun. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5627.94s)]
*  But that's just part of the program. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5630.66s)]
*  Luckily, I have the ability to explain that. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5633.339999999999s)]
*  Like I've said, did you do a thing with Greta Thornberg getting fucked in a gangbang? [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5636.32s)]
*  I didn't make it. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5641.16s)]
*  Somebody sent it to me. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5642.92s)]
*  And I thought it was funny. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5644.48s)]
*  I'm sorry if I think inappropriate things are funny. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5645.84s)]
*  But you have to make that assumption. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5650.219999999999s)]
*  Kids don't understand that. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5652.84s)]
*  I'm so glad there was no phones around when I was 15. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5654.32s)]
*  There'd be a thousand pictures of my dick. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5657.08s)]
*  I'd be sending them to everybody. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5659.719999999999s)]
*  I think everybody would have back in the day. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5661.84s)]
*  Chinese weather balloon that flew over the US gathered intelligence from military sites. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5664.84s)]
*  I found this reported two days ago. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5668.96s)]
*  This is an Irish site, independent Ireland. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5671.4800000000005s)]
*  And then another site called The Times. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5674.96s)]
*  I don't know where it was from. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5676.52s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5677.52s)]
*  It was an ad block. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5678.52s)]
*  But there is reporting that and I don't know. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5679.52s)]
*  And they just basically explained it by saying it was a weather balloon. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5685.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's a pretty bad lie. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5689.72s)]
*  Can we have satellites? [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5694.08s)]
*  Why do you have a balloon? [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5695.08s)]
*  It's a weather balloon. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5696.08s)]
*  It just is what it is. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5697.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5698.08s)]
*  I mean, I think it's also probably a fuck you. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5699.08s)]
*  Just fly a balloon over the fucking country. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5700.88s)]
*  I think so too. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5704.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5705.28s)]
*  It's got to be a lot of that. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5706.28s)]
*  It was a push. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5707.28s)]
*  It was a push to see our response time on it, I think. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5708.28s)]
*  I guess. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5709.28s)]
*  It's a fucking... [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5710.28s)]
*  Or to see what we would do. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5711.28s)]
*  It's a weird world. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5712.28s)]
*  Same thing. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5713.28s)]
*  A weird world. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5714.28s)]
*  Chinese spy balloon captured sensitive military info after all. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5715.28s)]
*  US officials say Beijing obtained US military intelligence from a spy balloon that was shot [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5719.28s)]
*  down in early February. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5724.44s)]
*  I've had Mike Baker on multiple times. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5726.32s)]
*  The Fox guy, yeah. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5729.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5730.639999999999s)]
*  He's a former CIA operative. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5731.639999999999s)]
*  And he essentially said that one of the things that China's been doing, the way they gather [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5732.639999999999s)]
*  intelligence is they sell cell phone towers at a very low rate and they install them all [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5737.719999999999s)]
*  around these sensitive areas. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5746.12s)]
*  If you go to where these military sites are... [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5748.759999999999s)]
*  Was it Wyoming? [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5751.16s)]
*  Is that where it was when he was explaining to us? [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5752.16s)]
*  Was it there in Idaho where they meet? [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5754.16s)]
*  And all these areas where this sensitive intelligence is going on, China has all these cell phone [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5756.839999999999s)]
*  towers set up there. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5764.88s)]
*  And it's their equipment that they put in. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5766.48s)]
*  And we already know that that's the reason why they banned Huawei from the United States. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5768.799999999999s)]
*  Mike talked about that as well, that Huawei was using, whether it's routers or all their [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5773.0s)]
*  different types of equipment that they were selling, had third party access so they could [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5778.76s)]
*  steal data and they could steal intellectual property. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5783.4800000000005s)]
*  So they could... [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5787.64s)]
*  That's one of the things China does. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5788.64s)]
*  Anytime the United States has an idea, they just copy it and make it better. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5791.24s)]
*  And they constantly do that. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5794.92s)]
*  And Huawei was genius at it. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5796.12s)]
*  Huawei, before they banned them, had the fucking best phones that you could get. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5798.36s)]
*  And I was about to buy a Huawei phone right before they got rid of them because they had [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5803.04s)]
*  these crazy cameras. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5807.28s)]
*  And that's a Chinese company? [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5809.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5811.04s)]
*  They just push stuff to the edge, make the best shit available, and then steal all the [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5812.599999999999s)]
*  data. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5817.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't understand technology at all. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5821.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm barely able to function on my phone. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5823.2s)]
*  Probably better that way. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5825.32s)]
*  It's a rabbit hole that if you go down to... [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5828.32s)]
*  I got my Instagram jacked and it's like I fell into a phishing scam or whatever. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5830.04s)]
*  And I got it taken from me. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5836.48s)]
*  How'd they get you? [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5838.799999999999s)]
*  They said, do we have intellectual property something? [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5840.16s)]
*  You're using something, clips or something that... [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5845.04s)]
*  It's my clip, but it was from TV. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5849.96s)]

*  Yeah, he's like, we got you. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5864.5599999999995s)]

*  I don't know stuff. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5888.32s)]

*  I don't know if it's just Instagram. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5893.639999999999s)]

*  Credit card, Facebook. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5896.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5897.4s)]
*  It's like I start panicking. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5898.4s)]
*  I start flipping out. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5899.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5900.4s)]
*  So I call my friend who's a tech guy, Ben Rosenfeld. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5901.4s)]
*  Shout out to Ben. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5902.639999999999s)]
*  And he's also a comic and he helped me try to figure it out. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5903.92s)]
*  But there is no recourse. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5909.08s)]
*  There's no recourse for it. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5912.28s)]
*  It's like you can file a complaint, but it's just basically gone. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5915.16s)]
*  You can start a new account. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5918.12s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5919.599999999999s)]
*  So your account's gone? [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5920.599999999999s)]
*  No, I didn't have to do that. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5921.599999999999s)]
*  I had another friend help me to get it back. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5922.8s)]
*  He has an account with a company and the company helped me get it back, fortunately. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5926.4s)]
*  But as an individual, as a private citizen trying to get that back, it's like deaf ears, [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5932.639999999999s)]
*  man. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5937.679999999999s)]
*  They don't care. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5938.679999999999s)]
*  Well, there's just too many of them, I think. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5939.679999999999s)]
*  I think it's happening at scale. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5940.76s)]
*  You're dealing with a company like, say, Instagram. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5943.280000000001s)]
*  How many people do they... [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5946.400000000001s)]
*  Let's guess. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5947.6s)]
*  How many people are on Instagram? [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5948.6s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5949.6s)]
*  Well, there's 350 million people in the country, right? [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5950.6s)]
*  But in the world. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5953.88s)]
*  Instagram's worldwide. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5954.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5955.88s)]
*  Billions. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5956.88s)]
*  How many people do you think? [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5957.88s)]
*  Billions. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5958.88s)]
*  Two billion? [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5959.88s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5960.88s)]
*  Three billion. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5961.88s)]
*  I'll say two. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5962.88s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5963.88s)]
*  How many people do you think are on it? [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5964.88s)]
*  It's probably about one. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5965.88s)]
*  One billion? [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5966.88s)]
*  But daily active users would be less too. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5967.88s)]
*  Let's find out how many accounts are on Instagram. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5969.28s)]
*  Let's Google that. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5971.6s)]
*  How many individual accounts are on Instagram? [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5972.64s)]
*  I'm saying two billion. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5974.36s)]
*  What do you think, Jamie? [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5975.36s)]
*  You say one, you say like two, three? [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5977.36s)]
*  Yeah, three. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5979.88s)]
*  Facebook's the most and it's not over two billion yet. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5980.88s)]
*  Oh, it isn't? [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5983.88s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5984.88s)]
*  I thought it was. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5985.88s)]
*  Facebook's been worldwide. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5986.88s)]
*  Facebook changes elections in places. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5988.88s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5991.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5992.4s)]
*  I had Zuckerberg on and you could tell having a conversation with that guy. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5993.4s)]
*  Dang, I'm off. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5996.64s)]
*  Instagram is... [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5997.64s)]
*  2.35 billion active users. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=5999.200000000001s)]
*  Wow, that's you. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6002.200000000001s)]
*  Wow, that's crazy. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6003.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I guess it would be hard for them to field... [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6006.200000000001s)]
*  I guess it would be hard for them to field complaints or whatever. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6008.200000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, that's fourth amongst the biggest social media networks globally. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6011.200000000001s)]
*  So, it's number one. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6015.200000000001s)]
*  Facebook's number one. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6017.200000000001s)]
*  2.9 billion. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6018.200000000001s)]
*  YouTube is 2.9 billion. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6020.200000000001s)]
*  I don't really consider YouTube social media not that much. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6021.200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6025.200000000001s)]
*  Because maybe it is. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6026.200000000001s)]
*  I guess it is. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6027.200000000001s)]
*  But I don't use it that way. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6028.76s)]
*  I use it for entertainment. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6029.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6030.76s)]
*  If I'm watching YouTube, I'm watching stuff like fights or... [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6031.76s)]
*  Clips, yeah. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6034.76s)]
*  WhatsApp is 2 billion. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6035.76s)]
*  Well, WhatsApp is a communication app. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6036.76s)]
*  I don't think that's social media. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6038.76s)]
*  No. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6039.76s)]
*  Instagram, 2.35. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6040.76s)]
*  TikTok. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6041.76s)]
*  TikTok's only 1 billion? [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6042.76s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6043.76s)]
*  I would have thought it was way more. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6044.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6046.76s)]
*  I think it is. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6047.76s)]
*  I think it's on the rise though. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6048.76s)]
*  Isn't TikTok like a thing? [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6049.76s)]
*  And then Instagram Reels is competing with it, right? [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6050.76s)]
*  Where's Twitter? [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6053.76s)]
*  Where's Twitter at? [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6054.76s)]

*  they've split them all up and this could just be one app. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6088.88s)]

*  And very forthcoming, he was explaining about how the FBI contacted him about the Hunter [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6129.16s)]
*  Biden laptop and explained it on the podcast. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6133.96s)]
*  It created a firestorm of controversy. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6138.16s)]
*  I'm sure. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6139.96s)]
*  He was just kind of casually explaining, well, the FBI told us that there was going to be [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6141.0s)]
*  some disinformation coming out of Russia. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6144.6s)]
*  We were told this and that. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6147.04s)]
*  And so we limited its reach and then just was fucking giant news. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6148.64s)]
*  This guy just created a fucking dating site for college kids. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6155.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6158.92s)]
*  X amount of years ago. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6159.92s)]
*  But he was instrumental in growing it though too. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6160.92s)]
*  And with that comes like bad stuff, obviously, not just the good parts of it. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6163.36s)]
*  And also, most recently, he took a big blunder with that whole meta thing where they thought [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6168.12s)]
*  that everybody was going to put on headsets and delve into the metaverse. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6173.68s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6177.24s)]
*  And that shit didn't work at all. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6178.24s)]
*  No, why? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6179.24s)]
*  It's too weird. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6180.24s)]
*  I love VR. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6181.24s)]
*  I mean, that's close to, I mean, that will mess, I mean, you want to talk about social [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6182.24s)]
*  media fucking with your mind. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6187.16s)]
*  Like that meta stuff, like in an alternate reality. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6189.32s)]
*  We all just live in, you're basically getting closer to just being in a pod. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6192.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6197.0s)]
*  And having that on as your reality. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6198.0s)]
*  It's going to happen. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6200.44s)]
*  It's going to happen. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6201.84s)]
*  It's just like, look, when I was a kid in the 1980s and 90s, there was times. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6202.84s)]
*  God, good times. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6207.64s)]
*  Good times. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6208.64s)]
*  But there was times back then where people thought virtual reality was going to be the [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6209.64s)]
*  future. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6212.92s)]
*  But the technology wasn't available. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6213.92s)]
*  It didn't really work. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6215.4s)]
*  But it was always this thought, you know, that one day we're going to live in virtual [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6217.24s)]
*  reality. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6220.88s)]
*  And that was the matrix. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6221.88s)]
*  That was like all these different things. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6222.88s)]
*  But it was like science fiction enough that it was so far ahead. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6224.0s)]
*  And then the technology was kind of clunky. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6227.92s)]
*  So it never really took off. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6230.04s)]
*  But then when Oculus came around and what were the other ones? [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6231.32s)]
*  There was another big one other than Oculus. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6236.400000000001s)]
*  Vive. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6238.4400000000005s)]
*  That's right. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6239.4400000000005s)]
*  The HTC Vive that they were. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6240.4400000000005s)]
*  They were so good. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6241.84s)]
*  You're like, oh, maybe we're close. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6242.84s)]
*  And there's some fun fucking games you can play on that. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6244.72s)]
*  Apparently there's an alien like Alien One, the movie game that is fucking terrifying. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6247.72s)]
*  You play it and you're on the Nostromo, that spaceship and the fucking aliens in the spaceship. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6252.679999999999s)]
*  And you're going down dark corridors and rains dripping. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6259.04s)]
*  And then the thing just jumps out at you. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6261.96s)]
*  It's fucking terrifying, apparently. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6264.639999999999s)]
*  But that, for whatever reason, they thought that was just going to just sweep the whole [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6266.5599999999995s)]
*  country. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6271.919999999999s)]
*  And everyone was going to... [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6272.919999999999s)]
*  And it was a virtual reality mask that you put on? [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6273.919999999999s)]
*  The Oculus is. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6276.0s)]
*  Yeah, the Oculus. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6277.0s)]
*  It's very light. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6278.0s)]
*  The new one is very light. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6279.0s)]
*  The old ones, we had the HTC Vive at the studio and it had to be attached to a backpack and [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6280.08s)]
*  it was like a cable that came above you and we had the cable suspended from the ceiling. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6285.36s)]
*  So we had a sectioned off area where you could play in it. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6289.48s)]
*  And then it got better and John Carmack got involved and they made even better versions [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6292.72s)]
*  of it. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6298.88s)]
*  And then it became something that you just sit on your head. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6299.88s)]
*  And then when that happened, I was like, oh boy, we're getting close now because that [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6301.44s)]
*  just sits in your head and you have these two controllers in your hand. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6304.96s)]
*  But it's still just people are not that interested in it, which is interesting. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6307.96s)]
*  That's good, I think. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6312.4s)]
*  I think it's a good thing not to be on it. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6314.12s)]
*  I think it's going to be the future. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6316.4800000000005s)]
*  It's going to be something that's so wonderful and so exciting that you can't get out of [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6320.16s)]
*  it. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6324.96s)]
*  It's going to be weird how it morphs with your mind. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6325.96s)]
*  It's going to eventually morph with your mind, right? [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6327.12s)]
*  So it'll be like part of you, kind of. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6330.2s)]
*  That's where we kind of morph into the robot world, I guess. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6332.92s)]
*  That's happening. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6336.28s)]
*  It's just a matter of like, what is it, 10 years? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6338.04s)]
*  Is it 20 years? [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6339.92s)]
*  Whatever it is. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6340.92s)]
*  But technology is going to reach a point where it's so ... Look, no one ever would have thought [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6341.92s)]
*  that you would have a thing in your pocket where you couldn't stop looking at it. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6345.84s)]
*  I'm still amazed by it. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6350.16s)]
*  I'm in New York and I'm watching people and I'm watching people just walk down the street [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6352.599999999999s)]
*  with it and they're not conscious of anything else that is going on. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6357.08s)]
*  And they're just walking down the street. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6360.92s)]
*  It's dangerous. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6362.48s)]
*  As cars could hit you. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6363.48s)]
*  They're just walking down the street just immersed in it. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6365.68s)]
*  Actually, if you're on the subway and you're not on it, if you're just staring forward, [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6368.68s)]
*  you're the weird one. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6374.360000000001s)]
*  You're the weird one. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6375.360000000001s)]
*  Everybody else is like, what's this guy doing? [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6377.68s)]
*  If you get on the subway with a book, who the fuck is this guy? [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6379.04s)]
*  Throwback. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6382.8s)]
*  You're reading a book? [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6383.8s)]
*  A real book? [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6384.8s)]
*  It's not even a Kindle? [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6385.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6386.8s)]
*  It's unreal. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6387.8s)]
*  It's unreal. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6388.8s)]
*  I had the books on my phone as I'm reading it on my phone. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6389.8s)]
*  That's amazing to me, I think, to have all that information just a library. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6393.64s)]
*  With a library app, you can just download books from the library on your phone and read [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6397.68s)]
*  them and return them. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6402.360000000001s)]
*  That's fantastic. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6404.04s)]
*  Well, I have most of the books that I consume. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6405.04s)]
*  I consume audio books on the way to work, coming home from work, in the sauna. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6407.12s)]
*  That's where I do most of my listening to books. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6411.88s)]
*  And I probably have 200, 300 books on this little tiny phone. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6414.88s)]
*  And they're all hours long. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6419.84s)]
*  It's a terabyte of data on that phone. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6421.839999999999s)]
*  There's so much room. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6423.879999999999s)]
*  And also, it just stores it in the cloud anyway. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6425.24s)]
*  If there's no room, it's in the cloud. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6427.24s)]
*  Then you download it and fucking ... There's never been a time that you could have more [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6429.08s)]
*  access to information. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6433.839999999999s)]
*  But there's also never been a time where you're more distracted. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6435.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6438.32s)]
*  That's the rub. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6439.879999999999s)]
*  That's the rub. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6441.0s)]
*  But if you're focused on the information, man, it's college. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6442.0s)]
*  It's basically a college in your pocket. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6444.24s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6447.5199999999995s)]
*  People listening might be like, what do you ... Because people grew up with this, but [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6449.76s)]
*  we didn't. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6453.4400000000005s)]
*  I knew a time where this didn't exist at all. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6454.4400000000005s)]
*  Me and my brother had a room together. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6456.64s)]
*  It was both of us. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6458.4800000000005s)]
*  No TV allowed in the room. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6459.76s)]
*  Dinner together at a certain time. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6461.400000000001s)]
*  Unless you're working or you're at a sports practice, you're having dinner. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6462.68s)]
*  My father's playing music while we have dinner. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6468.12s)]
*  We're talking about our day. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6470.320000000001s)]
*  And when we go to sleep, it's like a room, no television. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6472.4800000000005s)]
*  Because he didn't want us in our room watching television on our own. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6475.84s)]
*  You want to watch television, you're out with the family. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6478.92s)]
*  It's that kind of thing. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6481.88s)]
*  So I guess it's a different world. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6482.88s)]
*  And it's been a gradual thing, but it's still very, very different. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6486.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't have kids, so I don't know how that would be. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6490.24s)]
*  But I guess what you do, what you implement with your children sounds like the right thing. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6493.32s)]
*  They get mad at you. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6498.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6499.24s)]
*  Put your phone down. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6500.24s)]
*  They get mad because that little dopamine rush. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6501.24s)]
*  It's not even a big rush. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6503.84s)]
*  That's what's weird. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6505.6s)]
*  That little drip of dopamine. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6506.6s)]
*  Blip, blip, blip, blip. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6508.08s)]
*  But you go like, there's this poll. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6510.200000000001s)]
*  Like, what, is anybody texting me? [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6511.68s)]
*  Anybody whispering? [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6513.160000000001s)]
*  You just like, I see some people on the podcast. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6514.160000000001s)]
*  They can't help but they reach for their phone. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6516.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6518.280000000001s)]
*  They just check their text messages. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6519.280000000001s)]
*  And this is your podcast. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6520.84s)]
*  And it's giant. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6522.200000000001s)]
*  There's millions of people watching someone just look at their phone. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6523.200000000001s)]
*  It's like, but they can't help it. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6526.120000000001s)]
*  They just get so sucked in. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6527.4800000000005s)]
*  I've done it to the point where it's like, when I first get up, I make sure I don't look [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6529.08s)]
*  at it and do other things first. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6533.6s)]
*  And then I set time aside and I mentally prepare myself. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6537.0s)]
*  I go, okay, now I'm going to look at it. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6539.76s)]
*  I'm going to look at it. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6541.84s)]
*  I'm going to do as much as I want for 15 minutes. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6542.84s)]
*  Check everything. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6545.4400000000005s)]
*  Make sure everything's up. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6546.76s)]
*  Check the comments. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6549.0s)]
*  And now that the special is out, like respond to people as much as I can. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6550.0s)]
*  And then after that window is over, not again. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6554.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6557.88s)]
*  My favorite trick is YouTube because I like to watch stuff on YouTube, but it's like, [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6558.88s)]
*  I don't want to get addicted to scrolling on YouTube either. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6563.36s)]
*  So that's the difference there. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6566.24s)]
*  I'm definitely addicted to watching stuff on YouTube. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6568.16s)]
*  When I have breakfast, I've got this little, it's pretty cool, this little kickstand thing [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6571.36s)]
*  that sticks up your phone. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6575.84s)]
*  That's great. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6577.64s)]
*  I think this is called a coup case or something like that. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6578.64s)]
*  I forget what it's called, but it's like, bam. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6580.92s)]
*  So I just sit there and watch stuff while I'm eating. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6583.08s)]
*  And I think I'm not addicted that way. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6587.16s)]
*  But that's YouTube. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6589.72s)]
*  You're watching substance there instead of mindlessly scrolling, which is what I was [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6590.96s)]
*  doing. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6596.2s)]
*  And it just, that creates so many bad emotions and stuff. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6597.2s)]
*  It's like, I don't want to feel that way. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6599.72s)]
*  Isn't that weird that mindlessly scrolling creates bad emotions? [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6601.96s)]
*  What is that? [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6605.6s)]
*  Why does it do that? [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6606.6s)]
*  Is it just, you feel like you're wasting time? [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6607.6s)]
*  You're wasting time. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6610.04s)]
*  You're seeing a bunch of different things. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6611.04s)]
*  The energy coming from the thing. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6614.360000000001s)]
*  I'm a big energy guy too. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6615.76s)]
*  The energy coming from it, it hits. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6617.4s)]
*  Even when you're looking at your, I tried that for a while, looking at my own stuff. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6620.64s)]
*  I'll just look at my own stuff. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6623.32s)]
*  I won't look at everybody's stuff. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6624.32s)]
*  But then you start getting like, how many likes does this have? [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6625.84s)]
*  How many? [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6628.5599999999995s)]
*  That's not good. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6629.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, you end up swimming in your own narcissism. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6630.5599999999995s)]
*  So it's like, no, stop that now. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6632.78s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6634.76s)]
*  But if I'm, my point is I'm navigating this at 50 when my mind has already been developed. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6635.76s)]
*  What chance do kids have developing through this time period? [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6640.599999999999s)]
*  It's a different world, but I think they're going to be fine. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6644.88s)]
*  They really do. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6648.6s)]
*  I think there's going to be a transitionary period where we lose a lot of kids. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6649.6s)]
*  They don't know what the fuck they're doing and they get lost in it. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6654.12s)]
*  But there's going to be enough kids that recognize like, okay, this is just the new reality of [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6657.04s)]
*  life and if you want to be successful, just like you when you were young, you had focus [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6661.36s)]
*  and dedication. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6665.64s)]
*  You realized there's a lot of people out that don't do that and I can learn from them what [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6666.64s)]
*  not to do. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6670.52s)]
*  There's kids that are doing that now too. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6671.52s)]
*  I have friends that very much limit their kids access to social media. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6673.96s)]
*  They don't allow them on things. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6677.88s)]
*  They don't allow them to have a phone. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6679.64s)]
*  I don't think that's the way to do it because this is a reality and I think that if you [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6682.4800000000005s)]
*  give the kids the tools and the understanding to handle that, this is a new level of adversity [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6687.4800000000005s)]
*  that they have to deal with, that we didn't have to deal with. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6693.8s)]
*  But it's the way I look at it, it's like cold weather. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6696.4s)]
*  Like if you grew up in a place with cold weather, you developed an understanding of what the [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6699.4s)]
*  fuck that means. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6703.4s)]
*  Like you got to shovel snow, you got to deal with it and I think they have a new level [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6704.4s)]
*  of adversity because of the pressures of social media and because of like the shit talking, [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6709.28s)]
*  especially with girls, man. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6714.48s)]
*  Girls are fucking mean to each other. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6716.36s)]
*  Their reputation disrupts in the comments and there's shit on each other and group chats [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6718.839999999999s)]
*  and it gets real nasty and you developed a level of resilience from being able to handle [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6723.32s)]
*  that and after a while you get okay with it. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6729.5599999999995s)]
*  You have to understand what that is. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6732.64s)]
*  Yeah, you have to understand what that is. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6733.92s)]
*  You're right, going in with that mindset is the important thing. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6735.88s)]
*  But if you're just caught off guard with it, then it can crush you and it has. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6740.200000000001s)]
*  It's driven people to suicide. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6744.92s)]
*  It definitely has done that and there's also a thing, the FOMO aspect and the comparison, [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6746.64s)]
*  and this is apparently very bad with girls as well because there's a lot of people that [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6752.68s)]
*  are using filters and they're changing their body and these girls see these people and [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6755.8s)]
*  they look perfect and then they see themselves in the mirror and they have zits and they [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6760.44s)]
*  look like shit and maybe they're a little overweight and they get massively depressed [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6764.2s)]
*  and then they think, well, the only way for me, I have to be like that person so I have [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6768.5199999999995s)]
*  to do what they're doing and be completely focused on my looks and some people just unfortunately [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6773.28s)]
*  through a genetic roll of the dice, they don't have good features. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6779.5199999999995s)]
*  They don't look good. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6782.679999999999s)]
*  They don't have a good body and then they just feel fucking depressed because they're [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6783.679999999999s)]
*  comparing themselves. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6787.12s)]
*  See, if you are a comic and you want to be a great comic and you're kind of funny and [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6789.12s)]
*  you're figuring out, you can see Chris Rock and you go, maybe I could get to that spot. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6794.68s)]
*  Maybe I can get there. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6799.92s)]
*  But if you're a girl and you're born with an unfortunate appearance and you compare [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6801.4s)]
*  yourself to some bombshell who's doing squats with her giant ass in front of you, I can't [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6806.8s)]
*  be that person. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6812.92s)]
*  It's not attainable. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6813.92s)]
*  That's very, very depressing to people. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6815.5199999999995s)]
*  Very hard. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6817.88s)]
*  Very difficult to deal with. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6818.88s)]
*  Because the pressures of that, it's like that is one of the most important things on social [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6819.88s)]
*  media is to be attractive. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6824.8s)]
*  It's a currency in and of itself. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6827.32s)]
*  There's people that I see on Instagram that are like, they have 45 million fucking followers. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6829.4400000000005s)]
*  All they're doing is squats and looking pretty. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6835.84s)]
*  And there's also a thing with placing undue value on that. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6839.76s)]
*  Like 45 million, I'm a winner. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6843.96s)]
*  You have less, you're not. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6846.78s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6848.179999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6849.179999999999s)]
*  That kind of thing. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6850.179999999999s)]
*  And there's also something to be said for just being bored. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6851.179999999999s)]
*  Just let yourself be bored. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6856.62s)]
*  Let yourself be uncomfortable. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6858.54s)]
*  Let yourself just sit in a void once in a while and not be bored, be unhappy. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6861.58s)]
*  It's okay to be unhappy. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6866.54s)]
*  It's okay to be uncomfortable. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6867.94s)]
*  And I think that gets lost a lot because of this instant gratification. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6869.38s)]
*  I think for comics, being bored is very important because that's where some of the ideas come [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6873.0199999999995s)]
*  from. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6876.62s)]
*  And the people that don't, like Goggins, when he runs, he don't listen to shit. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6877.62s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6882.98s)]
*  He listens to his breath, maybe. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6883.98s)]
*  He listens to his inner demons. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6886.62s)]
*  His conversations with the fucking room in hell that he has in the back of his head. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6889.0599999999995s)]
*  And he tells those demons who the fuck the boss is. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6894.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6897.18s)]
*  That's, I mean, I don't do that. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6898.18s)]
*  But the guy who wrote Game of Thrones is, that guy's from Staten Island. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6900.0199999999995s)]
*  So it's like, the level of imagination, the detail that he must have had in imagining [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6904.1s)]
*  this world, if he would have had a phone, maybe that doesn't happen. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6911.34s)]
*  Sure. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6915.58s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6916.58s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6917.58s)]
*  It's possible, but I mean, it's also possible. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6918.58s)]
*  Or if he was a hot guy. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6920.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6921.26s)]
*  I mean, like if he was a hot guy and had options of all these women and going to the beach [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6922.26s)]
*  and lifting and all that stuff, maybe he doesn't write that. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6926.860000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6930.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6931.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6932.18s)]
*  I'm not reading Mario Lopez's book, you know what I'm saying? [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6933.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6936.820000000001s)]
*  He's too hot. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6937.820000000001s)]

*  He's a fucking great body. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6941.820000000001s)]

*  And abs, like when he was on Saved by the Bell, he was like a wrestler on Saved by the [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6956.820000000001s)]
*  Bell. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6959.62s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6960.62s)]

*  You know, I'm sure he works hard. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6969.78s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6972.5s)]
*  But like physically gifted. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6973.5s)]
*  Right, but he's not gonna write a Game of Thrones. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6974.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6976.14s)]
*  Maybe he will. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6977.14s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6978.14s)]
*  What the fuck do I know? [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6979.14s)]
*  But the odds are that that's not gonna happen. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6980.14s)]
*  Like one of my favorite authors is the guy who wrote Conan, Robert E. Howard. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6982.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6987.42s)]
*  Robert E. Howard was a recluse, a shut-in, lived with his mother, committed suicide in [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6989.22s)]
*  his early 30s. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6992.18s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6993.18s)]
*  But the fucking books that he wrote, like those fantasy novels of Conan that were fucking [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6994.18s)]
*  amazing when I was a kid. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6997.66s)]
*  And this is a guy who was, you know, kind of a shut-in and kind of a, you know, very [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=6999.5s)]
*  depressed. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7005.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7006.26s)]
*  And he wrote about this conqueror. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7007.26s)]
*  It was like this perfect man. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7008.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7009.26s)]
*  Who just destroyed things and fought off dragons and demons and, you know, and it was amazing [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7010.26s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7016.22s)]
*  If he was, you know, some beautiful hot man, probably that wouldn't have gotten written. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7017.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7022.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7023.9400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7024.9400000000005s)]
*  That's the thing about creativity. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7025.9400000000005s)]
*  It's like this very strange sort of force that you have to figure out how to tune into. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7027.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7034.06s)]
*  And if you're tuned into other stuff, you're not gonna give it the time that it deserves. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7035.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7038.62s)]
*  But the fact that he couldn't be that hot, popular guy, it forced his mind. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7039.62s)]
*  Mine is just so powerful. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7044.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7046.3s)]
*  And it forced you to go to another place. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7047.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7048.66s)]
*  Well, the ability to write fiction is so fascinating because you, and it's so engaging when someone [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7049.66s)]
*  writes a good book and you're into this character and these fucking scenarios and it's like, [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7056.7s)]
*  all fake, all invented in this person's mind, but it's, you're fucking, the heart is pounding, [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7062.42s)]
*  your hands are clamming. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7068.38s)]
*  And it's not like a movie because there's no filter on it. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7069.38s)]
*  It's just their thoughts. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7071.54s)]
*  It's them constructing it. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7072.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7074.9400000000005s)]

*  I consulted with him on that, Dave's Old Porn, yeah. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7097.139999999999s)]
*  I fucking never did an ep... [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7099.139999999999s)]
*  And Comedy Underground with Devotel. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7100.139999999999s)]
*  Did I do an episode of that? [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7101.139999999999s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7102.139999999999s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7103.139999999999s)]
*  I think I did. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7104.139999999999s)]
*  I think I did. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7105.34s)]
*  I think I did. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7106.34s)]
*  Maybe when he was out. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7107.34s)]
*  That's how many fucking things I've done. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7108.34s)]
*  I don't even remember what I've done. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7109.34s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7110.34s)]
*  That's pretty great. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7111.34s)]
*  That's bizarre. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7112.34s)]
*  I did do it. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7113.34s)]
*  Ginger Lynn. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7114.34s)]
*  Isn't that hilarious? [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7115.34s)]
*  I was about to say, I don't know, fucking... [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7116.34s)]
*  I wish I did that. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7117.34s)]
*  I thought you did. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7118.34s)]
*  Meanwhile, I did do it. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7119.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7120.34s)]
*  But Dave, that was a fun thing for him because he's kind of a pervert. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7121.34s)]
*  I love him. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7126.54s)]
*  So for him to watch porn with the old porn stars and joke around... [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7127.54s)]
*  Yeah, the classic porn. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7132.34s)]
*  There's something about those watching things, like Mystery Science Theater, like that kind [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7134.54s)]
*  of thing, watching and marketing. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7139.54s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7140.54s)]
*  That's great. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7141.54s)]
*  Hilarious. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7142.54s)]
*  If you don't remember doing it, you probably won't remember if that was in New York or [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7143.54s)]
*  LA. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7148.74s)]
*  I believe it was in LA. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7149.74s)]
*  It was in LA. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7150.74s)]
*  Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was in LA. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7151.74s)]
*  Because I was on set when he was shooting the ones in New York. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7152.74s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7155.9400000000005s)]
*  I think me and Kurt Madsger worked with Dave on it. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7156.9400000000005s)]
*  Madsger's the best. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7160.54s)]
*  He's great. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7161.54s)]
*  I love that dude. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7162.54s)]
*  Yeah, he's great on Jimmy Dore Show. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7163.74s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever seen him on the Jimmy Dore Show. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7165.74s)]
*  Jimmy Dore has a YouTube channel, like a political thing, and Kurt is like his sidekick. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7168.24s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7172.14s)]
*  And so Kurt is always chiming in about things. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7173.14s)]
*  But what's interesting is I've been friends with Kurt for a long time, and now whenever [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7175.24s)]
*  I talk to Kurt, he's always fucking scaring the shit out of me because he's so well read [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7180.74s)]
*  about what's going on in the world. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7186.86s)]
*  Kurt Madsger was the first person that contacted me about this restrict bill, which is what [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7189.1s)]
*  they're using to say they need to stop things like TikTok. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7193.34s)]
*  And then you go into what the restrict bill is, you're like, oh my god, this has nothing [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7197.1s)]
*  to do with TikTok. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7200.14s)]
*  They want the ability to lock down anything that's on social media and stop people from [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7202.1s)]
*  spreading information that's dangerous to whatever narrative they're trying to push. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7206.42s)]
*  And we went over it in depth yesterday. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7209.54s)]
*  It's fucking terrifying. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7211.66s)]
*  The ambiguity, the way that they're able to frame what they're able to target. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7213.9400000000005s)]
*  It's like, holy shit. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7221.06s)]
*  Don't come down to keywords, I'm sure. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7222.14s)]
*  But he's- [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7224.02s)]
*  Just keywords. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7225.02s)]
*  Madsger is so involved in that world now because he's on Jimmy's show that he's always looking [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7226.02s)]
*  at corruption and this and that and what's happening in Ukraine and what's actually happening. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7231.0s)]
*  It's a comedy? [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7235.06s)]
*  It's a comedy, right? [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7236.06s)]
*  It is a comedy. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7237.06s)]
*  Well, it's a political show, a political social show, where Jimmy Dore is a comic and Madsger [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7238.06s)]
*  is a great comic. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7245.26s)]
*  And the two of them together, they just talk shit and laugh about how fucking crazy modern [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7246.26s)]
*  day politics and influence and insider trading and all the shit that's going on and Sam [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7252.780000000001s)]
*  Bank from Freed and FDX and where the money was coming from and how they were all doing [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7257.46s)]
*  it and how they got away with it. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7261.14s)]
*  He scares the shit out of me every time I talk to him. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7262.860000000001s)]
*  When I get a text from Kurt, I'm like, oh, Jesus Christ, I'm going to go fucking panic [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7265.22s)]
*  now. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7269.1s)]
*  I just start reading his stuff. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7270.1s)]
*  Have you heard about this? [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7271.1s)]
*  Have you seen this? [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7272.1s)]
*  I'm like, no, don't do this to me. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7273.1s)]
*  I know, Kurt on coffee is the best. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7275.42s)]
*  But no, it was really a good time because we'd sit and watch these, think of jokes, [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7278.42s)]
*  all the jokes about this old porn and it was great. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7283.46s)]
*  So I was very fortunate to be brought into that. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7286.1s)]
*  And then comedy- [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7288.18s)]
*  Because that was early on. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7289.18s)]
*  That was a long time ago. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7290.18s)]
*  It was a long time ago now. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7291.18s)]
*  Because I would do spots late at the Comedy Cellar and that's when Dave would be there. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7292.860000000001s)]
*  And so I would do my set and then watch his set and then we would hang out, talk jokes [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7299.900000000001s)]
*  and stuff afterwards. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7304.78s)]
*  So I was very fortunate in that way because he's an all-time great. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7306.5599999999995s)]
*  He's one of my favorite people too. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7310.98s)]
*  He really is. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7313.98s)]
*  I don't see him that much anymore because I don't put him late at the Cellar, but just [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7314.98s)]
*  really great times, man. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7318.78s)]
*  He's a wonderful guy. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7322.0199999999995s)]
*  And he's so sweet to everybody. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7323.66s)]
*  When he does clubs, he brings candy for the waitresses and stuff. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7325.46s)]
*  He's just so nice, man. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7329.62s)]
*  All that guy cares about is stand-up comedy. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7332.5s)]
*  He came here and he takes care of his mom in New York. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7336.94s)]
*  And all he cares about is just getting up and doing jokes. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7340.5s)]
*  And his attitude was like, I want to go on early. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7342.98s)]
*  These young guys, let them have their spots. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7345.74s)]
*  I don't want to interrupt. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7348.34s)]
*  I don't want to get in the way. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7349.34s)]
*  I'll just kind of come in and just work on my new stuff. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7350.34s)]
*  So he'll get up at one o'clock in the morning. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7353.22s)]
*  So it's like one o'clock in the morning at the Cellar. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7355.26s)]
*  There's 14 people there and it's David Tells on stage. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7357.02s)]
*  One of the best comics that's ever lived. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7359.54s)]
*  It's unreal. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7361.38s)]
*  He's there because that's when he wants to go up. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7363.26s)]
*  He can go up at 9 p.m., hot crowd, and just murder every night with old material. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7364.82s)]
*  He does not. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7370.9400000000005s)]
*  No. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7371.9400000000005s)]
*  He's a fucking real pro. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7372.9400000000005s)]
*  He likes to go on late and it's unbelievable. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7374.38s)]
*  And it's really a great example for up-and-coming comics. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7377.66s)]
*  You get to see how that guy does it. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7381.14s)]
*  When you think you're pretty good, you know he's going up to a tired crowd. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7384.38s)]
*  I was opening for him at the Wilbur in Boston. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7390.62s)]
*  And for some reason they didn't have a liquor license or something. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7394.18s)]
*  Really? [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7397.46s)]
*  The Wilbur didn't? [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7398.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it didn't. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7399.46s)]
*  For some reason when we were there. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7400.58s)]
*  So it was a two-man show. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7403.3s)]
*  I was going up and then I was bringing him up. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7404.38s)]
*  And there's no liquor. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7407.26s)]
*  So I was like, oh, this is probably going to be pretty tough. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7408.26s)]
*  So I go up and do 20 and I'm murdering him, killing really hard. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7409.62s)]
*  And I bring him up. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7412.42s)]
*  And then I'm sitting on the side of the stage, kind of feeling good about myself. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7414.0599999999995s)]
*  I go, you know what? [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7417.82s)]
*  Time is coming. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7419.22s)]
*  I'm doing pretty good for myself. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7420.62s)]
*  The way that I slayed that cold crowd was pretty awesome. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7422.34s)]
*  I think I'm on my way. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7426.780000000001s)]
*  And then I started just listening to him and the laughs he was getting. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7428.26s)]
*  And I was getting laughs, but he was just getting the depth of the laughter. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7432.3s)]
*  And with every joke was hitting harder and harder and his setups were hitting. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7436.46s)]
*  And then the punch lines obviously hitting and then two tags on the end hitting. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7441.14s)]
*  It's like the guy does comedy the way that Pacquiao used to fight. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7445.5s)]
*  He would like hit you and then turn two more times, turn you and then two or three more times [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7449.099999999999s)]
*  and then get out. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7453.34s)]
*  And you're like, the guy's just like on the ground by that point. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7454.26s)]
*  So he's doing that. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7457.82s)]
*  And I'm just listening. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7458.74s)]
*  And it's like, I'm at the cellar late, so I know the material, but he's doing material [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7459.86s)]
*  I haven't heard before. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7465.26s)]
*  And he's murdering at a level that's just crazy. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7467.0599999999995s)]
*  And at the end of it, it's like none of those people in that crowd even remembered who I was. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7470.7s)]
*  It's like that's how good he is. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7476.14s)]
*  Yeah, they leave the show go, Oh my God, David, that was the best. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7480.1s)]
*  The first guy was OK. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7483.22s)]
*  First guy's pretty funny. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7484.860000000001s)]
*  I don't even think they remember there was a first guy. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7485.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's like that's how hard he hits. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7487.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he went up at the improv one night and it was the improv in Hollywood. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7490.3s)]
*  And it was a pretty late show. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7494.38s)]
*  And I had gone on earlier in the night and then I saw David at the bar. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7496.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm like, what's up? What's going on? When are you going up? [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7501.1s)]
*  He's like going. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7503.02s)]
*  And the crowd was kind of tired and a couple of people went up. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7503.98s)]
*  And, you know, like when you have a late show, like a 10 p.m. show, when it gets like 11, 30, 12 o'clock, [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7506.66s)]
*  people are checking their watch. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7512.58s)]
*  They got to be up at seven and they start thinking about leaving. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7513.74s)]
*  And then I was like, wow, this crowd's getting kind of done. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7517.0199999999995s)]
*  Night's done. And a tell went up and it was like he plugged the audience back into the electricity. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7520.259999999999s)]
*  It's like, yeah, and just fucking murdered effortless murder. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7526.219999999999s)]
*  And just tag after tag. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7532.42s)]
*  And I remember sitting in the back going, my God, this guy's a treasure. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7534.18s)]
*  A treasure is the right word for him. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7537.42s)]
*  National treasure. National treasure. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7539.34s)]
*  National treasure. And I don't think enough people understand it. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7541.22s)]
*  Like he should be in arenas. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7544.26s)]
*  David Tell should be selling out Madison Square Garden anytime he wants to instantly. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7546.3s)]
*  And he's doing clubs and he loves it. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7550.54s)]
*  And he's happy. Right. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7552.74s)]
*  He's like a real club comic. He likes doing all the sets. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7554.22s)]
*  He likes doing four shows in a weekend. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7557.02s)]
*  He likes it. Yeah. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7559.1s)]
*  And he's not a fame guy either. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7560.9800000000005s)]
*  Like he's not a fame guy. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7563.06s)]
*  Like he'll talk to me. He talked to like he's he's not a fame guy at all. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7564.14s)]
*  We were at the cellar, you know, the cellar. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7567.860000000001s)]
*  It's like Chris Rock will come there like he's not there all the time. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7570.5s)]
*  But it's not, you know, if you see Chris Rock there, you know, it's not crazy. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7573.9800000000005s)]
*  It's not uncommon. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7578.58s)]
*  Chappelle the same way. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7579.7s)]
*  If you see him there, it's not crazy. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7580.9800000000005s)]
*  Seinfeld once in a while. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7583.1s)]
*  But Adam Sandler was there one time. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7584.9400000000005s)]
*  And it's like they sit at the back table and you just feel the energy [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7587.38s)]
*  when there's somebody like a Chappelle or Chris Rock back. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7590.3s)]
*  The energy kind of changed. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7592.66s)]
*  Like people perk up that the people who are there eating, everybody notices [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7593.62s)]
*  the comics or their antennas go up. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7598.42s)]
*  And I understand, you know, the energy. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7600.34s)]
*  So Adam Sandler happens to be back there and he's never there. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7602.26s)]
*  And Dave walks in with his, you know, goes to the bar to get his coffee [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7606.62s)]
*  or whatever hood up. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7609.9800000000005s)]
*  And Adam Sandler goes, Dave, Dave, Dave. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7611.26s)]
*  Dave and Dave's just in his own world. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7617.78s)]
*  A tell, a tell. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7619.46s)]
*  And finally, he comes up to me and he goes, hey, Dave, he goes, hey, what's up, Adam? [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7621.74s)]

*  And then he goes outside and smokes. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7629.34s)]
*  He just cuts out and goes outside. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7631.46s)]
*  Everybody's like angling to see if they can talk to Adam Sandler. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7633.58s)]
*  And Adam Sandler is like screaming Dave's name until he gets his attention. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7636.9400000000005s)]

*  It's great. It's classic. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7645.42s)]
*  He's a real comics comic. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7646.82s)]
*  Yeah. Like the best version of a comics comics. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7648.86s)]
*  Like a master of his craft. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7651.9s)]
*  Doesn't get the appreciation that he deserves and who is universally respected. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7654.62s)]
*  By his peers. Yeah. That's Dave. Yeah. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7660.219999999999s)]

*  And unfortunately, also, he has a lot of babies. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7672.74s)]
*  Like what Patrice would call babies was like someone who like copies your style. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7675.9s)]
*  You'll hear guys talking like this. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7679.66s)]
*  They have a set up and a punch line. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7682.38s)]

*  You got to stop after a while. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7690.74s)]
*  It's hard because you want to go because he'll turn you if you're watching him. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7691.98s)]
*  It's like he'll turn you. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7695.26s)]
*  You when you're watching another comic, you'll go, what's his angle on this? [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7696.9s)]
*  What's his angle on this? [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7700.9s)]
*  I'm curious to see what his angle is on. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7701.9s)]
*  Even Chris Rock, some of the greats, you know, [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7703.78s)]
*  but with a tell you go down, if you go down with that mindset, [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7705.74s)]
*  like I wonder what his angle is on this after three jokes, [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7708.26s)]
*  you just become a fan because you're gut laughing, right? [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7712.0199999999995s)]
*  You're gut laughing like the rest of the people in the crowd. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7715.54s)]
*  You know what I mean? So it's just it's that he turns you into a comedy fan. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7718.66s)]
*  And then the problem is you go on thinking about his ass [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7722.42s)]
*  and then you compare your own material like, oh, my God, I hate my jokes. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7726.74s)]
*  Oh, my God. That's the biggest thing. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7730.5s)]
*  It's like his throwaway stuff is your is better than your main stuff. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7732.58s)]
*  Well, that's one of the best things about those showcase style clubs [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7737.46s)]
*  is that you do work with these killers and you have to sort of reevaluate [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7741.22s)]
*  your material. Yeah. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7744.82s)]

*  And he got kicked off SNL devastated. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7788.139999999999s)]
*  But he emerged like a fucking phoenix from the ashes. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7790.66s)]
*  He's way better than he was back then. Right. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7794.74s)]
*  He's like one of the best top 10 comics on planet Earth. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7796.78s)]
*  Yeah. Without doubt right now. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7800.7s)]
*  He's fantastic. And he came out of that pressure. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7802.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And now he's the one who like freaks people out. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7804.82s)]
*  Yeah. Only know that Shane's going up. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7808.139999999999s)]
*  He's going to do that Trump impression when he does Trump at the debates. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7809.78s)]
*  Like the fucking show is over. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7813.46s)]
*  And it's not just that. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7815.5s)]
*  It's very punched up all the way through. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7816.42s)]
*  It's like that New York style. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7818.06s)]
*  And he came out of Philly. Yeah. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7819.34s)]
*  And it's great. It's great to see his success. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7821.14s)]
*  It's punched up. And it's also like it's so smart. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7823.5s)]
*  Like he's got a bit about George Washington, [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7827.9s)]
*  because Shane has a deep knowledge of history. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7830.58s)]
*  He really reads a lot about history, knows a lot about history. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7833.02s)]
*  So he can incorporate that. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7835.82s)]
*  And there's like layers to his comedy because of his understanding of things. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7837.78s)]
*  So he's he's setting things up. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7842.02s)]
*  But he's doing it in a fun way where even the setups are funny. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7844.06s)]
*  Yeah. So that's a big thing. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7847.02s)]
*  That's a discipline in and of itself to get a laugh on the way to the punchline [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7848.860000000001s)]
*  and to structure it that way until like reevaluating. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7853.38s)]
*  Go, OK, maybe there's probably a funnier way to get into this. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7856.820000000001s)]
*  Let me figure out the right way. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7859.34s)]
*  It's nice to see the funniest guys win. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7861.700000000001s)]
*  Mm hmm. Yeah, it really is. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7863.46s)]
*  Well, don't you think that in stand up, there is a meritocracy in stand up. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7864.780000000001s)]
*  That's undeniable. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7867.9400000000005s)]
*  There's guys who get more popular than maybe the like the Attell guys. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7868.9800000000005s)]
*  And so you go, well, maybe there's not a meritocracy. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7874.14s)]
*  But for us, it is for like the best guys are always the best guys. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7876.46s)]
*  If you you're sitting around with a group of comics and you just watch the show, [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7880.580000000001s)]
*  like, oh, my God, this guy fucking kill. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7883.900000000001s)]
*  Right. Like, oh, shit, that was good. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7885.860000000001s)]
*  Like that meritocracy, like that exists in stand up. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7887.14s)]
*  Like if you if you're not funny, if it doesn't work, nobody cares about you. Right. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7891.42s)]
*  And that's just how it is. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7895.06s)]
*  There's no no cult of personality that can carry you over. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7896.580000000001s)]
*  There's no you can't dress in a way that's going to get people to like you more. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7899.820000000001s)]
*  You know, like, boy, you see his outfit. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7903.82s)]
*  Nobody gives a fuck about your outfit. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7905.26s)]
*  Attell wears the same goddamn outfit every night. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7906.7s)]
*  He probably has like three versions of that black button up shirt, [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7909.22s)]
*  three versions of that baseball hat, the same goddamn jeans. Right. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7912.5s)]
*  Right. Doesn't matter. It doesn't. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7915.9800000000005s)]
*  He's so nondescript. Yeah. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7917.34s)]
*  It's almost like he wants to blend in. Right. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7919.5s)]
*  He wants to blend in and wants to just be the vehicle for the material. Right. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7922.06s)]
*  But to your point, there's a there's a skill set. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7925.86s)]
*  Yeah. And we all know the skill set. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7927.74s)]
*  And other hardcore comedy fans know the skill. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7930.06s)]
*  Yes. And the waitresses. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7932.86s)]
*  Yes. Because they see it every night. Oh, yeah. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7934.62s)]
*  Yeah. So they know smoke and mirrors. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7936.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And they know what's real. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7937.78s)]
*  Do you know Eleanor Kerrigan? Yes. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7939.0599999999995s)]
*  So Eleanor was a waitress at the comedy store for like, I don't know, [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7941.299999999999s)]
*  like maybe 10 years before she ever did stand up. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7945.219999999999s)]
*  And we were always I would go to Eleanor when someone would say, [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7948.139999999999s)]
*  oh, this guy's really funny. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7951.94s)]
*  And I'd go to have you seen him? [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7953.099999999999s)]
*  And she goes, oh, fuck. And I go, really? Yeah. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7954.54s)]
*  And she was, yes. All tricks and bullshit. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7956.78s)]
*  Yeah. Smoke and mirrors. Yeah. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7958.46s)]
*  I'm like, whoa. Yeah. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7959.66s)]
*  She'd have like a fucking tray of drinks. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7960.9s)]
*  Yeah. He sucks. They know. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7962.66s)]
*  And then you would watch me. Oh, my God. She's right. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7963.7s)]
*  Like, so she was a comedy fan. Right. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7966.139999999999s)]
*  From being there and like doing. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7968.9s)]
*  And then eventually we all knew she was hilarious. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7971.94s)]
*  It just took time for her to have the courage to go on stage. Right. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7975.0199999999995s)]
*  Now she's a headliner, killing all over the country. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7978.5s)]
*  It's amazing. But knowing her as an open mic'er [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7980.78s)]
*  and knowing her as a waitress before she was an open mic'er, [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7985.099999999999s)]
*  she was one of the people that I would go to if I would ask her, like, hey, [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7988.34s)]
*  how did this person do? How was this person? [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7992.54s)]
*  And she would tell you in a way that like she wasn't jealous [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7994.660000000001s)]
*  because she wasn't a comedy, but she was like deeply embedded in the comedy world. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=7998.3s)]
*  Because you can kill without a skill set. Yes. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8002.780000000001s)]
*  You can kill without a skill set. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8005.34s)]
*  With personality and goofiness. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8006.580000000001s)]
*  And yeah, you can. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8009.5s)]
*  And some people, that's like their whole and some people are great at it. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8011.1s)]
*  Right. And that's their whole career. Right. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8014.02s)]
*  You know, but there's there's something about the well crafted act. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8016.18s)]
*  Yeah. To me, it's like I will watch that every time. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8020.820000000001s)]
*  Me too. Yeah. I find out someone really good is going on stage. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8024.1s)]
*  Well, I'm going to stick around. Yeah. I need to see that. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8027.58s)]
*  And if that's the real education that a guy gets if you're in New York, [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8030.14s)]
*  like if you are, you know, you're on these shows with Greer Barnes. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8034.62s)]

*  So I'll see Colin Quinn more. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8072.94s)]

*  And when I did Tough Crowd, [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8080.219999999999s)]
*  Colin would do stand up in front of the audience. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8081.62s)]
*  And when I'd say like he fucking murdered so hard. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8085.379999999999s)]
*  And then the show would go on. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8090.7s)]
*  And I wanted to say, you know, this show is great. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8092.62s)]
*  But it's not as good as this. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8095.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Like it's almost like people don't know. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8096.66s)]
*  Yeah. Like he's just the host of the standup. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8099.78s)]
*  And he's kind of the ringleader. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8101.74s)]
*  And so he's wrangling all these cats and get all these comics [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8102.94s)]
*  to stay on topic of all the different things they're talking about on Tough Crowd. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8105.78s)]
*  But I'm like, my God, the best thing is the warm up. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8109.0599999999995s)]
*  And Colin's famous. Yeah, he's famous. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8112.219999999999s)]
*  He's just you know what I mean? [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8114.38s)]
*  But I don't think that people appreciate him at the level. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8115.34s)]
*  I don't think so. They need to appreciate him. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8119.46s)]
*  It's like a tell. It's like, yeah. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8120.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's the same kind of thing. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8122.139999999999s)]
*  Like we appreciate it. Yeah. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8123.0199999999995s)]
*  Like if we know that Colin's going on stage, everyone's going to watch him. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8124.34s)]
*  But I think for the average. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8127.3s)]
*  But it's also that's why they're so good, [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8128.94s)]
*  because they don't have this desire for fame. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8131.5s)]
*  They just have desire to do great work. Right. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8134.14s)]
*  And they're not thinking about promoting. They're not. Right. Right. Right. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8136.3s)]
*  Is Colin even on social media? [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8138.94s)]
*  I don't think I've ever seen a post of his. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8140.7s)]
*  I think he's on Twitter. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8142.86s)]
*  I don't know if he's on Instagram. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8143.98s)]
*  I don't think I've ever even saw a thing that he put up. Yeah. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8145.3s)]
*  But he's universally respected amongst comedians. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8150.06s)]
*  It's just like he's a purist. Yeah. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8153.7s)]
*  And he's only any he does his one man shows like Red State, Blue State. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8156.34s)]
*  Brilliant stuff. Super prolific. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8160.219999999999s)]
*  Always working and writing. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8162.54s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Hitching. Yeah. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8164.0199999999995s)]
*  That's that's one of the real beautiful things about these communities, [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8165.86s)]
*  like a community. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8171.219999999999s)]
*  And that's what I'm trying to establish here in Austin. Right. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8172.82s)]
*  That's why I put together that club. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8176.299999999999s)]
*  And that's why I set it up. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8178.38s)]
*  So there's open mic night two nights a week. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8179.58s)]
*  That's every Sunday, every Monday. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8181.74s)]
*  That's really great. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8183.299999999999s)]
*  It's like all the people that work there, like the doorman and all the [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8183.82s)]
*  those are all comics. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8187.54s)]
*  And they auditioned as comics to get that job. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8188.78s)]
*  Great. So they had to do sets in front of Adam Egan. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8192.02s)]
*  They do these sets. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8194.74s)]
*  People evaluate their sets. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8196.14s)]
*  And then you have the ability to do these door guy showcases [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8197.7s)]
*  where you're going in front of fucking packed houses. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8201.66s)]
*  And it's it's amazing. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8204.1s)]
*  And it's good that there's a ladder in place, you know, [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8205.3s)]
*  because I went through that in the in the city as far as like in 2008. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8207.9s)]
*  I did Live at Gotham. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8211.42s)]
*  You know, me and Nate did it the same year, Live at Gotham. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8212.460000000001s)]
*  Then 2010, I did a Comedy Central half hour. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8214.62s)]
*  I don't know if they even still have that anymore. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8216.94s)]
*  But a Gotham set is eight minutes, half hours, 22 minutes. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8219.62s)]
*  Then you work your way up to an hour. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8222.74s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's like there's a ladder to climb. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8224.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah. With your skill set. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8227.54s)]
*  Yeah. Unfortunately, it doesn't really exist anymore. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8229.18s)]
*  Well, one of the things we want to establish here is we want to want to have a real [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8231.74s)]
*  clear path to becoming a professional. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8234.9s)]
*  And that if you put together like a real set [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8237.62s)]
*  and then you start doing guest sets on the big shows in the big room. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8240.66s)]
*  And then maybe a guy like David Lucas or a guy like Brian Simpson will take you on the road. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8244.26s)]
*  Say you want to open for me in Seattle and then you go with him. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8249.94s)]
*  It flies you out. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8252.86s)]
*  And then you get to see what it's like to be in a new state and a new crowd. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8253.78s)]
*  And that feeling. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8258.02s)]
*  And then you'll have a clear path to being a professional. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8258.66s)]
*  And the more professionals there are, the better it is for everybody. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8262.26s)]
*  The more guys make it, the more girls make it, the more it is. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8265.9s)]
*  It's just better for comedy all around. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8269.26s)]
*  And it's better that it's nice that you're doing it according to the skill set, [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8271.54s)]
*  because some guys develop like I think Shane developed fast. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8274.460000000001s)]
*  He developed very quickly, not that he didn't put in the work, [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8278.140000000001s)]
*  but some guys are like that. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8280.18s)]
*  Some guys run a four to 40. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8281.380000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? Right. Right. Right. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8283.18s)]
*  So it's like if you're developing fast, like Tommy John again was a guy like that. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8284.02s)]
*  I think he did a Comedy Central half hour, like three years into comedy. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8286.86s)]
*  But he just he had it. He was very good. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8291.460000000001s)]
*  I don't know him. Yeah. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8293.5s)]
*  He's a writer now. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8295.140000000001s)]
*  But he was not doing stand up anymore. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8296.42s)]
*  I think he's kind of dabbling, but he was writing on like network shows. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8298.380000000001s)]
*  That's a trap. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8301.46s)]
*  Supremely talented person. That's a trap. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8302.019999999999s)]
*  Writing on a network show. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8305.019999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of guys who are really funny guys. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8305.98s)]
*  Do you know Owen Smith? Yes. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8308.74s)]
*  Owen Smith is one of the best comics a lot. Yeah. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8310.699999999999s)]
*  And I would see Owen at the store and I'm like, Jesus Christ, [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8312.5s)]
*  how is this guy not world famous? Right. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8316.06s)]
*  I didn't understand he has the personality, the charisma, the timing, [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8319.9s)]
*  the material, the writing, everything, everything. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8324.339999999998s)]
*  But he works in Hollywood and he's always writing. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8328.02s)]
*  And so he's always writing on these sitcoms and he exists in that world. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8331.619999999999s)]
*  And it's a steady paycheck. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8335.539999999999s)]
*  He's got a family. Right. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8336.94s)]
*  And you get trapped. Yeah. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8338.34s)]
*  And I've seen guys get sucked into that and they don't get the career that they do. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8340.14s)]
*  It wouldn't be a trap for a less talented person. Right. Right. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8344.7s)]
*  But for him, right. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8347.619999999999s)]
*  It's like he should be right. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8348.66s)]
*  There's some guys that are really good writers, [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8350.5s)]
*  but they're just not comfortable performing and they don't like it. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8352.02s)]
*  And it gives them anxiety. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8355.1s)]
*  And they would rather just write. Right. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8356.14s)]
*  They're more introverted. Yeah. But they're really talented. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8357.54s)]
*  For them, that's great. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8359.980000000001s)]
*  But there's guys that are talented performers that get that gig. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8361.34s)]
*  And then they get that steady paycheck every week. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8365.86s)]
*  And then you get in that system where, oh, there's a new show. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8368.42s)]
*  We want you to be a co-executive of this or that. Right. Right. Right. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8371.5s)]
*  And then, you know, you go, well, the wife wants a pool. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8374.94s)]
*  You know, that's right. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8377.42s)]
*  The next thing you know, you're trapped. That's right. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8378.220000000001s)]
*  And then you see these other guys that started even after you. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8380.18s)]
*  And they're doing arenas. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8383.140000000001s)]
*  And you're like, oh, my God, if I stayed on the path, I would be doing arenas. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8384.54s)]
*  Right. Like in my mind, Owen Smith should be doing arenas. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8387.5s)]
*  Like 100 percent. When I see him at the store, I'm like, Jesus, that guy's good. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8390.26s)]
*  Yeah. But he's on that network path. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8393.34s)]
*  Right. On that sitcom. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8397.26s)]
*  I think he's a showrunner now, which is great. That's great. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8398.42s)]
*  I mean, that's that's really good money. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8400.98s)]
*  Yeah. But it's that stability thing. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8402.5s)]
*  As a comic, I want the world to know. Right. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8404.46s)]
*  I want the world to know how good that guy is. Right. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8407.06s)]
*  But it's the stability versus the, you know, rolling the dice. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8410.14s)]
*  It's a trap. Just because you're that good [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8413.82s)]
*  doesn't mean you're going to get that kind of exposure. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8415.82s)]
*  Maybe eventually it'll happen. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8418.34s)]
*  It's way more likely you might have to walk through fire. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8420.14s)]
*  You're going to walk through fire. Yeah. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8422.82s)]
*  No matter what, if you don't have a draw, but you do have the skill set. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8423.98s)]
*  You're walking through fire. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8427.3s)]
*  I don't give a fuck because you're going to do a half filled show in Columbus, Ohio. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8428.38s)]
*  They have to paper the room because no one knows who you are yet. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8432.539999999999s)]
*  And even if you're a fucking killer, it takes years and years. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8435.06s)]
*  Yeah. Which is the problem, right? [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8438.5s)]
*  It's like it kind of takes like 10 years of that grind on the road [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8440.02s)]
*  before the word gets out. Right. Or a few years. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8443.46s)]
*  At least. And that's hard to do when you're used to those steady checks. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8445.7s)]
*  And it's really hard to do if you have people relying on you. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8449.7s)]
*  Yeah. That's the hard thing. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8452.34s)]
*  Because then you have to explain it to them. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8453.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah. You're not going to. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8454.740000000002s)]
*  Yeah. You're just going to you're going to take that job. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8456.26s)]
*  And you're going to hope that something magic happens [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8458.34s)]
*  and it allows you to like leapfrog everything and then just go straight [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8460.980000000001s)]
*  into big theaters and arenas. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8464.02s)]
*  But it doesn't happen. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8465.7s)]
*  Really doesn't. Yeah. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8467.820000000002s)]
*  Because you're just not focused on. I get it. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8469.26s)]
*  Yeah. And that's one of the things that I tell these young comics today. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8471.140000000001s)]
*  I'm like the best thing that you could do is concentrate on yourself. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8474.7s)]
*  Meaning that work on your act. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8478.140000000001s)]
*  And instead of like hoping to get hired to do something, [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8480.02s)]
*  create your own thing, create a podcast. Right. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8483.58s)]
*  And that's the most freedom you're ever going to have. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8485.980000000001s)]
*  And it's the best. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8488.66s)]
*  And you can make it whatever you want. Yeah. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8489.42s)]
*  You know, it doesn't have to be, you know, and then it's a lot of trial and error. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8490.900000000001s)]
*  For sure. You know, and it grows, it grows over time. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8495.460000000001s)]
*  And but even that, like I know comics that like want to start a podcast now. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8498.34s)]
*  And then they're like, oh, only 2000 people are downloading my shit. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8502.34s)]
*  Like, yeah, next week it'll be 2100. Right. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8505.66s)]
*  And that's how it goes. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8508.460000000001s)]
*  Or sometimes you need to end the podcast and shift to something, [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8509.34s)]
*  you know, shift to something else, like another idea. Maybe. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8511.94s)]
*  But I think with podcasts, the most important thing is consistency. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8515.140000000001s)]
*  Consistency. Yeah. And a lot of guys, they start out and they do it [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8517.58s)]
*  for a little while and then they lose focus and they stop doing it. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8520.1s)]
*  And I'm going to restart my podcast. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8522.82s)]
*  Like when people say that, that's the feeling that I used to get [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8524.26s)]
*  when people stop fighting and then they would they would take like three years off. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8527.94s)]
*  And come back to the gym again. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8532.06s)]
*  I'm thinking about taking some fights. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8533.14s)]
*  My. OK. Right. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8534.3s)]
*  Yeah, you're lost. Yeah. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8537.26s)]
*  Because you like you got to stay on the path. Right. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8538.539999999999s)]
*  Because like we're talking about, you're building a mountain out of layers of pain. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8541.94s)]
*  Right. And you take, you know, a few years off or whatever you're taking off. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8546.06s)]
*  Those fucking those layers don't stay at the level they were at before. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8550.1s)]
*  They deteriorate. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8553.9s)]
*  Now you have to rebuild. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8554.94s)]
*  And that's a daunting process, I think. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8556.98s)]
*  But that's probably the case with anything that's hard to write. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8559.1s)]
*  I think that's true. Yeah, I think that's true. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8561.62s)]
*  But I think it's wonderful that you're creating a environment [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8563.380000000001s)]
*  where people can work hard, raise their level, [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8566.94s)]
*  and then they get to another level. Yeah. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8570.380000000001s)]
*  And they're working their way up. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8572.62s)]
*  Also very important as far as motivation. See killers. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8574.300000000001s)]
*  They're getting to see these people like Big Jay Okerson was there last night. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8577.900000000001s)]
*  One of the funniest. Oh, he was amazing. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8581.58s)]
*  Ari Shafir was there last night. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8583.86s)]
*  So they're getting to see these people that they've seen on television, [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8585.660000000002s)]
*  seen on YouTube. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8589.42s)]
*  And it's exciting to see them in real life and know. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8590.86s)]
*  And if that person comes up to them and goes, hey, man, I love that bit. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8593.3s)]
*  Oh, you're a young person coming up and someone tells you that your thing is good. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8597.02s)]
*  Right. Oh, it's so exciting. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8600.9s)]
*  But it's a very unselfish thing for you to do, [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8602.98s)]
*  because you could be doing whatever you want to now. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8605.42s)]
*  And to put your focus back on that by pulling other people up. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8608.34s)]
*  It's also selfish. It's also selfish because it helps me. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8612.1s)]
*  It's I wouldn't say it's selfish, but it's not like I don't benefit from it. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8615.42s)]
*  I benefit from it by having that environment where I can work out. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8619.14s)]
*  And I know that if like if you put together a gym filled with killers, [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8622.82s)]
*  you could say like, oh, well, that, you know, that's great that you did that [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8626.34s)]
*  for those guys. Yeah, but it's for me, too. Right. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8629.5s)]
*  Because I want that's what you need. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8631.539999999999s)]
*  If you I always tell comics like you can't be the funniest guy in Poughkeepsie, [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8633.74s)]
*  New York, right, because like there's no one else there. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8638.34s)]
*  And so it's hard to develop like a real act when like if you want to learn [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8641.14s)]
*  jujitsu and you're only training with white belts, you're only going to get so. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8646.42s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. You got to be around killers. Right. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8649.54s)]
*  You got to be around killers. And that's the thing with comedy. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8651.78s)]
*  And I think it's probably the thing with music. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8653.94s)]
*  And it's probably with everything else. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8655.62s)]
*  You get inspired by the excellence of other people around you, [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8657.1s)]
*  and it raises your own personal expectations. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8660.02s)]
*  That's absolutely true. Yeah. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8662.82s)]
*  I know that just from wrestling, like you're wrestling in a tough, tougher. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8664.54s)]
*  You just become much, much tougher. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8667.14s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you came out of Ohio. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8669.98s)]
*  I mean, fucking animals come out of Ohio. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8671.18s)]
*  Jesus Christ is a long history of killer wrestlers that come out of Ohio. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8673.460000000001s)]
*  You are as tough as you're. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8678.460000000001s)]
*  And especially for a guy like me, athletically, I wasn't the most athletic guy. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8679.58s)]
*  So I really it really depended on the program in the room. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8683.06s)]
*  I was in a good program. I would have been I was tough. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8686.06s)]
*  When the program fell off, I wasn't as good. Wasn't as effective. Of course. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8688.7s)]
*  So it's hard to push yourself. Yeah. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8692.26s)]
*  You know, it's hard to push yourself to the level that a great room will push you [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8694.54s)]
*  by almost impossible. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8698.1s)]
*  That level of competition. And it's the same in standup. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8700.5s)]
*  You know, guys coming out of New York, you know, like it's like guys are good. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8702.82s)]
*  Mark Norman, Shane, you know, these guys, Sam Morell, [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8705.94s)]
*  these guys, Christie. Yeah. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8710.94s)]
*  These guys have all been on the show. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8712.34s)]
*  It's like these guys came up through that club system. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8713.5s)]
*  It's also the dance. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8716.86s)]
*  So it was my dance. It was my my roommate for 10 years. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8718.02s)]
*  I love Dan. Love him. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8721.82s)]
*  But it's also the camaraderie. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8723.06s)]
*  Like no one understands comics like comics do. Yeah. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8724.82s)]
*  So it's like that's a place where you can be yourself. Yeah. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8727.66s)]
*  You know, no matter what, you're around these people. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8730.22s)]
*  Like when I'm around comics, it's not like, oh, there's that Joe Rogan guy, [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8732.42s)]
*  the podcast guy. It's like, no, I'm just these are my friends. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8736.82s)]
*  It's normal. Right. Like I know you guys. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8740.02s)]
*  I've known everybody for 20 years. Right. You can hang out. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8741.62s)]
*  It's it's it's more comfortable. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8743.98s)]
*  It's like they're your peers. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8746.1s)]
*  That's your your group. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8747.94s)]
*  That's the other thing people don't realize, like how long we've known each other. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8749.58s)]
*  Yeah. A lot of us like I've known guys in New York, like I've known them for like [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8753.02s)]
*  20 since I've been there 20 years. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8756.54s)]
*  And it's like somebody new comes into this situation and it's all good. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8759.26s)]
*  But I don't I don't know if they realize how long we've been in that scene [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8761.78s)]
*  together in a long time. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8766.34s)]
*  It's a long way to the top. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8767.7s)]
*  If you want to rock and roll, it's a fucking long way. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8769.34s)]
*  It's not it's not something that's going to happen quickly. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8772.900000000001s)]
*  And everybody in this world wants things to happen quickly. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8775.7s)]
*  Yeah. They want to be a millionaire by the time they're 25. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8778.820000000002s)]
*  They want to they want to do this and that. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8781.300000000001s)]
*  I have all these expectations and aspirations, which is great. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8783.26s)]
*  It's great to be ambitious. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8786.300000000001s)]
*  But if you want to do that with comedy, you want to write material [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8787.26s)]
*  and you want your act to develop, that is a fucking grind. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8791.3s)]
*  You are you are running through rosebushes naked for years. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8795.5s)]
*  Yeah. And there's nothing other than that that's going to get you there. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8799.699999999999s)]
*  That's right. It's a process. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8804.22s)]
*  And it's like that's the thing. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8806.14s)]
*  You got to fall in love with the process. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8807.259999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And but that's also what what helps being around fun people, [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8808.98s)]
*  because even if it's like a brutal, bloody process, you still hang out [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8812.859999999999s)]
*  with the guys and talk shit and laugh and all kinds of personal shit [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8816.699999999999s)]
*  happens along the way, too. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8820.14s)]
*  And it's like you rely on these people for support or your friends or your peers [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8821.5s)]
*  and like picking you up and trying to turn it into a bit [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8825.26s)]
*  or trying to turn it into something, you know, fantastic. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8829.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. It's a fun gig, man. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8833.18s)]
*  It's a fun way to make a living. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8835.5s)]
*  And it's a fun way to get through life. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8837.14s)]
*  We were talking about last night where we just did a show [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8839.18s)]
*  and afterwards we're all sitting around relaxing and having fun smoking pot. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8841.58s)]
*  And I was like, you imagine living your whole life and never killing. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8845.699999999999s)]
*  You know, we went through that with the pandemic where like comedy was stopped. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8849.7s)]
*  And I was like, I guess maybe I'll never do comedy again. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8854.02s)]
*  Right. I tell the story. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8856.380000000001s)]
*  It's a crazy story where Ron White had kind of resigned himself to retirement. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8858.220000000001s)]
*  He's like, I think I'm done. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8862.42s)]
*  I mean, I fucking did it all. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8863.820000000002s)]
*  You know, blue collar tour. I got a jet. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8865.34s)]
*  I got a fucking fucking sell my boat. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8867.58s)]
*  He's like, I'm just going to fucking relax. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8870.060000000001s)]
*  I got money in the bank. I'm going to play golf. Right. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8871.5s)]
*  And then we did a show in November of 2020 [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8874.060000000001s)]
*  at the Vulcan Gas Company down the street on Sixth Street. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8877.7s)]
*  And Tony Hinchcliffe had the show. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8880.34s)]
*  He put it up and he put Ron White up. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8883.62s)]
*  And I was already talking about putting together a comedy club. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8885.7s)]
*  I was trying to find a spot. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8889.300000000001s)]
*  And then I was actually telling everybody, I think I found the spot. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8891.62s)]
*  And I wound up not using that place and getting another place. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8895.02s)]
*  But Ron goes on stage and he hadn't been on stage in like a long time, [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8898.820000000002s)]
*  like eight months or something like that. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8903.02s)]
*  Went on stage and fucking murdered. Wow. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8904.54s)]
*  Murdered. And then he comes off stage and he grabs me by the shoulders. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8907.42s)]
*  He goes, whatever the fuck we have to do to keep doing that, we're going to do it. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8911.18s)]
*  That's great. He goes, get your fucking club open. Let's go. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8915.5s)]
*  And I was like, God damn. That's great. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8918.58s)]
*  It's like he had electricity coming off. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8920.380000000001s)]
*  Because he went on stage. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8923.98s)]
*  It doesn't matter how much money you have. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8924.94s)]
*  It doesn't matter. Like that feeling, that feeling is what's important. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8926.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah. There's nothing like it. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8929.62s)]
*  It's also you understand more than anybody [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8931.14s)]
*  how hard it is to put all that stuff together and to figure out a way to say it [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8934.38s)]
*  in a way that's going to get the laughs and resonate. That's it. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8939.34s)]
*  That's really it. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8941.939999999999s)]
*  There's nothing like when you're sitting there and you're turning the bit, [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8942.82s)]
*  you're however you're doing it, writing it out. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8946.019999999999s)]
*  I do notes on my phone. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8948.019999999999s)]
*  But you're like kind of saying it in your head. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8949.539999999999s)]
*  And then you're like that moment where you're like, I think I got something here. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8951.939999999999s)]
*  I think I really got something here. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8955.3s)]
*  And then the satisfaction of taking that and trying it on stage [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8956.699999999999s)]
*  and then getting the you're like, OK, I got it. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8959.98s)]
*  I got a punch line. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8962.98s)]
*  And it's like now I'm going to keep coming. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8964.38s)]
*  I don't know what your process is, but mine is I just keep coming at it. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8967.3s)]
*  Just keep coming. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8970.14s)]
*  Yeah. Keep coming every morning. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8970.939999999999s)]
*  Jokes. Keep throwing jokes at it. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8972.58s)]
*  Keep asking questions about it. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8974.74s)]
*  And then when you when you have it, it's just there's no feeling like it. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8976.46s)]
*  Even fame, whatever. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8980.26s)]
*  It's like money. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8981.38s)]
*  It's like there's no feeling like having that bit [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8982.34s)]
*  and just having it murder like all the way through from beginning to end. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8985.939999999999s)]
*  Having a new tagline. Yeah. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8989.5s)]
*  That just yeah, just something that simple. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8991.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. It's the best. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8993.14s)]
*  I really love it. It's the best. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8994.859999999999s)]
*  I really love it. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8996.38s)]
*  Do you write in front of a computer? [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8997.18s)]
*  Do you write on a notebook? [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=8999.619999999999s)]
*  Do you just write on your phone? [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9001.019999999999s)]
*  How do you do it? I used to do journaling. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9002.22s)]
*  You know, I was like, you know, because coming up with premises, [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9003.66s)]
*  it's like there's so many funny things that happen to us every day [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9006.46s)]
*  or potentially funny things. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9009.22s)]
*  It's like just journaling makes you conscious of it [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9011.18s)]
*  because there's so many things that slip by. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9014.14s)]
*  Like on the way here, I had a [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9015.939999999999s)]
*  knuckle, brass knuckles, but there would. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9018.98s)]
*  I've worked hilarities in Cleveland and the owner, Nick Costas. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9021.46s)]
*  He gives me a gift every time I do it. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9024.699999999999s)]
*  I don't know if he does it for everybody, but [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9026.74s)]
*  the time before he gave me a baseball bat. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9028.66s)]
*  And this time it was wooden brass knuckles. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9030.699999999999s)]
*  He's a great he's a great guy. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9033.619999999999s)]
*  It's a fantastic club. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9035.06s)]
*  So he gives me these wooden brass knuckles. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9036.14s)]
*  And I'm going through security at Fort Lauderdale Airport to come here. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9037.939999999999s)]
*  And they flag my bag and they bring it over. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9041.14s)]
*  And the guy goes, what's what's this? [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9043.26s)]
*  I immediately go, Nick Costas, Hilarity. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9047.1s)]
*  I immediately give up his name and snitch. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9049.5s)]
*  I wear a wire. I wear a wire. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9051.94s)]
*  I am a snitch. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9053.7s)]
*  For wooden brass knuckles. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9055.02s)]
*  Wooden brass knuckles. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9056.38s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know how. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9057.5s)]
*  No, they're not brass. They're wooden. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9058.94s)]
*  And I don't know what how it hijack a plane. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9060.34s)]
*  It's like take this to Yemen or this guy gets a splinter. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9063.5s)]
*  You know, so it's like [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9066.98s)]
*  but they were like and I was rushed. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9069.58s)]
*  So he's like, do you want to check your bag or do you want? [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9071.34s)]
*  You could just give it up. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9073.94s)]
*  I'm like, I'll just give it, you know, just give it up. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9074.82s)]
*  But it's like a brass like for them to take that. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9076.94s)]
*  And I think they're wooden. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9080.140000000001s)]
*  He gave them to me wooden because so they would get through security. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9081.5s)]
*  You know, but for them to do it. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9084.82s)]
*  But like my point is that journaling, I never would have thought twice about that. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9086.220000000001s)]
*  But it's like journaling brings that out. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9089.78s)]
*  So sometimes I'll do that if I feel like nothing is happening. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9091.18s)]
*  But then I'll take bits on my phone and I'll just like I went to jury duty. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9094.7s)]
*  And I'll just I'm like, there's so many funny things here about jury duty, [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9100.300000000001s)]
*  trying to get out of it the way they threaten you in New York anyway. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9104.26s)]
*  They go, you have to serve or you're going to go to jail for a year. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9107.22s)]
*  It's like, really, they're going to have to pick a jury for my trial. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9109.58s)]
*  Is it really the case you go to jail for a year? [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9114.619999999999s)]
*  They say it's a year or a sixty thousand dollar fine or something like that. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9117.14s)]
*  It's like, I don't know, maybe sixty thousand was too high. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9121.46s)]
*  But it's like a year in prison and a fine or both. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9124.14s)]
*  The point is, they threaten you hard to make sure that you go to jury duty. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9127.26s)]
*  Oh, my God. It's like, I don't know if this is how much faith [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9131.06s)]
*  I have in the justice system with your threatening me, a private citizen [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9133.94s)]
*  for a year to come to jury duty anyway. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9137.18s)]
*  So you end up going and it's like as comics, we're in this conundrum [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9140.060000000001s)]
*  because it's like it could be a three week trial. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9145.1s)]
*  It's like, yeah, I cannot serve for three weeks. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9147.26s)]
*  I have road dates. Money is at stake. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9150.26s)]
*  Flights are booked. Yeah. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9152.460000000001s)]
*  Like all of this stuff matters to me. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9153.74s)]
*  Like I need this money. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9155.54s)]
*  So, you know, but they just don't care. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9156.94s)]
*  There's nobody to call. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9159.82s)]
*  There's nobody to complain to. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9161.34s)]
*  So it's like you come and you check in and you just hope [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9163.42s)]
*  that you're not called into the thing. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9167.58s)]
*  So we're sitting there and we're just waiting. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9169.78s)]
*  So but that's like there's so many funny with emotions [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9171.34s)]
*  and feelings that come through there. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9174.74s)]
*  And like, how do I get out of this? Right. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9176.3s)]
*  It's like a felony, a felony. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9178.42s)]
*  If you have a felony, you can't serve. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9182.06s)]
*  It's like I could sucker punch the bailiff. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9183.22s)]
*  I mean, it's like that's a felony. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9185.3s)]
*  He's supposed he's a cop. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9187.54s)]
*  He's like, you know, it's like and then you start punching that up [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9188.86s)]
*  and crafting it and then going in there. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9191.58s)]
*  And what really happened is I went in there and they go, [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9193.939999999999s)]
*  you know, we have a jury pool outside. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9197.179999999998s)]
*  We need to take them first. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9198.779999999999s)]
*  So instead of holding here, we'll see you guys tomorrow. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9200.22s)]
*  Meanwhile, I have to fly out the next day. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9202.98s)]
*  So I go to the bailiff. I go, hey, I can't come back tomorrow. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9205.22s)]
*  I'm sorry. I have to fly out. I cannot come back tomorrow. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9207.939999999999s)]
*  He goes, wait here. He goes. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9210.74s)]
*  He gets a piece of paper and he goes, gives this give this to holding downstairs. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9212.259999999998s)]
*  They might they might reissue you another date. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9216.019999999999s)]
*  They might cut you. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9219.46s)]
*  So I go, all right. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9220.900000000001s)]
*  So I go down there, I give it to her. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9221.94s)]
*  She's like, give me a minute. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9223.26s)]
*  Just sitting there waiting. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9224.460000000001s)]
*  And she comes back. She's like, see in four years. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9225.74s)]
*  You're that you're cut. Oh, thank God. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9228.42s)]
*  But that whole thing, like the tension of that, like that's [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9231.300000000001s)]
*  I'll put that on my phone and I'll just keep coming. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9235.140000000001s)]
*  Keep coming at it. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9237.7s)]
*  Mm hmm. Yeah, that's good. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9238.86s)]
*  That's a good way. Everybody has their own way. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9240.78s)]
*  You know, like I think what's your way? [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9243.060000000001s)]
*  I write in front of a computer. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9245.220000000001s)]
*  I sit down and I write. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9247.26s)]
*  I like I write about subjects and it's a lot of wasted time. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9248.86s)]
*  Like there's a lot of it that's fucking useless, [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9252.300000000001s)]
*  but I have to find out where the jokes are. Right. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9254.02s)]
*  So I'll write on a subject and I'll just start expanding on that subject. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9257.140000000001s)]
*  And then I'll come up with one funny thing and then I'll take that [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9262.74s)]
*  and I'll copy it and paste it into a new file. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9266.66s)]
*  And then I'll write with that thing, that like one paragraph that I think is funny. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9269.66s)]
*  And then I'll expand upon it and then I'll come back to it the next day [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9274.460000000001s)]
*  and I'll smoke some weed and drink a cup of coffee and stare at it some more. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9277.34s)]
*  And then I'll write a write like basically an essay. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9281.34s)]
*  And then in that essay, I'll find the funny stuff and extract it. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9284.78s)]
*  It's not a efficient process because it doesn't come out looking like stand up. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9288.58s)]
*  It's like basically I'm farming premises. Right. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9293.3s)]
*  And I'm doing it through just time and like forcing myself to sit in front of it. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9296.18s)]
*  And so I do it a lot of it at night, which is kind of hard because I'm tired. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9302.78s)]
*  And it's like sometimes I literally see myself [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9306.900000000001s)]
*  like nodding out in front of the computer while I'm writing. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9308.820000000002s)]
*  But if it's just one fucking line, like I have one line in one of my new jokes [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9311.660000000002s)]
*  that came from that and it fucking murders this one line that's like a new bit. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9317.380000000001s)]
*  And this one line like defines that bit. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9323.1s)]
*  And it came out of the middle of the night. Right. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9325.460000000001s)]
*  It was like two o'clock in the morning. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9327.380000000001s)]
*  And I'm just sitting there writing like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9328.94s)]
*  I go, there it is. There it is. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9331.820000000002s)]
*  That's what I was looking for. I'm panning for gold. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9333.42s)]
*  I love that. I'll find that I'll copy and paste it. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9335.74s)]
*  And then I put them all on my phone. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9337.82s)]
*  So then if you look at my phone, I go into like I have a material folder [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9340.7s)]
*  and it's all like stuff that I've written over the last few months. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9344.94s)]
*  That's great. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9348.82s)]
*  And it's like I go over those bits and then I know which ones are in the act right now. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9349.5s)]
*  And then the ones that aren't in the act, when I'm trying to add new stuff, [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9354.82s)]
*  then I'll take that. OK, let's talk about this. Boom. [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9357.94s)]
*  And then I'll put that up on the computer and then I'll start writing. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9361.34s)]
*  And then when I want something to be really memorized, like the note, [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9363.98s)]
*  the little Post-it notes or the little [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9368.06s)]
*  index cards, that's when I write down physically with my hand, [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9372.1s)]
*  because that's what really commits it to memory. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9376.859999999999s)]
*  Writing something down commits things to memory far better than any other way. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9379.02s)]
*  I think that's true. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9382.98s)]
*  So do you take a note card up with the new material on it? [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9384.58s)]
*  No. You're just developing, you know, the beats in the bit. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9387.42s)]
*  Yeah, I do. I don't bring notes on stage. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9390.5s)]
*  I lay out those notes on the coffee table if I'm doing an arena or even a theater. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9392.58s)]
*  Sometimes I'll do it. If I do it at a comedy club, I just have the notes on my phone [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9397.019999999999s)]
*  because it's more casual. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9400.939999999999s)]
*  But when I do like actual physical writing, we're trying to come up with new ideas. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9402.099999999999s)]
*  I can type way faster than I can write. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9408.38s)]
*  And I don't have to look at my fingers. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9411.22s)]
*  So I could just look at the screen. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9412.74s)]
*  And in the process of writing, like if I'm sitting there, [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9414.259999999998s)]
*  I get into like a trance where I'm only thinking about the ideas. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9419.54s)]
*  But it's hard because you get distracted. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9423.22s)]
*  You want to surf the web, look at YouTube videos. [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9424.98s)]
*  And you just got to like make I'll like say, OK, you're not doing jack shit [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9427.66s)]
*  until you have 900 words. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9432.02s)]
*  It's great. You have 900 words and you can fuck off and do whatever you want. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9433.74s)]
*  Or not, depending on if you're hot, if you got something. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9437.1s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. But you want to keep that. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9439.94s)]
*  I mean, I might get something one out of 10 times. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9441.82s)]
*  So it's like nine times. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9443.98s)]
*  Right. But I know that if I do that 10 times, [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9446.46s)]
*  then I'll have a bit that I didn't have before. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9449.98s)]
*  But if I don't do it, that bit doesn't exist. Right. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9452.02s)]
*  That's like the Steven Pressfield, the guy who wrote The War of Art. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9454.66s)]
*  He talks about that, like summoning the muse. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9457.78s)]
*  And then if you are a professional and you sit down and you just do the work, [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9461.18s)]
*  those ideas will come to you. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9465.74s)]
*  But if you don't, if you don't sit there and summon that muse, they're not coming. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9467.74s)]
*  And I know that's a weird, painful, goofy, uncomfortable process [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9472.7s)]
*  to just sit there and not have anything to say. It's messy. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9477.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah. The whole thing is messy. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9479.86s)]
*  But yeah, that's the way to do it for me. For me. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9481.300000000001s)]
*  I also take notes like if something hits me during the day that I think is funny, [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9484.060000000001s)]
*  even if it's not a joke, just something peculiar. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9487.58s)]
*  I'll write it down in just general notes. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9490.060000000001s)]
*  But then I'll have like topics like jury duty, [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9492.060000000001s)]
*  working on this thing on the electric chair now. [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9494.78s)]
*  And it's just like use that as a topic. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9497.1s)]
*  It's like I got a couple of jokes that are working there. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9499.380000000001s)]
*  It's like, why not keep coming at it, keep coming at it until it's a solid bit? [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9501.26s)]
*  Well, it's the thing that we're talking about before. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9506.62s)]
*  It's like the process of getting good as a comic is a long process. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9508.82s)]
*  And the more you can do like listening to sets, watching sets, [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9513.300000000001s)]
*  you know, watching other people perform writing, the more you put in this [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9518.58s)]
*  overall time and hours that's going to manifest itself [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9522.78s)]
*  in better performances and better material and better sets. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9527.02s)]
*  It's just there's no other way to do it. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9530.539999999999s)]
*  And like, you know, I talked to Shane about his act. [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9531.94s)]
*  Like, I'm like, dude, your fucking material is so good right now. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9534.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's so exciting. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9537.18s)]
*  He goes, it's all I care about. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9538.26s)]
*  He's really great. Yeah. [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9539.9s)]
*  But that's that's why it's so good. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9541.38s)]
*  It's like he cares so much. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9543.3s)]
*  It's all he cares about, which is why it's so hot. Right. [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9544.94s)]
*  And that's the fucking thing, man. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9548.06s)]
*  It's just how much attention and energy are you putting into it? [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9549.619999999999s)]
*  Even if you're not going to sit down and write the way that you do, [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9553.58s)]
*  like, and you don't feel like it, maybe you traveled that day, [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9555.779999999999s)]
*  maybe something else happened. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9558.7s)]
*  It's like, just just check in on them. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9559.900000000001s)]
*  Like, just check in on the jokes. Yep. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9562.7s)]
*  Just see how they are. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9564.54s)]
*  It's like maybe you have a cup of coffee and just you're burned out. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9565.42s)]
*  You did it. Whatever. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9567.86s)]
*  It's like maybe just have a cup of coffee and check in. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9568.820000000002s)]

*  Yeah. Right. It's a fucking process, man. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9576.18s)]
*  But, you know, and that's what I wonder. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9578.34s)]
*  Like, I wonder if chat GPT is going to bypass that process. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9580.1s)]
*  People are not going to need that anymore. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9583.140000000001s)]
*  I mean, hopefully I'm gone by that time. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5OVf_YjD8&t=9585.42s)]
