# JRE MMA Show #152  with Sean Brady
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6.0s)]
*  What's up? Good to see you brother. Thank you for having me man. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=10.0s)]
*  So we were just talking about injuries, like the life of a fighter. You always have something wrong, right? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=16.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's rough. Especially for someone like me. I'm getting a little bit older now and I'm being smarter. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=22.0s)]
*  But I was training, I still kind of do, like almost three times a day. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=29.0s)]
*  So I would do a morning skill session, an afternoon run or an afternoon strength session, and then another skill session at night. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=33.0s)]
*  And I did that for 10 plus years. But I love it though. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=41.0s)]
*  But I'm finding now, I'm trying to find that balance of like if it's a hard morning MMA sparring session, nighttime will be Jiu Jitsu. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=47.0s)]
*  And I'll try to make it light. But you know how you drill, then you start rolling. And when you're rolling hard, it's almost just as... [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=55.0s)]
*  I get injured sometimes more during Jiu Jitsu. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=62.0s)]
*  The whole rolling light never happens. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=65.0s)]
*  I was telling my wife, because my hand, I was coming out here, I was like maybe I can go and I can just drill with Gordon and those guys. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=69.0s)]
*  She was like, you ain't fucking drilling with no... If you guys start rolling light, there's not going to be any of that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=76.0s)]
*  And I'm like, you're 100% right. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=83.0s)]
*  That's smart though. That's like smarter, Sean. Like older. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=85.0s)]
*  100%. And that's where before I was like, nah, fuck that. I'm going, I'm going to go hard. And then I'd be injured. And then I wouldn't be able to fight. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=90.0s)]
*  The problem with injuries is if you don't give them respect, they get chronic. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=97.0s)]
*  They just, there's so many guys that have an injury and they try to train through it and it just gets worse and worse and worse. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=102.0s)]
*  And then instead of being out for six weeks, now you're out for six months. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=109.0s)]
*  And that was me after my below fight. So I came home from Abu Dhabi. I didn't have any injuries. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=113.0s)]
*  I wanted to get back and I wanted to get that taste out of my mouth. So I'm back training, I'm back running. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=119.0s)]
*  And then I started to feel that pain I was telling you about. And I literally just kept running. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=124.0s)]
*  Like I'd run once I was warmed up, like, you know how it is, you warm up, the injuries kind of go away. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=129.0s)]
*  Like you feel good until you cool down. And I did that for a couple of months and I had a fight scheduled and I tore my groin. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=133.0s)]
*  And then I rescheduled the fight. I did my rehab and the first week back of training, it tore again. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=139.0s)]
*  So it was a shitty road. Have you had any surgeries? I've been, I had my deviated septum done. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=146.0s)]
*  Obviously they didn't fix the outside because this shit's fucked up. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=153.0s)]
*  But besides that, like I broke my thumb. I'd never had a knee, never had any, I've been pretty lucky with no surgeries, but a lot of injuries. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=156.0s)]
*  Isn't the deviated septum one amazing? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=165.0s)]
*  When I got it done and they, when you have to have those things in your nose for a week though, as soon as they pull them out, you feel like a new human. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=167.0s)]
*  It's like, oh, it's the best. It's incredible. It's the best. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=174.0s)]
*  I never knew like how much cardio I was missing, not being able to breathe out of my nose. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=178.0s)]
*  Look at like Drekus, like Duplassie. When he got his nose fixed, like he used to always fight with his mouth open and people thought he was out of shape. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=183.0s)]
*  And the guy just can't breathe out of his nose. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=192.0s)]
*  I think at some point though, you have to open up your mouth, obviously. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=194.0s)]
*  But I do all my zone two now on the eco bike, mouth closed. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=197.0s)]
*  And now I just started doing mouth tape when I sleep. My fucking, my recovery on like my aura ring went through the roof. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=201.0s)]
*  Just from mouth tape. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=208.0s)]
*  Just from mouth tape. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=209.0s)]
*  You use like hostage tape? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=210.0s)]
*  I had this one called Dream that I got, but hostage, it's the same thing. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=211.0s)]
*  Does it fuck with you with the mustache though? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=215.0s)]
*  No. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=217.0s)]
*  Sometimes if I have like too much facial hair, it doesn't stick that good. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=218.0s)]
*  My buddy Simon was saying that because he had some like cheap one. He was like, doesn't it bother you when you pull it off? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=221.0s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, a little bit. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=226.0s)]
*  I don't mean that. I mean, it doesn't stick. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=228.0s)]
*  Oh no, these ones, they stick good. You have to pull it off. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=230.0s)]
*  The cheap ones just fall right off. I'd wake up and it'd be like on my fucking shoulder. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=233.0s)]
*  That's interesting that it had that much of an impact on your recovery. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=238.0s)]
*  So you wear an aura ring. So what is, my wife wears one of those, but I've never worn it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=242.0s)]
*  How does it work? What's the metrics it gives you? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=248.0s)]
*  So I used to have a whoop and whoop couldn't, I was getting in, I couldn't shoot through my tattoos. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=252.0s)]
*  So I'd get inaccurate readings on all my shit and I actually messaged them and they're like, hey, it's just the kind of lighting we have. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=259.0s)]
*  So I would wear it here, but then it would go up on my wrist and then I have nowhere I could wear it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=267.0s)]
*  So this was like the next best thing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=272.0s)]
*  But it does HRV, heart rate, your sleep, deep sleep, REM. It does track your workouts, but I really don't care about that. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=275.0s)]
*  If I'm going to track my workouts, I wear the Polar or the Myzone. So I'll wear those. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=285.0s)]
*  But yeah, it does your sleep, does a lot of things. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=291.0s)]
*  I got a new one, Morpheus. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=295.0s)]
*  I have Morpheus. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=297.0s)]
*  The app is outstanding too. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=298.0s)]
*  I have Morpheus. You do the HRV in the morning and stuff like that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=300.0s)]
*  I love buying them and I just try them and I compare them. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=304.0s)]
*  I'll wear everything and I'll do the eco bike workout and I'll compare my heart rates and stuff like that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=308.0s)]
*  So yeah, it's fun. But when I got my nose fixed, it was a game changer for sure. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=313.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's just such a different thing to be able to breathe out of your nose. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=318.0s)]
*  But it's interesting to me that the sleep, that your recovery is better. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=321.0s)]
*  I just always wonder why. Why breathing through the nose while you sleep improves your recovery? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=325.0s)]
*  Well, I'll snore. If I sleep on my back, my wife will hit me and she'll be like, you're fucking snoring. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=330.0s)]
*  I'll turn on my side and I won't snore anymore. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=336.0s)]
*  And then I added the mouth tape and I just started doing no THC, but just CBD gummies. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=338.0s)]
*  And my wife too, she's a nurse. She's getting the best fucking sleep she's ever had. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=344.0s)]
*  I've never had our deeps because you can see the deep sleep on there. I have the eight sleep mattress too. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=348.0s)]
*  So I can compare and our deep sleep is from the CBD for me and the mouth tape is through the roof. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=352.0s)]
*  She doesn't do the mouth tape, but she does the CBD and our deep sleep is fucking is great. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=359.0s)]
*  That's interesting. So like, does it give you a score? And like, what is your score that you get? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=364.0s)]
*  So it will give you like, can I pull my phone out? Sure. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=369.0s)]
*  Yeah. I'll, I posted one the other day. So here it is. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=372.0s)]
*  Jamie's pulled it out. So it shows you readiness, readiness. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=376.0s)]
*  So time to recover is 44. That's me today for sure. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=381.0s)]
*  Try to carefully is 75 and then good day ahead is 96. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=385.0s)]
*  This was my one when I wore the, the, the mouth tape and the CBD. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=390.0s)]
*  Okay. My heart rate was 38. Yeah, that's great. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=395.0s)]
*  No, that's awesome. And you're like my, and usually my deep sleep doesn't get, doesn't get as deep. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=399.0s)]
*  Resting heart rate 38 is pretty fucking low. Yeah. Especially now for in camp. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=404.0s)]
*  Yeah. Not bad. That's great description of what makes it maybe a little different. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=408.0s)]
*  It says each person, the unique version of normal rather than your base averages on in-person population benchmarks, like hit 10,000 steps. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=412.0s)]
*  Or gets to know you and provides you with personalized baselines and insights, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=420.0s)]
*  whether your sleep took a hit after a night out or you're prioritizing balance in your wellness routine. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=425.0s)]
*  Or it helps you reach your goals by delivering the best 360 degree view of your health. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=430.0s)]
*  I like it. And, but can't wear it during MMA practice or anything like that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=434.0s)]
*  So I'll take it off. But I was getting almost too caught up with the, with the whoop. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=438.0s)]
*  Cause like you wake up when you're in a training camp, like you're most likely going to be in the yellow or the red, you know, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=442.0s)]
*  like you're not always going to be in the green. Then it's like telling you to take it easy. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=447.0s)]
*  It's like, I fucking can't take it easy. I have a fight and fucking. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=451.0s)]
*  So you have to find the balance of knowing like I actually really feel like shit or this thing's just telling me I feel like shit. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=454.0s)]
*  It's really funny that balance between like, especially when someone's just completely obsessed. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=459.0s)]
*  Like I was listening to this or watching this video where Craig Jones was talking about when he was training, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=464.0s)]
*  especially when he's first starting out, he was training every day. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=469.0s)]
*  Yeah. And he went to a doctor and the doctor's like, you like might have cancer. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=472.0s)]
*  You might have a serious illness. Yeah. Like what's wrong with your body? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=477.0s)]
*  And it really was just that he was just worn out. He was completely over trained. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=480.0s)]
*  Yeah. And with MMA, like we just have so many things we have to cover. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=484.0s)]
*  Like we have to do boxing and we have to do wrestling and we have to do Muay Thai. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=489.0s)]
*  And then I'm big in the like strength and conditioning. So I have to lift. I have to get up. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=493.0s)]
*  But that's something I've gotten better with. I lift three days a week now. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=497.0s)]
*  I have a strength coach that works with the Eagles. His name's Gabe. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=500.0s)]
*  And he's like, we go in, we warm up like we're doing all that shit. I'm like, fuck, I don't want to do this. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=504.0s)]
*  But now like I love it. Like it's like just getting me more athletic. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=509.0s)]
*  And it's more just like GPP, just keeping me prepared and just getting me ready for my MMA sessions and just keeping me strong. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=512.0s)]
*  Like we do trap bar deadlifts. We do front squats. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=518.0s)]
*  Like I don't get crazy with like a lot of the lifts I used to do. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=522.0s)]
*  Like I used to want to lift like a fucking power lifter. I'd be benching and straight bar deadlifts and back squats. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=525.0s)]
*  I'm like, I don't get that's not what we do. You know, so why did you get into that initially? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=530.0s)]
*  I started off lifting before I started MMA. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=536.0s)]
*  So I started training when I was like 16, but I started off lifting at like my local rec center, like just benching every day. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=539.0s)]
*  And then I really got into lifting and I would have the squat bench deadlift, like trying to get my numbers up. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=545.0s)]
*  And then eventually I kept hurting my back. I was like 21 years old with a wrecked back. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=551.0s)]
*  So now I just do trap bar deadlifts, no more straight bar, anything like that. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=555.0s)]
*  So I think the straight bar just puts you in like a bad position. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=559.0s)]
*  Whereas the trap bar puts you in like a more natural position to squat down and lift. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=564.0s)]
*  And you can still put on some good weight on there. So it does a job for me. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=568.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of people that think that deadlifts are just not worth it. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=572.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=576.0s)]
*  The amount of possibility, the possibility of injury in your back. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=577.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=581.0s)]
*  That there's other ways to, like you saw that machine, we had the belt squat machine. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=582.0s)]
*  Belt squats are the best. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=585.0s)]
*  Which is such a great machine for your legs. I mean, it just puts all the weight on your hips. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=586.0s)]
*  You're not compressing your spine at all. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=591.0s)]
*  And yet you can get like big numbers. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=593.0s)]
*  Yeah, you don't have that bar in your back. That's like in camp, we do a lot of the belt squat walks. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=595.0s)]
*  So we'll do three five minute rounds of, we'll put on like, if I'm fighting it, I fight at 170, we put on 170 pounds. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=599.0s)]
*  And we walk for five minutes, like just side to side, rest one minute and we do it for three rounds. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=605.0s)]
*  So, but by the end of it, you're fucking, your hips are cooked. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=610.0s)]
*  But it's, but it's good though. Like I don't have that, that bar on my, on my back. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=614.0s)]
*  And like you said, compressing you and that's how you get hurt. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=619.0s)]
*  That's another Louis Simmons invention. That fucking guy was a genius. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=622.0s)]
*  The best. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=625.0s)]
*  He was such a genius. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=626.0s)]
*  That's like the method we do is like the conjugate. So we do a dynamic upper, dynamic lower, max effort, max effort. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=627.0s)]
*  So a lot of, like we do a lot of sled pulls backwards, forwards. So it's a lot of like the Louis, the Louis stuff. It's really good. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=633.0s)]
*  It's interesting when you see fighters training and like their strength and conditioning routines, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=641.0s)]
*  because it's so hard to figure out what's the optimal balance between strength work and skill work. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=646.0s)]
*  And then we were talking about how GSP, especially towards the end of his career, all he did was do skills. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=653.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=658.0s)]
*  That's all he didn't really do any strength and conditioning. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=659.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, because if, think about like the foot, like NFL, like if you go into the Eagles or the Steelers, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=661.0s)]
*  like they might have different coaches and small things they do, but almost everything they're doing is going to be the same. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=666.0s)]
*  Like they have that strength system figured out. MMA guys, I know guys who don't work out at all. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=672.0s)]
*  I know some guys who do bodybuilding. I know guys who do powerlifting programs. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=677.0s)]
*  So no one has it like figured out yet to where like maybe in 10, 20 years from now they will. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=681.0s)]
*  But right now no one's got it figured out. So we're all kind of just trying to see what works best. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=687.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think there's like the Sam Calavita method, which a lot of people really like. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=693.0s)]
*  Yeah. I was listening to Bo with, he's a wild man. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=698.0s)]
*  He's amazing. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=701.0s)]
*  Sam does some crazy shit. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=702.0s)]
*  He does. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=704.0s)]
*  But like you were saying, Bo, I think there's definitely a point of no return where you go too hard. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=705.0s)]
*  And those workouts, like they kind of start to pull away from all your skill training. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=710.0s)]
*  Because if I have to recover for fucking four days from a bike workout, I just missed maybe potentially eight sessions that I could have been working on my skill. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=714.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=722.0s)]
*  And that's something I'm still like I had to figure out. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=723.0s)]
*  Well, you know, Marv Marinovich, who was training BJ Penn when BJ was the fucking man. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=725.0s)]
*  There was a time where people forget, there was a time when BJ was in his prime where I would put BJ against any 155 pounder that ever lived. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=732.0s)]
*  He was a monster. And when he was training with Marinovich, they really didn't have him doing any skill training. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=741.0s)]
*  It was almost all cardio and plyometrics and these dynamic sprinting things. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=747.0s)]
*  And their idea was like BJ already knows how to fight. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=753.0s)]
*  Like the problem is the gas tank, like giving him a fucking insane gas tank where he can go as hard as he wants. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=756.0s)]
*  So do your drills, do your own stuff. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=764.0s)]
*  But to have extensive MMA training, they're like for six weeks or eight weeks, you already know how to fight. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=767.0s)]
*  Yeah, just six weeks, eight weeks. Just we're going to blow it out with this insane cardiovascular routine. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=772.0s)]
*  And they got him in just fucking superhuman shape. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=778.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=781.0s)]
*  In superhuman shape, BJ was scared. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=782.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=784.0s)]
*  Sean Shirk, BJ. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=785.0s)]
*  That knee against the cage. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=786.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. Joe Stevenson. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=787.0s)]
*  Joe Stevenson. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=789.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=790.0s)]
*  That was, he was a monster, man. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=791.0s)]
*  Did he move up to 70 before or after that? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=793.0s)]
*  Well, he moved up to 70, I think, for fun. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=796.0s)]
*  You know, because he didn't even really move up to 70. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=798.0s)]
*  He just didn't die it. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=801.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. He probably walked down 170 pounds. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=802.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=804.0s)]
*  Because he was pudgy. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=805.0s)]
*  When he beat Matt Huse, he wasn't big. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=806.0s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=811.0s)]
*  It was just Jiu-Jitsu. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=812.0s)]
*  And Matt Huse was a monster. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=813.0s)]
*  A monster. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=814.0s)]
*  A monster. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=815.0s)]
*  He had that farm strength. He was jacked. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=816.0s)]
*  He was fucking strong. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=817.0s)]
*  And now we all walk around close to 200 pounds. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=818.0s)]
*  In the wild. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=822.0s)]
*  Close to 200. Like I cut from fight week, I show up, I'm 190 pounds. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=823.0s)]
*  What's the heaviest you ever get? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=828.0s)]
*  I used to get heavy. Like I'd be like 205. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=829.0s)]
*  But when I was younger, I'd go out after a fight and celebrate and eat like shit and drink now. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=832.0s)]
*  Like I don't drink alcohol. I don't eat bad. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=836.0s)]
*  Like I ate a bad sundae the day I got home from Austin with my wife. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=839.0s)]
*  And I felt like a piece of shit. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=843.0s)]
*  Like I go so hard. I'm like, I never want to feel like this again. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=845.0s)]
*  So now like 195, 197 is like the heaviest I'll get. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=848.0s)]
*  That was a big win for you though. You need to celebrate. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=852.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=854.0s)]
*  But I needed it. I needed to get back and I got into it. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=856.0s)]
*  But 195, like 10% body fat, like that's where my Dexa scans at. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=859.0s)]
*  And that's where I feel great. Like 195. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=863.0s)]
*  And then I'll slowly get down to 190 and that's where I start my like actual water cut from. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=866.0s)]
*  So they weighed me in the back at that fight. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=871.0s)]
*  I was 193 right before I fought Kelvin. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=873.0s)]
*  Really? So you put 23 pounds on me. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=876.0s)]
*  23, yeah. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=879.0s)]
*  That's nuts. How bad do you feel when you step on that scale? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=880.0s)]
*  Not that bad. This last one was my, I was on weight the night before. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=883.0s)]
*  I had like probably three, about like three liters of water that day before I even went to sleep. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=887.0s)]
*  So I woke up, I was 178 on Thursday. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=893.0s)]
*  I went to the sauna. We went to like a fucking LA fitness right by us. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=897.0s)]
*  I cut eight pounds by accident. I cut all my weight. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=900.0s)]
*  I weighed myself in an hour. I was on weight. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=902.0s)]
*  So I hit up, I worked with Charles from the PI. Like they're the best. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=905.0s)]
*  Hit him up, told him what happened. He was like, hey, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=908.0s)]
*  like gave me the exact amounts to drink and I was drinking and eating on Thursday. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=910.0s)]
*  I think I put back on four pounds. I went to the sauna that night. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=915.0s)]
*  I cut all of it in 30 minutes. I was, I'm always on weight the night before. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=919.0s)]
*  I never ever want to wake up and know I have to go cut weight because those sweats are so hard to break. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=923.0s)]
*  Like when your body fat's that low to break that first sweat, like it's fucking hard. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=929.0s)]
*  So I'd like to get on the night before and just be done with it. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=933.0s)]
*  There's different schools of thought. Some guys like to just have a good night's sleep. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=937.0s)]
*  They don't want to be. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=941.0s)]
*  Because they say they can't sleep when they're cutting. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=942.0s)]
*  Yeah. I feel like you're already, like you're already into that cut though. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=943.0s)]
*  So you're like, if you're going to sleep bad, like you're going to, I think you're going to sleep bad regardless. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=946.0s)]
*  So I just rather not have that stress of like, fuck, I got to wake up and cut. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=950.0s)]
*  I know guys who wake up, they cut 10, 15 pounds, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=954.0s)]
*  but that's how we used to do it when the weigh-ins were at six o'clock because you had all that time. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=956.0s)]
*  Now they're at nine. So I try to sleep till seven, get up, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=960.0s)]
*  and then you have to be over there by eight, eight thirty, try to be one of the first ones on the scale. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=964.0s)]
*  And then just start hammering those, hammering those liquids back in. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=968.0s)]
*  I wish they would let people do IVs. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=972.0s)]
*  I feel like if you're going to allow people to have these massive cuts, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=975.0s)]
*  they would have better performances if you let them do IVs. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=978.0s)]
*  We used to fucking, like we would get hooked up with the IVs and we'd feel like Superman, like 10 pounds immediately. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=981.0s)]
*  But the only negative aspect of it is they say that it can mask performance-enhancing drugs. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=988.0s)]
*  But I think the solution to that is test the guys, like as they're cutting. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=994.0s)]
*  Test the guys before they rehydrate. Test them then. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=999.0s)]
*  So that way you know, like they're not on, if you took something then it's not going to help you in 10 hours. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1002.0s)]
*  Guys are definitely still doing it though. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1008.0s)]
*  They have to be. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1010.0s)]
*  Guys are doing it 100%. And now with this new thing that we're under- [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1011.0s)]
*  You think guys are doing IVs? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1014.0s)]
*  Oh, 100%. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1015.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1016.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1017.0s)]
*  No shit. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1018.0s)]
*  Yeah, because if guys are cheating and getting away- [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1019.0s)]
*  Because guys are definitely getting away with taking PEDs. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1021.0s)]
*  There's a way to get away with, like what are they going to test for? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1024.0s)]
*  The traces of the plastic in your blood? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1027.0s)]
*  I think that's it, yeah. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1029.0s)]
*  But from what I heard, we're drinking shit that has plastic in it all the time. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1030.0s)]
*  So how are you going to know it's an IV? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1033.0s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1035.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1036.0s)]
*  I was hoping that with this new thing with USADA being done, we were going to be able to IV. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1037.0s)]
*  But I was talking to Charles from the PI. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1041.0s)]
*  He said, the science I don't know behind it, but he was saying it's better orally to do it anyway. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1043.0s)]
*  Like you're better off doing it with the amount of time we have than IVs. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1048.0s)]
*  So I'm like, I get all my weight back on. I can't complain. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1052.0s)]
*  Why is it better orally? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1055.0s)]
*  It seems like getting it right into your bloodstream would be quicker. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1056.0s)]
*  Obviously you do IVs. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1059.0s)]
*  I used to, like it'd be after cutting weight, so I'd be super bloated afterwards. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1061.0s)]
*  I mean, you get bloated from drinking your liquids you have to put back in anyway. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1066.0s)]
*  But that's the only thing I'm thinking. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1070.0s)]
*  Like maybe it would just fuck up your stomach more. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1071.0s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1073.0s)]
*  It's such a weird balance. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1075.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1076.0s)]
*  And it's so interesting when you have something like the UFCPI, which is like super high tech, super scientific. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1077.0s)]
*  They can tell you how much water to drink. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1083.0s)]
*  And it used to be guys were just kind of winging it. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1085.0s)]
*  And they would fuck it up one time and get it right the next time. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1088.0s)]
*  Like they give us a sheet because we have Joey Pfeiffer fighting December 10th. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1091.0s)]
*  He has a main event. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1095.0s)]
*  So I'm going to go out there, do all my tests, my test in and they give you a sheet like they know how many calories you burn at absolute rest. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1096.0s)]
*  Like they know like your body like better than you do. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1103.0s)]
*  And they give you a sheet like after you weigh in, you need forty five hundred calories. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1105.0s)]
*  You need like a thousand grams of carbs. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1110.0s)]
*  You need like all these different macros. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1112.0s)]
*  And it's fucking it's right there. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1114.0s)]
*  Like it's do they provide you? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1115.0s)]
*  I know they do that with some fighters. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1117.0s)]
*  They give you like meal prep. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1119.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1120.0s)]
*  Like how are they? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1121.0s)]
*  How are they doing that? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1122.0s)]
*  So they do it based on each aspect of it. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1123.0s)]
*  Based on each athlete weight. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1125.0s)]
*  As far as I know. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1127.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1128.0s)]
*  They and I like I've like hired other nutritionist and stuff like that. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1129.0s)]
*  But the PI does it great. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1132.0s)]
*  Like it's free for all UFC fighters. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1133.0s)]
*  And if you're just in contact with them all the time like I am like they make it so easy for you and they hand you your meals and they're like listen eat this eat this eat this and then you should be good to go. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1135.0s)]
*  Like they're taking your weight. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1145.0s)]
*  They tell you how much water to drink. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1146.0s)]
*  Like they make it pretty easy for us. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1148.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1150.0s)]
*  And do they provide you guys with supplements? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1151.0s)]
*  Because I know. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1153.0s)]
*  Thorne. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1154.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1155.0s)]
*  So it's all set up. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1156.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1157.0s)]
*  So if you want all Thorne like now we have an app that we go on and we can put in an order every month that we want. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1158.0s)]
*  So they do a lot of good shit for us. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1163.0s)]
*  Like what do you not like what are you not allowed to take? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1165.0s)]
*  You're allowed to take creatine right? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1168.0s)]
*  Creatine. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1169.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1170.0s)]
*  So any supplement that's third party test it. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1171.0s)]
*  So I use this company called All Max. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1172.0s)]
*  They have some things that are third party tested and some things that aren't. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1175.0s)]
*  So all the things that are third party I think it's informed choice. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1178.0s)]
*  So informed choice BSCG like I take Shroom Tech from on it. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1181.0s)]
*  You guys have BSCG. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1185.0s)]
*  I can take I can take that. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1187.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1188.0s)]
*  But if it didn't like you can take it. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1189.0s)]
*  But now it's at your own risk. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1192.0s)]
*  So anything that's third party test that we're good to go. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1194.0s)]
*  But I thought going into this now like we'd be able to do more stuff. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1197.0s)]
*  And I was asking Jeff about I text Jeff Novinsky and I was asking about peptides. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1201.0s)]
*  I just want to see like maybe for my hand or any like just any injuries. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1207.0s)]
*  I mean are we going to be allowed to take this and it's an absolute no. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1211.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1214.0s)]
*  I was talking to them about that too. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1215.0s)]
*  And as well as the new guy from drug free sport. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1216.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1219.0s)]
*  I forget his name but the guy's taken over from USADA and they were saying no because peptides that you'll get popped for it at each individual commission. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1220.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1229.0s)]
*  So if you're in Florida and they don't allow it you test there the Florida Commission will pop you for it. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1230.0s)]
*  Because I was asked him he said even if they didn't allow he said all the states like they won't give you it's quite a TUE some kind of exemption. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1235.0s)]
*  And they said none of them would do it. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1242.0s)]
*  So I'm like all right well just good to know not to like stem cells and stuff like that. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1244.0s)]
*  Like as far as I know like that's all good to go. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1248.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1250.0s)]
*  That's all good to go. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1251.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1252.0s)]
*  Creatine protein like all that shit like you should. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1253.0s)]
*  There's so many companies now who have third party test stuff like you can take plenty of stuff fish oil like there. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1255.0s)]
*  And then if you don't want to go outside the realm just stay with Thorne because their shit super high quality. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1260.0s)]
*  And the UFC gives it all that. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1265.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1267.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1268.0s)]
*  That's nice. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1269.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1270.0s)]
*  So do you ever do a camp at the P.I. or do your camps now. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1271.0s)]
*  I've done all my camps in Philly and that's something like that I'm super like proud and happy about like I'm born and raised in Philly I never left. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1273.0s)]
*  We have a small team it's called Marquez MMA. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1280.0s)]
*  We have like six guys in the UFC right now. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1282.0s)]
*  We have me Joey Piper Pat Sabatini Andre Petrovsky Jeremiah Wells like we have a great crew. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1284.0s)]
*  We got a good we got a good squad. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1292.0s)]
*  We had Paul Felder. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1293.0s)]
*  Paul was like one of the first guys out of Philly besides I do I train with Eddie Alvarez like we have a good good group of Philly guys. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1294.0s)]
*  So it's nice. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1302.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1303.0s)]
*  When I am I felt Christian Aguilera and I put him to sleep with a guillotine. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1304.0s)]
*  Eddie was my main training partner because it was during covid. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1306.0s)]
*  He was fighting for one FC. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1309.0s)]
*  No one was training and he hit me up. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1311.0s)]
*  He's a guy you guys train. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1313.0s)]
*  I was like fuck yeah we're training. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1314.0s)]
*  We had all of our windows like duck because in Philly like you weren't like they were shutting shit down. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1315.0s)]
*  And but we all had fights so we're like we're fucking training. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1320.0s)]
*  So me and Eddie got super close during that when Cormier fought steep. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1323.0s)]
*  He got covid during camp and just trained right through. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1329.0s)]
*  Just kept going. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1332.0s)]
*  I fought on first time when you interviewed me and you weren't even in the cage. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1333.0s)]
*  It was when they were still doing it was Jake Matthews. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1337.0s)]
*  I had covid two weeks before the fight. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1340.0s)]
*  Remember that how crazy that was. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1342.0s)]
*  You just had a fucking cage fight. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1344.0s)]
*  So you're on top of each other. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1346.0s)]
*  Sweat. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1347.0s)]
*  Yeah pounded on each other. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1348.0s)]
*  Everyone's tested. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1349.0s)]
*  I'm tested. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1350.0s)]

*  Like what? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1646.0s)]
*  That's the worst thing you can do. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1647.0s)]
*  Yeah terrible for you. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1649.0s)]
*  But they don't want you to be healthy. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1650.0s)]
*  They want you to be fat. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1651.24s)]
*  They don't want you to be lazy. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1652.4s)]
*  They don't want you working out. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1653.4s)]
*  They don't want you eating. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1654.4s)]
*  Well they definitely want you to comply. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1655.4s)]
*  That was the most important thing they wanted during that time. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1657.08s)]
*  They wanted full compliance from people. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1659.48s)]
*  And if they could scare you into compliance that's the way they did it. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1661.52s)]
*  It fucking worked for a lot of people. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1664.56s)]
*  Boy it did. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1666.16s)]
*  It scared the shit out of me because I was like oh my god there's so many pussies out [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1667.16s)]
*  here. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1670.76s)]
*  There's so many people that will roll over for the government even if what they're saying [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1671.76s)]
*  doesn't make any sense. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1674.68s)]
*  Even if it's not scientific it's just really disheartening. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1675.68s)]
*  It was almost like a position where I'm like damn I'm not vaccinated. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1680.36s)]
*  Am I going to have to get this shot so I can fight? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1684.28s)]
*  I'm like then it's going to come like do I retire because I don't want this fucking [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1686.2s)]
*  shot? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1690.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm like I don't know what the fuck to do. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1691.1599999999999s)]
*  So luckily it didn't come to that because choosing my career or getting that fucking [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1693.56s)]
*  shot I don't know what I would have did. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1698.04s)]
*  I almost got the shot. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1700.36s)]
*  The whole UFC staff they allocated all these vaccines. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1701.6s)]
*  They had it set up. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1706.96s)]
*  So Dana and I were talking and he goes if you want to get vaccinated we have them for [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1708.68s)]
*  you. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1711.88s)]
*  I go great. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1712.88s)]
*  I wasn't even remotely hesitant in the beginning. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1713.88s)]
*  And just by luck I get there on Saturday for the fight and I call the doctor and I say [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1716.0800000000002s)]
*  hey I thought they could do it for me at the arena. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1722.88s)]
*  So I was going to do it get vaccinated and just call the friends. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1726.8s)]
*  How bad could it be? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1730.52s)]
*  I wasn't hearing anything bad about it. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1731.52s)]
*  And he said no we have to do it at the clinic. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1734.28s)]
*  Can you come on Monday? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1736.48s)]
*  And I said I have to go home. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1737.48s)]
*  I go but we'll be back in two weeks because we had fights in two weeks. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1739.28s)]
*  And then within two weeks they pulled it. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1741.8s)]
*  The shit got bad. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1743.28s)]
*  That's when they pulled it. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1744.28s)]
*  When Johnson and Johnson was the one. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1745.28s)]
*  And then I knew two dudes who got strokes. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1746.92s)]
*  Two guys. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1750.0s)]
*  It's like. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1751.0s)]
*  I was like what is going on? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1752.0s)]
*  So then I started getting a little weird. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1753.72s)]
*  And then I started like listening to these doctors that were speaking out against this [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1755.6s)]
*  technology and then I listened to Dr. Robert Malone who he owns nine patents in the creation [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1759.82s)]
*  of mRNA vaccine technology. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1765.94s)]
*  And he had a very severe reaction to the vaccine. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1768.96s)]
*  And he posted about his reactions. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1771.34s)]
*  And then I had him on and then people started getting mad at me. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1773.78s)]
*  This guy's a legit doctor. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1776.9s)]
*  Well my mom's a nurse too. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1779.06s)]
*  And she got her yearly flu shot. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1781.18s)]
*  And the chick who gave it to her must have gave it to her wrong. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1784.38s)]
*  Fucked her shoulder up. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1787.54s)]
*  So she had problems in her shoulder. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1788.54s)]
*  And then it came to getting the COVID shot. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1790.64s)]
*  She's like I'm not getting it. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1792.58s)]
*  And it wasn't like any reason. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1793.78s)]
*  She didn't know shit about COVID at the time. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1797.02s)]
*  She's like I just don't want to get another shot. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1798.22s)]
*  So they were getting tested. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1800.26s)]
*  They made a super small window where they had to be there whether you had work or if [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1802.34s)]
*  you didn't have work and you had to get tested like three times a week or some stupid shit [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1807.58s)]
*  like that. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1811.22s)]
*  So they're making it super hard for the nurses who didn't get vaccinated to do their job. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1812.22s)]
*  I'm like these are the people who are saving these fucking people who are coming in who [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1816.34s)]
*  are sick. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1819.98s)]
*  And almost all of them get exposed to it. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1820.98s)]
*  And almost all of them develop. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1822.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1824.54s)]
*  Naturally. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1825.54s)]
*  They were trying to pretend that natural immunity was bullshit. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1827.1s)]
*  I've heard people say it recently natural immunity has been debunked. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1829.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1832.7s)]
*  No it hasn't. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1833.7s)]
*  There's actual studies that show it was multiple times better than the vaccine. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1834.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1838.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1839.54s)]
*  When I faced Craig Jones in that grappling match my whole fucking team was sick. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1840.54s)]
*  And at that point we're like none of us were getting tested. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1844.5s)]
*  I'm like I'm like dude we definitely all have COVID. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1846.5s)]
*  But I'm like I'm not getting tested. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1849.3s)]
*  Like I'm not doing it. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1850.94s)]
*  Just because I just I feel like shit. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1852.18s)]
*  I don't know if I'm run down or whatever it is but I'm not saying it's COVID and I can't [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1853.7s)]
*  go do what I'm going to do this weekend. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1858.3400000000001s)]
*  Like I'm not doing it. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1860.74s)]
*  When you do something like that like so you're one of the most promising welterweight contenders [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1861.74s)]
*  in the sport you know as your career progresses you'll probably get a shot at a title within [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1867.02s)]
*  the next couple of years. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1871.5800000000002s)]
*  Taking a grappling match is that's a risky move. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1873.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1877.38s)]
*  Especially against a world class guy like Craig Jones. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1878.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1879.8200000000002s)]
*  So the only thing Craig couldn't do in that match he couldn't heel hook me but he could [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1881.3s)]
*  straight knee bar me straight ankle lock me anything besides heel hooks. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1887.02s)]
*  So after the match like. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1891.22s)]
*  Is that your idea? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1892.46s)]
*  No that was that's the UFC's. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1893.46s)]
*  So Fury was working with the UFC and they're like the UFC told them like hey all UFC guys [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1895.5s)]
*  just know heel hooks. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1900.26s)]
*  Even like Aldrio just did that match for them and the only thing they couldn't do was no [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1901.26s)]
*  heel hooks. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1904.74s)]
*  So I mean. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1905.74s)]
*  Just because of like the tear. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1906.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1907.74s)]
*  Like Craig or anyone else you still have all those other submissions you can do so it's [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1909.66s)]
*  not like you're getting handicapped that fucking bad where like people are giving me shit online [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1913.06s)]
*  like oh you had to handicap on this and that. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1917.26s)]
*  I'm like I'm a UFC fighter. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1919.46s)]
*  Like this was the rules. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1921.18s)]
*  I didn't like. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1922.5s)]
*  You didn't make the rules. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1923.5s)]
*  You could knee bar me you could straight ankle lock me you could do all these other things [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1924.5s)]
*  so you could toe hold me but yeah. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1927.3s)]
*  But I like that they don't do the heel hooks. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1930.14s)]
*  Yeah it is a risky one man. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1932.06s)]
*  I mean how many guys have ripped their knee apart. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1933.94s)]
*  Oh oh yeah it's bad. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1936.02s)]
*  A lot. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1938.0600000000002s)]
*  Did you see that Mikey Misa Mets you one in one FC where the guy wouldn't tap. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1939.0600000000002s)]
*  Horrible. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1942.14s)]
*  Horrible. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1943.14s)]
*  Oh. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1944.14s)]
*  Dude I can't watch that one. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1945.14s)]
*  He ripped that guy's knee apart. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1947.14s)]
*  I don't know how that guy's doing right now. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1948.5s)]
*  It's probably not doing well. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1950.26s)]
*  I gotta imagine his knee is ruined for the rest of his life. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1951.98s)]
*  Was it um. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1954.9s)]
*  See if you can find that video because it's so hard to watch because we were talking about [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1955.9s)]
*  Mikey before. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1959.74s)]
*  Yeah yeah. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1960.74s)]
*  Because he's calling out some dude who's a bully. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1961.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1963.9s)]
*  Dude he destroys this guy's knee. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1964.9s)]
*  I mean destroys it. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1966.98s)]
*  The guy won't tap. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1968.3400000000001s)]
*  He's got him in a knee bar here. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1969.3400000000001s)]
*  The guy won't tap. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1970.68s)]
*  So now he adjusts and now he's ripping it sideways. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1971.72s)]
*  I mean look at the guy's knee. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1974.8600000000001s)]
*  Look at the motion of his knee. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1976.94s)]
*  Oh god damn. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1978.5800000000002s)]
*  So you see the way he's holding that. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1979.5800000000002s)]
*  He calls that the Mikey lock. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1983.8600000000001s)]
*  And the guys I train with at Movement Art they show it. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1986.74s)]
*  And dude it's nasty. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1989.74s)]
*  He's a monster man. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1992.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1993.3400000000001s)]
*  He's so good. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1994.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1995.3400000000001s)]
*  He's got all the biggest. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1996.74s)]
*  Even guys who are a lot bigger than him. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1997.74s)]
*  Oh I'm sure. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1998.74s)]
*  He's so technical. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=1999.74s)]
*  Well we were just talking about Craig. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2000.74s)]
*  How about Craig versus Vinny. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2002.58s)]
*  Oh yeah he broke his leg. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2004.5s)]
*  Broke his leg and Vinny wouldn't tap. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2005.5s)]
*  I'm like bro. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2007.54s)]
*  And Craig's leg. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2008.54s)]
*  Craig's leg is broken. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2009.54s)]
*  And then he went again. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2010.54s)]
*  And then he finally was like alright I'm done. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2011.54s)]
*  Insane. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2014.54s)]
*  But yeah I did that match with Craig and then I did another one with Ben Saunders. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2015.54s)]
*  And it was the same thing. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2019.76s)]
*  Same rules just no heel hooks. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2020.76s)]
*  Yeah but beating Craig Jones in a grappling match even if there's no heel hooks. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2023.46s)]
*  Dude that was gigantic. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2027.26s)]
*  I just went into it. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2028.62s)]
*  I'm like I'm going to stay on top. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2029.62s)]
*  I played by the rules. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2031.4199999999998s)]
*  And I'm like if he doesn't sweep me or get under me I'm going to win. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2032.94s)]
*  And then there was odds for it. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2036.1799999999998s)]
*  I was like an 18 to 1 underdog or something like that. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2038.26s)]
*  He was supposed to smoke me which he should have. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2043.02s)]
*  But people were giving me shit online. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2044.7s)]
*  I'm like listen. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2046.5s)]
*  I just went in there and did what I knew I was going to do. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2048.14s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2052.02s)]
*  So this is what the guy would happen with the dude. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2053.06s)]
*  Torn ACL torn MCL torn meniscus and a broken ankle. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2055.54s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2059.94s)]
*  So Mike he said I'm really sick to my stomach. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2062.3s)]
*  I never felt someone's leg explode like that in a match. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2064.46s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2067.38s)]
*  He goes I've been training for 22 years. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2068.38s)]
*  I never broke someone's leg that much. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2069.86s)]
*  I've broken a lot of legs he said but that leg exploded. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2071.7s)]
*  I didn't know what to do and it was disgusting and gross. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2076.06s)]
*  I really wish he tapped. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2078.7s)]
*  The result didn't change. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2079.78s)]
*  And now he's in the hospital. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2080.78s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2082.22s)]
*  But what a warrior is for showing his will. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2083.22s)]
*  I mean it is the dude is a warrior but I mean that's crazy. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2085.7s)]
*  You got to tap. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2088.98s)]
*  You're losing anyway. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2089.98s)]
*  For sure. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2091.7s)]
*  Tap. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2092.7s)]
*  Knees shoulders. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2093.7s)]
*  Like I'd rather almost not tap maybe in the arm. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2095.98s)]
*  Like if I'm going to pick something it'd be like an arm bar. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2098.3399999999997s)]
*  Straight arm bar. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2100.7799999999997s)]
*  But a camora like your shoulder. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2101.7799999999997s)]
*  Not just the shoulder but that spiral fracture like when Frank Meir gave it to Minotauro [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2104.18s)]
*  and you see his arm snap. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2108.4199999999996s)]
*  Just like a chicken wing. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2110.1s)]
*  Oh that guy. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2111.1s)]
*  That one's so scary. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2112.98s)]
*  Minotauro he had a giant scar up his arm or it was like a spiral fracture. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2113.98s)]
*  When he rolled through the way he did. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2119.42s)]
*  It was beautiful. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2122.2599999999998s)]
*  When he turned it and he put it behind his back. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2123.2599999999998s)]
*  Done. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2126.2599999999998s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2127.2599999999998s)]
*  Frank Meir has broken two arms of world champions. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2128.2599999999998s)]
*  Who else did he do? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2130.2999999999997s)]
*  Tim Sylvia. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2131.2999999999997s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2132.2999999999997s)]
*  Snapped his forearm in half. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2133.2999999999997s)]
*  He was good. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2134.2999999999997s)]
*  I was just watching him versus DC the other day. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2135.2999999999997s)]
*  When I'm on the eco bike I always just watch fights and I was watching him versus DC and [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2139.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm like damn DC was a motherfucker back in the day. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2143.26s)]
*  Oh dude. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2146.78s)]
*  And he was not even really a heavyweight. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2147.78s)]
*  No. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2149.1s)]
*  He was so small. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2150.1s)]
*  DC could have been a 185. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2151.1s)]
*  He was so small. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2152.1s)]
*  Yeah look at him. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2153.1s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2154.1s)]
*  I mean he carried around so much body fat but his wrestling was so fucking high level [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2155.1s)]
*  man and he's such a tank. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2159.06s)]
*  Outside like high crotches he would hit when he dumps the dudes. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2162.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2166.82s)]
*  DC was the man. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2168.06s)]
*  He was actually hurting Frank on the... [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2170.18s)]
*  I don't think there was one takedown scored on either side here. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2172.1s)]
*  I think they just struck the whole time but DC just put it on him. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2175.78s)]
*  DC was an animal man. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2180.38s)]
*  And that was one of those things. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2182.3s)]
*  Iron sharpens iron. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2184.34s)]
*  Because DC was training with Kane Velasquez. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2185.34s)]
*  Kane was the fucking man. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2188.22s)]
*  Kane was... [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2190.9s)]
*  That's another guy. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2191.9s)]
*  When people look at all time greats you got to look at them when they're in their prime. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2192.9s)]
*  Guys get injured, they fall apart, things happen, they get old. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2197.8799999999997s)]
*  And then you're looking at these fights where they're getting beaten up. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2201.72s)]
*  You can't look at those fights. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2203.52s)]
*  You got to look at the fights like when they're at their highest RPMs how do they perform. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2204.52s)]
*  Anderson same thing. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2208.96s)]
*  Guys who are watching fights now I'm like you guys don't... [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2210.68s)]
*  I remember it was... [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2212.64s)]
*  They came to Philly it was Anderson versus Forrest Griffin. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2214.2799999999997s)]
*  That's when I first got in the watching fights. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2219.2s)]
*  I think it was 2009. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2221.04s)]
*  And he did that step back and was dipping the punches and hit him once and Forrest just [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2223.6s)]
*  quit. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2228.56s)]
*  I'm like this guy is a fucking... [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2229.56s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2230.56s)]
*  And he moved up to 205 for that. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2231.56s)]
*  I heard that Forrest though got knocked out twice in camp for that fight. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2233.44s)]
*  That's what I had heard. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2240.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2241.2799999999997s)]
*  It happens all the time. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2242.2799999999997s)]
*  And I think that's true because I think Forrest at that time was... [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2243.2799999999997s)]
*  Forrest wanted to help him out. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2248.04s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2251.88s)]
*  He was just like... [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2252.88s)]
*  It was just complete different levels. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2253.88s)]
*  I think he ran out of the arena. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2255.4s)]
*  Yeah it's that right hand. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2259.12s)]
*  That's it. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2261.76s)]
*  Forrest like that's it. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2262.76s)]
*  But I genuinely think that those concussions that he got in camp had an effect. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2263.76s)]
*  There's quite a few times where you see guys fight and you're like man something's wrong. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2270.32s)]
*  You know I got knocked out too easy. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2274.76s)]
*  And then you'll hear oh he got knocked out in training two weeks ago. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2277.36s)]
*  And even if you don't get knocked out, you're fucking getting hit in your head. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2281.72s)]
*  You might not be going out but I definitely left practice before and I'm like damn I'm [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2286.68s)]
*  fuzzy. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2290.9199999999996s)]
*  You know guys are definitely... [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2291.9199999999996s)]
*  And we're pretty controlled. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2293.12s)]
*  I only go with guys I trust too. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2294.68s)]
*  And that's something I think you have to do. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2296.72s)]
*  Guys I only try... [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2300.0s)]
*  Injuries can happen but I'm not going to try to knock you out. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2302.24s)]
*  You're not going to try to knock me out. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2304.9599999999996s)]
*  And you have that like a grience. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2306.3599999999997s)]
*  Because that's how a small team like our team. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2307.3599999999997s)]
*  All of us came up in the same gym. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2310.36s)]
*  We only have like one head coach. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2313.1600000000003s)]
*  We just brought in Dean. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2314.92s)]
*  I'm working with Dean Thomas now. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2315.92s)]
*  I love Dean. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2317.44s)]
*  The best. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2318.44s)]
*  He's coming down to Philly all the time. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2319.44s)]
*  He was in my corner for that fight. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2321.32s)]
*  Great addition to the team but he loves our team. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2323.6400000000003s)]
*  Because we're a small team but we just fucking... [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2325.48s)]
*  We just grind and we just want everyone to keep getting better. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2327.6000000000004s)]
*  But John Marquez is our head coach. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2330.52s)]
*  We go hard but now if he gets out of control he steps right in and shuts that shit down. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2332.92s)]
*  We're all wearing head gear now. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2338.7999999999997s)]
*  I got this... [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2340.56s)]
*  I fucking hate head gear though. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2341.56s)]
*  Because I just feel like you get hit more. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2343.04s)]
*  So I got a head gear from Onyx. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2345.04s)]
*  And it's the small one. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2346.7599999999998s)]
*  And it's thin. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2348.24s)]
*  You can actually see. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2349.24s)]
*  So it's Trevor Whitman's. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2350.24s)]
*  Yup. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2351.24s)]
*  I hit them up and they sent it right out to me. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2352.24s)]
*  And it's good. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2354.08s)]
*  Because you can grapple with him. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2355.08s)]
*  He makes the best shit. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2356.08s)]
*  The best shit. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2357.08s)]
*  The best gloves. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2358.08s)]
*  They sent me gloves and I was like, yo, can I get your MMA gloves? [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2359.08s)]
*  I'll pay whatever it costs. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2361.96s)]
*  And Gagey was like, nah, they're not out yet. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2363.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm like, alright, well when they're out. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2365.64s)]
*  Dude, the UFC, I don't know what happened. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2367.4s)]
*  I don't know how it went wrong. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2370.2400000000002s)]
*  But the UFC was talking Trevor about using his MMA gloves. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2372.1600000000003s)]
*  He has absolutely superior MMA gloves. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2376.8s)]
*  They're the best. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2379.96s)]
*  No one even comes close. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2381.2400000000002s)]
*  And when you make a fist with those, it actually, it encourages a closed fist. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2382.92s)]
*  You have to work to open your hands like this. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2388.2000000000003s)]
*  You have to actually work against the glove. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2391.04s)]
*  Whereas the UFC gloves, they kind of open your hand up more and you have to work to [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2393.48s)]
*  close it. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2397.84s)]
*  The arm, like you fucking know. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2398.84s)]
*  That arm pump we get from, when I put, I get the smallest hand wraps. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2401.04s)]
*  I tell whoever's at, I'm like, give me a grappler's wrap. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2405.12s)]
*  I almost want nothing. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2407.6s)]
*  Because once you have that wrap on, you have the glove on, when you're trying to close [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2408.84s)]
*  your fist, I'm like, I'm getting fucking arm pump just from trying to close my fucking [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2412.64s)]
*  hands. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2416.84s)]
*  After the fight, my forearms are like double the size because the arm pump you have from [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2417.84s)]
*  grappling. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2422.44s)]
*  It's Trevor. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2424.4s)]
*  I'm telling you, it's Trevor's gloves. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2425.4s)]
*  I should probably reinstitute these talks and try to get it going again. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2427.88s)]
*  I really should. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2432.36s)]
*  You know what? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2433.36s)]
*  I'm going to do that. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2434.36s)]
*  Because they're superior. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2435.36s)]
*  They're absolutely the best gloves. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2436.36s)]
*  It's a problem. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2437.36s)]
*  I don't know what happened, what went wrong, but Trevor uses superior foam. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2438.36s)]
*  If you use his boxing gloves, they're the best. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2443.32s)]
*  They mold to your hand. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2447.2400000000002s)]
*  And it's also their superior protection too. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2450.16s)]
*  He's done demonstrations where he shows how much better the foam he uses to other cheaper [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2454.28s)]
*  foam. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2457.6s)]
*  Because it's fighters making stuff for fighters. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2458.6s)]
*  It's not people who aren't doing it. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2460.4s)]
*  Gage is the best one to do it. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2462.96s)]
*  And then obviously Trevor too. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2464.2000000000003s)]
*  They're an amazing combo and they're making amazing shit. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2465.52s)]
*  The head gear is great because head gear, your window is this big. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2468.4s)]
*  Next thing you know, you're trying to kick box and you can't see the guy's legs. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2472.04s)]
*  You're getting fucking kicked in the head. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2475.2000000000003s)]
*  And you're trying to shoot. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2477.1600000000003s)]
*  You're shooting into a knee. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2478.32s)]
*  But his is super wide and it's so thin. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2479.32s)]
*  And you're really just wearing it to prevent cuts. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2483.56s)]
*  Because realistically, if you have a big ass head gear on, when I see someone wearing [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2485.48s)]
*  a head gear, I'm like, that's a bigger fucking target. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2488.88s)]
*  It's going to be easier to hit. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2491.16s)]
*  But with a small one, it's just enough padding. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2492.96s)]
*  Just enough to keep you safe. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2496.2s)]
*  Remember Mike Tyson back in the day? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2497.2s)]
*  He wore the real thin one. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2498.2s)]
*  Real thin one when he was training. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2499.2s)]
*  It was almost like a wrestling head gear. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2500.2s)]
*  I think that's the way to go. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2505.28s)]
*  And I think it's just unfortunate that there's no other way around it. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2507.16s)]
*  There's nothing better. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2512.64s)]
*  There's no better solution. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2513.64s)]
*  If you want to prevent cuts, you're kicking and punching. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2515.68s)]
*  But I do not like when people have the face bar. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2518.48s)]
*  And you can't see. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2522.48s)]
*  I wore that for a while. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2524.16s)]
*  I broke my nose so many times. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2527.04s)]
*  But in the beginning of training camps, I broke my nose. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2528.3599999999997s)]
*  So you have to spar the entire camp with that nose guard. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2530.8799999999997s)]
*  And it fucking sucks. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2534.48s)]
*  And it still touches your nose. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2535.64s)]
*  And you probably get fucked up more with it on. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2538.04s)]
*  You definitely get more head shots. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2539.92s)]
*  With a big head gear. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2541.52s)]
*  Can't see shit. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2543.7200000000003s)]
*  And that bar, it sticks out this far. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2544.7200000000003s)]
*  So that bar gets touched and it would touch your nose. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2547.08s)]
*  I would even wear, like, do you see basketball players? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2550.08s)]
*  The one basketball player always wore it. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2553.6800000000003s)]
*  I forget what his name was. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2555.2000000000003s)]
*  But I would wear this plastic shield on my face even when I would roll. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2556.44s)]
*  Because my nose would be fucked up. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2560.48s)]
*  I'm like, I can't miss training. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2561.6s)]
*  And that's what we were talking about earlier. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2563.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm like, maybe I should stay the fuck home. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2564.1600000000003s)]
*  But I'd be in the gym. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2565.96s)]
*  I was duct taping it to my head and shit. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2566.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's getting better with the innovation. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2570.1600000000003s)]
*  But we got a long way to go, though. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2572.2000000000003s)]
*  So you were telling me that you would hurt your hand in the Kelvin fight. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2574.0s)]
*  But it's not a break. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2578.28s)]
*  Not a break. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2579.44s)]
*  So you're just trying to let it rehab or recover. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2579.92s)]
*  So I'm trying to, and that's me trying to be smart a little bit. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2583.0s)]
*  At my older age of 31, I'm just trying to let it heal. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2587.5200000000004s)]
*  And before I get back, I just don't want to start another training camp [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2590.88s)]
*  with an injury. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2594.28s)]
*  Whereas before, I would do that. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2595.0400000000004s)]
*  But yeah, I'm just trying to be smart. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2596.4s)]
*  Maybe get some stem cells and some shit like that. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2598.76s)]
*  And just take and just rest it. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2601.84s)]
*  Let me see if Brigham got back to me. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2603.7200000000003s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2606.7200000000003s)]
*  I'll call him when we get out of here. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2607.28s)]
*  But I think we can get in there. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2608.84s)]
*  But yeah, just rest. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2610.2400000000002s)]
*  And rest. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2611.5600000000004s)]
*  But I can still work on my kicks. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2612.28s)]
*  I can still punch. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2614.48s)]
*  And so, yeah. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2615.76s)]
*  You were always getting in training. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2617.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2618.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2618.6800000000003s)]
*  That was a big win for you, man. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2620.0s)]
*  Kelvin, I really think, and I've said this to Kelvin. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2621.36s)]
*  This is back when he was fighting in 85, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2625.8s)]
*  after he knocked out Bisping. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2627.6800000000003s)]
*  I was like, dude, I think you're a world champion in 170. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2629.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2632.0s)]
*  I really do. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2632.5200000000004s)]
*  And this was years ago. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2633.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2633.92s)]
*  He just didn't want to make that weight cut. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2634.76s)]
*  And he's not a big guy. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2636.88s)]
*  He's not big, man. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2637.84s)]
*  He's not. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2639.2400000000002s)]
*  He's not even big for once. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2640.0s)]
*  No, he's not. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2641.1600000000003s)]
*  Guys like Philly. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2642.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2643.84s)]
*  Even when I grabbed him, I was like, oh, these [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2644.8s)]
*  are the easiest takedowns I've ever gotten in my life. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2648.1600000000003s)]
*  I couldn't believe how easy it was to get him down. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2650.88s)]
*  And even when I wrapped around his legs, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2653.1600000000003s)]
*  he has a big framed upper body, but his legs, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2655.84s)]
*  I would lock under his butt. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2658.72s)]
*  They're small. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2659.84s)]
*  And it was so easy to take him down. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2660.32s)]
*  And like I was saying to you earlier, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2661.92s)]
*  I walk around 195, 200. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2664.68s)]
*  Most guys, we're not like, I think [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2666.48s)]
*  he's better off at middleweight. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2669.2s)]
*  Because I think he found a niche where [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2670.88s)]
*  he was a lot faster than a lot of those guys. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2672.56s)]
*  So like Bisping, he was in and out on him. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2674.68s)]
*  Tim Kennedy, all these guys, he was fucking up with his hands. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2676.88s)]
*  He was just a lot faster then. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2679.68s)]
*  Well, the Tim Kennedy fight, I know for sure, for a fact, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2681.36s)]
*  the Tim Kennedy overtrained. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2684.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2686.0s)]
*  And that's what, because Tim Kennedy, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2686.52s)]
*  who's known for his cardio, gassed out in that fight. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2688.36s)]
*  I watched that fight a million times. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2691.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2692.92s)]
*  Just studying him. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2693.44s)]
*  The fight sucks, because Tim's a friend. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2694.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2696.16s)]
*  Watch him get beat up. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2696.88s)]
*  He's like, because I know how good he is when he beat Bisping. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2697.92s)]
*  Like Tim Kennedy was a fucking monster. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2701.36s)]
*  He, yeah. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2703.88s)]
*  And he just went through two camps in a row. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2705.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2708.4s)]
*  And it's almost like in our minds, we always [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2708.88s)]
*  think more is better. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2712.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2713.72s)]
*  I'll take a day off now, or even just a session, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2714.68s)]
*  like a night session. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2717.16s)]
*  And I'll come in the next day. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2718.08s)]
*  And I'm like, and you want to get after it more. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2719.64s)]
*  It gives you that, like, I fucking [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2721.76s)]
*  can't wait to get back in there. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2723.4s)]
*  And then you feel fresh when you go into that. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2724.76s)]
*  Like, we'll train till 8, 30, 9 o'clock at night. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2726.92s)]
*  And then we have practice at 9, 30 the next morning. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2729.88s)]
*  So you're at the gym. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2732.52s)]
*  You go home. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2733.68s)]
*  You sleep. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2734.2000000000003s)]
*  You're right back at the gym. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2734.68s)]
*  I do the same drive from my house to the gym. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2737.0s)]
*  I could close my eyes and drive there, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2740.2000000000003s)]
*  because I'm there all day fucking long. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2741.96s)]
*  But when you have those little breaks in between, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2744.52s)]
*  you go back in. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2746.84s)]
*  You're like, all right, I can't wait to fucking get back in here. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2747.48s)]
*  Yeah, that was interesting talking to Bo Nicol about that, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2749.6800000000003s)]
*  because Bo takes two days off a week. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2752.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2754.12s)]
*  And I listened to that. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2754.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2755.48s)]
*  And I was like, why do you do that? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2755.76s)]
*  And he's like, it's the right way to do it. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2757.36s)]
*  Sundays are my day. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2759.8s)]
*  Like, I try to do nothing. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2761.44s)]
*  Like, not live. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2764.7200000000003s)]
*  Like, I'll go on a long walk, or walk my dog, or run my dog, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2765.56s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2769.0s)]
*  I tried no training on Sunday, regardless. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2770.12s)]
*  But I think two days is probably the way to go. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2772.56s)]
*  Or even Thursday, I'll do a jujitsu session in the morning [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2775.2400000000002s)]
*  and take the rest of the day off. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2779.1600000000003s)]
*  And that'll be a lighter day or something like that. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2780.56s)]
*  I've counted my sessions. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2784.36s)]
*  And by the end of it, including every workout I do, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2785.56s)]
*  I'm at like 22 or 23 workouts in a week. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2788.28s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2791.6800000000003s)]
*  There's no other sport like it. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2792.92s)]
*  It's nuts. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2794.52s)]
*  And then we start, like, I'm eating like 3,000 calories, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2795.24s)]
*  2,700, 2,500. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2799.16s)]
*  And I'm cutting my calories down. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2800.68s)]
*  And we're still in our minds, we're [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2802.7599999999998s)]
*  like, we have to keep that same workload. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2804.7999999999997s)]
*  Or ramp it up even more. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2808.04s)]
*  Because when you're in camp, you're [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2810.08s)]
*  going a little bit harder. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2812.0s)]
*  So it's a motherfucker. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2813.04s)]
*  It's got to fuck with your mind. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2814.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2816.64s)]
*  Especially when you're cutting the calories down. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2817.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2818.9199999999996s)]
*  Because you're like, damn, I'm supposed to feel this way. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2819.68s)]
*  And I fucking feel like shit. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2821.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2823.24s)]
*  And you know, fights four weeks out, three weeks out, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2824.4s)]
*  two weeks out. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2826.92s)]
*  And then if you miss a session, that's [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2827.44s)]
*  where you're like, oh shit, he's fucking training. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2829.2400000000002s)]
*  You know? [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2832.52s)]
*  And I'm not fucking training. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2833.04s)]
*  But that's where you got to be like, I'm recovering. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2834.96s)]
*  You got to trust the process. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2837.88s)]
*  I have the sauna. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2838.84s)]
*  I have the ice. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2839.84s)]
*  I have the Norma Tech boots. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2840.56s)]
*  I have all these things. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2842.1600000000003s)]
*  But even just sleep. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2843.28s)]
*  I'm in bed in training camp no later than 9.30. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2845.1200000000003s)]
*  I have it like 9.30 at night. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2848.28s)]
*  I'm asleep. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2849.88s)]
*  And I'm up at 6. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2850.44s)]
*  No matter what my schedule is. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2852.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm fucking on that shit. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2854.24s)]
*  And that's the bet. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2855.64s)]
*  Sleep is the number one thing you can do. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2856.8399999999997s)]
*  100%. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2859.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that's the superpower. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2860.7999999999997s)]
*  Tito Ortiz used to sleep 12 hours a night. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2862.56s)]
*  I wish I could sleep 12 hours. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2865.64s)]
*  He would fucking close all the windows, the shades, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2866.7599999999998s)]
*  make the room dark as fuck, and just conk out all night. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2870.2799999999997s)]
*  I think like eight hours is like, minimum seven, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2874.08s)]
*  like seven to nine. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2877.7599999999998s)]
*  But if I get like eight hours, I feel [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2878.64s)]
*  like that's the sweet spot for me. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2880.16s)]
*  I feel good. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2881.9599999999996s)]
*  It is interesting that this sport, which [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2883.68s)]
*  is relatively recent, the UFC didn't even exist before 1993. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2885.48s)]
*  And yet, guys here in 2024 are still kind of just dialing it [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2890.64s)]
*  in. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2897.0s)]
*  And there's no established protocol that everyone uses. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2897.7599999999998s)]
*  Everyone's got their own kind of methods [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2901.72s)]
*  that are using different individual coaches. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2903.44s)]
*  Well, even like, I know guys who are high level fighters who [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2906.0s)]
*  don't know dick about nutrition, don't [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2909.8799999999997s)]
*  know dick about nutrition, recovery, nothing. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2912.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm like, and they're just naturally talented. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2914.56s)]
*  And I'm like, man, these guys don't even know. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2917.3199999999997s)]
*  So it is crazy. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2920.56s)]
*  It's going to be crazy to see where it goes. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2922.12s)]
*  But like you were saying about Tim, though, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2924.3599999999997s)]
*  I hit up Tim before I was coming out here [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2926.2799999999997s)]
*  and before my hand was hurting me too much. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2927.96s)]
*  I was going to try to work out with him [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2929.88s)]
*  because he does some fucking hard ass workouts. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2931.54s)]
*  And I love that shit. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2934.52s)]
*  So he told me he was traveling. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2935.4s)]
*  But I'm going to come back and train with Gordon [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2937.2s)]
*  and train with Tim. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2940.08s)]
*  And Tim's a motherfucker. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2940.84s)]
*  He's a savage, bro. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2942.56s)]
*  No, he does some animal shit. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2943.6s)]
*  His cardio sessions are legendary. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2946.2s)]
*  I love it. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2947.92s)]
*  On the ski ergs. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2948.72s)]
*  And I love that shit. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2950.08s)]
*  It'd be super fun to get in on that. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2951.4s)]
*  And the guy isn't even fighting anymore. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2953.2s)]
*  He's still in fucking tip top shape. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2954.92s)]
*  Yeah, he's an animal. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2957.32s)]
*  He's jacked. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2958.8s)]
*  Yeah, and that fight always bothered me, that Kelvin fight. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2959.72s)]
*  Because I knew what was wrong with him. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2963.52s)]
*  Because I knew he had had a fight. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2965.44s)]
*  He went into camp and then the fight got canceled. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2967.88s)]
*  And then it got rescheduled. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2970.52s)]
*  He either got rescheduled or got a new opponent. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2972.4s)]
*  I remember what happened. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2974.08s)]
*  But then he went right back into camp. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2975.1200000000003s)]
*  So he's essentially in camp for like. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2977.6000000000004s)]
*  Probably 16 weeks. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2979.96s)]
*  Yeah, something nuts. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2980.92s)]
*  Where you can't. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2982.7200000000003s)]
*  You just can't do that. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2983.56s)]
*  Your body's going to break down. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2984.48s)]
*  And then you're cutting weight. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2985.44s)]
*  And then you have to gain the weight back [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2986.76s)]
*  because you don't want to stay too low. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2988.2000000000003s)]
*  That's where it starts to get like, this is fucked up. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2989.8s)]
*  I need to let my body recover. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2993.8s)]
*  There's some guys where I look at them and I'm like, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2997.12s)]
*  how are you making, like Joe, how are you making 185 Joe Piper? [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=2999.24s)]
*  Yeah, he's a big boy. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3003.2799999999997s)]

*  He's a big boy. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3005.24s)]
*  That doesn't even make sense. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3006.08s)]
*  He's so big. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3006.92s)]

*  That's it? [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3012.64s)]
*  No, he doesn't get that big. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3013.48s)]
*  He looks even bigger than that. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3014.3199999999997s)]
*  He doesn't get that big. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3015.16s)]
*  He looks like 230. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3016.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, God. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3017.16s)]

*  Yeah, he does, he does. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3018.84s)]
*  When he's in the octagon, this is a heavyweight almost. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3019.68s)]
*  Yeah, he, but like 215, 220 for him. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3022.36s)]
*  He's got a big fight coming up. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3025.68s)]
*  He's fighting Hermansen. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3027.84s)]
*  That's right. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3028.68s)]
*  At a main event. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3029.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good fight for him. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3030.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good fight. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3031.18s)]
*  That motherfucker hits so hard. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3032.02s)]
*  We should tell everybody that he broke Francis Nganu's [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3033.48s)]
*  record on that punch machine. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3036.88s)]
*  And they weren't trying to give it to him [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3038.6s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3040.04s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't want to register it. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3040.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3041.7200000000003s)]

*  I've trained and been hit. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3043.92s)]

*  I don't know. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3045.96s)]
*  The guy was saying like something was weird with the machine [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3046.8s)]
*  and Joe was like, he did it like three times. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3048.88s)]
*  Like three times in a row. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3051.2s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, he didn't believe that it was real. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3053.92s)]

*  Like Joey cracks. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3058.32s)]

*  Who was his last fight? [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3062.96s)]
*  Who was his last fight against? [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3063.88s)]
*  Abdul Alhassan. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3065.76s)]

*  Holy shit. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3069.36s)]
*  He submitted him. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3070.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but bro, he was putting it on him before that. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3071.02s)]
*  Yeah, he's smooth. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3073.0400000000004s)]
*  He's on another level right now. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3073.88s)]
*  Joey's good. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3075.1200000000003s)]

*  but I just, I just couldn't throw. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3337.6s)]
*  I'm like, I was just like, I just kind of quit. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3339.9199999999996s)]
*  Like I was like, I just didn't know what to do [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3342.24s)]
*  in that moment. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3344.3999999999996s)]
*  And that's the only time I ever quit on myself, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3345.24s)]
*  like practice anything. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3347.7599999999998s)]
*  And ever since then, like I started working [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3349.3599999999997s)]
*  with two mental performance coaches [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3351.68s)]
*  and I'm just like a completely different person now, [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3353.8799999999997s)]
*  but it's the best thing that ever happened to me. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3356.56s)]
*  That's a lot of times fighters say that. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3358.9199999999996s)]
*  It's like, you need to feel the sting of defeat. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3360.56s)]
*  I'm telling you Joe, the minute I lost, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3363.3999999999996s)]
*  it felt like like a fucking, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3365.9599999999996s)]
*  like a Bronco was lifted off my shoulders. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3367.68s)]
*  Like I was so like, I was like, yo, like this is going to be, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3369.9199999999996s)]
*  this is going to be the best thing that ever happened to me. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3373.6s)]
*  Because the, just the pressure of being undefeated. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3375.92s)]
*  Just let it go. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3378.0s)]
*  Like every time like I was going into a fight, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3378.84s)]
*  I'm like, I had the pressure of not only just losing [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3380.56s)]
*  and what comes with losing, but I'm like, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3383.08s)]
*  if I lose my record, like no one, like it's over. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3384.96s)]
*  And then I'm like, it's one fucking fight. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3387.7599999999998s)]
*  Like I've won 15 fights in a row. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3389.7599999999998s)]
*  I lost one fight. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3391.56s)]
*  Like it's not how it works. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3392.52s)]
*  And I just thought like, I just thought like my life [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3394.12s)]
*  was going to like implode and it didn't, you know? [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3396.36s)]
*  I had a hard, like I said, I came home [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3399.64s)]
*  and I definitely trained way too hard [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3401.68s)]
*  because I wanted to come back and fight again. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3403.0s)]
*  And I fucked myself up doing that. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3404.64s)]
*  But that even gave me more time to sit and reflect [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3406.16s)]
*  with myself and just get my shit right and realize like, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3409.7599999999998s)]
*  like it's not, it's not, it doesn't mean everything [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3413.44s)]
*  to be undefeated. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3416.6s)]
*  Like the best fighters in the world take losses. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3417.44s)]
*  And yeah, I needed that for sure. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3419.64s)]
*  Yeah, the only one who didn't is John. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3422.44s)]
*  John Jones, the only one who didn't. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3423.96s)]
*  But if Khabib, if you were stuck around long enough, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3425.48s)]
*  right, you know, so you never, he had a couple of close ones, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3427.8399999999997s)]
*  close one with Glace and T-Bow. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3431.52s)]
*  Glace and T-Bow's very debatable. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3433.04s)]
*  I watched that fight a lot. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3434.76s)]
*  Go back and watch it again. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3435.6s)]
*  Yeah, very close. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3436.44s)]
*  But we're all, it's, you have a 50% chance of going, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3437.32s)]
*  you're going to win or you're going to lose. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3441.08s)]
*  And when you're fighting the best guys in the world, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3442.4s)]
*  like, Balal's good. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3443.92s)]
*  Like I know I can beat Balal, but I'm happy for him to, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3445.08s)]
*  he went on, he beat Gilbert. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3447.6s)]
*  He's going to fight for the belt next and I'll win. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3448.88s)]
*  Is that established? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3451.2400000000002s)]
*  Is he definitely fighting for the belt next? [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3452.12s)]
*  They haven't announced it, but there's nobody else. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3454.04s)]
*  No, I would hope nobody leaves for awesome. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3456.44s)]
*  He deserves it. He deserves it. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3459.08s)]
*  100%. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3460.6800000000003s)]
*  He's being the most guys in the top 10, you know, [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3461.52s)]
*  like he deserves. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3464.16s)]
*  I think he's on a 10 fight win streak. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3465.0s)]
*  Yeah, he deserves it. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3467.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3467.96s)]
*  And I think he has a good chance of doing really well. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3468.8s)]
*  And they also fought before he got eye-pumped. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3470.64s)]
*  Yeah, so it's, it's there for him. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3472.7599999999998s)]
*  Like he deserves it and he should get it. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3476.16s)]
*  And I'm happy for him. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3477.96s)]
*  He broken, I don't know why he gets so much hate. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3478.8s)]
*  Like he's not, he's not a bad dude. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3481.2s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3483.88s)]
*  He trains fucking hard and- [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3484.72s)]
*  He won't even swear. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3486.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3487.04s)]
*  You know when he was in here? [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3487.88s)]
*  I'm fucking cursing a million times. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3488.7s)]
*  I'm not lying to you too, but he would say, [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3489.66s)]
*  what the fudge? [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3491.42s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3493.94s)]
*  You're a goddamn cage fighter. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3494.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he gets a lot of hate, but I'm happy for him. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3496.02s)]
*  And that's going to be a good, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3498.5s)]
*  that's going to be a good fight. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3500.46s)]
*  He's a big guy for 170, man. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3501.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3503.22s)]
*  Bilal's very large. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3504.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3504.9s)]
*  You know, he's not a small 170 at all. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3505.74s)]
*  No, it's going to be, that's going to be a good fight. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3507.38s)]
*  Very good fight. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3509.38s)]
*  I, I wasn't super, like, I wasn't super impressed [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3510.22s)]
*  with that Colby-Leon fight. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3513.94s)]
*  You weren't? [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3516.58s)]
*  No, definitely not on Colby's side. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3517.4s)]
*  No, not on Colby's side. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3519.5s)]
*  That's the fight I- [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3520.34s)]
*  I was impressed with Leon. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3521.18s)]
*  I want the, I want the Colby fight. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3522.02s)]
*  I think that the problem in that Colby fight is Leon. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3523.54s)]
*  He was so dangerous. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3526.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3528.02s)]
*  He was so sharp. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3528.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3529.68s)]
*  He's so technical on his feet. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3530.52s)]
*  And I think in that fight, he was, you know, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3531.94s)]
*  cause Colby talked so much shit. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3534.14s)]
*  I think he was really- [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3536.1s)]
*  The shit with his dad was fucked up. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3536.94s)]
*  Fuck, god. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3537.86s)]
*  Like, you don't, like, say whatever you want about me, [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3538.7s)]
*  my team, whatever, but like, you start talking about [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3541.86s)]
*  people's, like, their parents, their wives, their kids, [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3543.78s)]
*  especially if one of them's dead, like, [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3546.78s)]
*  that shit you get fucked up in the parking lot for. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3549.2599999999998s)]
*  Like, you don't do shit like that. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3551.34s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3552.5s)]
*  So- [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3553.34s)]
*  Well, you know, that's Colby. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3554.16s)]
*  He's the master at getting under people's skin, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3555.0s)]
*  but I think in that fight it backfired. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3556.98s)]
*  Yeah, and he looked, like, I was watching him. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3558.38s)]
*  I'm like, what the? [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3561.18s)]
*  Like, I didn't know what was happening with him. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3562.1s)]
*  Like, he just wasn't doing anything. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3563.58s)]
*  No, he didn't look good. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3565.22s)]
*  And then Leon shot on him and was like, [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3566.88s)]
*  I think he wanted to just make a point. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3568.62s)]
*  Like, I can take you down. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3569.9s)]
*  Yeah, and he did. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3571.18s)]
*  No, Leon's fucking good. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3572.34s)]
*  Yeah, his grappling is very good. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3573.66s)]
*  Leon's good, but it almost, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3575.46s)]
*  he got reversed a couple of times. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3577.54s)]
*  So he shot, and then Colby kinda switched it up on him. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3579.1s)]
*  And Colby wanted him on top. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3581.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3582.62s)]
*  Well, I think that was where the tactical errors remained. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3583.44s)]
*  And that's what I was critiquing at the fight. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3586.1s)]
*  I was like, I don't think he fought the smartest way, [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3588.18s)]
*  because I think he could have avoided those exchanges, [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3591.06s)]
*  and he had this massive advantage in the stand-up. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3592.94s)]
*  Super clean. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3595.7799999999997s)]
*  Like, he would've came out of that fight unscathed [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3596.62s)]
*  if he didn't do that, but yeah, the decisions- [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3599.62s)]
*  He still won the fight, really. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3601.66s)]
*  But at the end of the fight, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3603.5s)]
*  when Colby's on top of him at the very end of the fight, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3604.6s)]
*  that doesn't look good. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3607.54s)]
*  No, no. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3608.38s)]
*  He won 100%, he looked great. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3609.2200000000003s)]
*  And on the feet, man, he is so sharp. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3611.46s)]
*  His south ball is really fucking good. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3614.42s)]
*  He's sharp as fuck. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3617.1400000000003s)]
*  No, he's good, and he's long. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3617.98s)]
*  He's big, too. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3618.98s)]
*  We're all fucking, all 70-pounders are big. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3619.82s)]
*  Yeah, there's the day of the 70-pounder [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3621.7000000000003s)]
*  walking around at 70, those are gone. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3624.1800000000003s)]
*  Long gone. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3626.42s)]
*  55, Paul used to get up to 200 pounds [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3627.26s)]
*  when he would fight at 55. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3629.86s)]
*  I was like, dude, I weigh 203 right now. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3631.6200000000003s)]
*  I'll be like, bro, you're eight pounds heavier than me. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3634.46s)]
*  But he'd be like fat, he'd be drinking IPAs, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3637.86s)]
*  and after he would fight, he would get huge. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3640.38s)]
*  Like Patty Pimlet fat? [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3643.78s)]
*  Not that fat, that boy is fat. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3645.38s)]
*  He got fat so quick. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3648.26s)]
*  Did you see him in December after his fight? [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3649.7400000000002s)]
*  His face, he just goes on, I'm like, dude, [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3651.86s)]
*  you're going to a different, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3655.3s)]
*  but fighters have fucking eating disorders. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3656.54s)]
*  We 100% all have eating disorders, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3659.78s)]
*  because you're eating this way, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3661.66s)]
*  and then you're cutting out food, [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3663.42s)]
*  and then you're craving all these foods. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3664.62s)]
*  It's a fucking, it's a wild, wild way to live. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3666.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, there's Patty now. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3670.54s)]
*  Look at him, look at all fat and happy. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3672.58s)]
*  Look how tight that shirt is on him. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3674.7400000000002s)]
*  It's so crazy how much weight he gains. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3676.5s)]
*  It's so nuts, because he was shredded during that fight. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3678.5s)]
*  Yeah, he gets big. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3681.5s)]
*  He does. He gets big. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3684.26s)]
*  He got a lot of shit from that Tony Ferguson fight, [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3685.46s)]
*  but I was very impressed. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3687.34s)]
*  I was very impressed with his grappling, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3688.54s)]
*  I was impressed with his striking. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3689.98s)]
*  I think everything looked better. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3691.1400000000003s)]
*  And at the end of the day, he won the fight. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3692.34s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3693.86s)]
*  He found a way to win. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3694.7000000000003s)]
*  He definitely, the third round got a little sketchy, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3695.6600000000003s)]
*  but he found a way to win. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3697.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but people saying that he didn't look good, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3699.42s)]
*  and it's just, I thought he looked great. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3701.7000000000003s)]
*  Tony Ferguson is still dangerous. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3704.7400000000002s)]
*  He's still dangerous. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3707.38s)]
*  He was dangerous in the Gachey fight [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3708.54s)]
*  until Gachey started beating him up. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3710.2200000000003s)]
*  He was dangerous in the Chandler fight. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3711.7400000000002s)]
*  Drop Chandler. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3713.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, he's still fucking dangerous, man. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3714.5800000000004s)]
*  I don't think people realize, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3717.5s)]
*  you go in there and you have 15 minutes, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3719.02s)]
*  and you could have woke up that day, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3721.34s)]
*  had the fucking worst headache. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3722.9s)]
*  You could feel like shit, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3724.5800000000004s)]
*  or it just could not be your night. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3725.6600000000003s)]
*  So that's why in that moment, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3727.34s)]
*  you have to make the best of it, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3729.46s)]
*  but some days, it's just not your day. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3731.1400000000003s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3733.7400000000002s)]
*  But in the gym, you get that day, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3735.1800000000003s)]
*  you get to go back the next day. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3737.5800000000004s)]
*  But a guy like Tony, at what point does someone step in? [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3739.02s)]
*  Now. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3742.46s)]
*  You think? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3743.34s)]
*  Yeah, it has to be. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3744.1800000000003s)]
*  It's what, six or seven fights? [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3745.0s)]
*  I think it's seven in a row. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3746.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3747.7000000000003s)]
*  And it's not like, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3748.9s)]
*  if you were to win that fight, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3751.46s)]
*  I would still like to see, [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3752.46s)]
*  me and my buddy, I was cheering, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3753.86s)]
*  Tony, Tony, and anytime he would do anything, [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3755.1s)]
*  just because I fucking love Tony Ferguson, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3758.78s)]
*  but it's time. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3760.6600000000003s)]
*  And it was awesome having Goggins there and all that shit, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3762.94s)]
*  but just hang it up. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3767.2200000000003s)]
*  You're just doing more damage. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3769.78s)]
*  I also don't know what he's doing in training. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3771.62s)]
*  The Goggins stuff is great and everything like that, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3775.38s)]
*  but who is he sparring with? [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3777.1800000000003s)]
*  Is he? [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3779.46s)]
*  Are you doing skill work? [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3780.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what he's doing. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3781.14s)]
*  If you're gonna do this shit with Goggins, [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3782.54s)]
*  do that outside of training camp. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3783.98s)]
*  Do that when you don't have a fight. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3786.2599999999998s)]
*  You build up that aerobic capacity [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3788.2999999999997s)]
*  when you're not getting ready for a fight. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3790.54s)]
*  I'm sure he was, but it kinda seems like he always just [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3792.62s)]
*  did whatever he wanted to do. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3795.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, well it worked for a long time [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3797.1s)]
*  when he was the boogie man. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3799.3399999999997s)]
*  He was fucking everybody up. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3800.18s)]
*  Those chokes that he was hitting on people, the darses. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3801.8199999999997s)]
*  Yep, that's in Barbosa fight. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3804.74s)]
*  He would lock that shit on you and you were done. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3806.7s)]
*  Cowboy, he was cutting cowboy up. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3809.14s)]
*  Pettis, he was fucking people up. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3811.46s)]
*  Tony was a real scary man for many, many years. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3814.18s)]
*  And then he tripped on one cord. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3817.62s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3818.8199999999997s)]
*  And it all changed. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3819.66s)]
*  Isn't that fucking crazy? [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3820.5s)]
*  Getting ready for the Khabib fight, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3822.2999999999997s)]
*  Madison Square Garden. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3823.7s)]
*  Tripped on a cord. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3824.8599999999997s)]
*  Massive fight. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3825.7s)]
*  And tripped over a cord. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3827.22s)]
*  And your knee is done. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3828.06s)]
*  Just pillows his knee out. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3828.8999999999996s)]
*  Doesn't make any sense. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3829.98s)]
*  And then he came back from that super fast. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3830.94s)]
*  Beated Pettis, yeah. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3832.54s)]
*  Oh, he won after that. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3834.2599999999998s)]
*  Oh, he beat Pettis after that. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3835.82s)]
*  He beat the shit out of Pettis. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3836.6600000000003s)]
*  I remember the fight. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3837.7000000000003s)]
*  He beat the shit out of Pettis. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3838.7000000000003s)]
*  But I didn't know if that was before or after. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3839.6600000000003s)]
*  No, that was after. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3842.02s)]
*  That was his comeback fight. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3842.86s)]
*  Because Pettis was kicking the shit out of that leg. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3843.78s)]
*  And it was only, if I want to remember correctly, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3846.38s)]
*  five months or so after the surgery. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3849.2200000000003s)]
*  It was like five or seven months. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3851.9s)]
*  It was short. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3853.06s)]
*  Very quick. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3853.82s)]
*  Fucking short. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3854.46s)]
*  And I don't know shit about knees, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3855.1800000000003s)]
*  but I know that sounds very short. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3856.1800000000003s)]
*  It was ridiculously short. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3857.98s)]
*  When I talked to people that knew about that surgery [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3859.6200000000003s)]
*  and knew about how bad his knee was, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3862.38s)]
*  he did his own rehab. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3864.86s)]
*  Of course. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3866.26s)]
*  Yeah, he's just amazing. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3866.98s)]
*  But he was the man. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3868.06s)]
*  He was the man. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3870.58s)]
*  But I think it's that time. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3871.42s)]
*  It's father time. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3873.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3874.42s)]
*  Wins all fights. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3874.94s)]
*  Like him, it was nice to see Cowboy be done [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3876.1s)]
*  when he was done. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3878.54s)]
*  Because I was telling you earlier, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3879.46s)]
*  being a Cowboy, when Cowboy was on, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3881.34s)]
*  I think he was the best fighter in the fucking world. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3884.7400000000002s)]
*  He was so goddamn good. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3886.46s)]
*  And he would fuck us all up down at the rants. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3888.82s)]
*  Like me, Jonovan Webb, Paul. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3891.7400000000002s)]
*  He would beat the shit out of everybody. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3893.9s)]
*  And then, yeah, even Jim Miller. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3895.62s)]
*  I remember him head kicking Jim Miller [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3898.38s)]
*  when they first fought in AC. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3900.02s)]
*  Knocked him out. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3901.38s)]
*  And then his last fight was Jim Miller. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3901.98s)]
*  And Jim got the best of him. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3903.7400000000002s)]
*  So it's like, all right, it's time to... [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3905.26s)]
*  Yeah, at a certain point in time. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3908.3s)]
*  But he knew. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3910.7000000000003s)]
*  But look at him now. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3911.6600000000003s)]
*  He's fucking all soft stuff. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3912.7400000000002s)]
*  He's fucking, he looks great. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3913.98s)]
*  He's jacked. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3915.78s)]
*  I love it. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3916.78s)]
*  He looks... [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3917.5s)]
*  He's got a hair transplant. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3917.82s)]
*  And that's another thing I think. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3919.02s)]
*  I just did, I started working with Merrick Health. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3920.58s)]
*  I just did all my blood work last week. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3922.9s)]
*  So I'm waiting for that just to see where we're at after fights. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3924.7000000000003s)]
*  So check my testosterone. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3928.38s)]
*  Just check all my shit. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3929.9s)]
*  I'm trying to really dial all that shit in. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3931.46s)]
*  And a lot of guys don't do that. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3934.5s)]
*  Well, I think if you want to compete [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3936.42s)]
*  against the best of the best, you got to cross all your Ts [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3937.94s)]
*  and dot all your Is. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3941.38s)]
*  You got to make sure all your ducks are in a row. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3942.86s)]
*  And the difference between the guys who are just super talented, [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3946.1s)]
*  who don't take care of nutrition and still perform [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3948.5s)]
*  at a very high level, and the guys [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3950.7400000000002s)]
*  who are also talented like yourself, but dialed everything in. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3952.62s)]
*  That's how you become a champion. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3956.7799999999997s)]
*  That makes a difference, yeah. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3957.2999999999997s)]
*  Because even when I'm done fighting, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3958.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm going right into Jiu-Jitsu. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3960.3399999999997s)]
*  I can't wait to compete Jiu-Jitsu. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3961.94s)]
*  That's going to be so fun. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3964.06s)]
*  Because Nogi's getting so fucking big now. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3965.9s)]
*  And you've got guys like Wagner. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3968.1s)]
*  He's like 45 years old, still competing and winning. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3970.14s)]
*  So I'm super excited to get into that too. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3972.66s)]
*  But I got a lot more fighting in me. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3975.42s)]
*  That's for sure. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3977.58s)]
*  Do you think when you stop fighting MMA, [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3977.9s)]
*  you'll compete in Jiu-Jitsu? [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3980.54s)]
*  Oh, that's what I want to do. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3982.18s)]
*  Really? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3983.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3984.06s)]
*  And obviously, I want to open a gym one day. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3984.42s)]
*  But I want to compete just straight Jiu-Jitsu, like Nogi. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3986.62s)]
*  I did Gi for 10 years. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3989.2999999999997s)]
*  So I did Gi for a long time. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3990.5s)]
*  I haven't done it in a while. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3992.46s)]
*  Because I feel like to a certain point, it's like, all right, [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3993.54s)]
*  I've done this. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3997.46s)]
*  I'll pick it up when I'm done for sure. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3998.1s)]
*  But I love just hard Nogi. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=3999.7799999999997s)]
*  I love it. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4002.5s)]
*  It's so fucking fun to me. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4003.22s)]
*  And it's getting so big. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4004.94s)]
*  These guys are ADCC. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4006.06s)]
*  It's at T-Mobile next year. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4007.46s)]
*  Yep. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4009.14s)]
*  Next year. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4009.54s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4009.98s)]
*  Gordon, and he's the fucking best. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4010.82s)]
*  I was at the last one that they did AC in Vegas. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4013.78s)]
*  And it was an enormous place. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4016.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4017.82s)]
*  And like you said, it's getting huge. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4018.7000000000003s)]
*  I didn't realize he was sitting next to you at the fights [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4020.38s)]
*  when I was talking to you. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4022.6600000000003s)]
*  He's the man. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4023.6600000000003s)]
*  I was going to train with him this week. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4024.26s)]
*  I can't wait to train with him, though. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4025.7400000000002s)]
*  But I remember seeing those guys back at Henzo's. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4026.86s)]
*  Because I was going to the Henzo's a couple times a week [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4029.1400000000003s)]
*  training in the Blue Basement. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4031.78s)]
*  And I'd see Gordon and Craig when they were all still [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4032.98s)]
*  together. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4035.2200000000003s)]
*  And they were savages back then. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4035.7400000000002s)]
*  And they're still fucking doing it. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4037.54s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4039.7000000000003s)]
*  He's completely extraordinary. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4040.2599999999998s)]
*  When you look at a guy who's 28 years old, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4042.4199999999996s)]
*  he's universally accepted as the greatest ever. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4044.5s)]
*  Next. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4046.5s)]
*  That's nuts. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4046.98s)]
*  He's next level. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4047.74s)]
*  And that motherfucker doesn't take a day off. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4048.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4050.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4051.3799999999997s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4051.8999999999996s)]
*  No days off. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4052.5s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4053.18s)]
*  365 days a year they're training. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4053.74s)]
*  They're working on something. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4055.98s)]
*  And I'm sure they're training hard. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4057.14s)]
*  Training hard and working on skills. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4058.58s)]
*  And they watch tape. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4061.02s)]
*  And they break technique down. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4062.1s)]
*  It's not just like, ah, good enough. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4063.7799999999997s)]
*  Go home. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4065.98s)]
*  That's very systematic. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4066.8599999999997s)]
*  And that John Donner having that guy as your coach, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4068.82s)]
*  what a fucking cheat code that is. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4071.82s)]
*  I've seen the room. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4073.46s)]
*  It would be like, John, Gordon, GSP will be in there. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4074.26s)]
*  I'm like, dude, this room is fucking [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4077.5400000000004s)]
*  is crazy, like the people that they would have in there. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4079.3s)]
*  So you're only four. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4081.86s)]
*  You're going to get better, regardless. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4082.86s)]
*  I remember seeing GSP's corner. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4086.26s)]
*  It'd be like, John Donnerhair, Frost's a hobby, Greg Jackson, [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4087.7000000000003s)]
*  back when he would fight. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4091.2200000000003s)]
*  He was so ahead of his time doing shit like that. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4092.38s)]
*  I think GSP's. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4097.26s)]
*  He's like my goat of MMA, just the way, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4098.3s)]
*  being a true martial artist, even how he is now. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4101.62s)]
*  Guys, when they're done, they get fat. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4105.1s)]
*  They're done training. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4106.7s)]
*  Once they're done fighting, they're done. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4107.9800000000005s)]
*  He still trains. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4110.42s)]
*  He probably looks better now than he did back then. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4111.820000000001s)]
*  So I'm trying to follow that, for sure. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4113.9400000000005s)]
*  He keeps coming down here to train. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4117.860000000001s)]
*  I see him in Austin all the time. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4119.34s)]
*  He's here all the time. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4120.62s)]
*  I'm surprised he doesn't move down here. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4122.02s)]
*  Well, he just comes down to train. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4123.42s)]
*  I think he likes Montreal. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4124.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4125.9400000000005s)]
*  That gym kind of, TriStar was the shit for a while. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4128.06s)]
*  Amazing gym. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4131.1s)]
*  Haven't heard too many guys coming out of there now. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4131.580000000001s)]
*  I just feel like there's so many gyms now. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4133.9400000000005s)]
*  There's so many more gyms. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4136.02s)]
*  But it was GSP. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4137.700000000001s)]
*  They had Rory McDonnell. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4139.26s)]
*  Rory. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4140.38s)]
*  Rory was. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4140.860000000001s)]
*  Rory was a motherfucker. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4141.580000000001s)]
*  I remember watching him in his prime. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4142.700000000001s)]
*  I was young. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4143.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm like, this fucking guy is great. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4144.620000000001s)]
*  He was pretty fucking sharp. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4147.02s)]
*  He was very, very good this prime. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4149.26s)]
*  A couple of those wars, though, with Lawler. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4150.700000000001s)]
*  Robbie. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4153.740000000001s)]
*  Definitely shortened his career. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4154.26s)]
*  It was very nice seeing Robbie go out like that. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4155.740000000001s)]
*  That was beautiful. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4158.34s)]
*  It was Barberina, right? [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4159.3s)]
*  No. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4160.98s)]
*  It was, um. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4162.5s)]
*  Who? [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4164.66s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4166.38s)]
*  I thought it was Brian Barberina. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4167.42s)]
*  No. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4168.74s)]
*  God damn it. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4170.46s)]
*  It's at the tip of my tongue. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4171.38s)]
*  I'm looking at his face right now. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4172.46s)]
*  I can't pull up. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4173.58s)]
*  Nico Price. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4174.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4174.82s)]
*  Nico Price. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4175.0599999999995s)]
*  Nico Price. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4175.74s)]
*  Tough dude. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4176.26s)]
*  And Nico Price is fucking. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4177.0199999999995s)]
*  He's got some crazy knockouts and submissions, too. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4179.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4182.46s)]
*  That dude's a dog. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4182.98s)]
*  But Robbie went out right. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4183.82s)]
*  He went out on a win. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4185.179999999999s)]
*  That's got to feel. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4186.58s)]
*  First round knockout. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4187.74s)]
*  Didn't even get hit. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4188.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4189.42s)]
*  And everybody went crazy. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4189.9400000000005s)]
*  That's got to feel good. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4191.22s)]
*  We played this video. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4192.22s)]
*  It was beautiful. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4193.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4193.9400000000005s)]
*  For a guy like him. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4194.46s)]
*  And he's still, he's one of the main guys down at Kill Cliff. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4195.38s)]
*  Like he's still coaching. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4198.42s)]
*  Yep. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4199.7s)]
*  And that's great to see, too. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4199.9800000000005s)]
*  It is. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4201.3s)]
*  Because when a guy like that, if he's done, he leaves the gym. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4201.82s)]
*  Like a part of like, you lose part of that gym. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4205.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4208.1s)]
*  Yeah, this was awesome, him winning like that. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4209.14s)]
*  It really was fucking cool. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4211.3s)]
*  It was really cool. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4213.18s)]
*  Because it's just like, that's what you want to see from a legend. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4214.82s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4216.82s)]
*  But people forget that Ruth was Robbie Lawler days. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4218.299999999999s)]
*  Like when him and Rory had that fight, that was just guts. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4220.62s)]
*  And just survival. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4225.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4227.66s)]
*  In this, in his lips. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4228.179999999999s)]
*  When it was split like that. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4230.179999999999s)]
*  And I was interviewing him. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4231.82s)]
*  He was screaming. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4232.7s)]
*  His lips all spit. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4233.54s)]
*  Rory, you could tell Rory had it. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4235.179999999999s)]
*  His nose was smashed so bad. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4237.139999999999s)]
*  That last punch, I think it was probably a straight left. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4239.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4241.86s)]
*  He's like, I'm done. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4242.179999999999s)]
*  Like I just can't take any more pain at this point. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4243.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he was destroyed. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4245.299999999999s)]
*  When your nose is broken, you get hit in it, it's not fun. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4246.38s)]
*  Well, his face was pale too. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4249.9800000000005s)]
*  Like he had lost so much blood that his face was pale. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4252.18s)]
*  He was fucked up. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4255.06s)]
*  Yeah, what a crazy fight. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4256.74s)]
*  Look at his face. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4258.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, his face was just a mask of blood. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4260.42s)]
*  And this is like so iconic. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4262.42s)]
*  They're just staring at each other. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4264.5s)]
*  Look how flat his nose is there. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4265.86s)]
*  I mean, Rory's just face is destroyed. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4268.38s)]
*  Oh my, yeah. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4270.14s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4271.18s)]
*  It's just destroyed. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4271.78s)]
*  His face is destroyed. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4273.66s)]
*  I mean, that is as close to death as I think we've ever seen [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4275.46s)]
*  anybody get inside the octagon. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4278.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4279.02s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4280.02s)]
*  Look how pale he is. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4280.5s)]
*  And he went on to have some fucking good fights [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4284.46s)]
*  after that, but I was watching his career in PFL [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4287.3s)]
*  and it was just sad to see the way he went out. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4290.06s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think you go through a fight like that, [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4293.1s)]
*  you don't ever recover fully. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4295.86s)]
*  No, you don't. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4298.22s)]
*  And then you're back in the gym, you're training, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4298.94s)]
*  and then you fight again. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4301.66s)]
*  Everything's amplified in a fight. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4303.42s)]
*  It's just training times 10. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4305.18s)]
*  I've came out of fights where, quick fight for me, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4310.9800000000005s)]
*  but I still, I'll hit my elbow. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4314.5s)]
*  I'm like, what the fuck did I do to my elbow? [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4317.06s)]
*  You just come out of a fight and you still feel beat up, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4318.46s)]
*  even if it wasn't a super hard fight. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4321.3s)]
*  Even my fight with Kelvin, I didn't [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4323.700000000001s)]
*  land any crazy right hands, but my fucking hands [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4325.54s)]
*  been killing me for the last month. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4328.34s)]
*  So it's always something. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4329.900000000001s)]
*  And then you go through something like that. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4332.94s)]
*  Do you do any hyperbaric chamber work? [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4335.219999999999s)]
*  My strength coach has one, and I got in it. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4338.419999999999s)]
*  And I was having TMJ or something, and I got in there, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4341.74s)]
*  and my fucking ears start to pop, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4345.9s)]
*  and I got kind of freaked out, and I got out. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4347.62s)]
*  But I need to do it. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4349.9s)]
*  I know off-camp, but he's like, dude, you've got to get in. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4351.5s)]
*  You've got to get in. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4353.78s)]
*  That's the one thing. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4354.86s)]
*  That and float tanks are the two things I haven't got into yet. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4355.9s)]
*  But yeah, I need to do the hyperbaric. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4359.46s)]
*  They say it really, really helps recovery. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4364.22s)]
*  I know that Uriah Faber used it after the Jose Aldo fight. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4366.3s)]
*  Remember when he got his leg destroyed? [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4369.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4370.9s)]
*  I think I know, especially for your head too. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4371.94s)]
*  They say it's super, super good for your head. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4375.02s)]
*  Post concussions. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4377.18s)]
*  But like I said, stem cells, stuff like that, it does suck. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4378.62s)]
*  We can't do other peptides, because that shit helps. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4382.26s)]
*  And it's not like, test us for everything else. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4386.66s)]
*  Be there on site or whatever. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4390.42s)]
*  But I think that stuff would really help us out. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4392.38s)]
*  I don't know why it's illegal. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4395.3s)]
*  I think the argument is that it gives you [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4398.62s)]
*  a performance-enhancing benefit. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4400.3s)]
*  But I just think all it does is aid in recovery from injuries. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4401.74s)]
*  And I think if you're dealing with a sport where guys are [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4405.42s)]
*  literally training and preparing to injure each other, [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4409.099999999999s)]
*  that's what you do. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4412.74s)]
*  And you're getting injured while training, [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4413.82s)]
*  preparing to injure each other. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4416.18s)]
*  You're going to get injured. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4418.22s)]
*  There's no if, ands, or buts about it. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4419.3s)]
*  And it would be better for the sport overall, [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4420.900000000001s)]
*  if that was allowed. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4423.740000000001s)]
*  And I don't know why these athletic commissions don't [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4424.860000000001s)]
*  recognize, like, hey, this is not like steroids. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4427.34s)]
*  This is something that just helps your injuries here. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4430.22s)]
*  It's helping you recover. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4431.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm definitely happy, though, that we're done with USADA. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4433.42s)]
*  I'm hoping that, obviously, they're [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4436.26s)]
*  going to come and drug test us. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4438.5s)]
*  But don't come to my house at 6 AM or 7 AM. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4439.62s)]
*  And don't come when guys are cutting weight. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4442.34s)]
*  They came to my house the one night. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4444.700000000001s)]
*  It was 930 at night. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4446.1s)]
*  Luckily, there was fights going on. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4448.820000000001s)]
*  I was in camp, or else I would have been asleep. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4450.22s)]
*  I was watching Bellator on a Friday night. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4451.860000000001s)]
*  They knocked on my door. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4453.820000000001s)]
*  I look at my ring camera. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4454.860000000001s)]
*  My wife's like, it's fucking USADA. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4456.1s)]
*  I've never been mean to them. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4458.42s)]
*  And I wasn't even. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4459.620000000001s)]
*  I'm like, dude. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4460.14s)]
*  I looked at them. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4460.860000000001s)]
*  I'm like, I'm about to get in the bed. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4461.46s)]
*  They're like, we're sorry. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4463.58s)]
*  They have a protocol. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4464.780000000001s)]
*  They had it done. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4465.700000000001s)]
*  I'm like, I get it. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4466.22s)]
*  How long does it take? [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4466.9800000000005s)]
*  It's quick. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4468.26s)]
*  It can be quick. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4468.740000000001s)]
*  If they do blood, you have to sit down. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4469.46s)]
*  They time you for 10 minutes. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4472.26s)]
*  And then they take your blood. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4473.660000000001s)]
*  Then you have to do piss. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4474.700000000001s)]
*  So that can be annoying. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4475.86s)]
*  But if you just have to pee, you can run through it real quick. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4476.86s)]
*  But you have to get out all your supplements. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4479.78s)]
*  You have to write all that down. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4481.86s)]
*  So it takes probably 35, 40 minutes. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4483.179999999999s)]
*  So every time they come, you have [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4485.62s)]
*  to show them your supplements? [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4486.82s)]
*  Yep, every time. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4488.0599999999995s)]
*  They had them saved at one point. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4489.82s)]
*  But then they went away with that. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4491.299999999999s)]
*  So you'd have to redo it. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4492.58s)]
*  Any medications you take. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4493.86s)]
*  And then the dude has to come watch you piss. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4495.099999999999s)]
*  You have to pick out a cup. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4496.94s)]
*  So I never get like I haven't been drug [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4498.46s)]
*  tested by these new guys yet. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4500.259999999999s)]
*  But come at 3 o'clock. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4501.46s)]
*  Come when I'm home and I'm just sitting on my couch. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4503.42s)]
*  Well, I think the argument against that [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4505.58s)]
*  is if they can catch you. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4507.0599999999995s)]
*  Like if they come to your house at 9.30 AM. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4509.26s)]
*  If you take something that is in your system [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4511.82s)]
*  for a short period of time but provides benefits. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4514.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4516.82s)]
*  Like if you take some sort of oral testosterone at 9.30 PM [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4517.34s)]
*  right before you go to bed. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4520.38s)]
*  Like where to get you? [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4521.54s)]
*  And then like that was what they were [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4522.42s)]
*  doing with the gummies, right? [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4523.98s)]
*  With testosterone gummies in baseball. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4525.34s)]
*  Yeah, something like that. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4527.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4528.3s)]
*  So the idea is that you take it. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4528.8s)]
*  And then by the time they tested you, [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4530.42s)]
*  it would already be out of your system. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4532.34s)]
*  I think guys, like if you have enough money, [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4534.66s)]
*  I'm sure guys are gaming the system somehow. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4536.9s)]
*  Have you heard anything about how guys could do it? [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4539.58s)]
*  No, I haven't. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4541.78s)]
*  But I just feel like guys, like guys have to. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4542.86s)]
*  People are going to, if you can cheat, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4545.74s)]
*  somebody's going to cheat. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4547.42s)]
*  They're going to find a way. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4548.7s)]
*  But even with the IVs, I have heard of guys doing IVs still. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4549.94s)]
*  And I'm like, I guess like you said, [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4553.82s)]
*  like they say they trace plastic. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4556.58s)]
*  But I'm like, how could you even test for that? [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4558.0599999999995s)]
*  Because if you're drinking fucking gallons of water [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4559.38s)]
*  or whatever you're drinking with plastic, [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4561.94s)]
*  I guess there would be traces of plastic in there. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4563.34s)]
*  Maybe it's a different plastic. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4564.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4566.1s)]
*  Why don't you, Jamie, Google please, [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4566.62s)]
*  how do you detect if someone has had an IV, USADA? [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4568.18s)]
*  See if there's a way that explains it. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4572.7s)]
*  Because they were explaining to me [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4575.34s)]
*  that there is a workaround. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4576.74s)]
*  And the workaround would be if you got all the liquid [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4578.22s)]
*  into a glass vial. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4581.9400000000005s)]
*  I was literally, that's what I was thinking. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4584.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4585.78s)]
*  And then you injected the liquid back into someone's body [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4586.28s)]
*  slowly. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4589.5s)]
*  And instead of a drip, like with a hose, [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4590.78s)]
*  you're just going straight from a glass vial. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4593.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4595.9s)]
*  Sounds like a fucking process. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4596.9s)]
*  It's like a real process. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4598.259999999999s)]
*  Just for an IV. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4600.0599999999995s)]
*  The craziest one I've ever heard. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4601.0199999999995s)]
*  The craziest weight cut that I've ever heard, [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4602.78s)]
*  someone was cutting weight by getting their blood removed. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4605.66s)]
*  So they were getting their blood pulled from their body. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4609.0599999999995s)]
*  They were chilling it and then putting it back [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4611.78s)]
*  into their body. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4613.54s)]
*  Time for you to just move up a weight class. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4614.299999999999s)]
*  Here's the question, because blood doping, [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4617.099999999999s)]
*  that was a way that Tour de France and a lot of those guys [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4619.58s)]
*  would do it, where they would take blood out of their body. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4624.06s)]
*  And then they put it back in, right? [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4625.94s)]
*  Yeah, their body would recover and build that blood back up. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4627.1s)]
*  And then they would put that blood back in. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4629.9s)]
*  So they'd have all this extra blood. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4631.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4633.26s)]
*  And it would give them extra oxygen. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4633.78s)]
*  Blood doping, that's the craziest one. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4635.66s)]
*  If you're going to do anything, if you just never get tired, [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4639.0199999999995s)]
*  that's the most superhuman thing you can fucking do. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4643.46s)]
*  Strength and all that is cool. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4646.42s)]
*  But if you can just never get tired, [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4648.58s)]
*  that's next level shit. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4650.94s)]
*  Well, there's been guys that get popped for EPO. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4652.9s)]
*  A DJ? [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4655.14s)]
*  Yeah, well, there's actually a documentary [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4656.14s)]
*  that the UFC did that just came out last week. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4658.3s)]
*  I started it. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4660.42s)]
*  I watched it. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4661.22s)]
*  It's wild when you see what he looked like. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4662.34s)]
*  He was a skeleton. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4665.62s)]
*  He looked like a dead man. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4666.66s)]
*  He looked like a guy who was starving to death. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4668.5s)]
*  And he was about to fight Henry. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4671.66s)]
*  Is that what he was saying? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4673.26s)]
*  He was doing the EPO to help him cut weight? [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4674.58s)]
*  Is that what he was essentially saying? [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4677.62s)]
*  No, he was essentially anemic. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4679.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, that's what it really is. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4681.78s)]
*  It's anemia. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4683.58s)]
*  It's for anemia. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4684.58s)]
*  He was anemic. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4686.9s)]
*  He had gotten to a point where he couldn't do anything. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4687.98s)]
*  His body was just, he should have pulled out. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4692.62s)]
*  It's really what he should have done. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4695.54s)]
*  Or what he should have done, I think, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4697.62s)]
*  is probably had a test cut. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4699.26s)]
*  And if he had a test cut, he was down to 135 [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4701.34s)]
*  and then cutting the weight. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4705.58s)]
*  When he was down to 135, you looked at him, [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4706.74s)]
*  you're like, oh my God. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4708.7s)]
*  He was bad. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4709.7s)]
*  I remember seeing a picture of him in camp. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4711.099999999999s)]
*  I'm like, this dude looks horrible. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4712.46s)]
*  When he was preparing for the fight [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4715.099999999999s)]
*  and then it was like the day of the weigh-ins, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4717.5s)]
*  you see him walking around, you're like, what in the fuck? [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4720.099999999999s)]
*  His whole face was just skeleton. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4723.74s)]
*  And then you get fucking hit like that? [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4726.94s)]
*  I don't care if you have 48 hours. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4730.0199999999995s)]
*  So that's what he looked like. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4732.22s)]
*  Is that so insane, man? [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4735.54s)]
*  It's so insane, that weight cut. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4738.1s)]
*  Look at his. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4740.02s)]
*  Yeah, look at him there. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4740.86s)]
*  Listen, all of our cheeks get sucked in, [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4741.7s)]
*  but that's different. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4743.5s)]
*  I mean, that's not just your cheeks. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4746.06s)]
*  No, yeah. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4747.34s)]
*  It's like you're losing your jaw muscles. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4748.18s)]
*  And that's the thing. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4750.14s)]
*  It's like you're losing muscle, man. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4751.06s)]
*  You're losing muscle. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4753.42s)]
*  Now you see him now? [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4754.58s)]
*  He's not a small dude. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4755.94s)]
*  He's pretty fucking big. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4757.58s)]
*  Well, TJ also had shoulder problems his whole career. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4760.06s)]
*  I think he had two torn supraspinatus muscles [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4763.82s)]
*  in both traps or both shoulders and just never got it fixed. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4768.259999999999s)]
*  He was so good. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4772.0199999999995s)]
*  I love watching him. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4773.139999999999s)]
*  Just his striking was so good. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4775.42s)]
*  I feel like he was one of the first guys to start doing, [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4777.0599999999995s)]
*  to switching stances and throwing. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4779.7s)]
*  He was, he's fucking good. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4781.94s)]
*  Dude, the Henen-Barrow fight, holy shit. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4784.38s)]
*  The first one, yeah. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4787.0199999999995s)]
*  It's also his ability to perform under pressure. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4788.299999999999s)]
*  When the stakes were high, when the pressure was high. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4792.42s)]
*  Cody Garbrandt fight. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4795.3s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4796.3s)]
*  He got dropped in that first round [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4797.62s)]
*  and came back and knocked Cody out. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4799.06s)]
*  And I fucking love Cody. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4800.26s)]
*  It was nice to see Cody get back on track. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4802.18s)]
*  But yeah, that was, he can fuck, he's a competitor. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4804.74s)]
*  Like he's a competitor. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4807.58s)]
*  And it worked for him for a long time. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4809.14s)]
*  Yeah, just the shoulder thing is just so unfortunate [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4812.1s)]
*  because now he's fucked and he's had multiple surgeries [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4814.900000000001s)]
*  and he's hoping that he can still come back. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4818.14s)]
*  He fought in Abu Dhabi on the car with me [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4820.46s)]
*  and then his shoulder popped out immediately [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4823.14s)]
*  or something like that. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4825.34s)]
*  Well, he had actually told the referee before the fight, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4826.34s)]
*  he said, my shoulder's gonna pop out. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4828.38s)]
*  He said, just let me fight and I'll put it back in. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4829.78s)]
*  It pops out all the time. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4833.78s)]
*  That's not good. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4835.38s)]
*  I've seen that though. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4836.34s)]
*  I've seen guys in the room, they get sprawled on, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4837.18s)]
*  their fucking shoulder pops out and they hit, [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4839.9400000000005s)]
*  they're like, I need a second. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4842.62s)]
*  And they snap it back. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4843.7s)]
*  I'm like, dude, I don't know if you should be doing that. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4844.54s)]
*  That's supposedly what happened with Urie. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4847.38s)]
*  His coaches were trying to, [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4849.58s)]
*  they put his shit back in the place [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4851.38s)]
*  and they just totally destroyed his shoulder. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4852.58s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, probably shouldn't be doing that. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4854.66s)]
*  It's not like a finger, like a jujitsu finger [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4856.62s)]
*  where you're doing gi [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4858.7s)]
*  and your coach fucking snaps your finger. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4859.82s)]
*  That's your shoulder. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4862.62s)]
*  Well, it's also when your shoulder gets destroyed like that [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4863.46s)]
*  and they have to replace your shoulder, that's it. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4866.5s)]
*  I know guys have gotten their hip resurfaced [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4869.98s)]
*  and continue to compete. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4873.26s)]
*  I know Frankie Edgar did that. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4874.7s)]
*  But I think shoulders, like once that's. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4876.66s)]
*  Shoulder, shoulders and knees. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4879.7s)]
*  Like I've been pretty, knock on wood, [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4881.3s)]
*  like I feel like once you have a problem [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4883.0599999999995s)]
*  with your shoulders or knees, you're fucked. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4884.94s)]
*  Like you're always going to have, [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4887.099999999999s)]
*  same thing with like if you do that back surgery [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4889.0599999999995s)]
*  because the back surgery is a big one. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4891.0599999999995s)]
*  I think, and your neck, [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4892.9s)]
*  like if you do any of those surgeries, [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4894.74s)]
*  I think you're fucking done. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4896.3s)]
*  Well, that's what's crazy about Al Jermain. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4897.78s)]
*  I mean, he did his neck and then won [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4899.38s)]
*  and defended the title multiple times. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4902.099999999999s)]
*  And he looked great. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4904.5s)]
*  He looked great. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4905.34s)]
*  Like he came back and that Peter Yonf, [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4906.740000000001s)]
*  he looked fucking, he looked great in that. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4909.3s)]
*  With a fake disc in his neck. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4910.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, he's got an artificial disc in his back [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4912.58s)]
*  and he's competing in MMA and winning as a champion. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4914.26s)]
*  It's nuts. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4917.34s)]
*  Chris Wyman's coming back again too. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4918.5s)]
*  He's fighting Bruno. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4920.42s)]
*  I was there. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4921.5s)]
*  I was there for his fight in Boston. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4922.34s)]
*  And it was good to see him get back in there. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4925.02s)]
*  Like that break was so bad. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4929.26s)]
*  So I guess they're putting out like mini series of the UFC. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4931.34s)]
*  I watched that one. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4933.98s)]
*  And that on him coming back from his leg, [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4935.259999999999s)]
*  I was like almost crying watching it, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4938.139999999999s)]
*  like seeing like the pain he was going through. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4939.7s)]
*  Like he had like two or three surgeries after that. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4941.62s)]
*  And it wouldn't like, [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4943.66s)]
*  like his leg, like wouldn't it take, [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4945.339999999999s)]
*  or he would like start feeling a weird pain [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4947.5s)]
*  and they'd go back in and do another surgery. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4949.9s)]
*  He'd start getting better. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4952.259999999999s)]
*  They'd do another surgery. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4953.5s)]
*  It's like, it's the same thing as that TJ one. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4954.78s)]
*  If you get like 25 minutes, watch it one day. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4957.219999999999s)]
*  It's fucking good. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4959.58s)]
*  Well, that's the case with Conor as well, I believe. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4960.46s)]
*  Conor's had multiple surgeries as well. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4963.42s)]
*  Well, a break like that, like. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4965.46s)]
*  It's a crazy break. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4967.38s)]
*  The only one guy, you know, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4968.9s)]
*  I'd said no one's ever come back from it, [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4970.26s)]
*  but apparently the guy who won the PFL heavyweight division, [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4972.099999999999s)]
*  he had a broke leg like that. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4975.74s)]
*  And he came back and he's competing at a high level. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4978.58s)]
*  Well, how about Chris Wideman does it to Anderson Silva [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4981.139999999999s)]
*  and then he gets it done to him. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4985.5s)]
*  Like that is like, what kind of like, how does that happen? [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4987.74s)]
*  What are the odds? [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4992.580000000001s)]
*  That's nuts. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4993.42s)]
*  Especially when you think about how few leg breaks like that [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4994.5s)]
*  have been in the UFC. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4996.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4997.620000000001s)]
*  I think there's only been four. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4998.46s)]
*  It's not many. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=4999.3s)]
*  And he's been a part of two of them. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5000.14s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5000.9800000000005s)]
*  I can only think of those two. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5001.9800000000005s)]
*  Who else was in the UFC? [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5004.780000000001s)]
*  The first one was, what was the gentleman's name? [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5006.900000000001s)]
*  Corey Hill? [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5010.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I remember that. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5012.620000000001s)]
*  I think he's dead. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5014.18s)]
*  He is dead. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5015.06s)]
*  I don't know what happened to him. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5015.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but I remember that one. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5016.740000000001s)]
*  And then Chris is involved in two of them. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5018.42s)]
*  So is Corey, Anderson, Chris, who else? [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5020.98s)]
*  There's one other one. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5028.5s)]
*  Someone else got there like bro. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5030.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5031.259999999999s)]
*  Connor. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5032.099999999999s)]
*  Connor, that's it. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5032.94s)]
*  That's it, four. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5033.78s)]
*  So those are the four. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5034.62s)]
*  The biggest one Connor. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5035.459999999999s)]
*  And then outside of that, I've seen it with Tyron Spong. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5037.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5041.219999999999s)]
*  With the Go-Kons occupied. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5042.0599999999995s)]
*  I've seen that. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5043.74s)]
*  That was nasty. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5044.58s)]
*  That's the only time I've ever seen it in kickboxing. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5045.419999999999s)]
*  He's fucking, his highlights are crazy. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5047.219999999999s)]
*  Oh, he's a killer. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5049.5s)]
*  I've never seen the one where I think he comes out, [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5050.34s)]
*  drops Tyron, he gets up, showing up [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5053.14s)]
*  and throws that overhand and cleans him. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5055.74s)]
*  I'm like, God damn. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5058.38s)]

*  He's down at Henry's and he's like one of their main guys. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5061.3s)]
*  What did you do? [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5063.860000000001s)]
*  This one? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5064.7s)]
*  This was not in the UFC, but it's on combat. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5065.54s)]
*  Oh, this is like femur comes out. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5068.34s)]
*  Oh, I saw this one. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5072.26s)]

*  This one's bad. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5076.3s)]
*  And it's weird how it goes down. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5077.46s)]
*  Look how it goes backwards. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5080.1s)]

*  He had a bunch of stones fall on his leg, [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5105.38s)]
*  snapped his fucking femur in half. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5107.82s)]

*  He got his knees redone. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5113.54s)]
*  They had to take the metal rod out of his knee. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5115.42s)]
*  Like his bone, I guess, formed to it. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5117.78s)]
*  They said taking it out was rough, yeah. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5120.099999999999s)]

*  Did you see what Sean Strickland was doing the other day? [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5177.5s)]
*  Shooting like Roman candles at each other. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5179.62s)]
*  How about a firework fight? [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5181.46s)]
*  Yeah, bro, I'm not doing that. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5182.62s)]
*  Three weeks before he's fighting to retain his title. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5183.62s)]
*  He had like burns on him. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5186.86s)]
*  He's nuts. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5188.46s)]
*  He's nuts. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5189.38s)]
*  He's so out of his fucking mind. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5190.42s)]
*  But that boy can fight. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5192.0599999999995s)]
*  All he does is spar. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5195.0199999999995s)]
*  He probably looks at a treadmill. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5196.42s)]
*  He's like, get the fuck out of here. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5198.18s)]
*  He's like, I'm gonna spar. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5199.74s)]
*  What's crazy is his conditioning. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5200.86s)]
*  Look at that Israel Adesanya fight. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5202.54s)]
*  This is his first time fighting for the title. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5204.22s)]
*  He's fighting a legend. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5206.0599999999995s)]
*  And in the fifth round, he's not even breathing heavy. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5207.26s)]
*  Floor's on two. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5209.78s)]
*  Amazing, amazing. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5210.98s)]
*  Hits him with that one, two, drops him, [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5212.66s)]
*  pummels him afterwards. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5214.42s)]
*  And then, but dude, he's not even jumping like dirt bikes. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5216.3s)]
*  He's jumping like motorcycles in the desert. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5219.86s)]
*  I'm like, what the fuck is this dude? [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5222.3s)]
*  And that's also how he blew his knee apart. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5224.86s)]
*  Oh, yeah, because he used to fight at 70. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5226.9s)]
*  People don't know him and Camaro fought at 170 back in the day. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5229.42s)]
*  Camaro put it on him pretty good. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5233.339999999999s)]
*  I think he's one of those guys [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5235.339999999999s)]
*  that really was cutting too much weight. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5236.62s)]
*  He was definitely. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5238.0599999999995s)]
*  He's huge. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5238.9s)]
*  He's that point of diminishing returns. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5239.719999999999s)]
*  He's huge. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5240.5599999999995s)]
*  That'd be like Joey trying to cut down the 170. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5241.4s)]
*  Like, you'd be fucked. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5243.259999999999s)]
*  Just because you can make something [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5244.259999999999s)]
*  doesn't mean you should do it. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5246.219999999999s)]
*  It's, I'm gonna be interested to see that fight next weekend. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5249.099999999999s)]
*  I can't believe it's already here. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5251.74s)]
*  I can see the extreme version that. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5252.74s)]
*  Watch that TJ documentary. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5253.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5255.14s)]
*  It's pretty heavy. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5255.98s)]
*  His fight with Drikus is gonna be. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5256.94s)]
*  Very interesting. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5259.3s)]
*  Drikus is fucking scary. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5260.26s)]
*  That, and that's a guy who's so big for 85. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5262.0599999999995s)]
*  The way he looked against, I count it. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5265.34s)]
*  I didn't give him a fucking chance against Robert Whitaker [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5267.66s)]
*  and boy was I wrong. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5270.54s)]
*  Well, also that's after he got his DVH. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5272.58s)]
*  He got his nose surgery. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5274.82s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5275.66s)]
*  Which I think, I mean, it's a big factor. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5276.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5278.86s)]
*  Being able to breathe out of your nose. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5279.7s)]
*  If you can't breathe, you can't fight. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5280.54s)]
*  But it's also, it's like Drikus looks awkward. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5281.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5285.02s)]
*  When you fight, he moves different. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5285.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5286.7s)]
*  But that movement and that awkwardness [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5287.54s)]
*  makes him difficult to time. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5289.900000000001s)]
*  It's like his timing is off. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5291.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5293.22s)]
*  And if you don't have anybody that can imitate [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5294.06s)]
*  that kind of stutter step motion that he does. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5294.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he fights weird. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5296.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's deceptively technical though. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5299.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5301.26s)]
*  Deceptively. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5302.1s)]
*  It's his style. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5303.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5303.9800000000005s)]
*  You can't say it's wrong. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5304.82s)]
*  You know, like that's how he fights. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5305.9800000000005s)]
*  And it works. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5307.82s)]
*  And he's, like, you can tell he's strong. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5308.74s)]
*  I think he's gonna come in and really try to put [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5310.540000000001s)]
*  a hard grappling pace on Sean. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5313.3s)]
*  But Sean's hard to take down. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5315.780000000001s)]
*  You don't see many guys taking Sean down. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5317.1s)]
*  No. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5318.780000000001s)]
*  He's not. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5319.620000000001s)]
*  Well, he's a very good grappler. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5320.46s)]
*  Yeah, he's not easy to take down. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5321.3s)]
*  I've talked to guys at Rolls. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5323.540000000001s)]
*  That motherfucker's very good. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5324.860000000001s)]
*  I seen he was out at, [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5326.1s)]
*  I think he was training with Jaco. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5328.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5329.26s)]
*  Yeah, Jaco told me. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5330.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5330.9400000000005s)]
*  Jaco goes, dude, he's fucking legit. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5331.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5332.9400000000005s)]
*  He's really legit. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5333.780000000001s)]
*  He's long too. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5334.620000000001s)]
*  I'm sure he has good Jiu Jitsu. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5335.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5337.1s)]
*  But that's a good fight. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5337.9400000000005s)]
*  So here's an interesting statistic, [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5340.42s)]
*  because, you know, the UFC, [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5341.26s)]
*  was it a mouth guard that they gave you guys? [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5342.099999999999s)]
*  Show how many shots you take? [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5344.179999999999s)]
*  Something like that, yeah. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5345.74s)]
*  He gets hit the least. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5347.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5348.54s)]
*  And he spars the most. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5349.38s)]
*  See, Zach, his defense is so underappreciated. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5350.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5353.3s)]
*  Because that was a big factor in that fight too, [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5354.139999999999s)]
*  with Adesanya. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5355.66s)]
*  Adesanya just couldn't find him. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5356.5s)]
*  Yeah, he's like, [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5357.74s)]
*  it's like a weird, like, filly shell that he does. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5359.179999999999s)]
*  And then he's lifting that, like, lead leg to, like, teep. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5361.54s)]
*  Yep, and he's front kicking you with that lead leg. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5364.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5366.219999999999s)]
*  And he's just always jabbing. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5367.0599999999995s)]
*  And it comes, like, you would think a jab coming from down here, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5369.14s)]
*  like, it'd be easier to time, but it's not, [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5372.58s)]
*  because it's coming from a, like, you don't fucking see it. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5374.9400000000005s)]
*  And then, bop, bop, and then he's hitting you with the jab. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5376.900000000001s)]
*  But it fucking, it works for him. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5379.620000000001s)]
*  It works for him amazingly. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5381.620000000001s)]
*  I don't think Izzy was 100% in that training camp either. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5382.860000000001s)]
*  Like, he had that DUI thing, or the DWI, [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5386.700000000001s)]
*  like, right before that, [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5389.9400000000005s)]
*  I was like two weeks before that fight. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5390.780000000001s)]
*  And I think he just thought he was gonna fucking [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5392.26s)]
*  blow Sean out of the water. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5394.26s)]
*  And Sean's a tough motherfucker. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5395.5s)]
*  After the Abu's fight, someone should have looked at that fight [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5398.46s)]
*  and go, listen, this guy is always there. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5401.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5403.86s)]
*  He's always there. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5404.38s)]
*  It's crazy how it can flip so fast. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5405.42s)]
*  Like, a year ago, he lost to Jared Cannonier, [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5407.139999999999s)]
*  and now he's fucking UFC champion. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5410.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5411.62s)]
*  It happens fast. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5412.139999999999s)]
*  I mean, how about the Pejeda fight? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5412.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5414.74s)]
*  He gets flatlined in the first round against Pejeda, [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5415.34s)]
*  and then you think, this guy's not gonna be the champ. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5417.82s)]
*  And a year later, he's the champ. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5419.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5421.219999999999s)]
*  And went to train with Pejeda. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5421.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5423.26s)]
*  That shows you how smart he is. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5423.58s)]
*  That's that champion. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5424.26s)]
*  Yeah, he's like, I'm gonna go learn from this fucking guy. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5424.98s)]
*  Pejeda will teach you, which is even crazier. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5427.26s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5429.900000000001s)]
*  Alex is a, he's a bad motherfucker. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5430.7s)]
*  He's a big dude. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5433.22s)]
*  He's gigantic. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5434.38s)]
*  That guy making 185 was ridiculous. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5435.34s)]
*  Nuts. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5437.5s)]
*  Ridiculous. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5438.42s)]
*  Like, how? [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5439.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5440.02s)]
*  How did you do it? [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5440.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5441.74s)]
*  Because you look at him at 205. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5442.22s)]
*  He's so big at 205. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5443.46s)]
*  I think he's way better off at 205, though. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5444.5s)]
*  I think so, too. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5446.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5447.46s)]
*  I don't know who he's gonna fight next, but I'll be watching. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5448.18s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I would imagine it would be Jamal. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5451.46s)]
*  I just don't know when Jamal's gonna be fully recovered. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5454.7s)]
*  You know, Jamal blew out his Achilles, which is a bad one. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5457.9s)]
*  That's a hard one to come back from. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5460.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's a bad one. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5461.98s)]
*  That's what Aaron, is that what Aaron Rodgers did? [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5463.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5465.86s)]
*  That's gotta be weird. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5466.74s)]
*  Like, you're just going, and then next thing, it's done. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5467.82s)]
*  Yeah, it just pops off. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5470.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5471.34s)]
*  But Aaron Rodgers is doing great. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5472.139999999999s)]
*  They're saying he might, like, play, like, pretty soon. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5474.86s)]
*  He was hoping to. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5477.46s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5478.3s)]
*  But it's only been, how many months since the entry? [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5478.78s)]
*  Four or five? [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5481.42s)]
*  What was the beginning of the season? [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5482.179999999999s)]
*  September, I guess. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5483.46s)]
*  Is that what it was, since it started? [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5484.3s)]
*  October, November, December, January, so four months. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5485.46s)]
*  Yeah, not long. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5488.18s)]
*  Not long at all for such a catastrophic injury. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5489.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5491.860000000001s)]
*  I think Alex would be champ for a while, though. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5492.780000000001s)]
*  It's gotta, until someone comes along and exposes his, [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5495.46s)]
*  because his ground game's not where it needs to be. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5498.66s)]
*  Well, that's what's interesting with Hamzat, right? [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5501.14s)]
*  If he fights Hamzat Chamayev at 185 pounds, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5503.5s)]
*  that gets very interesting. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5507.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5508.9400000000005s)]
*  But I think we saw in the Hamzat fight against Uspen [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5509.74s)]
*  that, you know, Hamzat, against a really big, strong grappler, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5512.58s)]
*  is still very effective. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5517.1s)]
*  But, you know. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5518.94s)]
*  Not to the level where, like, it should be. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5519.74s)]
*  Well, Uspen exposed some holes in his game. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5523.42s)]
*  And Uspen had no camp. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5525.94s)]
*  That was a five round fight. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5527.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5528.98s)]
*  Like, and Uspen took it on short notice. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5529.7s)]
*  Even on short notice, if there was two more rounds of that, [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5532.74s)]
*  who knows where that could have gone. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5535.14s)]
*  Uspen was putting it on in the third. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5536.54s)]
*  I rewatched it recently. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5537.42s)]
*  And he was getting the better of him in the third round, [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5539.0599999999995s)]
*  full or short. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5541.14s)]
*  Especially in the strike game, [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5541.9s)]
*  because I think something happened to Hamzat's hand in the first round. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5542.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5545.74s)]
*  He broke his hand. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5546.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5546.82s)]
*  He's got some injuries going on. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5547.179999999999s)]
*  But he has someone, but even like someone like that, [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5548.58s)]
*  someone like Bo Nicol. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5551.38s)]
*  Bo's going to be a motherfucker. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5553.0599999999995s)]
*  And then Joey's right. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5554.259999999999s)]
*  Joey, Joey's known for knocking guys out. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5555.66s)]
*  But Joey has fucking really, he submitted Abdul in his last fight. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5557.74s)]
*  He's got really good wrestling, really good submission. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5561.46s)]
*  So it looks like 185 doesn't have like those grapple, like 170. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5563.339999999999s)]
*  Like, we're stacked with grapplers. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5568.38s)]
*  155 is stacked with grapplers. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5569.78s)]
*  Like 185 kind of doesn't have that. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5571.3s)]
*  So if you come into 185 and you have that good wrestling and grappling [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5573.0199999999995s)]
*  pedigree, like I think you can do really, really well. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5576.62s)]
*  It's interesting with Bo. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5579.34s)]
*  It's like they're they're let it's like some fighters get thrown of the wolves. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5580.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5584.66s)]
*  And some fighters, they lead. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5585.179999999999s)]
*  He's doing like the slow. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5586.82s)]
*  Nice. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5588.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5588.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5588.9s)]
*  Every fight, he's this giant. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5589.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5591.7s)]
*  Giant favorite. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5592.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5592.9s)]
*  And the next fight, same thing. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5593.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5594.66s)]
*  And he smokes them. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5594.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5595.54s)]
*  He hasn't fought so much. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5595.86s)]
*  July. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5596.7s)]
*  I listened to the podcast. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5597.259999999999s)]
*  Those really good. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5598.5s)]
*  But I think he's doing it right. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5599.1s)]
*  Like he's like, listen, I'm going to kind of slope because he's 27, 28. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5600.94s)]
*  He's already in the UFC. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5605.26s)]
*  A couple of fights away from being in the top 15. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5606.38s)]
*  Why rush? [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5609.14s)]
*  And I feel like that's something I did early on that I wish I wanted to be in the top 15 so bad. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5609.86s)]
*  Then once you get there, you have to wait for the division to play out. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5614.34s)]
*  You have to wait for guys to fight and then you get hurt. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5618.1s)]
*  And then you're sitting on the sidelines. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5620.46s)]
*  Whereas if you're not in the top 15, you can kind of rack up these wins, fight these guys who aren't [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5621.94s)]
*  world class, but they're still good fighters. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5627.419999999999s)]
*  You can get that experience and then go into the top 15. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5629.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5632.98s)]
*  Well, that's what they do in boxing. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5633.139999999999s)]
*  And it's always been the way they did it. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5634.299999999999s)]
*  They test guys. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5636.179999999999s)]
*  You get tested. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5637.339999999999s)]
*  But not a fight that you're going to lose. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5638.419999999999s)]
*  A fight that guy's going to show you some different looks. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5640.179999999999s)]
*  You're going to get, you know, maybe this guy likes to fight inside. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5642.54s)]
*  Maybe this guy's long, fights on the outside. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5644.94s)]
*  You get these different looks and you learn and grow and develop new skills and get experience. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5647.5s)]
*  And then you fight for the title. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5652.9s)]
*  Well, we have, um, boots, drawn out as his dad was my boxing coach for years. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5654.38s)]
*  I boots holds pads for me all the time. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5658.9400000000005s)]
*  Bro, that guy is a wizard. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5661.02s)]
*  I'll watch him hit pads from orthodox to South Pole. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5663.9800000000005s)]
*  How hard he hits. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5667.42s)]
*  Like, I'm like, yo, I wouldn't, I would, I would, I'd be butt scooting towards boots if I had a father. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5669.06s)]
*  Yo, come here because he thumps and he's 25 or like 26. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5674.46s)]
*  Like he's not even a man yet. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5679.78s)]
*  Like I used to think the man's trying to thing was bullshit. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5681.14s)]
*  It's true. Like the older you get, you definitely get stronger and he's getting stronger and he's getting better. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5683.66s)]
*  It sucks. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5688.5s)]
*  Like they gave them the belt, I guess, because Terrence get like got stripped. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5689.0199999999995s)]
*  So he didn't get to earn it. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5694.26s)]
*  He was the interim champ, but he has a he's having such a hard time getting a fight. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5695.5s)]
*  Like nobody wants to fight him and Terrence wants the big money. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5700.42s)]
*  And I get that. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5703.34s)]
*  I get it. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5704.38s)]
*  But boots is going to fuck any of these dudes up. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5704.98s)]
*  Like I was like, I like, I think Terrence is great. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5708.3s)]
*  But like boots is that next generation? [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5711.7s)]
*  Well, I think that fight would be very competitive and I would really love to see that because I think Terrence is the fucking man. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5713.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5719.38s)]
*  But I think that Terrence is 35, 36. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5719.78s)]
*  So that range. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5723.66s)]
*  And for him, it's like all about big money fights. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5724.54s)]
*  That's why he's trying to get that Canelo fight. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5726.7s)]
*  I get that. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5728.5s)]
*  Like you get to a certain point, you're clearly you deserve that. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5729.099999999999s)]
*  But I'm happy that they did strip him. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5731.5s)]
*  So now they're going to give boots that clear path to go let him build his resume and fight the guys. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5733.9s)]
*  But I don't even know who's in that division. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5739.42s)]
*  Well, it's like right now Terrence is locked up with Errol Spence again because Errol Spence, he exercised the rematch. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5742.42s)]
*  So they're going to fight. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5749.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5750.22s)]
*  And I think if I was being cynical, I would say, listen, Errol Spence fights someone else. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5750.46s)]
*  How much is he going to make? [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5756.18s)]
*  Errol Spence fights Terrence Crawford again. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5757.58s)]
*  He's going to make a big payday. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5760.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5761.74s)]
*  You know, and I think that's probably why he's doing this rematch again. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5762.42s)]
*  Also, he knows he's getting paid. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5765.5s)]
*  Yeah, knows he's getting paid, but also not happy with his performance in the first fight and thinks he can do better. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5767.26s)]
*  And I get that. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5772.1s)]
*  Which I get. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5772.54s)]
*  But I think Terrence is on another level. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5773.62s)]
*  He's fucking, he's good. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5775.74s)]
*  We had the UFC fights and those fights going on. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5777.820000000001s)]
*  And he just seemed like he was on a different level the entire time. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5781.1s)]
*  But yeah, he's so smart and he's so technical. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5784.820000000001s)]
*  And he also has that incredible ability to shift. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5788.26s)]
*  He can switch stances and fight just as good as Al Paz and Orphthodox. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5790.62s)]
*  I think it was like, I think he was fighting Sean Porter and his coach was telling him, [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5795.38s)]
*  like, yo, he's, it was like the 10th round. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5799.1s)]
*  He was like, yo, he's up. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5800.74s)]
*  And it didn't register for his, like, he looked at back, he's like, he's up, he's up. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5801.9400000000005s)]
*  And he went out there and he's like, all right, bet. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5805.66s)]
*  Went out there, smoked him the next round. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5807.14s)]
*  I'm like, yo, this dude is fucking, he's the man. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5808.9800000000005s)]
*  But yeah, Boots, like, boxing is hard to follow though, because there's so many, [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5812.1s)]
*  it's not like the UFC is the UFC. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5816.86s)]
*  And there's like top rank and there's show time and there's this and the belt. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5818.82s)]
*  Like who has the belt? [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5824.26s)]
*  So it makes it hard to follow. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5825.860000000001s)]
*  Well, there does because there's not just way more weight classes, but there's also [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5828.62s)]
*  four sanctioning bodies. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5832.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5833.860000000001s)]
*  And so it's at least four. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5834.54s)]
*  WBC, IBO, WBO, IBF, right? [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5835.9400000000005s)]
*  So how many boxing? [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5842.66s)]
*  It's at least four. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5844.58s)]
*  It's at least four. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5845.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5846.26s)]
*  WBC, WBA, WBO, IBF. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5847.06s)]
*  That's four right there. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5850.58s)]
*  Is that it? [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5851.740000000001s)]
*  That's probably four more. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5852.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5853.26s)]
*  There's a lot. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5853.58s)]
*  It's just like, why? [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5853.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5855.38s)]
*  Why are there so many sanctioning bodies? [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5856.0199999999995s)]
*  Like that doesn't make any sense. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5858.3s)]
*  It's not like we're an MMA, like, yeah, there's Bellator, not now, PFL. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5860.22s)]
*  I mean, there still is, but like. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5865.7s)]
*  Does Bellator is going to still exist overseas? [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5866.86s)]
*  Yeah, with PFL. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5869.14s)]
*  But like in MMA, you want to be a UFC champion. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5870.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5873.54s)]
*  When you're a boxer, you're like, who do you, I want to be a WB. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5873.74s)]
*  Like it's so hard to. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5877.3s)]
*  You want to beat the guy who's recognized as being famous as a champion. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5878.94s)]
*  And what do you want to have? [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5882.14s)]
*  You want to have all four belts. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5883.06s)]
*  Cause if you don't have all four belts, you're not really, you can make, Oh, that [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5884.740000000001s)]

*  You go to nine to five, like you're sitting in traffic. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5976.860000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5998.1s)]
*  Oh, he is boxing still. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=5999.0199999999995s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6000.58s)]
*  Wow. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6004.18s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6004.82s)]
*  65 year old Bozy sparring 65. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6006.78s)]
*  And he's just fucking around. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6012.3s)]
*  He looks good. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6013.54s)]
*  He's talking shit too. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6016.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6017.34s)]
*  Just pop that jab and the jab, as you were saying before about Sean, the jab [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6027.9800000000005s)]
*  real low coming down, coming down from low. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6032.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6034.26s)]
*  And same thing I was saying about like our gym, Marquez MMA, like bro, they're [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6035.78s)]
*  in just these like these gritty gyms. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6039.62s)]
*  Like there's no, no super gym. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6041.82s)]
*  Like there's no super gym in Philly. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6043.7s)]
*  Like. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6045.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, that's the question is like, what is the best? [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6046.299999999999s)]
*  Is it best to be with a small gym with really good coaches where they're [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6049.419999999999s)]
*  giving you individual attention? [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6054.339999999999s)]
*  And they really know what you're doing when you're on, when you're [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6055.74s)]
*  peeking, where you're at versus going to like a mega gym like ATT. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6059.139999999999s)]
*  Well, Mike, so my coach, John, like he only person that holds pads for me. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6064.58s)]
*  He watches all my sparring sessions like that he does for all of us. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6069.419999999999s)]
*  And then he'll send my spar into Dean. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6072.5s)]
*  Dean will break it down. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6075.34s)]
*  And then like my wrestling coach, Cody, like everyone, it's only three or four [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6076.62s)]
*  guys, but the head guy is John and he oversees everything. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6080.18s)]
*  And when you have a big gym, if you're, if you're not a top guy, like you're [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6083.98s)]
*  not getting that, you know, like, cause there's so many, like, yeah, like you [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6088.46s)]
*  have the training partners, but you're not getting that one-on-one that unless [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6091.9s)]
*  you're a champion, unless you're a champion, you know, and, um, then it's [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6095.82s)]
*  still even hard because like you guys, like your, your training partners, like, [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6099.54s)]
*  fuck, like I want to help these guys out, but I know like American top team, like [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6103.86s)]
*  they have different sets of coaches. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6107.22s)]
*  So you might work with this coach, but they have Mike Brown's like the main guy. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6109.9s)]
*  So you might work with Mike, but you might not work with this guy. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6113.58s)]
*  But I just think it's like, I'm lucky enough. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6116.22s)]
*  I don't have to travel. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6119.06s)]
*  Like my whole family lives in this. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6119.98s)]
*  Like I thought it, like, there was definitely times when I was coming up on [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6121.3s)]
*  my damn, like, where would I go? [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6124.1s)]
*  Would I go to Florida? [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6125.62s)]
*  Would I go here? [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6126.42s)]
*  Would I go there? [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6127.06s)]
*  And then I got lucky enough that I was just winning fights and our team was [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6127.7s)]
*  growing and we have the training partners now and I don't have to go anywhere. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6132.22s)]
*  No, you're listen, man. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6136.38s)]
*  The results speak for themselves. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6137.66s)]
*  Obviously. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6139.42s)]
*  So tell me more. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6140.3s)]
*  I want to hear more about this mental training and what's involved with that. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6141.46s)]
*  So you decided to do this after the Bilal fight? [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6145.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6147.62s)]
*  So you said you made like some decisions in that fight that you [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6148.46s)]
*  like you never had made before. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6153.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6155.099999999999s)]
*  I feel like I remember like you're in there and fighting, like being in a [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6155.38s)]
*  fight is the weirdest feeling ever. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6160.62s)]
*  Like sometimes like you're super present and then sometimes you're not. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6162.02s)]
*  Like I remember just being in that fight and for with Kelvin for 15 minutes, I [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6165.38s)]
*  was where my feet were. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6170.34s)]
*  I was super present. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6171.86s)]
*  Like I had like, I was blocked in that entire time when I fought below. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6172.82s)]
*  I remember like, I was just thinking about other shit and then I'd come back [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6176.86s)]
*  to like, like, like the president. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6180.7s)]
*  I'm like, what the fuck are you doing? [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6182.82s)]
*  Like, like I'm in the middle of a fight. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6184.26s)]
*  I just wasn't, I just wasn't present. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6186.58s)]
*  Like I wasn't even like where, like I just wasn't thinking about the fight. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6189.42s)]
*  Like I just didn't want to be there. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6192.14s)]
*  That's so weird. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6193.780000000001s)]
*  And I didn't, and I never felt like that before. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6194.3s)]
*  So now I started working with this guy, Brian Kane. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6196.820000000001s)]
*  He worked with GSP after GSP lost to Matt Serra first fight. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6199.18s)]
*  He, he started working with him and then I started working with Brian. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6204.9400000000005s)]
*  And it's just all about just being super present, like not even just in [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6208.26s)]
*  fighting, but just in life. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6211.34s)]
*  Like not worrying about what I got to do later or stupid shit like that. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6213.099999999999s)]
*  Just being in that moment and just focusing in on that. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6216.82s)]
*  Cause that's all you can control. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6219.54s)]
*  I was so caught up in thinking about the future or what like happened the day [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6221.0199999999995s)]
*  before, like if I had a bad day of training, like I let it bother me. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6225.179999999999s)]
*  And it just came out of the fight, but I just wasn't in the moment. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6228.139999999999s)]
*  And that's like now, like I just try to be in the moment, everything I'm doing, [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6232.38s)]
*  just super present, not thinking too far ahead, not thinking about the past. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6236.0599999999995s)]
*  And that's something I used to get caught up in a lot. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6239.78s)]
*  Just not, not being focused on in, like, I was just so worried about my next [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6241.86s)]
*  session or my next this or like thinking about my fight, like things I can't [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6246.74s)]
*  control, like I can't control that far, but all I can control is what [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6251.339999999999s)]
*  I'm doing in this moment. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6254.78s)]
*  So what is it that you do? [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6256.179999999999s)]
*  So like, we just have like, just like drills, like say if, um, if I'm sparring [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6259.139999999999s)]
*  and if like something's not going my way, just like little like signals, just to [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6264.219999999999s)]
*  like bring myself back into what I'm doing. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6268.9s)]
*  Like if, if I round doesn't go my way, like not getting too caught up on that [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6271.219999999999s)]
*  and just, and just knowing like I have another round and I can just get back [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6275.58s)]
*  into that and just having these like signal lights, like yeah, it's called [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6279.219999999999s)]
*  like red, green, red, red, yellow, green. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6282.66s)]
*  So green, all systems go, you're having the best training session of your life. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6286.179999999999s)]
*  Yellow, you're starting to get in your head in a little bit. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6290.179999999999s)]
*  It's not working out. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6292.86s)]
*  Like you're not getting off your shots, not getting off your takedowns. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6293.78s)]
*  Red is like, you're getting pissed up. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6296.219999999999s)]
*  Like your mind's going other places. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6298.34s)]
*  Like you don't want to fucking be there anymore. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6300.38s)]
*  And when you get in the red, you have to have like, like he works with baseball [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6302.18s)]
*  players, say like, um, you hit a, like you get, you're about to get struck out. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6306.26s)]
*  They got the batter will step out of the box. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6310.66s)]
*  They'll take off their gloves and they'll like, they'll like do like, they'll [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6312.900000000001s)]
*  like tap their shoulder or something. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6316.14s)]
*  And it's just like something that I've reset and that's exactly, that's exactly [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6317.66s)]
*  what it is. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6321.38s)]
*  So like, if I'm having like a bad session, like obviously I'm not going to [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6321.7s)]
*  fucking like tap my head or something like that, but just like talking to myself [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6324.38s)]
*  and just, just knowing like I'm all right, like you're good. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6328.7s)]
*  Like bring it back. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6331.820000000001s)]
*  Like, so how do you reset? [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6332.58s)]
*  Like, is there a very specific, just, I just talked to myself, just, and like, [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6334.02s)]
*  what do you say to yourself? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6338.26s)]
*  Just looking at myself. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6338.900000000001s)]
*  Just, um, we have like, uh, our affirmations for my last fight where, um, [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6339.860000000001s)]
*  I control what I can, I control what I can control. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6344.860000000001s)]
*  I trust my training. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6348.22s)]
*  I'm aggressive and always moving forward. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6349.5s)]
*  And then we'd have a funny one to make it not that serious. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6351.54s)]
*  It was, uh, I'm confident I'm cocky, I'm motherfucking Rocky. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6354.02s)]
*  And it would just make you laugh. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6357.700000000001s)]
*  And before my fight with Kelvin, I'm fucking in the bathroom and I'm saying [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6359.1s)]
*  these affirmations and then I'll laugh because it's like, it's not that serious, [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6362.820000000001s)]
*  but like small little things like that, just to, just to bring it back and just [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6366.38s)]
*  be, just be present. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6370.700000000001s)]
*  And, um, I think that, and then I started, then I started working with another guy [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6372.9800000000005s)]
*  through, um, my management company, his name is Brandon Epstein, and we would do [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6377.9400000000005s)]
*  like visual, like visualize like the fights. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6383.5s)]
*  So every week we'd meet on the call and we'd go from visualizing being in the [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6386.1s)]
*  locker room. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6392.1s)]
*  Well, even before that, the first, like the nervous, like the most nervous I would [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6393.7s)]
*  get before a fight is like that shower at like 12 o'clock fight day. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6397.74s)]
*  Like you get a shower and you know, the car's coming to pick you up in like two [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6401.7s)]
*  hours. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6404.62s)]
*  So we'd like close our eyes and we'd start in the shower. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6405.3s)]
*  I'd shower, get changed. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6408.22s)]
*  Car would pick you up. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6409.9s)]
*  We're walking to the locker room. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6411.1s)]
*  We're in the locker room. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6413.18s)]
*  We're hitting pads. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6414.3s)]
*  We're warming up, getting your hands wrapped, making that walk. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6415.26s)]
*  And then like for five, 10, 50, however long I'd be just eyes closed, visualizing [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6418.26s)]
*  how I want the fight to go bad situations, good situations, and then eventually [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6423.54s)]
*  winning the fight and visualizing talking to you or talking to DC. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6427.780000000001s)]
*  And I would do these mental reps over and over and over again, sitting in the [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6431.42s)]
*  sauna. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6436.46s)]
*  I would do it sitting in the cold tub. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6436.900000000001s)]
*  I would do it. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6439.38s)]
*  I would have my affirmation so like timed up. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6440.179999999999s)]
*  If I was going in the cold for three minutes, I knew how many times I would [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6443.259999999999s)]
*  have to say them. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6446.299999999999s)]
*  And then my three minutes would be up and that's all in training camp. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6447.379999999999s)]
*  And I would just do that shit over and over and over again. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6451.459999999999s)]
*  And, and that was something you had never done, never done before. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6455.74s)]
*  Cause you never like, I would never think about it. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6458.94s)]
*  And then before you know it, you get there and you're like, fuck, like this [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6461.98s)]
*  and it feels brand new to you again. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6465.58s)]
*  Cause you only fight a couple of times a year if you're lucky, but instead I [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6467.3s)]
*  seen these things a million times in my mind already. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6471.58s)]
*  Like, yeah, physically I wasn't there, but mentally, like I'm already in this [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6474.38s)]
*  locker room already. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6478.820000000001s)]
*  I've already walked in the cage. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6480.14s)]
*  I already made the walk. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6481.34s)]
*  Like they would make custom music for me that I would listen with my walkout [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6482.54s)]
*  music, Kelvin's walkout music, crowd noise. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6486.860000000001s)]
*  And I would listen to it before sparring and when I'm shadow boxing and shit [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6490.1s)]
*  like that, like, and I would just like felt. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6494.7s)]
*  So prepared doing it. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6497.1s)]
*  And I just never did anything like that before. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6498.22s)]
*  And yeah, it's a fucking game changer. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6501.1s)]
*  That's interesting because they do say that visualization actually helps skill [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6503.900000000001s)]
*  learning as much as training. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6508.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6510.06s)]
*  Like if you are training, but then also visualizing things and spending as much [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6510.42s)]
*  time, you, your training, your improvements will be compounded. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6514.740000000001s)]
*  Oh, a hundred percent. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6518.3s)]
*  And like, I'm blanking on a million other things we do, but like, that's like the [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6519.22s)]
*  big ones, like just visualizing what you want to do. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6522.5s)]
*  And not just the good, the bad too. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6525.54s)]
*  Like, so I would think about like, if I get ready for Kelvin, everyone is like, [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6527.86s)]
*  I'm going to get knocked out. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6533.58s)]
*  I'm going to get this. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6534.66s)]
*  I'm going to get that. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6535.34s)]
*  So I would visualize getting fucking dropped and having to get back in or [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6536.06s)]
*  getting rocked or going for a takedown, getting stuffed and having to recover [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6540.66s)]
*  from that and go and win the fight because they're not going to, you're not [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6545.54s)]
*  going to, it's not always going to go your way. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6548.86s)]
*  So visualizing the bad, but still making it out with the good, which I [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6550.74s)]
*  didn't do with Balal, like he rocked me in that moment and I was still there. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6555.42s)]
*  Instead of just making that switch and be like, you're good. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6559.86s)]
*  They go back and just getting back to the fight. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6562.66s)]
*  I just never could get back. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6565.74s)]
*  Does, is that partially attributable just also to getting hit? [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6567.22s)]
*  Like, cause sometimes when guys get hit, they get, they're out of it. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6570.9800000000005s)]
*  Like you've seen many guys that go back at the fourth round and they'll go. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6574.14s)]
*  They don't know what round is. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6577.58s)]
*  I was, I remember everything. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6579.02s)]
*  I remember, I wasn't like, I was definitely, definitely buzzed me, but [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6581.42s)]
*  I remember just putting my hands up and I just couldn't throw them on my punch. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6585.26s)]
*  And I heard the 10 second clap go off. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6590.42s)]
*  I thought I was going to get saved by the bell and I was going to make it to [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6592.900000000001s)]
*  the next round and I never did. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6595.5s)]
*  Well, it was an interesting stoppage because it was, it was one of the rare UFC [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6597.620000000001s)]
*  stoppages with the guy standing up. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6601.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6603.22s)]
*  It's very rare. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6603.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6604.38s)]
*  I never, and that's what I'm saying. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6604.58s)]
*  Like I didn't get dropped and I remember everything. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6606.14s)]
*  I remember hearing the clapper. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6608.54s)]
*  My coaches were right behind me. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6610.14s)]
*  I could hear my coach, John screaming. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6611.5s)]
*  He's good. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6613.620000000001s)]
*  He's good. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6614.26s)]
*  He's good. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6614.7s)]
*  And he stopped it, which good on him, but I like, I just couldn't, I [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6615.74s)]
*  couldn't do what I wanted to do. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6620.78s)]
*  It was the weirdest feeling. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6622.62s)]
*  It's so subjective. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6623.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6624.3s)]
*  When a fight gets stopped and when it doesn't get stopped. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6624.58s)]
*  And the thing that sucks the most is when a fight is stopped too late. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6627.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6632.099999999999s)]
*  You mean like, for sure, you know, the Jalen Turner, Bobby green fight. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6632.62s)]
*  That was bad. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6636.58s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6637.26s)]
*  That was bad. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6638.0199999999995s)]
*  That was so bad. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6638.62s)]
*  You were cage-side for that, right? [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6639.74s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6640.58s)]
*  I was like, stop the fight. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6641.46s)]
*  What is happening here? [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6643.099999999999s)]
*  It was like 20 something unanswered strikes or something like that. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6644.38s)]
*  That is so hard to watch. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6649.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6650.9800000000005s)]
*  It was, um, so unnecessary. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6651.3s)]
*  It was bad. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6653.58s)]
*  But yeah, back to like, like the mental performance stuff, like it was just [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6654.38s)]
*  really just all came down to just me just being focused for 15 minutes. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6658.14s)]
*  Cause like we, you can be doing anything and just you're fucking driving, but [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6663.9400000000005s)]
*  you're looking all like, you're not, you're not in the moment, you know? [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6667.9400000000005s)]
*  And that's something like, now I try to like, I try to do it. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6670.5s)]
*  Everything I do in my life. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6673.7s)]
*  If I'm walking my dog, I'll leave my phone at home and just try to be present [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6674.9s)]
*  doing the thing you're doing at the time, not wearing, there's so much noise [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6679.179999999999s)]
*  and other shit and when I'm fighting, like the only thing I'm fucking [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6682.78s)]
*  thinking about is fighting and. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6686.46s)]
*  Well, just having the tools in terms of like having strategies and having a [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6688.86s)]
*  pathway that's already carved in your mind for all of these different scenarios [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6693.139999999999s)]
*  has got to be beneficial. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6697.22s)]
*  It's way better than just winging it. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6698.74s)]
*  No. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6700.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6700.46s)]
*  And that's the thing. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6700.7s)]
*  If you're just winging it and like he, uh, they wanted me to even get to the [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6701.34s)]
*  arena and like go walk it before the fight, I couldn't get in, but like he [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6705.3s)]
*  would have, they used to have GSP go in the day before the fight and like [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6709.46s)]
*  actually already be in the arena and feel that and already like see that I [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6713.5s)]
*  couldn't do that this fight, but if I get the chance, like before I go and [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6717.54s)]
*  fight my next fight, I'm going to go fucking walk around that cage, feel the [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6720.900000000001s)]
*  canvas and just, yeah, cause you only get to do it once. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6724.58s)]
*  So Kelvin was ranked, right? [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6727.66s)]
*  Well, where was Kelvin at? [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6729.820000000001s)]
*  He was ranked at middle weight. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6730.82s)]
*  Oh, right. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6732.58s)]
*  So it's a debut. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6733.46s)]
*  He, I was number nine going into that fight. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6735.5s)]
*  I'm number seven now, but cause he was originally supposed to fight [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6737.66s)]
*  Shavkat, Shavkat got hurt and then, um, they matched us up and I don't know [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6740.46s)]
*  what he's going to do if he's going to stay at 70, go back to 85, but I'm [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6746.219999999999s)]
*  number seven at 70 now, so it's, [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6749.42s)]
*  I don't think he has that over a heart of a time making it down to 170. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6753.259999999999s)]
*  I just think he has to make some adjustments. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6756.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6757.82s)]
*  You know, I mean, when you go back to when Kelvin was in his prime, I mean, [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6758.7s)]
*  just, I just really think 170 was always the weight for him. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6762.5s)]
*  I just think he needs to do it the right way. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6766.0599999999995s)]
*  Like he needs to do it at the PI. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6767.74s)]
*  If you, if you look at the people he's beat, like he's fought everyone and the [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6769.0199999999995s)]
*  guys he's lost to, they're all close fights. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6773.74s)]
*  How about the Adesanya fight? [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6776.22s)]
*  Very close. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6777.5s)]
*  Very close. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6778.66s)]
*  I watched that fight so many times. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6779.42s)]
*  I'm like, dude, he's fucking, Kelvin's good. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6781.42s)]
*  He's fast, his hands. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6784.3s)]
*  That one too, that right left, that fucking straight left. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6785.22s)]
*  He has. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6788.860000000001s)]
*  I had so many guys sort of like just getting ready for that fight because I [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6789.3s)]
*  watched all of these fights. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6792.900000000001s)]
*  I watched what he did to all these guys. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6793.860000000001s)]
*  When he knocked out Bisbin, when he knocked, he beat Jacare. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6795.660000000001s)]
*  Like he's being all these guys. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6798.780000000001s)]
*  He beat, um, Johnny Hendrix. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6800.06s)]
*  Like he's like, you go and look at his record. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6802.46s)]
*  You're like, holy shit. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6804.860000000001s)]
*  This guy fought all these guys and he has so much experience. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6805.900000000001s)]
*  I think he had like five or six main events. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6808.780000000001s)]
*  He fought, uh, Chris Weidman dropped them bad in the first round. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6811.3s)]
*  Weidman submitted them in the third round, but fucking got floored before that. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6814.86s)]
*  So you're thinking like, this is at 185. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6818.94s)]
*  He's going to hit way harder at 170. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6821.219999999999s)]
*  So I trained my fucking asshole for that fight. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6823.139999999999s)]
*  And, um, but yeah, once I got him to the ground, I'm like, this is [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6826.0199999999995s)]
*  where I'm going to win this fight. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6829.66s)]
*  Well, you are in that weight class, one of the absolute elite grapplers. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6830.38s)]
*  And that was really established in that fight. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6835.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, I was so impressed with your control, your ability. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6838.139999999999s)]
*  I mean, he's a good grappler. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6840.58s)]
*  Kelvin's a very good grappler. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6841.78s)]
*  And you were manhandling. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6843.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6844.820000000001s)]
*  It's like the same thing. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6845.9400000000005s)]
*  Uh, it's just like having, like, I have a path I'm going to do on the ground. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6847.14s)]
*  And you turn this way. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6851.06s)]
*  I have something for that. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6852.820000000001s)]
*  You turn the, it's like a map in my mind and it fucking, like, you might think [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6853.860000000001s)]
*  you're getting out, but I'm just putting you in a direction I want to put you on. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6858.740000000001s)]
*  And, um, yeah, I love like that, like almost like that slow cook approach, like [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6862.9400000000005s)]
*  take you down, wear you out second round, same thing. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6868.02s)]
*  And then I, like, I submitted Jake Matthews in the third Kelvin in the third. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6871.06s)]
*  Obviously if I can get it in the first round, but, um, yeah, when you wear on [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6874.9800000000005s)]
*  guys, like there's nothing better than that feeling like, cause you can feel it. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6878.580000000001s)]
*  Like you can feel when you're on top of somebody and they're just slowly, slowly, [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6881.740000000001s)]
*  like their energy is just getting zapped. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6886.580000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6888.700000000001s)]
*  So have there been talks about, uh, when you're going to come back and, and [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6889.02s)]
*  who he might likely be facing? [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6893.14s)]
*  So there's that Atlantic city card. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6894.660000000001s)]
*  It's March 30th. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6896.9800000000005s)]
*  So it's still like 12, like 11, 12 weeks away. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6898.1s)]
*  Um, like I just want to make sure my hand's good before I go back into anything. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6900.9400000000005s)]
*  So maybe April timeframe will be there, but I would like to Colby fight. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6905.700000000001s)]
*  He's ranked five now. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6912.14s)]
*  He hasn't beaten anybody inside the top 15. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6913.42s)]
*  He has no ranked wins. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6915.9400000000005s)]
*  Um, Mazel tov doesn't fight anymore. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6917.620000000001s)]
*  All the guys he's beat, like they're not even in the UFC. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6920.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6922.580000000001s)]
*  So, and then there's wonder boy right at, right ahead of me. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6922.900000000001s)]
*  I don't know what he's going to do. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6925.700000000001s)]
*  I know like third, like they don't want to put him with your grappler, you know, [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6926.9s)]
*  like, so, and I get that, but if it's going to be like that, I don't think you [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6930.66s)]
*  should be in the rankings either. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6934.58s)]
*  Like if you're, if you're going to pick and choose and he deserves to, he's done [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6935.94s)]
*  a lot in the sport, go have your fun fights and like Terrence Crawford, but [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6938.98s)]
*  put someone else in the division. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6943.0199999999995s)]
*  Um, but yeah, there's, there's a couple of big fights. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6944.42s)]
*  Uh, Luke is right behind me. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6947.98s)]
*  So that could be a fight that they match. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6949.66s)]
*  They could match us up. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6951.219999999999s)]
*  Have they given you any indication of which way they might be going? [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6952.66s)]
*  Not yet. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6955.9s)]
*  Not yet. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6956.46s)]
*  I, how does that work? [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6957.1s)]
*  Like, do you just get a call one day? [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6958.02s)]
*  They reach out to your manager, I guess they, and then your manager calls you [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6960.1s)]
*  and they're like, Hey, like this is what they're thinking. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6963.78s)]
*  And then it's literally like that simple. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6965.38s)]
*  Like you just go from there. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6968.1s)]
*  But if you have an injury or something like that, you kind of let them, let [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6969.7s)]
*  them know what's going on. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6972.42s)]
*  So I just told them, I'm like, give me a week or two to see kind of how my [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6973.42s)]
*  hand's feeling and cause I'm going to try to do absolutely nothing and just let it [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6977.22s)]
*  rest and if it feels good, like I would love the fight in AC, like I fought in AC. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6980.86s)]
*  I won belts in AC. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6985.54s)]
*  Like it's, it was like my bad fighting in Philly or fighting in AC. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6987.26s)]
*  Like fucking we'd all go out and party afterwards when we were younger. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6990.26s)]
*  It was great. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6993.78s)]
*  But what is the drive like 45 minutes? [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6994.34s)]
*  Like an hour. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6996.38s)]
*  It's the easiest drive ever. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=6997.78s)]
*  But being hung over driving home, they're like, all right, it's only an hour. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7000.14s)]
*  It's not, it's not that bad. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7003.18s)]
*  We used to get fucking rowdy and AC when I was younger, it would be [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7004.1s)]
*  awesome to do that again. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7008.1s)]
*  But yeah, I just want to make it, but I just, I don't want to rush into it and [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7009.18s)]
*  start a training camp with my hand fucked up. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7013.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7015.78s)]
*  Well, especially because I'm in a good position now, you know, I'm number seven. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7016.219999999999s)]
*  I haven't had a big win and yeah, I think I, I would like to Colby just because he [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7019.62s)]
*  like, he's always gotten like not, he's won his fights, but he's always kind of [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7025.66s)]
*  gotten like a easier path to the, to the, to the title. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7030.139999999999s)]
*  So I think he should have to fight somebody younger than him, ranked behind him. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7034.179999999999s)]
*  And then if he deserves it, he'll win that fight and then he can go back. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7038.0199999999995s)]
*  But if not, let the, let the younger guys move up. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7041.5s)]
*  It's going to be interesting what happens with him now after that fight, [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7044.78s)]
*  because it's obvious that you can't give him another title shot. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7048.42s)]
*  No. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7051.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7051.74s)]
*  So it's not like he can go right back in. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7052.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7054.18s)]
*  He absolutely could earn another title shot in the future. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7055.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7058.26s)]
*  With a bunch of wins. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7058.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7059.3s)]
*  It's still possible. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7060.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7060.86s)]
*  But you know, what is that path like, and who do they match him up? [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7061.34s)]
*  He was calling out, um, he went on wonder boy. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7064.38s)]
*  I'm like, no, like you're not like, come on, like come, let me, let's [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7066.38s)]
*  like, you're one of the best grapplers in the division. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7071.54s)]
*  I'm one of the best. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7073.5s)]
*  Like let's fucking me and you do it and let's see who wins. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7074.3s)]
*  You know, we're right next to each other in the rankings. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7078.18s)]
*  Like that's what I want. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7079.9s)]
*  I'd love to see that. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7081.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7081.9800000000005s)]
*  That's what I want. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7082.3s)]
*  Well, this is Sean. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHgCVIrnyE&t=7083.14s)]
