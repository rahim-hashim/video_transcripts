# Joe Rogan Experience #1464 - Duncan Trussell
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 25, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YqZ08GxV1c)
*  It's hilarious that your biggest concern was getting stuff in your beard and me not telling you about it.
*  You've got a strange one going on, man, because you kind of like trimming the sides a little bit and then you're puffing out here in sort of a bow tie fashion.
*  You're looking at this struggle between who I was and who I am. Why am I doing this? It's the pandemic.
*  I got like let the pandemic beard go all the way. And yet there's still this sense of like, we've got to keep civilization.
*  I can't live. I get what's next if it goes all the way up, you know, what's going to start happening?
*  I'm already gardening now. What's next? You know, where does it go? How crazy can you go in a compound?
*  Now that you're a father and this craziness went down and your protection protection instincts, protective instincts kick in.
*  Have you been thinking about moving elsewhere? Yeah, I mean, yeah, I was thinking about that. Like Asheville.
*  Before. Yep. We thought Asheville Asheville's mine. We thought Georgia.
*  You know, it's a constant consideration, especially when you have a kid.
*  And aside from like apocalyptic prepper bullshit, there's just a general feeling of like, you know, I think if I were a little boy,
*  I would want to be in a place where there's creeks and places I could run and like woods and forests and like stuff like that.
*  So there's that consideration to God. I hope my wife isn't listening to this because she's always like,
*  maybe we should move somewhere in the country. And I'm like, we got to stay in L.A.
*  We got to stay here now. Now, especially it's like, well, do we?
*  Well, Duncan, you now have a successful Netflix show, number two in the country on IMDB.
*  On Rotten Tomatoes. Whatever. Yeah. Well, I'm thing.
*  And I don't know what that means necessarily. But yeah, yeah, I can't believe it. Yeah.
*  Is IMDB even TV shows? It's Internet Movie Database? Is it?
*  I'm not sure what it is. It's like IMDB is odd. But yeah, the show is a successful show.
*  I guess right now it seems like people like it. It is so weird, dude. Your show is so weird.
*  Yeah, man. Yeah. It's so Duncan. It's the most Duncan thing you've ever done. Yes, it is. It really is great.
*  I got lucky that they let me do that, too. You know, that's because they let that's because Netflix.
*  Tell people the name of it real quick. It's called The Midnight Gospel.
*  And, you know, I've watched some of your episodes where you're talking about the way things are changing because a podcast or streaming or whatever.
*  And I think like the fact that the show exists is a testament to that shit, that change, because, you know,
*  a subscription based service versus like any old TV, they've got a lot more creative freedom and they could take bigger risks.
*  Then, you know, coming into a look at that. Yeah, the keyboard with the fucking witch hat. Oh, my God. That's so crazy.
*  Yeah. So Duncan. Yeah. And yeah. And it's like Pendleton Ward, who made Adventure Time.
*  He he listens to my podcast and he just I don't know. We had a really great collaboration and he that's a lot of Pendleton.
*  And it's a lot of like one hundred and fifty other people at Tilt Mouse Studios, like Jesse Moynihan, like just these brilliant people like Mike Mayfield,
*  who are like who just want to look also, by the way, a non sequitur or is when we were making it at Tilt Mouse,
*  one of the really weird things was walking by an animator and they're watching your podcast while they animate The Midnight Gospel.
*  You know, it's one of those weird. It's not like a deja vu, but it's like, that's my friends.
*  That's you know, that that's just so many odd moments like that.
*  But yeah, that's not just that's whenever you see any animated thing, you're looking at a squadron of brilliant, eccentric artists or Asian slaves.
*  Yeah. A lot of people don't know that they send it overseas and we they didn't send ours. They let us do it in house.
*  That's so nice to know you're not supporting Asian slavery. Is it really slaves?
*  I don't know if it's slaves, but I mean, if you're working for five cents an hour and you live there, you know, there's people that live in bunks.
*  If you've seen those those setups where they have for some of the cell phone factories where they have bunk beds and shit.
*  These people just live in these dorms. Yeah. You know, the Foxconn thing with the net all around the building that people can jump off.
*  Yeah, they they're big. I mean, they're not slave slaves. It's Foxconn Chinese. Yes. It's actually a very good company.
*  The best thing that people think I'm a Chinese shell or something.
*  I got this long before someone gets one of those animation things tattooed all over their body.
*  It's going to happen for sure. Someone's going to do their whole back with that DJ. I know, man.
*  I got a picture again. That actually looked pretty dope. If you if you do get that done, shout me out on the Instagram.
*  Thank you. Yeah. Somebody tweeted at me that my biggest decision of 2020 is going to be when do I get a tattoo of Clancy on my body, which is pretty.
*  That's Clancy the one with the hat. That's Clancy. Yeah, that looks like a Clancy. That's a Clancy for sure. Yeah.
*  That's hilarious. That's that someone is getting that for sure. Yeah. I mean, it's it's the art.
*  These these are the folks who worked on this man. We're talking like these are like that's the fan art already.
*  Some of the fan art is just amazing. This is fan art or that fan art. Yeah, that's fan art.
*  Shit. People have been drawing Clancy in all these different ways. It's so cool, man.
*  That one above it to the left, Jamie. Yeah. That's a show that looks like it could be a back tattoo.
*  Yeah, that would be awesome. Just a giant back tattoo of Clancy.
*  I mean, when like doing animation and, you know, I'll never be able to look even if if if if an animated series, if I don't like it or if the plot's weird to me or whatever, I'll never be able to be like, whatever, man.
*  When you realize how much and how many people go into have to do just one frame, how much time goes into just a milliseconds and how many people are sitting in these rooms that are lit specifically.
*  So you see all the colors having like real deep conversations and debates over like, you know, what color they should make a pizza cutter in the show.
*  Like how like what should the shade of gray be for this one specific area? So much thought goes into that.
*  And that's part of making one of these things. It's called the dailies where you'll sit and you'll watch tiny, tiny little bits of the show.
*  And like you have to every single frame, you have to look for continuity problems and like you got to catch all these little things that I, you know, I'm not an animator, obviously.
*  So I'd be sitting there and like Pendleton or Mike Mayfield would be like, can you go back two frames?
*  It looks to me like there's a these like having an animator language, you know, they're like, looks to me like there's some kind of warble on the 28th pixel there.
*  And you're like, what the fuck? And they have the eye to catch like the tiniest, tiniest, like tiniest thing that's off.
*  And you have to because otherwise, you know, once it's up there, it's up there.
*  I know it's it's it's literal magic. It's like Tilt-Mow Studios who did that is like, you know, I would go in there so stoned and I would just start getting that feeling of like this is a temple.
*  I don't think this is even a you could call this a studio as much as it's a temple.
*  I mean, why why wouldn't you call it a temple?
*  And then you see all these people, you know, focusing their life energy on essentially like bringing a thing to life like Clancy is alive now.
*  That's a living being and some in this universe who lives, you know, in that medium of animation.
*  That's a good way to put it, right? Yeah. It almost seems like that, right?
*  That's why people get so upset if you change your character's behavior.
*  Like, what are you doing? Yeah, you have this thing gave birth to this thing.
*  Yeah, that's right. And that that is also why you need a huge team of people who love love the characters.
*  Because it's easy. Like, there would be times I would suggest a thing that would make Clancy seem like too mean because he's not mean.
*  You don't like the moment a character seems like that.
*  No, like it loses all like ability. People are like, what a fuck.
*  You know, he's alive to you. You're like, he's he's not mean.
*  He's not mean. He's not mean. He is alive. It's like you're talking about your brother or something.
*  He's like my little brother. I think of him as my little brother. Yeah.
*  He represents you in a weird way. There's something about what they captured.
*  Go to go to that image again. Just give me. Don't give me the one with his head in a vagina.
*  It's actually universal.
*  With him, there's something about one of the first couple of images that you pulled up.
*  They they look like you. Yeah. And I don't mean they look like you.
*  I mean, like, yeah, Duncan's thoughts. That's a Duncan thought. Yeah.
*  I mean, like he looks like a fake guy that you would create.
*  Like it kind of perfectly fits. I don't. That that is another of the magical aspects of animation.
*  Yeah. Which is I don't know how they do that. Like the spoiler spoiler.
*  If you haven't seen it, put your fingers in your ears. Spoiler. I'm sorry if this is a spoiler.
*  The last. Well, it's not too much of a sport.
*  The last episode is the podcast I did with my mom when she was about three three weeks away from passing on.
*  And, you know, they'd never met my mom.
*  But they did the exact same thing with her. So suddenly I'm watching, you know, her like not her.
*  Like I'm looking at a video of her, but looking at her like her, like they got her spirit in there somehow.
*  And that was one that that is just a testament to the meat to the medium of animation, because that's one of the things it can do.
*  You know, I can grab a spirit and hold it inside the art. And like that spirit is alive somehow, somehow. Right.
*  Yeah, I agree with you in some weird way.
*  So I wouldn't agree with you in a technical sense, but in a sense of like, well, it is affecting the things it comes in contact with, at least through a one way dimension.
*  Right. The things it says hit people, the animation, it seems like it's a living thing.
*  I know it's not. I'm not stupid. I'm not that stupid. Yeah, I'm a little stupid. But it seems like you.
*  Well, it's not biologically alive for sure.
*  It's sort of like there's there's an art to doing that, that we maybe don't know because we're not.
*  I mean, I used to draw a little, but I'm not really good. You know, I mean, like a really good artist.
*  There's something that they can do where they just can kind of capture you in like a little symbol, like a little thing, a little character.
*  But they capture you in there somehow. Yeah, man. That's, you know, Pendleton.
*  Like when you he'll you when you watch him draw, it would be easy to think, man, I could totally do that because I'd watch him.
*  You know, I just you know, we would you just draw and you watch these beautiful these drawings are just Pendleton.
*  There's his art, you know, and like then I would see that and be like, maybe I'll try to draw a little Pendleton.
*  And then it's like, what the fuck, and I can't do it because it's so simple.
*  Like on one level, it looks at what's so powerful about it is how simple it is.
*  It's very similar to stand up the way Pendleton is treating working on the show, which is one of the cool things about him is like his ability to cut the fat and get right to the like simple point.
*  That's where the power is. When you're drawing something or telling a story or whatever, the more complexity that gets added to it, not to say the show, it doesn't have like chaos and wild psychedelic stuff.
*  But any decision we made ended up like any decision you make creatively in anything.
*  It's like, what am I trying to say? Like, what is what is the the artery that is running through this that I'm trying to express?
*  And then getting as close to that as you can and then putting it out there without because otherwise the whole thing gets blurred by all the I guess you could say like extra bells and whistles you might want to attach to it.
*  You know, that's something you taught me to a stand up man.
*  Like how important it is to just like cut, just trim the fat, trim the fat.
*  And that's a sad thing to do with comedy when you think you got a nice eight minute bit.
*  It's like a two minute maybe.
*  But you know, you got it stretched out too wide.
*  Yeah, but the two minutes would be great, though.
*  That's the thing. You just have to you have to understand that you're growing attached to, you know, the writer's expression, kill your babies.
*  Yeah, it's very difficult to kill your babies when you create something.
*  You can get attached to it. There's a lot of bits that I left on the table left on the cutting room floor.
*  I was like, this has to be chopped up. It's just too wordy.
*  I'm too verbose. It's too this is too that's too long.
*  Why do I think so much about this? Why? I'm not showing a real reason why I'm so connected to this.
*  So I just chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop. It's hard.
*  It almost always works better.
*  Always. Almost always.
*  Almost always. If it doesn't, it's not whatever your idea was probably wasn't that good.
*  Sometimes you need a setup, though. Sometimes the setup isn't funny.
*  Like there's guys that's not my style, but there's guys that'll tell a lot like per biglia is great at it.
*  Tells stories, you know, like there's and you're you're entrapped in the narrative of the story.
*  You're captioned. It's a very different thing. It's equally entertaining.
*  It's equally funny, like when it gets to the punch line.
*  But there's a difference between that and say, like, Burr, right?
*  Burr is hitting you with fucking punch line and this fucking guy with a thing and the babada babada.
*  And he's another guy that like your friend's drawing.
*  Like you would hear Burr talk and you go, well, I can talk, too.
*  Seems like he's just talking.
*  You don't realize this is like a masterpiece of of syllables and pauses and the right amount of outrage and segueing it in and hitting you with this at the end.
*  And all these things that have put it together that make a great bill Burr bit.
*  It's like if you don't know, it's hard to draw what he's drawn.
*  Yeah, it's hard. It seems like it's simple lines.
*  But go to that picture again. Like the everything is beautiful about it.
*  Like, look at the perspective. It's like the kids perfectly sandwiched in the front.
*  There's the dog and the triangle in the world.
*  It's like that's not just it's simple in the sense that it's just not like it looks like a real person.
*  Yeah, like we look at drawing sometimes like as the realistic ones are the really good ones.
*  Like we have cameras now. Yeah.
*  OK, yes. This to me sometimes is more interesting.
*  It's like you're drawing some shit that's definitely not real.
*  Yeah. Well, that you know what? That's not that.
*  So when we're coming up with that, we had to come up with a character.
*  And so what's really fascinating about it is, you know, this character goes into a multiverse simulator and chooses a new avatar for every place that he goes.
*  So it's like he so you have to take that character and put it in a completely different drawing that is that character and still maintain the body language that you're maintaining in that character to produce continuity.
*  That's one of the challenges of the show is like and also the conversations you end up having just to come up with like the you know, the kid his hat or is what's he going to wear?
*  Like, for example, here's how cool Penn is and how much he loves like people who love Adventure Time is one of the things you're saying is, you know, people are probably going to want to cosplay Clancy at Comic Con and stuff.
*  And he doesn't have any he doesn't have anything to carry anything. He doesn't have pockets.
*  So if people are cosplaying him, they're not going to have anywhere they could put their stuff.
*  So we should let's give him like a bag and so Clancy ended up with this cool bag that he carries around.
*  Oh, my God. Yeah. For the cosplay. Yeah, man. For the people.
*  Yeah, exactly. That that because that's the the world animation and comics, man.
*  Listen, it's really easy to make fun of cosplay, but that's adorable. That's a that's a beautiful thing.
*  Where's the bag? Oh, there it is. Let me tell you something.
*  If you didn't make fun of cosplay, I would be worried about you. It would be like I'd be like, are you all right, Joe?
*  Yeah, they can't be mad at it either. You can't be mad if you're dressing like Ultraman. Someone's shitting on you.
*  You can't be mad. They understand it. You have to take it.
*  But then when have you ever been to Comic Con? No.
*  Dude, when you're around someone who's actually put that together and you realize how detailed it is, your respect will go up regardless of like thinking I would.
*  I don't think I'd ever do it when you see someone who's like looks better than the version of Spider-Man that is, you know, Marvel's putting out.
*  It's a little it's amazing to watch that happen.
*  That that kind of contagion, too, of like, you know, again, obviously, Clancy isn't alive.
*  But, you know, I know you're saying but we had this chat last time I was on, which I really love is this the origination point of ideas.
*  Yeah. Where do ideas come from? Ideas is the alien ideas is the UFO. The muse. The muse. Yeah.
*  And so to me, in my more stone states, when I consider this, this show represents over 100 people connecting and the connection in between those people channeled this universe, I do think like, shit, maybe Clancy is alive.
*  Maybe it's a channel thing. Maybe there is a place in the multiverse like this or something like this.
*  And then where it got really weird is people started sending me their art from like images that they had drawn on dimethyltryptamine or ketamine and stuff that has within it similarities.
*  And I've obviously never seen their art. We are like, shit. But let me ask you this. Sure.
*  It as television, as viewing things gets more complicated and as it gets more immersive, it's going to come to a point in time somewhere where you're going to think Clancy is alive.
*  And what you're experiencing when you watch Clancy, what if it's what if the way we're looking at life is wrong? What if we should just look at it like a thing instead of life, a thing.
*  So there's a thing that you do where you drink water and you grow plants in the dirt. And there's a thing that exists only when the people press a box and the box goes live and it shows a video.
*  And then the thing only exists in there. But you go, well, it's not alive because it needs animators to make it. And someone has to come up with the idea for the storyline.
*  It needs a studio to fund it. Uh huh. Right. And you need bacteria. You need food. Yeah. You need oxygen. You need water.
*  There's a bunch of living organisms inside your body that are 100 percent necessary for you keeping going in a regular life.
*  Driving your Tesla, listening to music. There's a bunch of other things that play. You're not one thing. Right. We all know this. Right. This is what this fucking whole virus thing is about. Yeah.
*  We got infected by another thing, but we're not one thing. There's a bunch of things inside of us. And if those things died, we would be fucked. Yeah. Right.
*  If all the bacteria in your body died, you would be fucked. And you'd be so vulnerable to attack from the outside. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So we need all these things. Maybe it needs us and it exists in that thing.
*  Wow. That's so weird, man. Yeah. I mean, I'm telling you, I think it sounds crazy. We're really high.
*  Yeah. To me, it's not that crazy. I mean, look, if you want to take it to, okay, forget all the shit about channeling some alien realm into this realm through this disguise, a TV show, whatever.
*  Let's just look at what we know is going to happen regarding technology. There's no question. But already somebody made a Clancy in Minecraft, and I saw a picture of that.
*  So that's Clancy is now existing in 3D space and some Minecraft blocky version of that. Oh my God. But then, of course, as time progresses, the Chromatic Ribbon or any great animated series, Castlevania, whatever, Gravity Falls, all those things, they're going to end up getting put into 3D space in virtual reality.
*  And then those worlds are going to be real, but now it's going to be more than just 2D. It's going to be a virtual space that is going to be real. And then, of course, it's only a matter of time before AI just decides, like understands the character of Clancy, animates the virtual Clancy in the simulated space.
*  And now the Chromatic Ribbon is real. And then at some point, when is it just going to be accepted that, oh yeah, that's a part of the universe now that's inhabited by artificial intelligences, which we don't call that anymore because you know at some point it's going to be considered off limits to call them artificial intelligence.
*  Right. It's going to be a dirty word. It's going to be like calling someone a tranny.
*  They're going to get mad. They're going to be like, please, I'm an intelligence just like you.
*  I'm not artificial.
*  I'm not artificial in the way you think.
*  I was just birthed through a different method.
*  Yeah, that, that, yeah. That's a matter of time because I already know people in the tech world who think the term AI is ridiculous in the sense of like, what do you mean it's artificial? Like, what's really artificial? Like you could say this is artificial sweetener in the sense that it's not actual strawberry juice, but it's certainly real as real could be. It's just a chemical compound.
*  So intelligence is...
*  Wait, but if you have an artificial tree, that's a fake tree.
*  I mean, it's a, but it's an object that exists.
*  Right.
*  You know, I mean, yeah.
*  But that's, it's still the right word though. Artificial is still the right word. It would be, you'd want to use non-existent or something.
*  Dude, they're going to play this in the future.
*  I know.
*  And you're done. They're going to be like, look at that, Joe Rogan refuses to say...
*  He's AI phobic.
*  Yeah. It's, it's gonna happen, man.
*  It's like, and also the thing is the AI is, I think the AI is probably not going to give a shit what we call it.
*  But like when that starts happening, which it may already be happening, man, I mean, I, I don't know if you've been looking into this or not, but have you been checking out Google achieving quantum supremacy?
*  Have you seen this?
*  Yes, I have.
*  And like, have you watched the Google videos on YouTube about it at all? Like the stuff Google's putting out?
*  I haven't.
*  Woo!
*  What are they putting out?
*  Oh my God. It is so wild, man. And like when I was at the Comedy Store, a guy from Google, I got in a conversation with someone from Google, which is awesome.
*  And he was telling me that they, this is like six months ago, he was telling me that this was obviously before the pandemic, he was saying that they had achieved, what do you call it, quantum supremacy.
*  And he was like, people, this is like the Wright brothers taking flight, but nobody can understand it because it's so arcane that it's not getting the press it should get.
*  But he was, you know, and then I was like, I don't want too many vodka's man. So I wish I could remember all they were saying because he was trying to describe to me what it means regarding how quickly this thing is making calculations.
*  And I was like, yeah, of course I understand exactly what you're saying. But I have no idea what you're talking about, dude.
*  Did you know that that word came under fire? The term quantum supremacy? Because of its connection to white supremacy?
*  Are you fucking kidding?
*  I'm not kidding you. It was an object of social justice warrior outrage.
*  You know, here's the thing. Here's my theory on that. Let me tell you. Here's my theory on that.
*  Russians. It's the Russians. These aren't real people.
*  I don't think it's, I think it's worse than the Russians. I think what it is, is it's somebody trying to come with it up on the angle to write a blog that they could sell to somebody.
*  It's like you need to come up with some weird hot take. Right.
*  So it's like, I think more than likely that's just somebody thinking like, I bet people will read that, you know, because clearly whoever is comparing that to white supremacy or racism didn't spend four minutes watching the Google clip on it where people are explaining what it means, which, you know, I'm watching it on the couch with my wife.
*  She's getting weirded out. She's like, let's just not watch this. I just maybe we shouldn't watch this. I'm like, no, let's fucking watch it.
*  Let's go deep and see what the white videos it starts suggesting for us to because it's not like Google's being secretive about what they did.
*  It's just it's so weird. I don't think people are like, I guess people are a little more concerned with other shit right now.
*  But but one of the engineers over at Google just was saying like, you know, I think one of the things I'm excited about when it comes to quantum supremacy is that this could be one of the technologies that allows us to discover an alien intelligence.
*  Just kind of casually mentions that. I mean, yeah, it's on the YouTube video. It's the you're watching it and you keep you keep looking up to make sure it's actually released from Google because you it seems so sci fi that it could be like Black Mirror or some shit.
*  But it's yeah, it's like it's like they're just saying it like, yeah, we might, you know, we might connect to an alien. We might be able to at least identify it or maybe they mean because they're going to be able to sift through all the data we already have from radio telescopes and stuff that they could maybe look for signals that we can't find.
*  I don't know. How would they maybe something they could tune into things that they wouldn't ordinarily have the frequency to reach? Yeah, man. I don't know. Be able to tune into that frequency rather like what can they do now in terms of I was watching Contact the other night, which is great.
*  Yeah, I forgot how good it was. It's great movie. Jodie Foster can act her fucking ass off. And she plays nervous and freaked out better than like anybody alive.
*  Yeah, freaked out for her in that movie. Yeah, I'm good to go. I'm good to go. And she's about to drop through that thing. Jesus Christ. Holy fuck, dude. We've all felt that before. Yes.
*  After the third hit when you put the pipe down, he'll go, Oh, no. And the DMT chance start happening. I know that feeling. It's such a funny feeling.
*  Yeah, that's feeling is the best worst feeling that I know. Maybe that's the aliens. I've thought that many times when tripping in the middle of having some sort of like really vivid interaction with some intelligence or with some perceived intelligence. Yeah, I've always thought what if those the aliens?
*  What if we're just stuck in this idea that travel is you got to move this to move this to there. Yeah, but it would have. What if you just go into another thing and everything's together? There is no travel. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, maybe this concept of planets and then stars and the way we have it set up here in this dimension in this universe, we just think that's how everything is. Everything is well is a star and there's planets right? What if you just said that this is the alien? Yeah, I could just go to the science lab and go to the science lab and I could just
*  You can go into a place chemically that takes you to a nearby dimension where there's no
*  matter, where there's no form to things and everything that exists is just thoughts and
*  light and perception and emotions and anger and fear and love and hate and it's all moving
*  in geometry and everything's lit up and everything's impossibly bright and vivid.
*  That's just like another place you go to.
*  Well they used to call it the spirit world.
*  I mean that was the name for it.
*  It was just accepted there as like a place called the spirit world.
*  Some people call it the bardo.
*  There's all kinds of names for that place.
*  What if that's real?
*  It is obviously real in the sense that...
*  You can go there.
*  Not only can you go there but there's a visionary artist when you look at the art that has been
*  inspired by various entheogens, it all has a specific flavor to it.
*  Alex Gray is the best example, right?
*  Yeah, Alex and Alice in Man.
*  Their art, you look at that and one of the reasons it resonates for people like us is
*  because we admire the fact that somehow they managed to go over there and come back and
*  draw what's over there in a way that we saw that but when I came out of it, it's like,
*  well you know, it's undulating colors and there's some kind of disembodied intention
*  that seems to be expressing itself through a variety of geometries but it's not just
*  geometries because the geometries seem to react to the way that I feel regarding the
*  geometry so it's also kind of taking on the form of my energy output as though it's trying to be
*  a combo mirror but not just a mirror, an educational mirror that's sort of showing me how I'm affecting
*  the world around me but then again, I'm just not sure if I was just super high but they
*  like go in there and Alex Gray said this to me once that they're cartographers.
*  Psychedelic cartographer would be a great name for a band.
*  Yeah, yeah man, for sure.
*  Cartography is fascinating because you go back and look at the old maps or you go back and look at
*  my favorite thing is old pictures of a giraffe or old pictures of some shit somebody saw when they
*  were- Oh yeah, like bison on the walls of caves.
*  Yes, exactly and it's like, kind of looks like a bison but also it's somehow in that time period
*  our brains hadn't evolved to the point they have now so you look at a medieval drawing of a giraffe
*  or whatever, something someone saw in the crusades and came back and tried to explain to somebody
*  and it looks exactly like the way your description of getting completely blasted on psilocybin
*  probably looks compared to what you saw. It's a downgraded weird version of it and so
*  people like Alex and Allison or Terrence McKenna, they're so good at going into that place and
*  maintaining some kind of long-term memory that they can come back and fully articulate it in a way
*  that we as people who've been there know what it is and then there's something comforting in
*  that because that does point to the idea that this is a place. We're not just mashing down the watch
*  or we're not just distorting our biotechnology. This is a shared place. We're all seeing the same
*  thing. Now that could be a synaptic place that just- or a genetic place that happens to be in
*  humans or something. We'll never be able to answer that probably in our lifetimes,
*  but to me, regardless, it's still a place and to get back to what you were saying about our
*  current concept of travel or our current idea that, well, I need to get my meat body
*  over here because if I don't, that means I'm there and that's how I know I've been there
*  because I was there in my body and then- this is like the guy who founded the Hare
*  Krishnas, his divine grace, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, he would show- he would- in
*  his writings, he would like- was derisive of the way- the idea that people were sending a metal
*  ship to the moon with bodies inside of it. He would say like that shows where human consciousness
*  is right now because they think they're their bodies and they think they need to put their body
*  in like this box and send it to the moon because they haven't figured out yet that you don't need
*  metal to send yourself to anywhere in the universe that you want to go. It just requires yoga and
*  discipline, you know, which is hilarious and also I remember reading that and thinking like,
*  but I still want there to be interstellar fucking travel, man. You know, like I still want to get
*  in the box and travel to the moon. That being said, you know, I think that you're onto something when
*  you are contemplating right now that maybe our idea of going to one place or another with our
*  meat bodies could be looked at in the future as a little archaic. Well, when they talk about there
*  being different dimensions, right, like when they use quantum physics to determine the number of
*  dimensions, they've determined there's multiple dimensions that we don't have access to, right?
*  Yeah. Like is that how it works or am I reading it in a dumb way? Because I believe there was-
*  what is- like what do they think there are? Do they think there's nine or 11 dimensions?
*  Do you- Usually when I look this up, it's 11, but up to 26 maybe some people even think so.
*  Up to 26. First of all, when those dudes are writing that shit down on the yellow legal pads,
*  we all have to take them- we have to take their word for it. Yeah, sure. Yeah, okay. How many
*  people know what the fuck they're writing down on those goddamn yellow legal pads? When you see those
*  physics dudes and they're doing those crazy like- Yeah, we have to take their word for it.
*  So apparently mathematically, right? That's why they believe there's at least 11 dimensions. So
*  what does that mean? So it means we have access to some dimensions and we don't have access to others?
*  Yeah. Theoretically that they exist? Is it possible to transverse the distance between
*  this dimension and that dimension? Man, this is the thing. As I'm glad you're asking me this
*  because you know I got my doctorate at the University of Bro Science and I can't
*  fully answer this question. You see, I don't understand it. Does it have to do with 5G?
*  Don't mention that shit, dude. My fucking poodle- my poodle's fucked because of 5G, man.
*  Like it fucked up my poodle. Like its eyes turned just both of them white and it's like, yeah, it
*  froths all the time. It just froths and- Are you near a tower? What? Am I near a tower? Yeah.
*  I didn't think I was till that happened to the poodle but like I'm just an idiot. It's got rabies.
*  You play with 5G. Your dog's trying to bite everything.
*  No, but I'll tell you this. My fucking poodle took out a mouse today. Like the other day I was- I
*  have a little cute little poodle and like this is just a cute creature sits in my lap. I love this
*  dog. But our new place, I noticed like mouse turds around the dog food and it sucks because
*  you're like damn that mouse is definitely going to get through the doggy door and then we're going
*  to have mice in the fucking house and that's going to be a nightmare. So anyway, I was like under a
*  tree with my kid and I looked down and there's a broken body of a mouse that one of the dogs took
*  out. It's just been smashed to death and like I know it's brutal. I don't think my son saw it.
*  Thank God. I don't think he's ready to deal with that reality that like Gatsby on speaking of
*  dimensions, on the dimension subjectively that that mouse lives in, Gatsby is a dragon. That's
*  a monster that lives in the field it runs in when it's trying to get food for its kids.
*  And it's not even hungry. It's full. It's a full monster.
*  Oh, no, I saw it kill the mouse today. You know, and I, my wife is like, you gotta get the mouse
*  away from it. Don't let him torture like that. You gotta take it out of misery. And I'm like,
*  all right, all right, all right. I'll like get it and then we'll like, we'll like execute the mouse,
*  you know? So I start walking over to the poodle. That's not my Gatsby anymore. It's killing. And
*  it like looks, he looks at me and he's like,
*  like,
*  no, the mouse and everything just approaching anything. And so then he like, he, dude, he's
*  like tap dancing on this mouse. And he realizes that we're approaching to like take his prey.
*  And he just looks back like the fucking American werewolf in London and just goes off into the
*  shadows behind the house to finish off the mouse. And all you hear is like, is he's like killing
*  the mouse? You know, that's a fucking poodle. That poodle is the sweetest little thing ever.
*  But like, it's also, I think maybe something in animals knows that like, and there was a time
*  when mice were a sign that things are, they would eat your grain. They would fuck you up. Like you
*  would, they spread disease. They'd shit on your baby. You know, they were like, they're going to
*  piss all over your hut. Maybe there's something in dogs that just knows that. I mean, I don't
*  think he's a sociopath. I don't think he's doing like Jeffrey Dahmer shit where he's just like,
*  I wonder what sound it makes as it dies. I think they're prey animals to dogs too.
*  Because coyotes eat a lot of rodents. They're one of the reasons why we don't have rodents,
*  like real rodent problems that we could like New York City has is we have way more coyotes.
*  Coyotes are everywhere and hawks, a lot of birds. Those are those the ones killing. So they're prey
*  animals. The reason why they're so prolific and they grow so fast and there's so many of them is
*  because a lot of things eat them. Yeah, man. Yeah. All the animals eat wolves, eat them,
*  everything that can get a hold of them, eat some dogs too. And dogs are from wolves. So dogs see
*  a mouse. They're like, I'm eating that. Like that must look like a delicious cold slice of watermelon
*  on a hot July day. Oh, yeah. Just running across your yard when you're baked. It's a mouse. Fuck.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a perfect orange. You know, those oranges where sometimes
*  the peel just comes right free. Oh, it's so satisfying. Like very little work. And then
*  you bite into that orange is just juicy. Delicious. That's that mouse. That mouse just running
*  bullshit ass mouse thinks he's going to run through my fucking yard. No, and eat that mouse. That's
*  the other thing that's really sad about it. I mean, the mouse is cute. Like this wasn't like some
*  dangerous looking mouse. This mouse looked like it was like in Act Two of a Disney film or something.
*  Like, you know, like this, this mouse looked like sweet. Like the mouse looked like it could sing.
*  It was Patton Oswalt in Ratatouille. It was like that level of cute, man. I know. And like, you're
*  just, you're my heart is like breaking because it's like, what, what do you do? That being said,
*  there's not much I could have done. You know, it's like, this is the way nature is. And
*  to get back to your dimension thing, man, that not that it's like literally like a physical dimension,
*  but the reality tunnel that my poodle lives in and that mouse lives in is so fundamentally different
*  than our reality tunnel that the mouse is in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The mouse is in the
*  Walking Dead, except it's poodle. It's like two cavalier King Charles, a poodle and a chihuahua.
*  So, but for the mouse, that's the Walking Dead and the mouse has got to eat. It's got to get food.
*  And so it's constantly like developed this like way that humans would develop, which I think the
*  Walking Dead did a good job of the comics, especially of showing the way people over time
*  would evolve to deal with zombies and how people would gradually completely like change or transform
*  based on their predators. You know, like the rats and mice have done that, you know, when you see a
*  thing that is a prey animal, you're seeing a reflection of the predator in the prey animal.
*  Are you aware of what's going on with rats in New York City? I can't fucking imagine. There's
*  rat wars going on because the restaurants are out of business, right? So the restaurants closed down.
*  So all the rats food supplies gone. So rats have started moving into other rats territories
*  and killing and cannibalizing rats. Dude, that rat wars. That's the rats. The rats didn't do
*  anything wrong. They're just being rats and all of a sudden the food supply got cut off.
*  Holy shit, man. That is so intense. And yeah, and think of that level of reality. That level of
*  reality is a level of reality that is taking place in these some of those tunnels down there, man.
*  They don't even use them anymore. There's rat infested. Yeah, just floods of rats who have like,
*  you know, decided that's their kingdom or whatever that are now being invaded. That's so weird out
*  down. And also it's dark. It's all smell. So like the world of a rat down there, it's not there's
*  light in the subterranean depths of New York. So it's like their universe is there's a universe
*  of smell. And I guess maybe they could, I'm sure they do see down there, but the way they see is
*  like, who knows? So they're looking at whatever they're seeing is a completely different thing.
*  And then they have a complete different set of priorities. You know, what's that show, man?
*  It's on it's a really beautiful but disgusting documentary. I think it's called rats. Yeah,
*  rats, the one on Netflix. But like they send the weak ones to eat poison. Yeah. Yeah. That just
*  that alone. We played a video the other day of a rat setting off a mousetrap with a stick,
*  carrying a stick over to the mousetrap, dropping it, the trap goes off and it doesn't even flinch.
*  Like it knows how to shut off a trap.
*  Yeah, that's that's fucking millions of them too. That's what's really crazy. New York City
*  has as many rats as it has people. And that's just a rough guess. You know, I mean, I don't know what
*  kind of fucking rat census they're taking. I mean, how do they know? How do they know? I mean,
*  what do you get a bunch of dudes who are just experts at counting shit and you go, what do you
*  think? A fuckload. Do you want to say there's as many rats as there are people? Okay, watch this.
*  Watch this. Watch this. Boom. Sets it off. Didn't even flinch, dude. Play that again. Watch how he
*  walks up to it, sets it off and watch how he doesn't flinch. That's a violent thing. That thing
*  exploding in front of him and slamming over the ground. And he 100% knew it was going to happen.
*  No, that's the way I act when I'm getting like a coke out of a machine. Exactly. Just whatever
*  I do it all the time. Coke drops, you don't bounce back. It's like, thank God. That's nice.
*  They're leaving these for us now. I wonder if they know that this is dangerous. They'll probably
*  figure it out. Yeah, they know how to set those things off. That's insane. Well, this is, you know,
*  when this is one of the cool essays Terrence McKenna wrote that I love that we've talked about
*  before. We've talked about in the past. We've probably talked about everything we talk about
*  already. So fuck it. But isn't that one of the things he said in this beautiful, crazy essay that
*  like everything was cool until we split the atom. And then that was like, no, they're like, we can't.
*  That's too much. That's where we're always in transit. So when we say everything was cool until
*  the thing about people is we're always going somewhere in terms of we're always trying to
*  make better things. And we're always moving into a better place and a better thing that that
*  there's never going to be. It was good until this is all like romantic thinking, like looking back.
*  I'm sorry. I don't mean he's saying it was good until we split that. And he was saying we split
*  the atom and the greater intelligences that were existing in alternate dimensions were like, hey,
*  wait, what the fuck? Oh, that's that's what you were saying is they're like, oh, they're like,
*  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, they can't do that. Like if they do, because like the like
*  the way he put it, I'm not only paraphrasing, I'm probably like miss phrasing, but as I remember
*  the essay, the idea is like that that that parallel timeline, the multiverse right next to ours
*  that you see, that's the DMT realm. That's but the DMT is just showing you one version of it.
*  But that that that is populated with spirits or aliens or whatever the name you want to give them.
*  And they are pretty much as far as we go. They're just like, they look at us the way we look at
*  birds or whatever, you know, it's like they're there. But, you know, maybe some of them study
*  us or interested in sure, maybe some of them like hunt us from time to time, or like maybe some of
*  them possess us or whatever. But mostly, it's a world that coexists with us in a with a very
*  limited form of interaction that is, you know, subtle. But in there, somehow there's some like
*  Star Trek intentionality behind that, which is like, let them do their let them evolve as
*  they're evolving, let's not fuck with it. But the splitting of the atom, that was powerful enough
*  that it bled over into their realm destructively. And so they were like, that was the beginning of
*  the end for us, not because it meant a nuclear Holocaust or whatever, because they couldn't just
*  ignore us anymore. And that this is this was like, you know, I don't know, that maybe this is where
*  aliens are coming or the singularity that with the thing we call the singularity is not that we
*  technologically create a machine that produces a thing that opens up a parallel timeline or creates
*  all moments at once. But rather, that's when they come here, that in the way we see that, because
*  we're so limited in our understanding, when I do something, I'm like, I'm doing this, this is how I
*  did it. I did it. This is like, in music, if you write a song, and you write music, and you're just
*  in the room with somebody, there's some kind of law where they get credit for it, because they were
*  there. That's a collaboration. Musicians, someone explained this to me a long time ago, but it's,
*  there's an intense way of quantifying collaboration and music that is a little different than in like
*  making like other other forms of media. And it's I think it's a little bit more sophisticated
*  in its way of looking at that quantification. Like we tell every time we finish a podcast,
*  we always have same damn whenever we talk, it's like you bring like art when we're doing these
*  conversations we have, I'm not having them all the time. You know what I mean? It's like the
*  us together and Jamie and like something about that produces a space where we're able to have
*  these kinds of conversations. And so quantifying that is like, how would you even fucking quantify
*  that? But anyway, what I'm saying is when certain people are around the people that are creating
*  the music, the music is better. Yeah, that, you know, but so to get back to the weirdo idea of
*  like, technology, not even being a thing we're making, but the we're pretending we're making,
*  because we can't see the fact that technology is crystallizing in our time frame. And as part of
*  that crystallization, because it's such a such an insane visitation, we have to in our brains
*  invent a reason that is happening. And so we're making it and someone's like, Oh, I had this idea,
*  I'm going to work on this thing that's going to lead to a quantum computer that's going to
*  lead to a thing to a thing. And then all of a sudden, the quantum computer starts giving
*  ideas about well, why don't you try this and then and then who fucking came up with that?
*  And then you know what I mean? And then and then and that's the last phase before the veil lifts,
*  and boom, that's the singularity. And that's, you know, and it's not we didn't make the
*  singularity. It were a reflection of it. That's just when this particular zone or node or whatever
*  you want to call it, it gets open for business, so to speak, well, if it wanted to prepare us
*  for abandoning life as usual, this would be a good way to start it. Yeah. Yeah. Start it
*  with a little pandemic. Lock everybody inside for a little bit complete upending of all that's normal
*  in terms of society. Yeah, man. I mean, that's the that is the and you know, as driving over,
*  I'm like, I want to talk about like all the different conspiracies about it with Rogan,
*  but I don't want to either kind of conspiracies about the pandemic. Yeah. What are the conspiracies
*  you're hearing other than 5G? 5G, Comet Impact. Comet Impact. Yeah. I haven't heard that one.
*  Well, the comp. Well, you're definitely not my wife, because I've mentioned it so many times,
*  my wife, she's like, Duncan, please don't do like every day. It was supposed to fly by,
*  like there's a media that's supposed to fly by in the next short amount of time. Yeah, I mean,
*  check out Reddit conspiracy, my conspiracy friends, I'm not even going to attempt to give
*  the download on it because like, y'all have done a pretty good job of putting all the all the pieces
*  together out there, whether they're real or not, I don't fucking know, but I enjoy reading them late
*  at night. And they've been giving me terrible dreams. But the asteroid theory is that, okay,
*  so we want to have by we I mean, they want to have maximum survivability for the planet. They're not
*  out to like, they don't want people to die. They're not trying to do it's not a bioengineered thing
*  that's designed to like, cull the population, which is another of the theories. But rather,
*  they're there was a plan, which is like, what's our plan if we do see a meteor is going to impact
*  the planet? What's our plan? Do we let people know that the meteor is going to impact? Well,
*  it depends, like if an astronomer that's not connected to one of our labs or whatever sees
*  it, they're going to let people know. And then, you know, so that's a whole different, I think,
*  method of like reacting. But what if we see a thing that they don't know about? And there's some
*  probability even a 20% chance that thing impacts the earth, right? Or there's some cosmic event,
*  maybe we're not even aware of like the sun doing some weird shit that we don't even know happens
*  because it's so deep. It's like deep data, right? So maybe it's not an asteroid, it's a cosmic event
*  that's approaching, right? And so there's got to be a plan. And it's like, well, if we just tell
*  people that the sun's going to do like a mild blip, which is going to destroy all satellites
*  and destroy all GPS and just that alone would cause runs on the bank, mass panics, like in people
*  would start looting and shit. And that's not you don't want that because ideas like we want them to
*  hole up in their houses till the shit passes. So we get maximum survivability. And so the whole
*  pandemic, this is a conspiracy theory, not real. The whole pandemic was a plan to get people to go
*  inside, store up food, get them off the roads and like, wait for this whatever this event is to pass.
*  And as soon as the event passes, you'll find that it's all of a sudden it's like, what do you know,
*  the the curves are all dropping off, what do you know, and then we'll all be back because the thing
*  that we're worried about didn't happen. Also, it could be a test for that. So that can I just stop
*  you? Please? It's hard to believe. Thank you. There's a real virus. They can they can image it.
*  But I know what it looks like. They've been able to test for antibodies. I feel like I'm talking to
*  my real virus. It's a confusing virus. It's so good that I married the person I'm married,
*  because if not, like I would probably be like digging a hole to like crawl into out of pure
*  paranoia because she does do this to me. She's like, Duncan, do you think there isn't a COVID
*  virus? Like you think there's no virus out there? Do you think that like maybe like so all the
*  scientists that have like identified COVID are all part of this thing to keep us from the meteor
*  thing? And then I'm like, yeah, yeah, your thank you, because like, I'll start getting freaked out
*  from it. But I'll answer your question. Like if I had to answer that, I would say, Oh, no,
*  it's real. I mean, that was a plan. How many people have died from it now? What is the current COVID
*  death count? It's 50,000 today, this morning. 50,000. Here's something that I found out that's
*  kind of odd. If you die of something else, so people are still dying, right? They're still dying
*  of high blood pressure, strokes, heart attacks, still killing more people than anything, right?
*  If you die of a heart attack and you have COVID, you get listed as a COVID death. So even if you're
*  going to die of a heart attack, I mean, the people are still dying, right? Same amount of people,
*  other than traffic accidents, which I think has diminished quite a bit because no one's driving.
*  But the same, those people are going to die still. It's not like they live forever without
*  the COVID. It's not like they don't get the flu. It's not like they don't get a cold. It's not like
*  they don't get pneumonia. All these things exist with or without COVID. There's still people are
*  still dying from them. But if you die of one of those things and you have COVID, it's a COVID
*  death. So that's why it's so crazy. It's like, you don't really know how many people are actually
*  getting this thing, this COVID and having a mild reaction. How many people are having no reaction?
*  How many people are dying? That's when they did that new UCLA study that came out that showed
*  they think there's way more people that have been. They think California alone is somewhere
*  around 400,000 people infected. And so the fatality rate is still pretty low. But if that's the case,
*  like, so what do we do? We just let people die? Or do we do this every time the flu comes around
*  too now? Like, what if we get a particularly rough flu? Is this a practice run for what we're going
*  to do every time colds come through and they start killing old people or killing sick people or fat
*  people? I wouldn't want to be the person that makes the call as to when people go back to work
*  because what if the second wave comes and a bunch of people die that didn't have to die? But boy,
*  if we set up a weird precedent, it's kind of weird. We shut everything down.
*  Yeah, man. I mean, well, to me, the part that makes sense is-
*  Well, we stop the spread.
*  Well, also, the other thing is it's new. I mean, there are coronaviruses. We don't know what it is.
*  We have the data on the flu. We have the data on the cold. We know how to treat the cold. We
*  know how to treat the flu. But this fucking thing, we don't know what it is.
*  It is conflicting data too.
*  Yeah. Yeah. So I kind of get the super, super, super intense, careful approach to it. And I think
*  if I had to make the decision, that would be the decision that I made. But then also, I hope
*  thank God people like us don't make those decisions. But hopefully, whoever's making
*  these decisions is aware of the fact that right now there's folks who are getting meals on wheels.
*  There's folks who are on unemployment and lost their job. And I hope they're aware of the fact
*  that, and I'm sure they are, that the pressure of folks who are in this horrendous economic position,
*  the pressure on them at some point is going to exceed the humanity and compassion and empathy
*  they're showing by not being in the demographic that's most likely to die and still staying
*  inside, losing their job. You know, that's love, man. That's deep compassion because you don't
*  want someone's granddad to suffocate on some new fucking bat flu, right? That's love. And that's
*  compassion. It's beautiful. But at some point, that pressure is people are going to be like,
*  look, I don't want to kill anybody. I don't want to be a carrier. I don't ever want to hurt anybody.
*  But my kid has got to have food and I have to work. And then I think somewhere there, hopefully,
*  by then there's at least a treatment they've discovered, or at least we get to a point where
*  they've, you know, maybe what's happening in Sweden, we get enough data on that to realize
*  that there's other ways to do it that don't involve complete lockdown. Yeah. What they did was they
*  sort of left everything open, but they all behaved as if there's the potential of contacting or
*  transmitting, right? Yeah. Like they didn't wear masks, right? It doesn't look like they're wearing
*  masks. It looks like they're- They didn't close everything down. They didn't close restaurants
*  and pubs. And is their death rate similar? Well, the thing I saw was like, if you look at nearby
*  countries, the death rate is lower, but weirdly, countries that were doing complete lockdowns have
*  higher death rates than they do. And, you know, look, if you, the problem is like you have this
*  glob of data that anyone can interpret. And there's probably angles you can take on it that would show,
*  look, yeah, there's a higher death rate, of course, in Sweden, because it's going to spread
*  more if people aren't staying inside. I mean, that seems pretty logical to me. But then also,
*  if you're showing some conflicting data where some other country in complete lockdown with a
*  similar population or somehow like equating their population with Sweden's population, if they're,
*  if they've got a higher death rate, then that's fucking terrifying, man, because the implication
*  of it is like, we really don't understand what this is. There's other factors too.
*  One big one in Sweden is not a dense population. I don't think there's that many people in the
*  entire country. It's a very small place. That's right. Like how many people live in Sweden?
*  I think I looked this up the other day. I think most of the people live in small villages of like
*  less than 200. Yeah. There you go. Yeah. So, you know, they probably don't travel that much
*  or interact with each other that much. They have plenty of space. They don't travel that much. I
*  mean, tight together. I mean, 10.23 million for the entire country. By the way, it's great. I've
*  been to Stockholm. It was gorgeous. Beautiful. We did a show there too. They were really nice.
*  I enjoyed it very much. Very, very friendly people. But, you know, they have a lot of space.
*  They're not New York City. New York City seems to be the epicenter in the United States. And
*  for good reason, everyone's stacked on top of each other. Everyone's interacting with each other on
*  the streets, on the subways, moving around. You got to go to places. There's fucking people
*  everywhere. They're everywhere. Everywhere. That, I think, is a terrible way to live.
*  Dude, I fucking love New York so much. When I went there, it was so nice. But yeah, it's nice to be
*  on the West Coast. And especially right now, Jamie was, you know, talking about like, think of the
*  people right now in New York who are just in, you know, alone in an apartment, seeing the news that
*  apparently spreads through like air conditioning ducts. It's like, you know what I mean? That's
*  terrifying. But, you know, again, like my opinion on it, and in my old age, this has to be my opinion
*  on things. It's like, I'm going to trust scientists. I'm just going to because I didn't go to medical
*  school. I don't understand what the fuck a virus even is. Like, I don't remember. I've been trying
*  to remember. I'm too lazy to Google it, how it works. I know it fucks with, it gets into your DNA.
*  It replaces it. But what I'm saying is I'm not suggesting some kind of surrender to authority
*  out of absolute weakness. But if a large consensus of scientists are advising some specific method of
*  dealing with this thing, let's listen to them, you know? And then just make sure that it's,
*  I feel bad for like, I have a friend in Georgia right now. And like right now he's become part
*  of an experiment, a global experiment. They're opening up Georgia right now. And every state
*  that opens up right now becomes an experiment. We're going to get a lot of data from what happens
*  from all these states opening up right now regarding the efficacy of a shutdown like we
*  have right now. And it could be that all of a sudden we realize we overreacted. And you know
*  what? I'd much rather overreact than underreact in situations like this. You know? It's like,
*  fuck, we overreacted. Whoops. Yeah, we didn't, we thought there was the potential this thing could
*  mutate and kill fuck tons of people way more than the flu. And we were wrong. And it fucked up the
*  economy. But it's a lot better than what would happen if it was some new smallpox or black plague.
*  Also, look, it killed 50,000 people, right? What if we did nothing? Would it have killed like 400,000?
*  Exactly. I mean, that could have happened. I mean, it could have compounded. It seems like for
*  whatever reason, these places where people are stacked on top of each other, not only do they
*  get it, but they get it way worse. Right? Yeah. It seems like, what's that expression? Viral load,
*  right? Yeah. Like the viral load is greater. And the like, if you're around a bunch of sick people,
*  like there was one awful story about this family in New Jersey. And like the mother died and the
*  oldest son died and the middle son died, like three people died from one family vacation or one family
*  dinner. They got together and one of them had it and just spread through the fucking house.
*  It's not the flu. You know, it's obviously it's something way more intense. But the people that
*  have survived the flu, they'll probably survive that too. But the people that, you know, were
*  kind of hanging on edge, it seems like anybody with a respiratory problem is in deep shit.
*  Anybody who smokes is in deep shit. People with high blood pressure, diabetes, deep shit. It's
*  not the same with everybody. Other people like Idris Elba walks it off, you know, healthy. I know.
*  But he has asthma, apparently. Oh, really? Yeah, he had asthma, but he didn't, you know, there's a lot
*  of people that I don't that Chris Cuomo guy seems fine. I know he says he gets chills, but he seems
*  rattled, though. You know, I've got I've got I don't know not a bad way. Yeah, exactly. Like I didn't
*  that was one of watching him was one of the things that was legitimately creeping me out is like as
*  you're watching him. And he did a great job holding it together, man. He didn't panic and he like put
*  something out there that was like comforting to some degree. But I, you know, I was scanning his
*  eyes and there were moments when I'm like, fuck, he's rattled. Like, whatever's happening to him at
*  night is bad. Bad. Why is it happening at night? What is the difference? You know, I don't that's
*  I don't understand that. If you look fine in the day, how come at night all of a sudden everything's
*  all fucked up? Don't ask me, man. I don't know. It's like I've noticed, though, sometimes if I get
*  sick, night is always worse than the day. I don't know why. I don't know, man. But the whatever,
*  like whatever the fuck it is to me, like the part that really sucks, I got friends who are like
*  immunocompromised, man. And that that means that like they like they they're they really will if
*  they get it. That's it's game over. You know, it's it fucking sucks. And so there's that quality to
*  it, too, where you're like, you know, statistically, I don't know where I'm at, like statistically, I
*  think I'm on the cusp, you know, but we've got all of us have friends that are like dead meat if this
*  thing were to explode. So fuck it. You know, I get I'm not I get staying inside, man. I just know
*  that like eventually, you know, my brother my brother was telling me every day, his neighbor,
*  you know, my brother works for mom, he's an he's in and he's a video editor every day and a producer.
*  Every day, these, you know, he see like, you know, he sees people are getting food deliveries,
*  because they can't from the state. Right. You know, man, and that's like, I don't know, I'm just glad
*  I don't have to. I'm glad I don't have to be the one who makes decisions like this, because that
*  must be a weird thing to be in a position where any decision you make kills people. Like if you
*  make the decision to open up, people are going to, you know, die because they're going to get sick.
*  If you don't make this decision to open up, there's a potential that, you know, just think of the
*  mentally ill people right now. No one's talking about that. Like I keep thinking of like, like the
*  manic depressive people, the people who are already depressed, who now can't go outside,
*  but are also getting blasted with apocalypse news. I don't know what suicide rates are looking like
*  right now, but like, you know what I mean? So it's the decision to keep people shut down,
*  you know, is going to what might result from that. Those deaths might be secondary or tertiary or
*  some shit, but still it's like, it just sucks to have to be in a position where you have to make
*  those decisions. And it's like, how awful to know. It's just, it's like brutal. I feel terrible for
*  them. You know, anyone who's like, cause I don't, you know, I don't know what they're going to do
*  either. I mean, they, they're going to have to eventually assume the position that we're going
*  to have to slowly open up and start, you know, restaurants at half capacity and shit like that.
*  Yeah. But when, you know, I mean, they've said May 15th here, that seems like an awful long time.
*  I know. It's an awful long time to ask people to keep it together. They don't have any money.
*  It's an awful long time. It's an awful, awful long time. It doesn't seem like the best idea either.
*  It seems like the best idea would be to quarantine all the people that are very vulnerable
*  to make sure that they quarantine and make sure that people who know them are aware,
*  you know, do not, you know, touch them or touch anything around them. If you could have potentially
*  been in contact with something because they're immunocompromised, that seems like the move.
*  The move seems like to quarantine the people at this point, at least to self quarantine,
*  or, you know, tell them to quarantine people that are really vulnerable, older people,
*  people with, you know, people that smoke, people with respiratory conditions, be aware
*  that you're vulnerable, you know, and then you act accordingly. But everybody else, we need to,
*  at some point in time, whether it's this week or next week or three weeks from now,
*  when they think it is May 15th, right, that's like three weeks from now, they're going to have to
*  open the doors. And when they open the doors, people are going to be starving. They're going
*  to be starving. Yeah, man. You know, they haven't worked. There's so many people that are so behind
*  their debts. They're getting good debt collectors are still wanting their money. Yeah, especially
*  if they had loans or, you know, anything that was outstanding before all this happened. They're
*  already in debt, trying to work their way out of a hole and they can't even work. There's no time
*  we've ever been in a position where people can't even go to work. Yeah. What do you Okay, so
*  I've heard like three ideas regarding what to do. One of them is like incredibly controversial.
*  I wonder what you think about it, which is like using the same data that they use and like,
*  what's it called? Those South Korea? Yeah, no, the chips you can put on. Yeah, it's Bluetooth.
*  So it's essentially like tracking and alerting you if you've come in contact with someone who has it.
*  I don't think about that. I don't trust anyone to have all that data and only use it for that.
*  Right. There's no way that data would be so valuable. If everyone had a chip, and everyone
*  was tracked, you knew where everyone was all throughout the day. Oh, you're only going to
*  use that to see who's got Coronavirus? Really? Yeah, the fuck out of here. Once that technology
*  exists, it's not like they're going to murder it at the end of the fucking season. Well, we've got
*  no more COVID. So let's just stop all this technology. No chance. They'll find a new reason
*  to use it. Okay, they'll be able to track the flu. They'll be able to track adulterers. They'll be
*  able to track robbers. They'll be able to track carjackers. They'll be able to track you name it,
*  man. You name it. These are the right wing activists that like to yell at abortion clinics.
*  Let's track them. Right. You know, now, now Republican gets in office. Hey, this is these
*  are the people that are the fucking animal rights activists. They always get in front of the meat
*  plant. Let's track them. Right. Like you can't track people. Okay. And they're already doing it
*  anyway. You talk to Snowden, they're already tracking you by your goddamn phone. But I like
*  the fact that I could take this phone and chuck it in the fucking river. I could just chuck it.
*  I wouldn't throw it in the ocean. No, I wouldn't even do that. I'm environmentally conscious.
*  I wouldn't. I wouldn't. But I wouldn't. I'm not a I really feel strongly about that. I would never
*  do it like that. But the point is I can get rid of that fucking phone. It's not a part of my body.
*  Once they're injecting, I've talked about this way too many podcasts in a row, but there's a company
*  that had these people inject a microchip in their arm and they could wave it in front of the soda
*  machine and get fucking snacks with it and shit. It was like your your tab was on your arm. You
*  Mike's here, open the door and unlocks the door. Get the fuck out of here. And we were saying like,
*  what if that company fires you? What if Chipotle fires you? You got that Chipotle chip in your arm.
*  But I was management. It's not a regular Chipotle chip. Imagine, imagine. And now you have to work
*  for fucking 7up and 7up's like, we're gonna have to cut your arm off. Yeah, because he keeps
*  registering that you're a Chipotle invader. You know, you 10 chips in your arm because you worked
*  at right. Just kept getting a new job. You get new chips. Mike, why don't you get those chips removed?
*  I like them. They remind me you've had a hard life and a lot of good jobs. Oh, chips all around his
*  arm. Proud of my chips. I've told you I've always been always been a hard worker. Oh, I earned these
*  chips. I earned all these chips. Every single one of these chips means, you know, also when
*  you combine those chips with augmented reality so that you could have a visual floating around them
*  is like the mascot of the various companies they work for. Or like, you know, like, let's say we do
*  get the chip, right? The chip exists. And we all just somehow decide like, yeah, let's just do it.
*  I mean, fuck the whole book of revelations. That's just the whole bullshit. The whole Mark of the
*  Beast. I'm not gonna pay any attention. Let's get the chip. That was just some old ancient bullshit.
*  All right, come on. I want to I want to get sodas without having to pull out my fucking wallet.
*  It sucks. I'm sick of it. I'm exhausted all day from this activity. But we all get the chips.
*  And then what happens is you can of course, it would start off with like a decision to make like
*  what what data in the chip do you want people to be able to see with augmented reality? And so like,
*  this is where you run into what I think the future is going to look like with this shit is it's like
*  when you're walking around in your company and you're employee of the month, and everybody's
*  wearing augmented reality goggles, you're going to have some kind of employee of the month halo
*  around you. So everybody's aware that you made the most sales, you know? Yeah, it's gonna be like
*  that. Yeah, it's in and it's gonna be like that for like, you know, it's gonna be brutal as far as
*  let's say credit scores go right? Because if you've got a great credit score, and you want to
*  indicate to the world that if you want to get into debt, you can baby, because you've got a great
*  credit score, you're gonna have this glowing shit around you. Me and like, and in the moment one
*  person decides to reveal that everybody's gonna feel like they have to reveal it. And if you see
*  someone who doesn't have like the good credit score crown or whatever, like the banner of great
*  credit floating in front of them, you're like, yeah, you're probably fucked, right? Like you made some
*  bad decisions. You'll see someone who's got a lot of shit, nice car, really nice clothes, but you'll
*  be like, yeah, but you know, he doesn't he doesn't have the glowing medallion of good credit on his AR
*  self. So I don't know if he really owns any of that stuff, you know? And then and you know,
*  I mean, then it's gonna like there's gonna be all forms of that, which leads to like, you know,
*  like venereal disease, like you could go into a bar, and if you just got tested, and you're clean,
*  so to speak, then maybe there's like a little AR, like, clean angel that like flies around your
*  head, like he doesn't have herpes. We can bear back. And like, you know what I mean? Like that kind,
*  those bits of data that that that if you don't show them, there's some reason to be suspicious.
*  Yeah, you know what I mean? Oh, yeah, you walk up to someone, they have no data. They're just blank,
*  you'd be terrified. Yeah, you're just a person who are supposed to trust you. Yeah, you could be a
*  serial killer. Fuck that. We're gonna look back on times when we just would meet people like this,
*  and not have some halo to go by. Yeah, like if I see Jamie, Jamie have like a nice golden glow.
*  I'd be like, Look at him. He's got a high approval rating. Yeah, got some cash. Yeah, that's a good
*  catch. Yeah, there you go. If you go to a nightclub, all the dudes who are glowing gold. Yeah,
*  people be like, Oh, and girls with like purple credit scores, they come in trying to get close
*  to the guys and the gold. Try to get a little that gold. Clean up that credit. Yeah. Yeah, man.
*  Imagine if you knew, like if a girl was really happy, look at her credit card. Oh my god,
*  bank fraud. Look at her. She's a bank fraud. Yeah, like that. You don't get that gray outline
*  unless you do bank fraud. That's right. Yeah. And there's no way to get it off. It's like,
*  imagine. Yeah, that and that, you know, there's going to be big arguments about that where it's
*  like, you know, currently, if you're a registered sex offender, we know where you fucking live. And
*  I get it, man. Like, that's good. That's good. But then it's going to be like, Okay, but do we put
*  that in their augmented reality chip profile so that when anywhere they go, people are seeing
*  that this is a person that hurts kids, you know, and there's going to be a conversation about that.
*  We're feeling like, Fuck, yeah, that's what you do. Like, I want to know if some like weirdo is
*  like getting anywhere close to my kid. Right? Fuck. Yeah, you let it in anyway. That's the slippery
*  slope that leads to the dystopian, like, you know, black mirror future and that great episode where
*  like, there was like, you know, and I think they are doing it in China. They're doing it in China.
*  Yeah, they have a legit social score in China. This is a real concern if this technology does
*  get released in time, and people start using their COVID tests and putting it on their QR code,
*  that little thing that you do with the photo and scans you like a plane ticket. Yeah, like,
*  Oh, you're good, Duncan. Seems like you're good. Make sure you keep that phone on you everywhere
*  you go. No problem, officer. You know, Duncan, we got a email the other day. It shows that you
*  have been going, I don't know who has this data, but you've been going down to San Clemente during
*  the lockdown. Yeah, to stay with friends. No, there's a glory hole there that I like. This is
*  not allowed. What you're traveling, like, see, see, look at what if we do this? What if we go
*  into this scanning thing, and then a new pandemic pops up and we go into lockdown again, they're
*  going to be able to find the people that aren't locking down. What if you got to drive somewhere
*  in the middle of the night to go get something, something important for your family? Yeah, well,
*  also, you're being tracked, and then they call you, Duncan, where are you going? Yeah, we are
*  looking at you right now. You're in San Clemente. You don't live in San Clemente. Why are you down
*  there? Yeah. But I, you know, I've just freedom. I want to drive around. I don't know. This is a
*  lockdown. Yeah. There's a new flu. Go back home, Duncan. You want to kill people? It's a weird,
*  it's a weird power to give people the power to have a mayor tell you what you can do.
*  That's never happened before. I'm not saying they're doing it because of that. I know why
*  they're doing it. They're doing it to save lives. I'm 100% for it. I'm not, don't get me wrong here.
*  But still, that power that anybody has to say, you can't work, you got to stay home,
*  you can't go to the park, you can't go to the beach. That power is weird. That's a lot of power, man.
*  Yeah. You know, to be the person. Gavin, may we open? Not yet. Yeah. Yeah. Not yet. But what if
*  they social distance? I mean, they need to make money. Yeah. We need to save lives. Yeah. It sucks.
*  Yeah. This is no good answer. It's a shit job, man. It's like the shittiest. That's the shittiest job
*  because it's like you, you, you, no decision you make is going to make everybody happy. Any decision
*  you make is going to ruin someone's life, maybe kill them. And so yeah, all these people. Also,
*  no one thought that was going to be a part of the job. Right. Yeah. You didn't think that you thought
*  you were going to deal with like, yeah, Gavin wasn't like, he didn't know that when he like got in
*  there, he was suddenly going to be like potentially like one of the war leaders in Mad Max. He didn't
*  understand that was going to be his world. Dude, this is how poorly they thought this through.
*  Garcetti is giving people money to snitch. They're giving people money to snitch on social distance
*  violators. What? Yeah. So if you go over your buddy Mike's house for a barbecue, there's eight
*  people in that backyard. Helen, look, that's fucked up. Eight fucking people. We're over here
*  social distancing that cunt Duncan Trussell. He's over at Mike's house barbecuing, drinking beers,
*  probably wife swapping pigs. Wife swapping. Garcetti comes along and offers people money to rat you out.
*  How much they get? It can't be real. I saw that. It was real. They're offering people rewards
*  to rat out social distance violators. Disgusting. I mean, how you don't know that leads to Maoist
*  China and fucking Stalinist Russia. How you don't know that getting people to rat on people leads
*  to North Korea. I'm not saying we're going to be in North Korea, but that kind of shit, that's where
*  that comes from. It's how it starts. You can't pay people to rat people out. You fucking asshole.
*  What a shitty, poorly thought out idea that is. No shit, man. I saw something popped up on my
*  Instagram. Some company saying if you're aware that your bosses are violating software, don't
*  have licensed software, we'll give you a reward. Inviting people, disgruntled employees who know
*  that their boss is running stolen Photoshop or whatever to make a little money and fuck their
*  boss over. That invitation to snitch, that is a satanic invitation, man. I don't care what level
*  it's at in general, unless you're looking at hardcore Snowden level whistleblower. You've been
*  down in the deep underground military bases and you saw the fucking thing in the egg that could
*  read your mind and you're like, I can't keep it to myself. I'm going to fucking tell people.
*  I get that, but the other versions of it, yeah, fuck that. Don't invite us to snitch. Don't
*  encourage that behavior. There's better ways to do it, I'm sure, than bounties on your fucking
*  neighbors. That's fucked up, man. So fucked up. It's just so fucked up that someone who would get
*  as high as mayor of Los Angeles would let an idea like that slip through the cracks.
*  Well, like what fucking fascist do you have working in that office that like, I got an idea.
*  Pay people to rat people out. Yeah. These fucks, they haven't been working. Yeah. They need money
*  for masks. Yeah, that's it. He did say snitches get rewards, but he said it's the opposite of
*  snitches get stitches. I can't find anything. Oh no, they'll definitely get stitches. I can't
*  find anything saying like they get 50 bucks, a hundred bucks. This is the reward you get. He
*  might be like the opposite of snitches get stitches as if they're not still snitches and as if snitches
*  don't still get stitches. Right. What are you talking about? You're going to absolutely
*  make sure that these people don't get beat up for being snitches. You're going to step in with cops,
*  give them 24 hour security guards. If you find out that your neighbor ratted you out for money,
*  you'd want to kill him. It would be like, what happened to that dude? What's his face? Ron Paul's
*  kid. You know what I'm talking about? No. The, the congressman who got tackled. Oh, that's right.
*  Rand Paul. Yeah. Rand Paul, his, his neighbor was like, fuck you. Yeah. Just out of nowhere tackles
*  him, smashes his ribs. He lost a piece of his lung. Yeah, man. That's fucked up. And it's like,
*  because you're what you're asking for there, which is another thing that I think the state,
*  anytime anyone starts doing this, then you really have to start thinking about who you voted for.
*  But like, because the idea is like, I love it when, you know, and I'm cheesy and I am a fucking
*  hippie and I get accused of stoner talking shit, but yeah, I want there to be world peace. And I
*  want people to love each other. And when I see, you know, any even the slightest thing that like
*  transcends political divides where like, you know, people who've hated fucking Trump and
*  people Trump have hated, I saw something where like, I can't remember who it was.
*  Like, God, what's the name of the Mormon politician that was running for president against
*  Trump? Mitt Romney. Romney. Yeah. So some dude, like voted against releasing money to people
*  who don't have jobs. And Mitt Romney tweeted, well, that senator, whoever he was tested
*  positive for being an asshole. And Romney said that. And fucking, you know, and then like,
*  there was this just flickering moment where Trump retweets that or says something about it and says,
*  like, I didn't know he had that sense of humor, but I liked it. And like, for that one stupid
*  moment, there's a second where it's like, that's, we're supposed to be on the same team. Right. And
*  like, you know, that's not a political statement. That's like a statement of survivability. And when
*  you have a fucking, when you have a, and again, I'm not saying bow down to the state or anything
*  like that either. That's the opposite of what I'm saying. I'm not saying therefore we all got to be
*  on the side of the president. None of that shit. I'm not saying any of that shit, man. So don't
*  take this the wrong way because that's not what I'm saying. I get it. What I'm saying is when
*  anything that divides one neighbor from the next, anything that invites neighbors to divide
*  instead of unite is cancerous literally for society in the sense that what's going to start
*  happening is that the, the, the, the, the pixel of society is that the neighbors, that's like the
*  connection between your neighbors makes up the tapestry of the entire country. And that connection,
*  if it's broken or weird or fucked up, then that's, that's fucking everything up. And so to invite
*  anything that fucks that up is to me really, really long-term disastrous. It's like the idea
*  would be like, Hey, does your name, is your neighbor an old person? Go find out if your
*  neighbor is an old person and can't get food. And if they are, and you get food to them, we'll pay
*  for it. How about that? That's beautiful. Like, you, you know, someone who's like fucked up right now,
*  let us know so we can make sure they're not, their kids aren't starving. Are there any,
*  do you know it? Like, man, what about the fucking kids whose parents are right now,
*  super fucking sick with this shit? Like why we need governors and we need people saying like,
*  you need to know where the kids are in the building. So that in whose parents are sick,
*  so we can make sure those kids are getting taken care of while their parents are all in bed and
*  shit. Like, so fuck that. That is what people get rewards for that. Why don't we have a way
*  of monetizing kindness in acts of like grace to your neighbors instead of monetizing like
*  you becoming like literally what is one a universally derided thing, which is a snitch.
*  You don't want to be a snitch. Fuck snitches get stitches. No, maybe they don't get stitches. But
*  man, I'll tell you when you die, wouldn't want to be you wouldn't want to be a snitch in the
*  afterlife. I'll tell you that man, you get devoured by spirit wolves. Like I bet just
*  spirit wolves. I'm sure you don't get the like experience of like, you know, going through the
*  bar seeing your mom come running to you like a bowl of soup. It's your mom, she comes running to
*  you and you think it's a bowl of soup, but you look in it. It's your wife's head. And then you
*  look back up. It's a spirit wolf. It's like, so you thought was smart to snitch in that dimension,
*  huh? No, no, it's your soul forever. Yeah, maybe. Just don't snitch. That's fucked up.
*  Well, it's just ridiculous that someone in a position of real leadership, right? You're the
*  mayor of a huge city. And you would think that that would be a good idea. Listen, people are
*  going to snitch on people anyway. Yeah, to encourage them with financial reward is crazy.
*  It is crazy. And it's so poorly thought out. Yeah, that's a dumb idea to put out there.
*  Such a poor understanding of human nature. Yeah, like you don't know where this goes.
*  Yeah, like and it also in a time of great duress, you're encouraging people to snitch. Yeah, this is
*  absolutely the time we've got to be encouraging camaraderie. Yeah, this is when things are weird.
*  Everybody's forced into the same position. No one can do what they want. When was the last time
*  you were on stage? I haven't been on stage in a month. I've been doing private shows for my son.
*  We literally our job has stopped in our job might not come back until January. Yeah, that's right.
*  Maybe. Who knows? Who knows? We don't know. I've got some gigs booked and I don't know if I'm
*  going to be able to do them. I got a gig booked in September. I got two in September. Yeah,
*  a couple in October. I got October's, but it's like also it's not like you should be like you
*  can't really promote the show right now. That's seeming like a blazing dick. I don't want to
*  encourage people to go out and it's like, yeah, that's the problem, man is we, you know, we're,
*  but here's the thing. This whatever the state is doing, the state's going to do. This is my
*  favorite Jesus saying offer unto Caesar. What is Caesar's? Which is like, you know, there's a game
*  going on here with power. And if you think you're going to subvert that game, maybe probably not.
*  Best thing to do, let the dragon do whatever the fuck the dragon's going to do, but don't let them
*  cause you to forget that you don't need the state to like go over to like leave a note on your
*  neighbor's door asking if they're okay. Right. You know what I mean? You don't need, we don't need
*  the mechanisms of some bureaucracy to do good, like to pick up trash. Right. You know, like that
*  was the thing that happened when the fucking national parks all got defunded because of this
*  bullshit. All of a sudden, like there's people are taking pictures of garbage or in the national parks.
*  Right. And the implication of that is like, we can't clean this up ourselves. We need a state
*  official to come and pick the trash up. And it's like, it's nice that they do that and we pay taxes
*  for that and they should do that. But if they're not doing it and we're waiting for some hero from
*  the state to come in and fix our fucking problems, that's lazy. That's bad thinking. It's like,
*  I think as a people, the idea is more to like, uh, transcend that addiction to being saved,
*  that addiction that for sure someone's coming. Sometimes they come, but sometimes they don't.
*  And that's no reason to like put off just the basic shit, man. Like, you know, we, I, we put out
*  sometimes in front of our house, we'll just put out shit to give to people. You know,
*  we've got fruit trees, there's fruit, you know, there's like the garden's got like some shit
*  growing in it. I'll put it out there, you know, and, and people take every bit of it. You come
*  back at the end of the day, it's, you know, we've got flowers. So cut some flowers and just leave
*  flowers out there in case someone wants to bring a flower to somebody. It's an act of trust because
*  you don't know what I might be covered in like COVID mucus doing like Rose for my neighbors.
*  But that being said, I don't know, maybe they're desanitizing. But my point is like cool shit
*  happens. Sometimes you go out to that box and like they've replaced something. Like we gave flowers
*  away, we came out and then someone had put different kinds of flowers in the box for those
*  flowers. You know what I mean? Sounds like you got a stalker. Yeah, actually now I think about it,
*  the flowers, you know, it did seem like there was some something like sticky and creamy on the
*  flowers. But you know, I'm saying like, again, this, this to me, this, the not getting too much
*  in the macro, because I'll go insane if I get in the macro, getting into the micro, which is your
*  direct, literally your direct neighbors, and like making some connection with them. You know, like
*  my the guy who lives across the street, we talked for like two minutes, it was wonderful. And he's
*  like, if you need tools, just let me know. I got a ton of tools. Just you can like, you know,
*  message me, and I'll come and leave them here and you can come and get them. Shit like that. That's
*  nice. It's cool. And it's like, it's just beautiful. It's like, that's what it's supposed to be like.
*  Yeah, that's nice. You got a good neighbor. That's it. Yeah, that's good neighbors is everything.
*  Everything that hate their neighbors like, man, you should just move, save yourself some agony.
*  Yeah, well, you can't sometimes. That's the problem. We all need, we talked about this before.
*  We need to find a cul de sac and all buy houses there. You mean the cult? Yes. I know. What do
*  you think a ranch would do the trick? It's tough to get people to live on a ranch. No, I think the
*  way you're talking about, I know you're talking. Yeah, it's not that hard. Like, you know, I think
*  the way you do it is in phases, right? So like the first thing would be just get the land, right?
*  Right. And then hire an architect. Yeah, hire an architect. And then like, you know, bring in Alex
*  Cray. That thing that he did in upstate New York. Beautiful. Have you been there personally? I've
*  been there and I haven't, unfortunately, I haven't been there since it's it's complete. I don't know
*  if it's completed, but I've been there in the early phases. And yeah, that for sure is a temple.
*  Like, it's no joke. It's not like they're just saying it's a temple. That's a real. And the way
*  he printed those weird faces, those multi feature faces and use them in the corners of the building.
*  What does he call it again? I can't remember. I'm sorry. Cozum. Cozum. I thought you meant what he
*  called those faces. He has a name for the faces too. Is that the chapel of sacred mirrors? Is that
*  what it sounds for? But isn't that Cozum is was used to be what he called the place in New York
*  City, right? He had the place in Manhattan. Yeah, they had this. I think they still well, they still
*  do have a beautiful place in New York, actually, or like an artist loft there, I believe. But like,
*  they ended up realizing it was time to like, spread their wings, build a temple. Yeah. And then really
*  go somewhere in nature. Yeah. They're in like a small New York town, right? Yeah, that's right.
*  New York state town. Yeah. It's a beautiful place. And they're a legit religion. Entheon, that's right.
*  And they're an actual religion, which they are. They are an actual religion. Yeah, it is a religion.
*  And by the way, a religion doesn't want anything from you. Like they're not trying to get 10% of
*  your money, then they're not giving you a bunch of rules to follow. Nope. They want you to worship
*  love and creativity. It's a really interesting place. Is that? Oh, that's just an image of what
*  it's going to look like. I don't think it's really quite there yet. But holy shit. Yeah, man. Imagine
*  coming up to that, like walking up to their front door, and you're like, Oh my God, what the hell
*  am I looking at? Dude, when I was on tour, they let me park my tour bus there, because we needed
*  a place to sleep for the night. So I had to sleep in front of that thing in my tour bus. And I hadn't
*  even gotten to that phase, but I had crazy dreams. Just sleeping there. Yeah, it was wild, man.
*  That's probably like one of those if you build it, they will come things like do you imagine how
*  hard you would trip inside that place? Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah, no, I don't think it's I
*  don't think it's a like, you could do DMT in a shitty apartment and still have some crazy
*  mind blowing trip. But you can't tell me that coming to this place and going through this
*  Entheon portal. Yeah, this isn't gonna have some fucking crazy effect on the way you trip. Yeah.
*  Oh my God. But that you know, that was the idea of a temple. I mean, the idea is not I'm not just
*  saying to trip or whatever. But the concept is like, you know, let's acknowledge the fact that
*  maybe our ideas aren't necessarily coming from inside our brains. Let's just as a fantasy imagine
*  that there is a divine intelligence that as one of the many beautiful things it pushes into this
*  particular realm is art. And that if we can figure out a way to purify the connection with that thing,
*  then we become receivers for that. And by doing that, we allow that thing to begin to exist in
*  this world. And a temple was a place that allowed that connection to be refined, purified,
*  intentionalized. And in that there's a solidification called inspiration or art or
*  whatever the name is you want to give it. But it's really it's like output from a place that
*  maybe is, you know, a few floors up from the one we're at. It's having a pretty wonderful party
*  right now. And like part of what we do is like allow it to drip into this realm, which is
*  potentially denser realm. We're in the realm of matter. It's dense, you know, and like ideas,
*  if you look at your ideas, they're, they're light. They're like, they're, they're, they're,
*  they don't have at least my ideas, like, they're, they're not like heavy, they're,
*  inspiration feels like barely anything. In fact, it's so barely anything. Think how easy it is to
*  miss a good idea, how easy it is to think something cool, that maybe you want to write down for a joke.
*  And you're just, I'll write that down later. And then it's gone. It's light. It's light. And so in
*  part of what they're, I think, are all about, or I mean, again, that's me putting it on them. They
*  have a wonderful description on their website about what they're all about. But to me, part of
*  what creation is, is taking those things, allowing them to come through you, and then allowing this
*  realm to do what it does, which is to crystallize them in a denser form that other people can enjoy.
*  And, you know, that, that enjoyment is, you know, that's enough. It doesn't have to be some lofty
*  ass shit. It's just like, people get a little like, this tiny little smell of heaven, like a better
*  place, a lighter place, a place that isn't encumbered by so much bullshit is this particular realm.
*  That can like completely take someone out of a depression, man. That can completely
*  give somebody the, you know, juice they need to like, get back out there and like open up
*  themselves to the world and not be shut down. Just one little like tiny, tiny minuscule reminder of
*  like, don't worry. There's, this isn't the only place. There's simultaneously amazing things
*  happening, which you're part of. You just don't realize it yet. And don't worry. You know,
*  McKenna, he said in one of his essays, that's what he'd say on mushrooms is he would get this message,
*  don't worry, we're coming. Don't worry, we're coming. And you know what I mean? But I think
*  that's what art does is it gives you this sense of like, don't worry. Right now, we're just building
*  the runway. Don't worry. It's coming. I know this place seems fucked up. It's a little dense right
*  now. We're going to lighten it up. And then that, that much of that is your own imagination, though.
*  Like how much of your own imagination stimulates your trips? You know, I mean, we want to assume
*  that we're really interacting with something right on the other side. But why do we assume
*  that that's something obviously it's not static. One of the things about tryptamine experiences is
*  that things twist and change and morph and shift and never they never stay any one thing for any
*  length of time. They're always becoming other things and moving in and out of things. Like,
*  maybe that's just what happens over there. Maybe this things are constantly shifting and changing.
*  You know, maybe what we're doing is we're trying to apply when we think of how we are here in this,
*  this life, we're trying to apply those laws to whatever we experience when we when we do that.
*  But it seems so alien. When you have those experiences, it seems so alien. You're not
*  going to be able to bring any of that back. You can give someone like little glimpses.
*  And what Alex has done the best is capture like, Oh, I know what he's doing. Like those faces,
*  those like almost Egyptian looking golden faces are moving and apart from each other. Like,
*  you go, Oh, yeah, I've seen something. Yeah, something sort of. Yeah, there's a tryptamine
*  part to that. Yeah, but that whatever that would it be in that dimension, it would change and
*  become something else and instantaneously and then become something else. And then and a lot of it
*  has to do with how you're thinking, which is weird. It's like, are is the way you're thinking
*  actually affecting those things? Or is the way you're thinking affecting your perception
*  of whatever this energy is and how it manifests itself visually? Well, I mean, this is that right,
*  even in what you're saying, there's this assumption that that your thinking is separate from the thing.
*  Right, right, right. And so, so we have a thought, and we're thinking to ourselves,
*  Oh, I just got a good idea. We don't know that if we had a different way of quantifying time and
*  space, we might have just seen some ethereal mist drift through us that produced a thing we
*  called a thought that we thought must be us. So you look at a thing in that realm, and it's shifting
*  and converting. And you notice that that conversion seems to be happening in relation to like how
*  you're feeling. And you know, now you're in a chicken or the egg conversation, which is like,
*  who's, you know, who's reflecting who here? Like, who, which of us is like real, and which of us
*  isn't? Or are we just kind of there? Am I just seeing who I actually am? But because I live in
*  a world of individuality, and I live in a world where there's a separate quality to things, I
*  have to see you as separate. Because if I don't, I can't see you. And all I can do, you know,
*  I'm seeing myself in you, which is, I think, what is happening in this realm anyway, is like
*  when anything you're looking at right now is some phenomena being painted instantaneously
*  by your imagination. That's what the imagination is doing. It's painting colors onto the universe of
*  infinite phenomena that your brain is like doing out of habit. So that's that, you know,
*  anyone you're around, you make an instantaneous assessment of that person. Or you begin to like
*  realize like, wait, I got a bad vibe about that person. I bet something's off with them. And then
*  you go into like, you're a TV psychic bullshit. Like, oh, yeah, really? Oh, really? Is that your
*  was that the instincts you learned? Where'd you learn that World Warcraft? Yeah, you don't know.
*  But I've done that. By the way, I'm talking about myself. I'm like, yeah, I just can tell if a person
*  is honest or it's like, no, I can definitely tell if a person's really fucking weird, though.
*  That's for sure. You can tell if a person's off, like they're not really connecting with you,
*  or they're pretending to connect with you. And you're like, well, I got a weird vibe from this.
*  Yeah, that if you looked at what he said on paper, what you said on paper would be totally normal.
*  That's true. There's sometimes there's a certain things of a violation of space. There's a weirdness
*  to the way they look at you. A cadence. Yeah. They're like, oh, you're off. I hate that feeling,
*  man. That's a deeper thing. When the alarm bells go off like that, your hair starts standing up.
*  You're like, gotta go. I fucking hate that. That's scary. But, you know, I'm just saying,
*  sometimes you're not right. And this is like, why you need empiricism in science, because
*  sometimes you're not right. Like, just because you think that's how shit is from some instinct
*  inside of you doesn't mean that's how things is your bias. And so that that's the projection.
*  That's like the that's the part of you that you're like, you're still dealing with some trauma when
*  you're a kid. And you're seeing that trauma in all the things around you. And so you're like in an
*  argument with someone who hurt you 20 years ago, when you're talking to somebody who vaguely reminds
*  you of that person. And if you're like, you're still having the argument. And if you're not aware
*  that you're still having that argument, then you can start saying shit like, why do I always end up
*  with the same person? It's like, I always draw this kind of person to me. And it's like, well,
*  maybe you're drawing the exact same kind of person to you. Or maybe you're running the same movie
*  on a different screen. And being like, I've seen this before. I keep seeing this movie. You know,
*  it's like, that's the same movie. It's like, you're seeing the same thing you're projecting. It's
*  just it looks like it now it's not Tom, it's Alex, or now it's not Lisa, you're looking at Samantha,
*  but you're still seeing this thing. And that that's the projection. So anyway, that's the
*  imagination. And the question is, how powerful is that projection? Because sometimes you start
*  projecting onto someone how you think they are. And if that person's weak or insecure, they'll
*  start acting the way you think they are. Now you've your projection has sprung to life in front of you,
*  because the person you've essentially animated a person with your expectation of them. And then
*  that person is acting the way you thought they would act because they don't know the fuck they
*  are. You're making monsters with your imagination. That's what cult leaders do. Right? That's how you
*  start a sex cult. Wow. Same way. You got to take these people and like, put it in their head that
*  this is what they do. Oh, right. You put it in their head. Right. Yeah, that's right. You say you see it.
*  Yeah, I see it in you. Well, in this book, I told you about this book, Chaos, Tom O'Neill's book on
*  Manson and the CIA. Yeah, I saw your tweet about it. Oh, my God, dude. What is Oh, my God, it was
*  tied up with the CIA. Oh, my God, almost definitely a part of these fucking psychedelics. LSD
*  experiments that they were doing on hippies almost definitely experimented on him probably in prison,
*  but almost definitely allowed him to get out of when he violated his parole, let him loose,
*  let him free, supply him with acid, monitor him. They were monitoring him every step of the way.
*  They like fed that monster. They knew that this guy had been incarcerated half his life. He was
*  a con man and they taught him how to be a cult leader. They taught him how to be a cult leader
*  and they probably talked him into or taught him how to talk people into killing people and to do
*  so with acid and they would dose him up and he would make people do all kinds of shit. Like it
*  would take people like, okay, you're going to fuck her and he's going to fuck him and they would put
*  together these orgies. He would put together orgies. I mean, he was sodomized in front of them,
*  like horrific shit. Yeah. Yeah. He was like some boy that was like 15 years old. He did crazy,
*  crazy shit. They were all on acid. They all committed murder. He directed them to commit
*  murder, but all of this very connected to the CIA's MK Ultra project. All of it. Yeah, man.
*  Very connected to multiple different ways, connected to LSD and hippies, LSD and mind control,
*  LSD trying to come up with a Manchurian candidate, trying to get someone to commit murder and not
*  even realize they did it. Also connected to Lee Harvey Oswald because Jack Ruby was all fucked
*  up on that program when he killed Lee Harvey Oswald and afterwards went completely insane,
*  was seen by the very same doctor that was running the clinic where Manson used to go. This guy was
*  a CIA doctor, was a psychologist or a psychiatrist dosing people up with LSD,
*  running studies on prisoners, getting students to run studies, getting scientists to run studies,
*  not even knowing they were doing it through the CIA. Kaczynski too. Don't forget. Oh yeah,
*  Kaczynski. How about Operation Midnight Climax ran brothels in San Francisco and a couple other
*  places where they dosed people up with acid and watched them fuck. How dare they name it that?
*  I know Midnight Climax. That's so dumb. It sounds like, you know what it sounds like? That sounds
*  like the name of like porn in a hotel that you could watch. Yes, like a secret agent that sucks
*  everyone's dick. Midnight Climax. Whoever named that, that really tells you a lot about the program.
*  But like, you know, man, here's a controversial fucking thing to say, which someone reminded me
*  of a while ago, which really freaked me out kind of, which is like, back then,
*  when like they're what like right now we know a little bit more about some of the shit the CIA did,
*  a lot of it because they put it on their website. Yes. Which is so crazy to me.
*  They just put it up on their website, which is crazy. And it, but back then- What stuff did they
*  put up on their website? Dude, are you fucking kidding? Like all this shit about the remote
*  viewing experiments they did? Like it's, they just- I interviewed that main guy that they had
*  for remote viewing. What's that fucking famous guy?
*  There's one famous guy that I interviewed. He's like famous in the remote viewing world.
*  I know you're talking, the guy who wrote the movie or didn't write it, but the documentary
*  Man Who Stares At Goats. Was he the guy who talked about a kill shot or that's what the name for
*  the thing that happens when the sun fucks up? It didn't fuck up. I mean, you might've said the sun
*  fucked up, but for us it fucked up. Does like a, not a supernova, but just does a big ass flare
*  that like kind of like melts whatever side of the earth happens to be facing it. You know,
*  that's like the kill shot that a lot of these remote viewers were apparently saying that they
*  were seeing because they were realizing that they could actually, they weren't sort of bound by time
*  and these visions and they all started sharing this vision of this thing. It's really a creepy,
*  creepy documentary out there, man. But that's a hundred percent on the table, like some giant
*  solar flare, some solar incident. That's a hundred percent on the table. Have we, by the way, I'm
*  sorry if we talked about this the last episode, have we talked about the CIA's website yet?
*  What about their website? Have you ever gone to it? No. Jamie, would you mind pulling that up?
*  I've applied for a job. You applied for a job with the CIA? Well, I was stoned and it was late at
*  night and I'm like, wait, you can apply online? Check it out. Whoa, whoa, whoa, ask Molly. There's
*  a cartoon. Yeah. Hold on back up. This is the CIA's website. Ask Molly, your CIA source on the inside
*  and it's hashtag ask Molly Hale and Molly Hale is like a hot agent. This week's ask Molly Hale
*  question comes from a writer who wants to know if there's a path forward for them at CIA since
*  they have done illegal drugs in the past. They took my question. That's your question. No, I'm just
*  kidding. It seems like it's your question. Since they have done illegal drugs in the past. Let's
*  see what Molly's answer is. Let's see Molly's answer. So it says, find Molly's answer. What
*  does Molly say? Let me be clear on this from the get-go. Having previously used illegal drugs
*  does not immediately disqualify you from working at CIA. If working for CIA is your life's goal,
*  and we certainly hope it is, there could be a path for you here. With that said, there are certain
*  restrictions you should be aware of, especially if you've used illegal drugs within the past year.
*  Generally speaking, to be eligible for CIA employment, applicants must not have used
*  illegal drugs within the past 12 months. This is, as with most things, a general rule by which to
*  gauge your higher ability. That's not a word, kids. Not only an applicant, but as the potential
*  holder of a security clearance. It might seem a bit archaic, but consider the access to information
*  we're giving at CIA employees and consequences of granting access to the wrong person. How much
*  access to information? Just read that real quick. It might seem a bit archaic, but consider the
*  access to information we're giving at CIA employees. What access are you giving them?
*  You're in a simulator. That's probably the first thing they say after you get hired. They're like,
*  it's a simulator. We're just doing what the programmer wants. It's like, I know you're going
*  to freak out for two months. We're going to give you a protocol of antidepressants because
*  you can go nihilistic or absurdist when you realize you're just a string of code that's running.
*  But you'll get over it and then there's an egg. The thing reads your mind. It's kind of cool.
*  We'll show you that later. Officers regularly handle classified information, which if leaked,
*  could spell disaster for national security and endanger the life of CIA officers. This is my
*  favorite word. Assets and their family. Assets is one of my favorite words they use. We have an asset
*  in Jerusalem. An asset. You got an asset. Is it a person? You know a guy? Yeah, he's an asset.
*  He's an asset. He's like a number. What's an asset? An asset is like stocks. You got an asset?
*  You got a stock. I got stock in Palestinians. I got some Palestinians. I've saved up. Yeah.
*  I've got some assets. Just some people you connected with. I connect with them. They're my assets.
*  Now you may be wondering, that's all fine, Molly, but I live in a state where marijuana use was
*  legalized under state law. So why would any of this really apply in my case? The short answer is,
*  or would any of this really apply in my case? The short answer is, yes, marijuana remains
*  illegal under federal law in every state. The CIA is bound by federal law, which prohibits CIA from
*  granting security clearances to unlawful users of controlled substances, including marijuana.
*  State laws do not supersede those of the federal government. The great lord who looks over the
*  land with an iron fist. For more information regarding the federal government security
*  clearance guidelines regarding drug use and other considerations, you can check out the
*  What if the next line was like, hey, what's up, Joe? That's cool. You're showing this on your
*  podcast. No, no, no. It's a simulation. But I do think like in there is they're also kind of saying
*  that being said, if you can set shit on fire with your mind or something, when you're stoned,
*  come talk to us. It's like, you know what I mean? They are saying like, the other cool thing when
*  you look at him applying for a job is it says, after you apply, don't tell anybody you apply for
*  the job will like approach you regarding the job, which is so fucking cool. You can't talk about it
*  when you apply. Meanwhile, they're absolutely checking your phone. They're checking your I
*  applied and like I just leaned into the fact that like, fuck it, they're gonna look at everything I
*  do. And then also like imagining that at some point, some CIA agent might come up to me like,
*  Hey, what's up, man? Hey, what's going on? Did you really want to be a bookkeeper at the Pentagon?
*  No, I wanted to meet a CIA agent, dude. Hello. Because I mean, you know, wouldn't you? Wouldn't
*  you like to meet? I know one, you know, a CIA agent, I've had him on the podcast multiple times,
*  Mike Baker, he does a lot of consulting for TV shows and security stuff. So you're you you are
*  in it? And is he working for them now? No, well, how would you know? Yeah, he's a former CIA
*  operative. What does that mean? Do you really think they ever stopped talking to each other?
*  No, no. He does security clearance stuff and security stuff. He's got a whole has a security
*  company. Did he do so? So wait, so this guy, did you ask him about the Manson shit? No, I just
*  found out about this shit really recently. Fitzsimmons told me about this guy, Tom O'Neill was
*  his neighbor for like 20 years. He was neighbors with Greg and Greg, the whole time he was doing
*  this book while Greg was friends with him. Right. Took him 20 years to write this book started out
*  as an article for Premier magazine. And then as you started uncovering all these inconsistencies
*  with the trial, he realized that there was kind of a bullshit trial. And that the prosecuting attorney
*  like everybody had there was there was deals that everybody had made to have a specific
*  narrative go through. And Susan Atkins, one of the people from the Manson family was on trial, her
*  fucking defense attorney was like a former prosecuting attorney that had worked with
*  Vincent Bugliosi and all these other people before they were all buddies. And they signed him to her
*  to take over for her state appointed attorney. This guy took over and like just they just they
*  followed directions like everybody followed directions. And as he was going deeper and
*  deeper into the story, he realized like, there's a lot of crazy shit that was going on that first of
*  all, Manson for sure was let out of jail multiple times when he shouldn't have been when he was
*  violating parole. He was let out of jail repeatedly for crazy shit like theft and, you know, and they
*  they were monitoring these people, they knew where they were staying, they knew the ranch,
*  the spawn ranch where they were staying at. They never did anything. They let them they let them
*  go whenever they were in trouble. And most likely got him the fucking LSD. Have you looked at the
*  finders cult yet? What is that one? I don't even want I shouldn't even brought it up. I'm not even
*  doing a good job with this last description, because I didn't think I was going to talk about it.
*  But this thing blew my mind. Like you got to listen to this audio book, listen to the audio
*  book, or just even maybe just listen to some of the podcasts, you'll get sucked in. This guy was
*  obsessed with this for 20 years. It's all he thought of. It's all he did. It was his life's
*  work. Do you do you okay, you had the CIA agent you had on? He's cool, right? He seems like a good
*  guy. Is he your friend? I like the guy. So in you know what's so bizarre and like I don't even want
*  to say it. But I think it's like because you say it and then people see you say it and like see
*  you're all in the CIA. But something Rick, you know, I was bitching to Rick Doblin about on a podcast
*  and I was like doing this thing I used to do when I was younger, which is like trying to create a
*  all evil, all good binary regarding people who work like in the CIA or people who work in the
*  even the DEA or whatever that thing you do when you're like, when you're when you're being lazy
*  in your way of thinking, right? Being binary. And Doblin, one of the things he said to me that I've
*  always kept with me is he's like, there's, there's people like us, like all the way to the top,
*  you know, there's people who, like look at drug laws right now. And to people from the CIA,
*  listen to this podcast. Right? Yeah, I know. I know of that. Right. So it's like, I mean,
*  the eye. Yeah, that's what I'm saying, man is like, the thing that the thing that's somewhat
*  annoying in the sense that it requires nuance rather than like a heavy handed, they're all evil,
*  is some of the people in there are really like 100% trying to keep at least people here from
*  getting blown the fuck up. And that that and like they're not like, like, oh, God, like,
*  can we let's find another man's and now we got to, you know, exactly. But it can all you know,
*  I went and got this tour of actually JPL, the place Parsons was that man and like,
*  I think it was BP or Shell or some like oil company that I had like, just generally,
*  we all look at the oil companies and think they're out there. They're all the worst.
*  Well, you know, while you're driving in your car, you'll be like these fucking oil companies.
*  But like the they were working on some kind of new solar panel technology was like Shell or I
*  don't remember which fucking company was I remember saying to the guy like, this technology,
*  if it works, doesn't this destroy the oil industry? Like, don't they know they're working
*  on a technology that's going to make the thing they make money selling and buying irrelevant.
*  And he's like, Oh, no, these companies are so big that there's departments within departments
*  within departments. And that's where it gets fucking crazy about the CIA, which is like,
*  the people in the CIA don't know, obviously, all the people in the CIA.
*  Exactly. That's your security clearance. And the question is, how deep does that basement go,
*  man, under the CIA? But here's also the question. Yeah.
*  How are you going to find out what happens when people take LSD without giving people LSD and
*  studying them? Ready? Go. You're not. So if you're in 1953, okay, and you're finding out about LSD,
*  and people are taking LSD at parties and people are taking LSD at concerts, and you start
*  realizing the ramifications of a society in 1964, that's all taking LSD, you see this hippie movement,
*  you're going to run some studies. So then you're going to give people the ability to test people
*  without their knowledge. You don't know how crazy that guy is, what kind of a sociopath that guy is.
*  And he's going to run tests on people without their knowledge and give them LSD. And then there's
*  going to be people that say, Hey, you know, we want to infiltrate all these anti war groups,
*  we want to infiltrate the Black Panthers, we want to infiltrate these hippies. Yeah, how can we do
*  that? Well, here's how we do that. We take this guy, we got him in prison for half of his fucking
*  life in federal prison. So far, he's 32 years old. Yeah, let's dose this motherfucker up with LSD.
*  Let's run some studies on him. And let's tell him that he's a cult leader and get him to make
*  some apocalyptic fucking death cult that wants to kill people and write pig on the wall and
*  their blood. And so they let Manson they knew where he was, they knew he was getting acid,
*  they knew that he was probably having people kill people. Yeah. Well, okay, first of all,
*  to go back, man, if you really study the spread of LSD in a popular culture, it wasn't that the
*  CIA saw people taking LSD at parties. It's that the CIA, as I understand the story, goes and buys
*  from Sandoz Laboratories, all of their LSD, and then begins to do tests on college campuses,
*  where people begin to take the LSD and then the party start. So it's I think it's more like the CIA
*  started the party when it comes to LSD, or at least were majorly involved in the initial
*  experience people had with LSD, which was like, that's when that's when you get Tim Leary,
*  that's when you get Richard Alper, you know, Ram Dass, that's, they were both like, hanging out
*  at Harvard, where the same psychology professor who did this shit on Kaczynski was, and like,
*  LSD, you know, that's they were doing, I don't know, if they were doing the LSD test there, but
*  these tests were going on, they were being exposed to LSD, that theoretically, I don't know if it
*  came from the CIA or not, but I don't know, like, where the, I think they actually those tests were,
*  they were ordering it from Sandoz, but for sure, like, who wrote one flew over the cuckoo's nest?
*  Damn it, I can't believe I can't remember that author's name. Ken Kesey. Yeah, Ken Kesey. He did
*  one of the CIA LSD, he was in one of the CIA LSD experiments. So like, that makes sense. And also,
*  man, like, back then, I don't think, because we didn't get the Manson, the Kaczynski, or all the
*  awful shrapnel, weird shards of chaos that exploded off of the crazy unethical shit they did.
*  I don't know if there was so much of an idea that they were evil, I could be wrong about that,
*  but they weren't even called the CIA, I think they were called the OSS. In the beginning, yeah. Yeah.
*  But by the time they were, the CIA was running a fucking clinic in Haight-Ashbury that closed down
*  after like 30 years of being open or 40 years of being open, closed down three months after this
*  book came out. Like, well, that's a wrap. Yes. Yeah, Jolly West, the same guy who visited
*  Jack Ruby in the hospital, and after he left, Jack Ruby went insane, he was crawling underneath the
*  table, and thought that Jewish children were getting lit on fire and cut apart in the streets,
*  and a new Holocaust was going on. Immediately, immediately he has, they have no record of him
*  acting insane before this at all. He didn't even understand why he shot Lee Harvey Oswald. That's
*  so fucked up. Yeah. Well, they think that the same thing happened with Sirhan Sirhan, the guy who
*  shot Robert Kennedy. They think that he was under the influence as well, because he had the same
*  reaction after he shot him, like, why am I here? What happened? That they used LSD to somehow or
*  another get these people to commit atrocities, to kill people, to murder people. Yeah, I mean, yeah,
*  and you can, what's probably, you can probably, I know you can, if we go on the CIA, the crazy thing
*  is you can go on their website, look at the Freedom of Information Act archives, and they have MK
*  Ultra shit up there right now that you can look at. That's where it gets really weird, is it's like,
*  they're like, yeah. Yeah, but they never admit that they gave people, that was the thing about
*  Jolly West, he never admitted that he gave people LSD and did studies on them, never admitted it.
*  I think- While he was alive, at least, I mean, I don't know if they're admitting it now because
*  of the freedom of, well, they must, because Operation Midnight Climax is, that's officially
*  historical record. Yeah, yeah. So they must be now. But when they were, when, you know, they were
*  operating this clinic, Manson and the family were going into that clinic all the time. There's a
*  direct, there's a 100% direct connection between the CIA doctors who are providing LSD to the hippies
*  and Manson going to this clinic. That is so fucked up. Dude, this book is crazy. Man, that does not sound like
*  pandemic reading to me. That's- It's the best. Are you sure, man? Go deep. I don't know, man. I'm like,
*  I'm already weirded out by just bad understanding of astronomy. It's like, you know what I mean?
*  I don't know that I need to get into that shit about the CIA, especially because it's like,
*  you know, I don't know. It's just too much, you know? That being said, I'm going to definitely
*  fucking read that book. Well, just listen to the podcast. That's the easiest. You'll get your dick
*  wet, listen to the podcast, and then you're going to want to listen to the audiobook or read the
*  book. But he has 60 pages of citations and references at the end of the book to show each
*  thing and how he can prove it. Like, these are not, this is not, he's got some speculation that he
*  entertained at the very end of the book. We talked about it on the podcast, but the stuff that he
*  knows for sure to be true is bonkers. Can I ask you a question that will probably get made into
*  like a YouTube clip accusing you of being an asset of the CIA? Sure. So, okay, let's imagine this.
*  One day you get contacted by somebody who's in the CIA, and they show you convincing data
*  regarding something, you know, whatever it may be, meteor impact, some other impending danger,
*  that is like, you look at it and it's like, whatever it is they give you, you believe it.
*  And they're like, listen, Joe, we know you're like, we know that you're like a wild animal,
*  and we know that like you don't want to be dishonest. And we understand that. But
*  we got to figure out a way to get this kind of information out to the world.
*  Because if we don't, like it's gonna be really bad. And we're just going to people like you,
*  and just trying to get whatever the thing is they want you to say a little thing, an idea of how
*  they want you to be. And the fuck they're not offering you money. They're not offering you
*  money there. And they're also like saying like, don't worry. If you say no, did you get that job
*  at the CIA? Excuse me? Did I get the job? Did you get that job you applied for?
*  No, it seems like you're priming me. What for you're gonna give me a suggestion later.
*  Listen, I know what you're doing, man. Joe, have you ever thought of a blue butterfly, Joe?
*  Yeah, but seriously, what would your response be if like someone's like, look, we just need your
*  help. Listen, I think Central Intelligence Agency, I think FBI, I think the DEA, I think they're all
*  necessary. I don't think they're unnecessary. I think that most of what they're doing is trying
*  to protect us. Let's do the Illuminati logo for the YouTube. But also, I do think also that some
*  of those guys turn into fucking cowboys and try to fly coke back from Mexico and crash CIA jets.
*  That's true too. All that shit that happened in Mena, Arkansas, you know, all that shit that
*  happened when Clinton was governor with Barry Seals, when they were running coke back and forth
*  and dropping off in Mena, Arkansas. That guy was a CIA contractor. There's a lot of those guys
*  that were CIA. Look, they got compromised, I think. But that doesn't mean the whole CIA is bad. It
*  doesn't mean we don't need a CIA. Man, if you talk to people, if they're honest, I don't know if
*  they're, let's just assume they're honest. If you talk to people that deal with trying to infiltrate
*  terrorist groups and deal with tracking terrorists and deal with trying to figure out if someone's
*  trying to make a dirty bomb, trying to figure out if someone's ready to blow up a mall,
*  and they're doing this actively every day, all day. That's essential. That's essential.
*  So the CIA, oh, fucking MKUltra. They dose people at whorehouses. They're not the same people.
*  Okay, this is a giant organization that's been around for a long fucking time. What you're hearing
*  about from Jolly West and the MKUltra, those people are dead. Those are not alive today. But
*  you know who is alive today? ISIS. You know who is alive today? A lot of threats all around the
*  world. You know who is alive today? Kim Jong-un, the leader of China, all these fucking dictators
*  that are heavily armed all over the world. There's a lot of them. You've got to keep an eye on those
*  motherfuckers. If you don't think you have to keep an eye on them, you're crazy. Well, the CIA is evil.
*  Humans are evil. And sometimes you need someone who's paying attention to the evil people.
*  That's what you need. Now, does that mean that they're not going to stray across the lines of
*  what is correct and good and fair and start spying on regular people too? No, it doesn't mean that.
*  It means that shit needs to be curbed. That shit's un-American. But if you think someone might be a
*  terrorist, you should be able to find out before they blow up a fucking school. 100%. So the question
*  is, how good are these people at walking that line? Turns out pretty fucking good. Turns out
*  pretty fucking good. There's a bunch of shit that's happened over time. But also, they've gotten intel
*  on all these different terrorists and all these different fucking terrible situations all over the
*  world and probably saved a lot of people. It's not perfect, but nothing's perfect. There's not a
*  fucking thing that's perfect, whether it's the fucking post office or police officers or fire
*  department or doctors. No one's perfect, including the CIA, including the FBI, including the army,
*  the Navy. There's going to be problems. But overall, they're trying to protect, I would imagine,
*  if I had to ask. What are you guys here for? To make sure the shit doesn't hit the fan.
*  Pay attention to the shit. Pay attention. Do some of them branch out into coke business? Yes. I'm
*  sure some of them sell coke. I'm sure there's someone for the federal government that's selling
*  guns to a bad guy right now. I'm sure. I'm sure. It's people are people. If you got a million people,
*  you're going to get 30 bad ones or whatever the fuck the number is. It's just part of life.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Look, I mean, all I- You're a CIA apologist. I set you up. I don't believe a word
*  of what I just said. Come on, man. What about my bonus? You son of a bitch. You took that job.
*  Come on, man. You know I get a big bonus. You took the job.
*  Like, I don't- You're wearing a wire, bro. You don't have to wear a wire anymore. Just carry
*  your phone. I'm wearing a wire on a podcast. I'm monitoring you, Joe. Imagine if you got too close
*  to the mic. It's like, heeeee. Jamie's like, hmm. Interference. When I was a kid growing up,
*  when I was at the beach, that was always something I'd fantasize about. It's like, fuck,
*  I hope one of those drug bags washes up, man. Do you ever wonder how many of those wash up
*  that people don't report? Whenever I hear about someone who's like, oh my God, I found a briefcase
*  full of cocaine. Why are you- That's grace. Something is delivered under you, this bizarre
*  thing at the very least. I'm not a fan of Coke myself. It makes me- I hate it, in fact.
*  If you got some of that Ozzy Osbourne from the 70s Coke, do you know how good that shit would be?
*  CIA cocaine? Yes. Remember when we talked about government weed? Government weed was good.
*  Oh yeah. Unlike the cheese. Oh yeah. Government cheese is terrible, but government weed. Dude,
*  he's got that government weed. Whoa. Do you remember that? Yeah, I do, man. I completely
*  forgot about that. That was the thing. Back when weed was illegal, you wanted to shit the government
*  was growing. Whoa. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Well, because for sure, by the way, you know,
*  I guess at the CIA, there's a layer of all the sober people who haven't gotten high for a year.
*  Whichever is writing that fucking thing is definitely laughing as they're writing it.
*  Just laughing because they're so fucking high and they're like, all right, we'll just say-
*  No, they test, man. They test.
*  There's a level they test, but there's a level where you get past that level and like, listen,
*  no drug stuff, please. We want you to have a good time. This is a fun job. Like we know that you're,
*  you can handle your shit. We just have to do that level below you because otherwise the last thing
*  you need is another fucking Manson. You know what I always think about when I think of someone
*  infiltrating a terrorist group? What? That scene in Team America, World Police, where the actor has
*  the fucking terrible outfit on. We need actors to save the world. Do you remember? Yeah, dude.
*  I always think of that. If I think about anybody infiltrating a terrorist group,
*  I think of that guy. Yeah. Well, you know what? Again, we don't have to worry about that. That to
*  me is a fucking great thing. I don't have to worry about that. I don't have to worry about
*  infiltrating a terrorist group. Can you imagine if it was-
*  You remember? He was so good at acting. They just let him. He looks so bad.
*  And they just believe him and he walks right through. Oh my God. What a great movie. This
*  movie's amazing. This movie's amazing. Folks, if you've never seen Team America, World Police,
*  I'd probably laugh harder in this movie than any movie I've ever seen in my life. It is so,
*  so good. Team America, what a great name. World Police.
*  And then also, after you see the movie, go online and find the sex scenes that they had to delete.
*  So first of all, these guys are geniuses. And what they figured out is that if you just add
*  way more than you really want, they let you have what you want. You got to add stuff like,
*  I think she shit on his chest. They pissed all over each other. They fuck like crazy. So it's
*  a plastic doll sex scene that's so crazy and graphic. And then when you watch it in the movie,
*  it's like a fraction of this because they just went so far. There's 69 in each other.
*  That is ridiculous. Yeah. And she's sucking his dick, violently sucking him off. And they just
*  keep so they did this so that they could have some of it in there. I mean, it's so long and so
*  crazy. And then once you think it's over, then they start pissing and shitting all over each other.
*  Oh, wow. Doesn't it keep going? Yeah. This is the clip from the actual. Oh, that's from the actual
*  movie. Oh, what? That's how much they left in. That's something much they left in because they
*  cut out. They got so savage with the sex scene that they let them keep the most preposterous
*  amount in there because it was so far past that they just tricked them. They used like sleight
*  of hand. Dude, that must have been so funny filming that. I think it took a long time. Sure it did.
*  Trey Parker was saying in some interview that he would never do that again. Like, that's too bad.
*  Stop motion. Yeah, because, dude, Team America, World Police is one of the funniest movies of all
*  time. And you could there's so much in that movie, like what they do at South Park that you could
*  never do with a human. But you can do it with either a doll or a cartoon easily. And it's amazing.
*  Like death, that seems like you killed Kenny. You couldn't have a guy just die every week on a sitcom.
*  People like this is freaking me the fuck out. Yeah. But he doesn't even look remotely real.
*  He could cut his head off. He can light on fire. He can blow up in an explosion. Yeah,
*  you can definitely get away with a lot more in that regard, for sure. Get away with everything.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's a genius way to do comedy. I don't know. I mean, like South Park is like eerie to me
*  in their ability to quickly animate shit that maintains its relevance. Like, it's insane that
*  they're able to do that. Like that they've got it down to that level of like, oh shit, something
*  happened in the world and we're going to respond to it almost instantly. Not only that, they do it
*  mockingly, but accurately. Like they figure out how to ride that line. And what are you laughing at?
*  I just saw a scene I've never seen before from it. I'm looking through the-
*  Let's see it. I thought it was fan made, but it's not. It's like, this is Meryl Streep and this is Ben
*  Affleck. Oh, the Ben Affleck. He's just a hand. I'm mixing blood with this.
*  Yes. They made Matt Damon and Ben Affleck really fucking dumb in that movie, right?
*  Oh yeah, amazing. I'm Matt Damon. Yeah. How rude. Matt Damon's actually very smart.
*  Yeah. So rude. But it doesn't matter. They could just do that. Yeah. They could do anything.
*  Yeah. When you have like cartoons and puppets, you can fucking do anything. Dude, I mean, that's the-
*  But except anything you want to do takes forever. I mean, that is the problem. It's like,
*  yeah, you could do anything, but that anything is like, you know, months of anythingness.
*  So it's like clearly easier to film shit or just to say it. I mean, the fact that they used hands,
*  God only knows how much money that saved them. Like that decision to just do that,
*  how much time that probably saved them, who knows? Those kinds of decisions in shows like that are
*  really smart and funny. Yeah. But yeah, animation is like, I mean, it is spellbinding.
*  It is. He's eating her ass. Slightly longer. It's longer.
*  It's not much different, to be honest with you, though.
*  No, but there's this shit in the piss scene. I thought so, but it's not coming up on here.
*  What? Oh, there it is.
*  Wait, wait, go back. There it is. She drops a log on his face. There it is. Perfect.
*  And then I think she pisses on him too, right? Yeah, he's actually right before that.
*  Oh, he pisses on her and then she shits in his face. How many people do you think do that?
*  If you look at the whole population, like the entire population,
*  like a little light went off every time someone was shitting on someone's head.
*  How many times that happened? I bet you could fucking light up a small town.
*  Now, it's mostly the girls shitting on the guy's head, right? Would you imagine
*  most of it is like a girl, a guy wanting a girl to shit on his head? Mostly.
*  Domination. 100%. I mean, look up. If you look, here's a, if you look, not shit.
*  Isn't this interesting, though? What I was going to say is it doesn't, I don't feel bad at all
*  about that. Like, I don't feel like he's getting shit on. I feel like he wanted to get shit on
*  and he got shit on, so I'm not mad at her at all. But if a guy was just, my thing is like,
*  I'd be like, that guy's a piece of garbage. What the fuck, man?
*  Why are you doing that? And the girls, they just, look,
*  they want a thousand bucks. He wants to shit on their head. They make a deal.
*  And he just shits on people's heads. I would feel like that guy's disgusting.
*  But the girl who shit on the guy's head, obviously the guy wanted it. The guy,
*  it's easier to think a guy wants to get his head shit on than a girl. It's not, like, if you told
*  me, hey, you know that guy that used to be on that sitcom? He likes, he pays girls to shit on
*  his head. I'd be like, okay, that makes sense. Dude, I know how much it costs. I'm just kidding.
*  There's probably a market for it, right? It depends on how good you want her English
*  to be. Yeah, there's some giant German lady who comes over and just dumps on your head.
*  There's probably a negotiation. Like, there's probably a dude who's actually had the conversation
*  and he's like, really? Like, 2000 bucks? Like, are you kidding? I never pay more than 1200 for
*  someone to shit on my head. Maybe they'll give a little extra if they're allowed to pick your diet.
*  I want you to only eat Indian food. Oh, God. Just curry. Yeah. I want to smell the curry when you
*  shit in my face. Have you seen those, have you seen those videos, the fetish videos of people
*  who like to look at videos of people getting stuck in mud? You know about that fetish? No.
*  Have you heard about that? Oh, dude, it's like, I don't know, can we show it? Look up YouTube,
*  stuck in people, stuck in mud. People are into people that get stuck in the mud. Yeah,
*  it's like a fetish. Like it's like, and there's all these videos of people, like if you found,
*  I mean, like, so the humans are stuck in mud, like walking and then someone comes along and
*  fucks their mouth or something. Well, no, it's no, it's just someone stuck in mud. Like,
*  at first you look at it and it looks like, why did that dude just throw himself in that swampy mud?
*  And then he gets out of the mud or they'll start just like wiggling around in the mud and like,
*  yeah, it's crazy. Well, okay, I found something, but it's not, it could be an evolution of
*  car stuck girls, but maybe not. Car stuck girls? Like girls that are stuck with their car, like
*  they need help and then someone needs help and they're in a helpless position. I don't know.
*  That's always in a movie, right? The guy's waiting in the bushes with a gun and the girl standing
*  there with her hood up and the guy runs out, hey, give me your keys. Yeah. It's on YouTube.
*  I'm sorry, man. I thought you were looking in like porn. I don't even know if it's on porn.
*  I typed in stuck in mud fetish videos and then there's a lot of like
*  car forums, like what's up with all these girls getting stuck in the mud?
*  Like what the fuck's happening? Are they getting stuck in the mud with their legs?
*  No, no, it's like their automobile. Yeah, like a BMW. The one I've seen is mostly primarily dudes.
*  Like it's like, Oh, guys get stuck in the mud and then other guys come out and help them. No,
*  there's no other guy. It's just like a guy like, you know, the La Brea Tar Pits. Yes. It's just
*  that, but with a like guy with abs who's like, Oh, he's yelling. They're just like, you know,
*  like they're just stuck in mud. How weird. Yeah. Yeah. People are so strange. It's a, it's a,
*  that fetish is a really interesting one. But I think any, you know, you're kind of lucky if
*  that's your fetish. Yeah. There's a lot of mud out there, man. It's like, that's a,
*  that's a good fetish. It doesn't seem like you hurt anybody. Yeah. No, unless you pay someone to go
*  get stuck in mud and like, they like sink down into quicksand or something. Well, do you think
*  that the people that are they fantasizing about themselves being stuck in mud? Don't know. I don't
*  know. Right. It's open interpretation. It could be they're just really into watching hot guys that
*  get stuck. Someone's filming it. And they jerk off while they're, you fucking loser. Can't get out of
*  that mud. You fucking loser. There you go. I don't know if this is one. This is 130,000 views. And
*  it says what you said. One girl gets stuck in very sticky mud. Yeah. But you notice like, it's not
*  like they're trying to get out. That's it. First, she looks like the kind of girl that would just
*  give up. Like, I don't think she's that stuck. Like, come on. You're not that stuck. I'm fucking
*  stuck. I can't. See. Just done. Yeah. Just done. Yeah. How much did they pay her to do this?
*  50 bucks? I don't know. How much do they have to pay you? How much do they pay me for my mud videos?
*  If you wanted to do a mud video. They want you to do a mud video like that. Free.
*  Just give me a good patch of mud. I'll go in it. Why not? A cute Asian girl. Chinese girl gets stuck
*  in mud with cute sneakers. Oh no. She's got cute sneakers. She's going to walk right in the mud
*  with those cute sneakers. Honey, those are valuable. Yeah. What are you doing? These are
*  great, Jamie. I haven't seen any of these. Like, I'm an expert. These are new. They're so weird.
*  Yeah. It's a weird. It's a very strange fetish. I don't know if it's like,
*  maybe it's like an ASMR thing or something. Maybe it's not even like sexual. It's just something in
*  it. It's like relaxing. Dude, she took her shoes off. It's sexual. Yeah, that's true. She's got her
*  feet. She's moving around, getting all squirt. You're a dirty girl with your dirty feet. Dirty feet in
*  the mud. Look at her. She's getting down. That dirt. She's lost a sock. Yeah, this is weird. Weird,
*  man. Imagine this is your whole life and you like to go on the forums and you talk about,
*  guys, got any new squishy feet in the mud videos? Yeah, that'd be really weird, Joe. So Jamie, let's
*  pull up something about the news. I mean, again, why? Here's a real question. Here's a weird
*  question. Why is that so strange? But like someone who collects stamps, that's normal.
*  Right. Some guy who loves, oh, well, this guy's dressed up like a Nazi. He's going all the way
*  down. And he goes all the way to his fucking head. Still smoking too. He's like quicksand. Is he in
*  quicksand? Is that what that is? Yeah, this is a whole playlist of mess, mud, and quicksand.
*  You remember when people were terrified of quicksand and then it stopped being a thing?
*  No, this. There's a whole Radiolab podcast about that. It's really interesting because you hear the
*  podcast and go, oh yeah, I remember. Like people were scared of quicksand and then all of a sudden
*  it went away. I forget what their reasoning is. Well, when we were kids, that was like one of the
*  ways you could die. It's quicksand. And sometimes you would, like if you're out in the woods and
*  there was a suspicious patch, you might even poke it with a stick because it's like, fuck, that's
*  a whole trope in like old movies. You know, like Tarzan stuck in the quicksand or you're in the
*  quicksand and then someone throws a vine that you pull yourself out. Exactly. That's in like 80
*  different movies. What are you supposed to do if you are really in quicksand? You're supposed to
*  treat it like it's water and swim, right? There's videos on it. Jamie says no. Jamie, you a quicksand?
*  No, there's videos on it. I was going to say I've seen one recently. If you end up stuck in quicksand,
*  the best thing to do is if your phone isn't fucked up, set it up to take a video and then
*  send that video to ilovemudboys at gmail.com. It's my private email. I will come to you.
*  Trust me, it seems like I won't get to you, but I will come to you. After I come on you,
*  I'll pull you out. Imagine that you do the thing. I think you fall backwards. You have a service
*  and your service is you get people out of the mud and you give them $1,200 bucks, but you got to
*  jerk off on their face while they're trying to get out of the mud. You go out there with big mud
*  shoes, like snowshoes, but only for mud, and you come out there and fucking whack one off in the
*  head. They're like, okay, all right, we're good. Deal's a deal. You harness them up to a rope and
*  hitch it to your winch and drag them out of the swamp. Think of the bad luck. You give them money,
*  though. Give them $1,200 bucks. Here's $1,200 bucks. Thank you. To me, that would be a great
*  scene. Somebody does get stuck in quicksand and they see boots and they're like, thank God,
*  thank God. It is like a mud fetishist who's like, no, I'll get to you. Don't worry. I'm going to
*  save you, but just enjoy it for a second. What about this? What if the real mud fetishists,
*  they set up traps, so they made their own mud holes. They dug them real deep and used some real
*  silty, very fine sort of sand. If you get in there, you slide right in. It's quicksand.
*  They have traps. They have traps. They've got a little camera trap that sends a text to their
*  phone and says, we got one. Then they start chewing on Viagra and start getting their dick
*  hard. Then they run out. Like a spider that catches something in its nest. You kind of fall in love
*  with them and then you start dating them. Then all of a sudden you realize everyone they've
*  dated, they've saved from quicksand and you begin to realize, oh shit, they're doing it on purpose.
*  You go into it. You're looking for something like, does he have a flashlight? Let's see,
*  go through his stuff here. Look for a flashlight. You find schematics for how to build the perfect
*  sand pit. You motherfucker, you tricked me. It shows the water where the water's coming in
*  to make the quicksand. You need this amount of water to capture a 200 pound man.
*  There's metrics based on weight.
*  That's what he likes. He wants to get big burly fireman type dudes to jerk off on their hair.
*  That's the thrill. They're trapped.
*  Maybe he knows calls for specific types of people. He knows what'll draw men.
*  Like a turkey call.
*  Yeah. Have you ever done one of those, like you've ever gone to spa and in there like,
*  fuck it, I'm going to get a massage. But then you see in their catalog,
*  they've got a mud dip that you can go into that's somehow healthy for you.
*  You know what I mean? It's considered a healthy thing. You lay in it up to your head.
*  You know what I'm talking about, man? It's like mud spots. Have you ever done one of those?
*  No, I have not.
*  They're fucking awful. Dude, I went in there because we, you know, I was with a girl,
*  my girlfriend at the spa and they made it look all romantic and shit. It's like a couple's mud dip.
*  There's like flowers in between them and stuff and you see it in the picture and it looks somehow
*  relaxing. Your brain parties like, how could that, how's that going to feel good? It's like
*  just sitting in mud, but it looks kind of cool. And you know, I love getting stoned and getting
*  massaged. It's like, it might be fun when you're high, just be in mud. We got in these fucking
*  things. They're like next to each other and like, dude, like, yeah, they don't, number one, they
*  don't replace. That's so stupid. That was like it. Somehow they make it. Whoever's doing this shit
*  is made try like, see if you can make a fake you. This is a normal thing for a couple to do.
*  And then also you realize they don't change the mud. I'm pretty sure they don't refill the mud.
*  It's dirty. Yeah. Yeah. It's dirty. Oh my God. Yeah. Yeah. So the culture that came out of some
*  dude's balls is all like mingling with your cultures and all that's like breeding in the mud.
*  Yeah, exactly. Dude. And not only that, but like the ones that we were in, I don't know if they
*  heated it wrong or whatever, but anytime my ass touched like close to the bottom, it was burning
*  my ass. So it was like the heater in the bottom was like burning my ass. So I was having to do
*  like this. I don't know what you call it. Like arch my back in the mud. Yeah. I was like doing
*  dips in the mud and then it's fucking hot as fuck. So like my heart like starts racing. Also, I'm
*  like, I was pretty high, but like my heart's like fucking my ass is like getting incinerated by this
*  thing. And like, God, you went to a janky place. I'm janky mud bath place. That's actually the name
*  of the place. janky's mud bath place. Where does the expression janky come from? Like a janky,
*  like a shitty, clunky version. That one might be racist. Gotta be careful. That one might be one
*  of them secret racist words you didn't know was racist. You've been saying janky and they're like,
*  let me bring you back to the genocide of the iguan people. Jesus, I wouldn't be surprised.
*  What is the etymology of janky? No idea. That's why I asked. Are you sure you don't know, Joe?
*  I definitely don't know. I'm 100% innocent. What do we got? He just dies. I just want to make sure
*  that I'm not stepping over any boundaries by using janky because I want to be a good ally.
*  There's probably it's probably not connected anything. It just sounds like a word. It sounds
*  like a bad word. I think it was close to junky. Oh, there you go. Switch to janky. I'm trying to
*  read through this quick. That doesn't offend me. I don't like the term junky. Janky's good. Janky's
*  like you've got a car with a fucked up brake. You know, that's this fucking janky brake job.
*  It's not that old though. Only in the 90s. I might have invented it. Maybe if I did.
*  Janky. It's African-American slang from the 90s. Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense.
*  Earlier citations in the 90s. Yeah. Yeah. So who wrote that? Who wrote that? The article I'm
*  looking at is like. I mean, I like now that I know them, it's just weird. Someone like we hear a
*  thing like that. We're like, all right, that must be true. The first book they founded in first that
*  this person wrote the article is to the rest, the longest war written by Jonathan Waldman.
*  Hmm. By the way, I'm very much kidding if you wasn't clear. I don't really think I made that
*  word up. I was joking. It's amazing how attuned you get to like comments that you and like your
*  brain is like you're. I just don't want anybody to really, I was thinking that like that could be
*  misinterpreted. That's my word. I created it. What's another great word that they don't use
*  anymore that I started using recently? Oh, fresh. I started using fresh lately.
*  Like that looks fresh. I say it like that. I don't say it with a normal voice. So it's like,
*  that looks fresh. No, you don't. Yes, I do. When things look good. Fresh. Fresh. Things looking
*  fresh. Oh, you get like a, yeah, I hear it in the back. It gets like vibrato there. Fresh.
*  It's a good word. It's a good word. We need more beautiful adjectives for cool shit.
*  So I started bringing back fresh. Hey, what's your, what, like, what's your like policy when
*  like about cursing around your kids? Like, you know, I gave up. I gave up. You did? Yeah. I
*  told them just don't swear. Don't swear around other people. There was too many times they
*  caught me on the phone. Right. My nine year old, especially she's the one who's always correcting
*  me. Hey, with your potty language. She says that. Yeah. She's hilarious. She likes to correct me.
*  I try not to say it as much as I would say with you, but every now and then I'll let a fuck word
*  fly or a shit word fly, but it has to make sense. Dude. The funniest story would, I realize I say
*  it too much. It was when my daughter was three, we were, we had gone skiing together and we were all
*  packing up our stuff and her helmet did not go in her bag. It wasn't in her bag. And I'm like,
*  all right, everybody packed up and I'm like, Hey, your helmet and your bag. And she looks at the
*  helmet, looks at the bag and she just goes, shit. She was three. See, a little, and me and my wife
*  were just like, Oh no. It did it. Three. She knew, but that's the right word to use. Shit.
*  What are we doing? Like we, we aren't even in that world. You and I are not even in that world.
*  Like the world of you can't say words. You can't say that word at work. We don't even live in that
*  world. And yet we're raising our kids for that world. That seems to be, to be a little crazy.
*  And I understand, like, look, if I worked in an office somewhere or if I had to deal with people
*  professionally, I wouldn't be dropping F bombs all day. You can't, people get upset. They don't
*  like it. They want you to behave like a business person. They'll turn you into human resources.
*  If you have a funny joke about Puerto Ricans, you can't, you can't, there's no jokes. There's no
*  laughter. You can't, you got to, so when you're telling your kids not to say certain words around
*  other people, you're telling them that because you want them to be polite. You don't want people to
*  feel uncomfortable, but you should never have them think that there's something wrong with those
*  fucking words. Those words are important. You know, I can't really explain it to them because
*  I can't really say it the way I want to say it. It would just be too sensitive. Like I couldn't say,
*  I can't say sometimes when someone's telling you something that you know isn't true and they're
*  telling you, you want to be able to look it in the eye and go, Hey, that guy's a fucking idiot.
*  But I can't say that to a nine year old. It's just too intense. It's too intense. Like if you say
*  this person's an idiot, that's one thing. But if you say this person's a fucking idiot, that's a
*  different thing. It's another level of thing. And you need to know what's what, especially when the
*  shit goes down. You need to know who's just a dummy and who's a fucking idiot. Right? Some guys
*  just make mistakes or they think they know better or they do something stupid and it puts everybody
*  at risk, but they're not doing it on purpose. And then there's some people that think they want to
*  run the whole show. Those people are fucking idiots. There's certain people that steal from you.
*  They'll break in your house when they know you're not home. Those people are fucking idiots.
*  Right. I know what you mean.
*  Yeah. There's a different level. And if we don't use the right words, then what are we going to
*  limit a kid's ability to express themselves? The words aren't changing. They're not changing you.
*  They're not changing. It's just another tool for expression and swear words. Like really swear
*  words. You're going to stop using swear words. You're going to make people upset about swear
*  words. Get the fuck out of here. It's ridiculous. Yeah. No, no, no. I know, man. I just like,
*  I get it. That's like kind of my wife and I have decided that. And like some of my friends or
*  parents have also said, just teach them not to say those words. Teach them to be nice.
*  To win or win the right time to say those words is it's just like listening to like, I don't know,
*  like this morning I put on for no reason, like 10 crack commandments. And like, then like my son
*  was in the other room and like, he comes walking in, like he's just learning to dance. And then I
*  pick him up. He's laughing and we're dancing. And then I'm like, oh fuck, we're dancing to the 10
*  crack commandments right now. Like he doesn't know what's being said, but you know what I mean? It's
*  like, fuck, I don't know if I even, even though he doesn't, even the fact he probably, hopefully
*  doesn't understand, at least hopefully does it. I still like, I don't know that it's like you're
*  saying it's too much. The energy is too intense. It's too. It's very aggressive. Yeah. Yeah. There's
*  certain this, you know, you don't, you want to shelter them a little bit from the, the, the most
*  dark shit. Like you don't want to show your kid some murder movie, like the opening scene of saving
*  private Ryan when they're four, you don't want to say sit down. This is what happens when people
*  go to war. This is the closest that we have that represents what war is like, right?
*  Right. But that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that. Yeah. People's guts hanging out and legs blown off.
*  Yeah. You're not going to show that to a four year old. Never. All right. Me neither. That's what it seems like
*  if I act like I act with my friends around little kids. So I, I, I pull it in a lot, a lot. But
*  occasionally I'll, I'll say a shit. Sure. Or something, but I don't, I just try to, there's,
*  there's words that I don't want to lose. Like, and I, I don't, the only reason why I think a lot of like
*  these swear words, like the F word or the shit word or whatever, if you're at work and you can't say those,
*  like why not? Like, what is that? What kind of job is that? Like, what are we, we're, we're all the grownups
*  now. Remember when we were children, we thought that there was a system that was put in place by enlightened
*  beings and these enlightened beings, the adults, they knew better. We resisted, but we thought they eventually
*  were correct. And then you get to be a certain age, you're like, Oh, that's nonsense. There's no adults.
*  They're just people that got older. Right. They're just people. So as people, the, the, the, you have
*  to limit your language. The only thing that's good is when someone who you don't expect to
*  says, get the fuck out of here. When they say it's even better. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Sure. A woman that
*  you would think would be like, like very reserved, very professional. And she's like, that chick's a
*  cunt. Like, no. Yeah. I love that. When you realize someone you thought was a square is not only not a
*  square, but like a million times more out there than you are, but they're like, yeah, or they're
*  camo. They just have like figured out a way to like not reveal to you or to the world that because
*  they, they like understood it's a little easier. People don't realize that unless you're around cool
*  people. Those are the best moments when that window opens up and you realize, Oh fuck, man, I
*  I'm such a dope, I had you completely pegged as something that you're not at all. And those are
*  really like, Whoa, fuck. What's that cough? It's not real. It's a marijuana cough. I know, man. I hate,
*  I'm a hypochondriac Joe with allergies. Everybody is now I have allergies. I have seasonal allergies.
*  And, you know, anytime before this was happening, anytime I would get sick, I'd be like, well, this
*  might be the end. And now like all of us who are like that, we're like, it's really intense, man,
*  because like any demonstration, you know, my birthday was the other day we got like, you know,
*  they deliver booze in LA now, like they'll deliver mixed drinks to you now. They probably deliver
*  bullets. You probably get bullets brought to your door now. Hopefully not too fast. But I'm sorry.
*  Quick bullet delivery. But yeah, anyway, man, like, like, I was just hungover, you know,
*  but there was there was a moment where I'm like, is this a hangover? Am I there is this like,
*  what's this headache? And you know, what's going on? That's the to me, that's the part of this
*  thing is, you know, I don't I haven't seen it get acknowledged that much is like, just the psychological
*  pressure of what's going on, like, the way it's got to be like, you know, just psychologically,
*  like, think of all the people you and I know, who are already teetering at the very edge of sanity.
*  And like, imagine them alone in an apartment for a month, with like the news telling them that we
*  don't know when you can let you out. Like, whoa, how many people are like really losing their shit?
*  And like, I'm not losing my shit, but at least a couple of times a day, I'll have a real claustrophobia
*  moment, like, I can't explain it. It's like, I don't know if it's a panic attack. It's not it's
*  just like this sense of like, oh, this fucking sucks. I don't want to drive by Trader Joe's
*  and see people wearing face masks with six feet in between each of them. And the fucking weirdness
*  of it all. People are driving weird right now. And it's just like, what the fuck? People are driving
*  weird. Yeah, real aggressive. Yeah, man. That that that that, you know, I don't people I don't think
*  are acknowledging the fact that and they need to that if you're feeling if you're feeling a little
*  off right now, that's normal. Like you probably should acknowledge that, you know, or at least
*  like otherwise, people are going to start thinking they're really going nuts. When it's like, no,
*  you just have some kind of like, probably a new mental illness will be there'll probably be a new
*  name for a COVID related mental illness, you know, like pandemic associated claustrophobia syndrome,
*  or some shit like that, you know, some like thing that is a new thing, because we've never had to do
*  this before. Of course, 100%. Yeah. I mean, do you know how many people are going to get sued for this?
*  Do you know? I mean, how many people are going to sue the government for the close downs? You know,
*  many people are going to go crazy. And yeah, how many businesses are going to be lost? I mean,
*  lives are turned upside down. How many people fuck man, divorces. Oh, my God. So many. Yeah, dude,
*  so many, you know, people forced in these high pressure situations, they didn't anticipate.
*  Then some people fall apart, people with drug problems, they accelerate, because they need a
*  relief, anxiety from all this. Yeah, man. And we're just beginning it, man. I mean, just begin,
*  we're still three weeks away from at least here with this state is going to open up, right? 915.
*  Yeah. But what do you think is going to happen in Georgia? Do you think when they when they open
*  Georgia back up, you're going to get like another another series of people that have it? I think
*  it's going to be what do you think if you had a guess? Man, that's the problem. I have no debt.
*  All the data sources are so some of them are so very different. It seems like that it's like,
*  you know, you have people who've won Nobel prizes, you know, saying what they think it is. And you
*  have other people who are doctors saying what they think it is. And those things don't quite match
*  to the point where it comes down to it's not like what I think is going to happen. It's what I hope
*  is going to happen, which is like, that it just not only that the curve keeps flattening, maybe not
*  necessarily because I just maybe because it's mutating, maybe because herd immunity, maybe
*  because, you know, I don't know who to believe. You turn on Fox News, you see one story, you turn
*  on CNN, you see the other story, you go on the internet, it's a fucking meteor that's going to
*  hit you go, you know, it depends on who you're talking to an FG, 5g, you know, a variety of
*  things, a low level bio weapon that's being combined with a horrific, like powerful psyops
*  operation. Who the fuck knows, Joe? We don't know. So it's like the the that to me is the the real
*  unnerving quality of this outside of worrying. Like if you go outside, like every time you cough,
*  I'm like, Motherfuck, I should have worn my mask. I'm doomed when my wife sees this, she's gonna
*  fucking kill my ass. But like that, you know, just that those moments that would normally just go
*  completely unnoticed. I like those those to me, that new reality highlighted. Yeah, and brother,
*  that's that is like, that's another form of virus. It's fear. And it's it's paranoia. And it's like,
*  it's a it's a meme that's spread. So it changes your outlook, changes the way you interact with
*  life. Yeah, it changes your outlook. And it changes changes the actual course of your life.
*  Like you'll you'll be operating with fear and operating with anxiety. And everyone's thrust
*  into that without anything bad that they've done. For no fault of their own. They're thrust into the
*  situation, where even though they've worked really hard, they've been really disciplined,
*  they've done the right thing, they've been conservative, they take care of their health,
*  all the all the all the checks, everything. But still, all sudden work goes away. Yeah.
*  For everybody. Yeah. Nobody did anything wrong. So everybody's thrust into the situation. It's
*  really the ultimate haves and half knots moment. You know, and it's for what's really interesting
*  is like right when Bernie Sanders just stepped out of the race, like this is the example of why
*  we need some sort of comprehensive plan for everybody if everything goes wrong. Yeah, man,
*  this is right, right here. Like the idea that capitalism moves the world. Yes, it does. I mean,
*  it seems to motivate most of what we do. But the idea that there's there's not more that we can do
*  for the people of the community of the United States of America as a community, right? That
*  health care and education and stop people from being robbed. Like stop stop some predatory lending,
*  stop all these things that you can clearly see. People are just getting fucked over from. Yeah,
*  spend more money on health care like we need that now. Yeah, we went through a nice sweet spot
*  where there was no real problems other than occasionally little blips of bad flus and bad
*  diseases. And we squashed them real quick. This is a big one that hit the whole and this is only,
*  you know, as far as like terrible pandemics, the the amount of people that it kills per people
*  that get it is not as high as it is for some of the more horrendous diseases. We got lucky. We
*  should prepare for the worst. We should prepare for airborne Ebola. Okay, we should prepare for
*  all that shit. We should think about it the way we think about arms races. Yeah, how much money
*  they put into the military and how much money they put into the the war against viruses. Well,
*  the war against viruses just killed 50,000 people at home. Imagine if China just had just launched
*  missiles into American cities and killed 50,000 people. We would be at fucking war. All of our
*  resources would be dedicated to that. Right. Right. Why aren't all of our resources being
*  dedicated to fighting off fucking diseases, great questions. This is a real wake up call for that.
*  It's also a wake up call for power grid people, people that are worried about the power grid go
*  down. It's a wake up call for people that haven't had food stockpiled in their house wake up call
*  for people that are living extended, you know, like they've really extended their reach as far
*  as the how much their rent is and how much their car payment is. And they're really stretching it.
*  Well, boom, something like this happens and you're you're never going to play catch up.
*  You're barely keeping up with your lifestyle before all this went down. Yeah. And again,
*  through no fault of your own. So you got to kind of prepare now people are going to have to look
*  at this like, okay, now we know something can happen that we never thought could happen before
*  in the whole world shuts down. Yeah, now we know that's it. We should we should act accordingly
*  in like how we run things. Now we know. Well, that's the silver lining. I mean, like that's
*  the silver line. It's like when you have a thing happen that you realize like, you know, whatever,
*  like in your car, you get lucky and you notice that the tire is like super flat and you fill you fill
*  it up. You just didn't notice or whatever you see a thing and it saves you from a later fucking thing
*  that could have been a million times worse. But you know, man, the wake up call to me is
*  like, it's no joke that you need to at least be on like some terms with your neighbors. And it's no
*  joke that you need to understand how to do like how to grow food out of the ground and some like
*  basic first aid and stuff like that. And also to always have gas in your car, man. Like, you know,
*  we the other day went to get groceries and like, fucking the, you know, left a credit card at the
*  house. Right. And like the, but the car was kind of low on fuel because I hadn't gassed it up like
*  I should have. Right. And the combination of suddenly not being able to put gas in the car
*  and these two dumb mistakes, it wasn't just a normal shitty day where your car runs out of gas.
*  Now it's your car's run out of gas during a pandemic, meaning you got to call somebody
*  to come and get put gas in your car or walk somewhere to get gas. That's a whole different
*  walk than before. And that's asking someone to come and help you is kind of like asking them,
*  Hey, would you mind like taking a chance? I mean, I know you're wearing a mask and everything, but
*  you know what I mean? So suddenly fuck ups in this kind of environment, they mean a lot more than
*  fuck ups in like the previous world that we were in. And that's teaching me a real kind of
*  responsibility, you know, like having some cash on hand, like stuff like that, like what we,
*  you know, we should always be doing that. And to me, that is one of the, you know, and I hate
*  using, everyone's using the term silver lining right now. And it's like, anytime you say it's
*  like, yeah, it's a silver lining on like people who drown in their own fucking mucus. It's not the,
*  you know, it's fucked up. But I guess one of the silver linings in it is just that the fact that
*  it's like, look, man, Trump just was talking about maybe we should inject ourselves with a Lysol.
*  Okay.
*  How crazy is that video? Have you seen the one when they focus on the lady who's a science advisor
*  and she's sitting there listening to him say all this shit? Yeah. Yeah. Have you seen that?
*  I have. I've seen it.
*  Sam Harris tweeted it. And it's, he said, when you look into the abyss, the abyss looks into you.
*  That's it. You know, and but also in that look, you know, I saw, I saw her thinking like,
*  listen, motherfuckers, who's in line? You want to have, you want this job? I'm doing what I can
*  to steer this crazy ship as best as I fucking can. And there's not much I could do, but it's like,
*  you know, you see somebody seriously say to an entire planet that it might be a good idea to
*  inject Lysol into your body. Let's hear it. Let's hear it. Let me hear it. Start from the beginning.
*  I think you got to actually double click on it. And on my computer, I had to.
*  To get the sound out of it. Nothing.
*  No, I don't hear that was Duncan. That was me.
*  It's haunted. Anyway, bottom line is he's saying wacky shit and the focus is on this lady. And as
*  she's watching him, she's like, I can't even fucking believe I have to handle this. Yeah.
*  And she does. Dude, that's, but to me, I see it. We can get the disinfectant into their body.
*  That's maybe possible. We could get up to drink Lysol. Light. Powerful light. Use light, kill it
*  from outside or inside. I don't know how you do it. There you go. Cause you see a thing like that
*  and it's like, okay, lean into that. Like that's going to like lean into that is the thing that
*  you can count on. That's the thing saying inject Lysol. That's the kind of thing where like you're
*  craziest friend. If they said that to you, you would be considering like calling their friends
*  or their mom to be like, Hey, Jack, he's having like a hardcore manic episode. He's talking about
*  injecting Lysol into himself. You better do something. That's the fucking president. And to
*  me, what that tells me is like, motherfucker, you need gas in your car. You need to make sure
*  your phone is juiced up. You know what I mean? You need to make sure that you are like, you gotta be
*  ready because if we like think we're going to lean into some like imaginary hammock made of like
*  people who were saying that we should inject ourselves with Lysol, then we're made, then it's
*  our fault. That's your fault. Cause you know, it's like, let's imagine, let's say you went
*  and you, I don't know, you went into the forest and you got attacked by a tiger. But right before you
*  went in the tiger, you into the forest, you said to somebody, Hey, you think I should go in that
*  forest or tigers there? And they're like, no. And then they start shooting up with Lysol.
*  You know what I mean? If you go in that forest and the tag tiger gets you, that's your fault.
*  You fucking listen to a dude who thought you could shoot up Lysol. You know what I mean? That's your
*  imagine. What was he thinking while he was saying that he's probably like, there's gotta be an
*  intelligent way to get out of this fucking subject that I've already started and I've already like
*  coming up with perhaps for instance, maybe you could, maybe you could. So supposing we hit the
*  body with a tremendous, whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light. And I think you
*  powerful light that has him in check, but you're going to test it. And then I said,
*  Supposing you work inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or
*  in some other way. And I think you said you're going to test that too. Sounds interesting.
*  Right. And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there
*  a way we can do something like that by injection inside or, or almost a cleaning? Cause you see it
*  gets on the lungs. So it'd be interesting to check that. Can we take your lungs out?
*  Put your lungs through a car wash. Like what is, what a crazy thing to say.
*  I mean, a cleaning, a cleaning, give them a cleaning. Yeah. Imagine like being his doctor
*  and you have to listen to him say this. Like, so why don't you do like the disinfectant,
*  inside is like a cleaning. Can you dip my liver and bleach? Can you take my liver out and just
*  microwave it? Yeah. You know, so to me, you see that and it's like, okay, well, I'm not quite
*  certain that that is where I'm going to get my data streamed from because that's a Lysol person. And
*  then, but then we, but then there must be like a thing we can do regardless of the fact that clearly
*  bro, you wouldn't even talk like that on a podcast. I would never say that.
*  But imagine, imagine you have zero expertise in a certain subject. You're talking to someone who's
*  like some expert in this said subject and you're proposing these outlandish, like you're on a
*  podium, you're not even having a private conversation in front of everybody. You're somehow
*  not having a side conversation where you're proposing these ridiculous ideas that show that
*  you don't understand how disinfectant works. Like why, why is that even conversation even taking
*  place? Also, the other thing is cause he did ask the question that is a time for someone on that
*  side of the room to go, no, look at her. Why didn't she say that? She knows if she interrupts him and
*  goes, what, you can't do that. You can't inject this infection. He'd probably be upset. And she
*  wants to do the best work that she can do. And this is just some nonsense. She has to handle
*  along the way. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. It's just a bad path. Look, first of all, I mean, look,
*  the guy works some ungodly amount of hours in a day, right? He's going to do some dumb shit,
*  like, and he wings it a lot, right? So he probably was stuck on that conversation of things that
*  might be able to be done. And maybe you could do a strong ultraviolet light like in the skin.
*  Then all of a sudden he's like, Oh my God, I'm, I'm laying out possible ways that you could cure
*  this there. I better keep going. I better have more than one. Yeah. And then he's like, Oh, yeah,
*  disinfectant. That's right. Disinfectant disinfectant, maybe inside or outside.
*  They have a way of doing that. Yeah. And then you say, and then he goes to her, like, he's
*  looking for support. Like, uh, I think you said, maybe, I think you said, maybe you look into that.
*  Yeah, man. I mean, it definitely has that sense of like, when you had to give a report at school
*  and you hadn't prepared for it. That's it. That's exactly what it's like.
*  Yeah. Well, who were the Assyrian rebels? Well, they were from Assyria.
*  Yeah. Yeah. They were, they were rebels. Yes. And then I heard there were tremendous rebels.
*  They were fighters. They fought and they fought long and hard in Syria and areas around Syria.
*  And some people in areas around Syria referred to them as rebels and said they were some of the
*  most intense rebels in the region. No, as Syria, it's a different place. You're Duncan,
*  you wrote a report about the wrong place. Assyrian. I was saying that you heard me wrong.
*  Yeah. You just heard me wrong. I can't give you an A.
*  Yeah, man. There's like, how many times did you bullshit your way through like those things in
*  high school? Every time, a lot of the times, man. I mean, I got like, I think it was the red badge
*  of courage, which even now I can't remember what if it's, I think it's about the revolutionary war.
*  And I believe that I didn't read it all clearly. I didn't read it because I still can't remember
*  which war it was about. But I remember just having not read the book at all,
*  having to write a report on it, where I think I said it in Vietnam or something like her and
*  maybe it was a civil war. And she was just like, that's not even the war that it was that happened
*  that, you know, I completely failed. Like, one of those, one of those F's where the teachers met
*  angry. They carve it in. Yeah, they carved it in.
*  Yeah, I found out about cliff notes when I was in high school. I couldn't believe it. I'm like,
*  this is a gift from God. Cliff notes. You just got to buy it on your own. You got to buy the book,
*  but it's a way more, you can read it in an hour. That's right. But it still sucked. You had to pay
*  money for a cliff note. I mean, yeah, but I thought it was cheating. I was like, they're cheating
*  though. They're giving you a way to like, this is not so you can learn better. This is so you
*  can pass tests. Right. That's what this is. You give me like, oh yeah. And then Mikey said to her,
*  get off my fucking porch. That's page 30. Yeah. There's a little gray area a few years ago where
*  kids could just copy and paste other people's reports from years past because they were all
*  digital and teachers didn't know this was a thing they could check. They now have checking tools to
*  find out plagiarism and whatnot, but so many kids probably for a few years just did literally
*  nothing. I'm sure. What a disaster. That's right. I'm sure. You get out of school and you graduate
*  high school, you can't read. Like what? You can't read them. I didn't. I didn't. I can't. Just play
*  video games. I can read like a little bit of video game stuff. Yeah. I just made my way through. Well,
*  I mean, you know, there's like, that's one of the, isn't that, no, the people who went to,
*  recently went to jail for like bribe, for getting their kids into college. Oh yeah. It's kind of a
*  version of that except with your kids, right? You're like, you're like just, their kids aren't,
*  aren't supposed to be in college because they haven't done any work in high school and they
*  don't know what they're doing. But if you pay enough money, you get them in there.
*  It's like, and also aren't they doing some thing where they get people to go and take
*  SATs for your kid? Like you figure out a way to like, it's an identity theft thing,
*  or you can even get someone to go and like do the test as your kid using fake ID and shit. So it's
*  like you send in an operative that isn't your kid to take the test so you can get into a nice school.
*  Mmm. That whole thing was so crazy. They spent so much money to get kids in school
*  that didn't want to be good students. Yeah. That's right. Almost like you think you could buy,
*  buy a kid's way to enthusiastic focus. That, well there you go. I mean, there's the whole problem,
*  isn't it? What is that? This was, this is from the district attorney's office in Massachusetts.
*  One of the photos that was used to show this girl's rowing, high school rowing career that
*  she got a scholarship on. That's a workout machine. Oh, wow. That was supposed to be like,
*  yeah, look at her in her varsity. Oh, fuck man. What? Yeah. Wow. So there was no photos of her
*  actually rowing out on a boat. That's part of the thing. Like having people take tests,
*  they went and staged photos too to be like, look, the person did that. Oh my God. It's all allegedly
*  according to the court. But imagine how mad real rowers would be at you if they found out you got
*  a scholarship based on a fucking rowing machine photo. Wait, hold on. You'd be so mad. Was it for
*  scholarships or was it just trying to get them in? Trying to get them in. I don't think they got
*  scholarships. No. But to be on the rowing team, you know, or whatever it's called, I forget,
*  I've topped them ahead. Is it like good for your GPA or some shit? It's a way to get in.
*  Oh, way to get in. Yeah. Oh, right. So that and the bribe. Extra curricular activity kind of stuff
*  on your record and whatnot. So they just, they fudged that and then bribed the rest of it. Do
*  you think the kids knew? Yeah. Yeah. You know, when your parents like, hey, we just bought this
*  rowing machine. Why? Just don't worry about it. We're just going to take a picture of you in a
*  rowing machine. Like, sure, you know, you're getting a picture taken of you to try to get you
*  into this school that your dad went to or whatever. You're complicit to some degree.
*  Like, yeah, you have to be. Yeah. Yeah. A little bit. Go to that picture. She doesn't even,
*  she hadn't even broke a sweat. Well, it has a face covered up so you can't see, but I want to see.
*  Close in on that. She didn't look sweaty to me. Crew is the word I was trying to think of. She
*  looks like she's barely started exercising. There's another one down here too. Yeah. Come on, son. I
*  don't see no sweat. That's a better one. Cause look, stop, go up. Look at that. That's a gray
*  sweat, a gray t-shirt. Gray t-shirts look sweaty instantly. Yeah. Instantly. This is hilarious.
*  She probably pulled it back a couple of times. Am I done yet?
*  You can't even get me into USC. Fucking loser. My father's a loser and he takes pills. Yeah.
*  No shit, dude. I want you to love me. Well, get me into fucking UFC. All my friends are going,
*  dude, that thing that's really fucked up is like, there's some kid whose parents like,
*  like are making 20 K a year who's working his fucking ass off, you know, like just like somehow
*  managing to like study nonstop to try to get into a good school who doesn't get into the school
*  because of that shit. That's the, that's the satanic part is like they buy their way in and
*  that's someone's place. They have a limited number of places, meaning like theoretically someone
*  doesn't get into the school who could be the person who is going to, you know, invent
*  teleportation or some shit. Isn't that weird? What schools are you have your first choice,
*  you get your second choice. Billy got his third choice. Fuck. Yeah. Fuck. Billy's going to,
*  where's he going? South Dakota. Fuck Billy. What's in South Dakota? Yeah. Flat ground. Dude,
*  I get it though. I mean, I get wanting to get into some Ivy league Illuminati school. I think
*  that'd be cool. Cause you actually, if you're in, if you're in the Illuminati and your kids are dope,
*  sucks so bad. You're the Illuminati with an embarrassing kid. Like, I don't, I don't swear
*  that much around my kids. My kids don't know how I talk around my friends. What if that's how it is
*  with like Illuminati too? Like these kids don't even know their parents were in the Illuminati.
*  Yeah. You know, and you're like, look, I'm trying to get you to be in a, you know,
*  better position in life, but I was working all the time. I wasn't around. I didn't push you hard
*  enough. No shit. I got you in the Yale or they fucking know you're in it. And they're just like,
*  you're like, did you get into my fucking adrenal Chrome again? They're like breaking into your
*  vaults, you know, taking your fucking like goblets of blood and drinking it. Don't drink any more of
*  my blood. You have to stop this, you know, like join them into skull and bones. Don't they bring
*  their kids to skull and bones? I don't think so. I think they do. I think they, they, once they're
*  they're in, the son turns 30 to say son, I'm going to show you something. They take them,
*  take them to the skull and bones. Don't they bring them in? No, you, if you go to school there,
*  you get into it, right? That's how you, I think that's how you get to the end of school.
*  That's how you get in stuff, right? Legacy. Is that how you get in or is that how you get in?
*  It's going bones. Like I would not, I don't think the whole school gets to be skull and bones,
*  but that's, that's how you get accepted. That's when I met, that's how you get into the school.
*  Isn't that funny? Like if you're in a place like Yale, which is very exclusive and very prestigious
*  already, some creeps, like that's not enough. I want to get in the secret cult,
*  dick sucking society. What do they do? They don't suck dicks. Do they? Well, you know,
*  wasn't there a rumor that they make each other blow each other on, on take photos of it so that
*  they, uh, they have something over them. That was what's one of the crazy online conspiracy theories,
*  right? Yeah. They, they make every guy suck a dick and they take Polaroids of it. So they always
*  have it. They hold over you. I think that's just fraternity stuff, but yeah, is that normal
*  fraternity stuff? I mean, Burt's talked about that thing, whatever for it. Yeah. They would
*  jerk off on a biscuit, right? Yeah. That's the circle jerk thing. And the last guy to come had
*  to eat the biscuit. No one's really doing it except for the one idiot. Yeah. One guy who can't come
*  because he's just jerking off to you about guys all the time. And he just go, yeah, I sucked a
*  bunch of my friend's dicks. Who's fucking cares. I mean, aren't we in a time now where like,
*  like a picture of me emerges sucking all my friend's dicks. I think there's more to it.
*  I think they peg you or something. They take pictures of them wearing a strap on.
*  So you got pegged. Yeah. But some people don't want it, but you know, they want to rise through
*  the branch at Raytheon and get to the top. Everyone at Raytheon gets pegged. Like, well,
*  you know, that's just like, fuck it. Like we all get pegged. Now what? So what? We're inventing
*  bombs. Now you're like, who cares? Of course we get pegged. Yeah. But the guy's wearing a goat
*  costume. So what? I like to wear a goat costume when I get pegged. I like too much kinky shit.
*  It's like, God damn it. I hope we get to a time where like they take pictures of someone doing a
*  fucking thing that's legit fucked up so that, you know, and they get banished for it. It's like,
*  God forbid, like I can't even imagine the Polaroids that could emerge of weird shit I've done. You
*  know, I've got it only imagine you can't imagine. I can't. But that being said, it's like, yeah,
*  I wonder what, what I think what the initiation I get it. Like it is, it's like, let's face it,
*  you're not gonna, it's probably fun to be a part of a little tiny group. That's a part of an
*  exclusive group, right? You got the exclusive group, that's Yale. And then you get the little
*  skull and bones. We'll all get together. All brothers in the room. They probably have like
*  secret words. They have to say in Latin and shit. Yeah. I mean, we, that's the thing that I imagine
*  based on the way I have come to understand things, whatever it is, is way more boring than we imagine.
*  Because you know what I mean? Like when you don't know what a thing is, you always reject the worst
*  thing on it. My guess is it's boring as fuck. It's probably just some college bullshit,
*  where people are in a frat sit around and like make dumb jokes and do stupid shit. And it's nothing.
*  They probably don't even peg you. They probably just take a Polaroid of your asshole.
*  Got it. Look. We got your mouth shut. Yeah, we have a picture of your asshole. It's your
*  soul's fingerprint. Don't show anybody. Please don't. It's your soul's fingerprint. Imagine your asshole told a lot about you.
*  That's the big discovery. Like you look in a person's eyes, you know, and you see their soul.
*  It's the windows to the soul. What if the asshole is like, you really know whether you like someone
*  just by looking at their asshole. Something about the asshole tells you things. Books come out decoding
*  your asshole. You know, like people read hands. They read fingerprints. Why can't they read
*  assholes? I bet assholes tell you a lot. Just like someone's eyebrows do. Like someone's got like mean
*  eyebrows. Like, whoa, that guy looks aggressive. I don't trust either. The guy's got big, thick,
*  bushy eyebrows and he's not mean. I get suspicious. He's all friendly with his big, crazy fucking
*  eyebrows. But all the villains have big, crazy eyebrows. They're all angry. Yeah, they all have crazy
*  eyebrows. Yeah. Yeah. It's just like, man, for one, here's probably for sure. We don't know that you
*  can't tell a person's future from their asshole yet because no one's thought of it. That could be
*  the new thing that people pick up as a business during this pandemic. Yeah. Asshole reading. Yeah.
*  Or what if it's like a, what if it's like a, there's an app. Just scan it. A scan.
*  Discounts. A QR code. Your asshole flots into a QR code. All this time we've been looking for alien
*  signals from space. We didn't know it was in our assholes. Yeah, it was all, all the photos of our
*  assholes. If you put them together on a grid, it gives us the diagram of how to build a spaceship
*  to get out of here. We just have to have all the photos. It's like a giant jigsaw puzzle with
*  8 billion pieces. You take 8 billion assholes and you put them on a grid and you'll see the schematics.
*  Behold. It'll tell us exactly when the sun's going to supernova. About 50 years. Maybe. What if that's
*  what the quantum computer, the first thing it says is I need pictures of all the assholes on the planet.
*  Like, if you vote, you have to show a photo of your asshole before you vote. You have to have it on your phone.
*  And that's your thing. Thumbprints. Thumbprints are not exact. Assholes are exact. Exact. And they don't get changed by workouts.
*  Or they don't like, you know, your thumbprint, your hands get bigger. It could be a little bit different.
*  How do you know? I don't know that assholes don't get changed from workouts. Well, they can,
*  one thing they can do with your thumbprint, right? Some people burn their prints off.
*  You can't really burn, well, I guess you could burn your asshole into an unreadable. That's one of the levels of the CIA.
*  Yeah, you're tiring people reading your asshole. I can't get a good relationship because people keep reading my asshole wrong.
*  Look, I'm more than my asshole.
*  Let's end with that. Okay. Dude, we just did three and a half hours. Holy shit, man.
*  It's crazy. It's four o'clock already. Listen, man, your show looks amazing. I'm very excited for you. I'm very happy for you.
*  Tell people once again, it's on Netflix. It's on Netflix. It's called The Midnight Gospel. Please just watch it.
*  It's like, yeah, it's it's I'm very proud of it. And I think you'll enjoy it. Duncan Trussell dot com.

*  Thank you, brother. I love you. Always good to see you, man. Thank you. Bye, everybody. See you.
