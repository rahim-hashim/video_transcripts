# Joe Rogan Experience #1932 - Merlin Tuttle
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE)
*  Well, welcome to the show Merlin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=0.0s)]
*  What a great name by the way. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=14.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=16.4s)]
*  Your parents named you Merlin. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Did they make you get into magic at all? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=19.96s)]
*  My mother actually named me Merlin Devere and her hope was that she would get a kick [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=22.88s)]
*  out of me being a medical doctor, MD Tuttle MD. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=29.2s)]
*  But it didn't work out that way. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=33.36s)]
*  Well you're a bat scientist. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=36.44s)]
*  How does one specialize in bats? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=39.48s)]
*  How did that journey start? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=41.44s)]
*  Well I was always interested in anything in nature. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=43.76s)]
*  I started out to collecting monarch caterpillars and watch them make cocoons and hatch into [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  butterflies and then I went into a snake phase in which my mother was not happy with that [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=52.28s)]
*  phase. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=58.4s)]
*  At five I was dragging in sometimes snakes four or five feet long and they'd get loose [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=59.4s)]
*  in the house. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=63.44s)]
*  We moved into a new neighborhood one time and a welcoming committee came over to welcome [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=67.0s)]
*  my mother to the neighborhood and I had a few days before caught a seven foot eight [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  inch coach whip snake that I was really proud of but it got out and we couldn't find it [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=77.92s)]
*  in the house. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=83.08s)]
*  We thought it had gotten out of the house. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=84.08s)]
*  The group sat around welcoming my mother to the neighborhood and all of a sudden she [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=86.36s)]
*  sees everybody with a look of horror on their faces and they're heading for the door and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=90.64s)]
*  this snake had reared up behind the couch and was looking for all the world like a cobra [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=95.64s)]
*  looking around and only one of those women would ever even speak to my mother again. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=99.8s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  Your crazy son with his snakes. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=107.76s)]
*  So you are a bat scientist. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=110.28s)]
*  The Secret Lives of Bats is one of your books and the other one is The Bat House Guide. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=113.88s)]
*  That's the most recent one. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of bats in Austin Texas. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=123.56s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=126.2s)]
*  Actually I moved to Austin because there are a lot of bats here but there wouldn't be probably [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=129.64s)]
*  still a lot of bats if it hadn't been for my moving. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=133.68s)]
*  When I first began to be interested in conserving bats, Austin was making more negative publicity [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=137.0s)]
*  about bats than any other place probably in the world. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=143.86s)]
*  There are news headlines from coast to coast saying that hundreds of thousands of rabid [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=147.24s)]
*  bats were invading and attacking the citizens of Austin. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=151.92s)]
*  And was that nonsense? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=156.12s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=157.84s)]
*  Why do you think people have this fear of bats? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=159.54s)]
*  Fear of the unknown. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=163.86s)]
*  I mean you're probably not totally unaffected. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=165.54000000000002s)]
*  I mean I know I am. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=169.62s)]
*  I'm much more nervous about taking off in a plane than riding to the airport in a taxi. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=171.58s)]
*  And yet the taxi is far more dangerous than the plane. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=178.10000000000002s)]
*  Statistically speaking. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=181.38000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=182.38000000000002s)]
*  But we fear what we don't know and very few people know much about bats. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=183.38000000000002s)]
*  So they're easily misunderstood and scared. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=189.70000000000002s)]
*  And in those days if a bat tried to catch a mosquito near somebody the person would [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=192.78s)]
*  run like hell thinking that they're being attacked and they'd never even look around [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=198.74s)]
*  to see the bat catch the mosquito and go on his way. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=203.34s)]
*  In fact I had one guy that claimed he was actually, the bat actually did attack him. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=206.98s)]
*  And when I looked at the evidence of the attack I found these big scratches on his arm that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=214.46s)]
*  a bat couldn't have inflicted. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=219.01999999999998s)]
*  And turned out he'd run too close to a rose bush on his way to the house and got bit by [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=221.54s)]
*  the rose bush and blamed the bat. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=227.42s)]
*  So bats in Austin, what's interesting is this bridge near Lady Bird Lake. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=231.14s)]
*  And that bridge is famously a home for millions of bats, right? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=239.78s)]
*  Up to 1.5 million. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=245.94s)]
*  That's a lot of bats. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=247.33999999999997s)]
*  It's a beautiful thing when you watch them fly out. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=249.22s)]
*  One of the first times I've ever come here, you can see Jamie has a photo of it happening, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=251.9s)]
*  one of the first times I ever came here we went next to it and you could hear the bats [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=255.9s)]
*  or you could hear them squeaking and stuff in there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=262.58s)]
*  Well when I first came to Austin I had to face people who were signing petitions to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=266.22s)]
*  have them eradicated. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=274.46000000000004s)]
*  They were terrified of them. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=275.46000000000004s)]
*  The health department had warned that they were mostly rabid and would attack people. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=277.26000000000005s)]
*  Mostly rabid? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=281.70000000000005s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=282.70000000000005s)]
*  And what were they basing this on? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=283.70000000000005s)]
*  In the early 1980s there were all kinds of planted stories in the news media by pest [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=284.82000000000005s)]
*  control and health people that made money off of fear of bats. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=290.78000000000003s)]
*  And like Family Circle and Good Housekeeping magazines were running articles like Three [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=296.78000000000003s)]
*  Years of Terror, Real Life Ordeal. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=302.90000000000003s)]
*  One of these stories had the family trapped in their home for three days and nights with [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=305.94s)]
*  bats attacking the windows and doors trying to get them. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=310.26s)]
*  And so people were really frightened genuinely. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=313.7s)]
*  But all it took to overcome that is I ended up getting a bat of the kind that lives under [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=318.21999999999997s)]
*  the bridge and I'd take him around and show him to people. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=325.38s)]
*  I remember one lady actually it was Ms. Crenshaw, the famous golfer's mother. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=329.74s)]
*  She thought when she first heard I was conserving bats she told her friends, what next somebody's [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=337.21999999999997s)]
*  going to be trying to conserve cockroaches. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=343.21999999999997s)]
*  But the first time I actually showed her a live bat in the hand she was like, oh isn't [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=345.97999999999996s)]
*  he cute? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=352.21999999999997s)]
*  You know a whole different response. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=353.21999999999997s)]
*  So bats once people meet them they're their own best ambassadors. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=358.21999999999997s)]
*  They're gentle animals that almost never bite anything except an insect or fruit except [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=362.42s)]
*  in self-defense. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=368.62s)]
*  And all I had to do was come to Austin and point out that this was a treasure not yet [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=371.34s)]
*  recognized and because of convincing Austin not to eradicate the bats today they bring [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=379.18s)]
*  millions of tourist dollars every summer to Austin and they eat tons of crop and yard [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=388.3s)]
*  pests every night. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=393.90000000000003s)]
*  So that's what's important for people to understand is they actually serve a very important purpose [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=395.42s)]
*  in the ecosystem, right? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=399.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=401.58s)]
*  A major part of my success in conserving bats has been that I look at it from a standpoint [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=402.58s)]
*  not just that bats or other animals have rights or anything. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=408.06s)]
*  It's a matter of like them or not we need them and if we understand them we'll probably [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=413.7s)]
*  like them too. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=419.38s)]
*  And so this eradication idea that people had, that would have been a disaster like ecologically [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=421.06s)]
*  if they did decide to eradicate the bats and they killed all those bats that were under [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=430.38s)]
*  the bridge? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=433.38s)]
*  Well what we forget is when people warn us about the supposed dangers of having bats [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=434.54s)]
*  around the real danger is not having bats around. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=439.86s)]
*  We could be practically buried in insect pests. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=443.9s)]
*  Bats are the primary controllers of insects that fly at night like mosquitoes. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=447.58s)]
*  A recent study in Wisconsin showed that bats living in people's bat houses in their yards [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=453.86s)]
*  they looked at the droppings of those bats and genetically analyzed to see what they [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=460.3s)]
*  were eating and they found that those bats living in bat houses were eating 15 species [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=463.98s)]
*  of mosquitoes, nine of which carried West Nile virus. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=470.34000000000003s)]
*  Do we get West Nile virus in Texas? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=476.58000000000004s)]
*  Is that common? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=478.34000000000003s)]
*  I don't think it's real common. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=480.18s)]
*  But it's possible? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=482.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=484.06s)]
*  So a bat house, and this is a photo of a bat house that you have on the cover of your book. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=485.06s)]
*  I didn't even know that these were a thing. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=489.22s)]
*  They're like bird houses, but it's a bat house. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=490.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, except that they're open at the bottom instead of a hole in the front with a floor. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=493.34s)]
*  And so people put these up and construct them purposely so bats can live in them. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=497.29999999999995s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=502.73999999999995s)]
*  And how do you get a bat to get in there? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=503.73999999999995s)]
*  Well just like birds, they find them and decide they like them. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=506.7s)]
*  Oh wow, look at that picture. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=509.73999999999995s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=511.7s)]
*  That bat house was occupied by 105 bats within a week of the time it was put up. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=512.6999999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, you have a little Batman logo on the front of it too. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=518.54s)]
*  So within a week it was put up, there was over 100 bats in there. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=522.94s)]
*  That's right. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=527.3000000000001s)]
*  Now I wouldn't say that that's what you'd expect all the time. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=528.3000000000001s)]
*  It often takes six months to a year, even sometimes a year and a half to two years to [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=531.0200000000001s)]
*  attract bats. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=535.7s)]
*  But if you put up the right kind of bat house in the right kind of place, you'll probably [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=536.7800000000001s)]
*  attract some bats and it can be a lot of fun. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=543.1400000000001s)]
*  And what is the right kind of bat house? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=545.7800000000001s)]
*  Do you have to put something in there to attract them? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=548.3800000000001s)]
*  Just roosting crevices are three quarters of an inch to an inch wide usually. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=551.82s)]
*  The bats like those narrow crevices because they're used to snakes coming after them. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=559.22s)]
*  And like if a big rat snake comes into a bat house to try to catch a bat, if the bat's [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=564.22s)]
*  roosting in a place only three quarters of an inch wide, the snake comes in, he can't [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=569.42s)]
*  open his mouth wide enough to get around the bat's head, but the bat opens his mouth and [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=575.02s)]
*  bites the snake's nose. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=580.7s)]
*  So I suspect that's a large part of why bats like those narrow crevices is protection against [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=583.1400000000001s)]
*  one of their dominant predators. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=589.0600000000001s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=591.62s)]
*  So you would set one of these things up, leave it, and that would help control all sorts [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=592.62s)]
*  of mosquitoes and pests and things that are on your property. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=598.0200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=603.34s)]
*  Putting up bat houses can be a big help in many ways. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=604.34s)]
*  There's a recent study done in the Mediterranean that showed that when they put up bat houses [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=608.7s)]
*  strategically located around rice paddies, that they no longer had to use pesticides. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=614.7s)]
*  Really? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=621.7s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=624.7s)]
*  How many bats do you need to control pests? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=625.7s)]
*  What kind of bugs are we talking about besides mosquitoes? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=630.74s)]
*  Those were moths that they were controlling, and bats have been found helping protect rice [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=633.78s)]
*  in Thailand where they're eating white-billed plant hoppers. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=640.78s)]
*  They'll eat a wide variety of insects. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=643.9399999999999s)]
*  One important point to make, you know, we hear a lot about the importance of biodiversity, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=650.06s)]
*  and the bat houses in the Mediterranean that successfully eliminated the need for pesticides, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=656.54s)]
*  they didn't mean that there were never any more pests or that there was no pest damage. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=664.0999999999999s)]
*  What the bats have to do to eliminate the need for pesticides is just lower the damage [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=668.38s)]
*  to a level where the cost of the damage is less than it costs to put pesticides out. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=674.02s)]
*  So the reason that worked was that there was a national park not very far away, and [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=681.54s)]
*  so you know, if you just have miles of monoculture, what do the bats do in the off season when [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=688.02s)]
*  your pests aren't there? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=695.74s)]
*  They're going to starve to death. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=696.74s)]
*  And so by having diverse habitat not far away in the off season, the bats had a place to [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=699.3s)]
*  go eat until they were needed over the rice paddies again. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=706.42s)]
*  Mm, okay. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=710.6999999999999s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=712.4599999999999s)]
*  So when you first got here, you're dealing with these people that want to eradicate bats. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=713.66s)]
*  You had to convince them that bats are very important. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=721.26s)]
*  And how did you go about doing that? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=724.26s)]
*  Like what did you do to try to educate people? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=726.0999999999999s)]
*  Well, this goes back a ways. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=729.5s)]
*  When I started out, when I got my first job, it was a really great job. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=733.3000000000001s)]
*  I got a full salary just to go have fun in the world as far as I looked at it because [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=738.62s)]
*  I could go anywhere in the world I wanted, stay as long as I wanted, as long as I did [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=745.3000000000001s)]
*  good research on some aspect of bat biology. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=749.02s)]
*  And so when I announced that I was going to resign that to do full-time bat conservation [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=753.0600000000001s)]
*  even my closest friends thought I was star-craving crazy because in those days, almost everybody, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=760.4200000000001s)]
*  especially in America, thought that if not all, at least most bats were rabid and they [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=766.02s)]
*  would much rather pay to have a bat killed than to have it saved. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=771.1800000000001s)]
*  And so it was very difficult at first. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=775.74s)]
*  We hear a lot from environmentalists, conservationists about the need to win battles. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=786.26s)]
*  Send us X amount of money so we can beat up on such and such a company. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=794.34s)]
*  There's a certain type of people that kind of love that. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=799.9000000000001s)]
*  But if you're starting out to save something that everybody hates and they'd really rather [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=804.1800000000001s)]
*  spend money to kill it than to save it, you've got to get a whole lot more clever than just [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=809.4200000000001s)]
*  asking them for money to save the animal. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=814.86s)]
*  So I don't think it was because I was particularly smart or anything, but I had to learn early [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=818.0600000000001s)]
*  on to win friends instead of battles. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=823.02s)]
*  And what I found was if I went about it right and I won enough friends, I didn't need to [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=827.14s)]
*  win the battles. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=833.34s)]
*  And that's become kind of a dominant part of my approach to conservation is first of [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=835.46s)]
*  all, you listen to people and I don't care if they say, you know, I had fun burning a [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=842.3000000000001s)]
*  bat cave in which I killed thousands of bats or whatever they say. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=848.38s)]
*  You know, we shouldn't be dwelling in the past. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=854.34s)]
*  It's the future that counts. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=857.46s)]
*  And we've all made crazy mistakes in the past. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=859.58s)]
*  And we wouldn't want to be hated for the rest of our lives for what we did wrong before [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=862.48s)]
*  we knew what was right. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=866.7s)]
*  I found that if I listened to people and took them seriously and understood that even the [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=869.42s)]
*  person with the wildest tale probably had some reason for believing it. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=877.06s)]
*  And the more I listened and understood, the better I became at countering it. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=883.42s)]
*  And also, I always had the attitude of I'm not here to just help bats. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=888.62s)]
*  I'm here to help people and bats. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=894.86s)]
*  And if you've got a problem, I want to know what it is. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=898.5999999999999s)]
*  I want to understand it. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=902.16s)]
*  And then maybe I can help you solve it. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=903.92s)]
*  And so I learned to be good at listening to people. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=906.7199999999999s)]
*  And I'm sure you've experienced a good share of winning is just listening. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=912.4399999999999s)]
*  Most people will like you if you just take time to listen to them, even if you are at [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=919.4s)]
*  opposite poles as what you believe. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=924.68s)]
*  And so by by learning to listen well and then have an attitude that what can I do to help [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=927.96s)]
*  you? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=935.9200000000001s)]
*  I was able to change a hell of a lot of people's minds about bats. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=936.9200000000001s)]
*  So a lot of people, they have this idea about bats based on like horror movies, vampire [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=943.52s)]
*  movies and whatever you see like Halloween decorations. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=948.44s)]
*  There's always bats involved. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=951.1600000000001s)]
*  So thought of as like a creepy kind of scary animal. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=953.64s)]
*  Well that's all part of just not understanding. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=958.08s)]
*  In fact, one of the big problems for bats is that, you know, out of the more than 1400 [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=962.12s)]
*  species in the world, the vast majority of them, we hardly know a thing about them other [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=968.4399999999999s)]
*  than that they've got a name and they fly erratically. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=973.1999999999999s)]
*  They live in places that people often consider kind of spooky. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=978.34s)]
*  The basement or the attic or the cave. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=981.8s)]
*  And we don't know what what they're going to do next because they fly so erratically [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=985.3599999999999s)]
*  and they're associated with the night. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=990.4s)]
*  I mean, even people who work at night aren't trusted as much as people work in the daytime. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=992.4399999999999s)]
*  That's true. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=997.16s)]
*  That's true. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=998.16s)]
*  Night shift people are kind of creepy. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=999.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1000.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1001.92s)]
*  So these bats that we have in Austin, is there more than one species? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1002.92s)]
*  At least 99% one species under the bridge. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1009.6s)]
*  There's probably two species there. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1013.24s)]
*  One's the cave myotis that usually lives in caves and the other is the Brazilian free [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1015.48s)]
*  tailed bat. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1020.84s)]
*  And what's the most common? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1021.84s)]
*  The free tailed bats. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1023.2s)]
*  So that's the one when you see the big swarms, most of them are the Brazilian free tailed [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1024.3s)]
*  bats. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1028.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1029.24s)]
*  So is that an invasive species? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1030.24s)]
*  No, not by any means. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1031.24s)]
*  So why is it called the Brazilian free tailed bat? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1032.24s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1034.64s)]
*  Species often get named by where they were first discovered. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1037.44s)]
*  And the species was first described by specimens discovered in Brazil. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1041.04s)]
*  Then it was discovered later that it was found all the way up into the United States. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1046.04s)]
*  And there were subspecies named. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1052.3600000000001s)]
*  It was thought originally that there was a different subspecies in Mexico that came up [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1055.8400000000001s)]
*  into Texas and a third subspecies in Florida and the Gulf region. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1061.48s)]
*  And each of those subspecies, the first one was described in Brazil. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1067.88s)]
*  So it was Tiderida brasiliensis, Braziliensis, and then Tiderida brasiliensis mexicana from [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1072.48s)]
*  Mexico and so on. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1078.72s)]
*  But then a genetic study was done and found that they're so broadly mixed genetically [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1080.64s)]
*  that you couldn't separate out subspecies. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1087.24s)]
*  And so they went back to the original name and it's now called the Brazilian free tailed [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1090.74s)]
*  bat, which is kind of a pain for all of us that knew it for many years as the Mexican [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1096.9s)]
*  free tailed bat. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1101.2s)]
*  But that's just the way of genetics. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1103.3s)]
*  Sometimes I like the common names even better than the scientific because they don't seem [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1106.54s)]
*  to change as rapidly these days. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1110.58s)]
*  So and what is the other bat that's very common here? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1112.9s)]
*  It's not very common. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1117.7s)]
*  That's common but prevalent. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1119.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, the cave myotis. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1120.66s)]
*  It's a slower flying, more agile maneuverable bat. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1122.94s)]
*  The free tailed bats can fly thousands of feet above ground and they can travel at, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1127.8600000000001s)]
*  get this, with a tail wind they can go 100 miles an hour. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1134.3400000000001s)]
*  What? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1138.22s)]
*  100 miles an hour. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1139.22s)]
*  Our bats from the bridge could easily be feeding clear down on the coast at some nights. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1141.5400000000002s)]
*  I've watched on Doppler weather radar, we can watch them really well on radar. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1147.5s)]
*  And I've watched where they come out of, let's say Bracken Cave down near San Antonio and [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1152.3s)]
*  we see the front band of moving bats crossing four to five counties in 12 minutes. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1159.14s)]
*  Wow, I had no idea. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1166.3s)]
*  I thought they were, you know, kind of like bird speed, like a regular bird. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1168.8600000000001s)]
*  Bats are by far the most maneuverable, best flyers in the world. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1174.82s)]
*  They can do things that neither birds nor insects can do in flight. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1179.18s)]
*  And why is that? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1183.14s)]
*  They don't have fixed hard wings, you know, like insects, the wings are made of chitin [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1186.1s)]
*  and they don't bend that much except at the joints and birds feathers aren't nearly as [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1190.94s)]
*  flexible as the skin on a bats wing. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1196.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1199.86s)]
*  Actually, the skin on a bats wing is two layers and that skin has been rated as 19 times tougher [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1201.4599999999998s)]
*  than a surgeon's glove. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1211.5s)]
*  Wow, really? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1213.5s)]
*  And what's really cool is even if they get damaged badly, it's amazing what their healing [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1215.74s)]
*  powers are. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1220.9799999999998s)]
*  Sometimes a bat can even have a broken wing and the swelling around the break will actually [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1221.9799999999998s)]
*  act like a cast and will hold the bone in place where the bat still is able to fly and [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1231.78s)]
*  survive until he can recover. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1237.98s)]
*  So these bats that we have, we have the fast moving bats that are the Brazilian bats and [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1241.34s)]
*  then you have the other bats which are more maneuverable but they don't go as fast? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1247.8999999999999s)]
*  That's true. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1252.74s)]
*  And these bats tend to feed in different types of places. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1253.74s)]
*  And the fact that these Brazilian bats can make it all the way down to the coast and [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1258.1000000000001s)]
*  then they come back to the bridge at night? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1261.7s)]
*  Well, I'm not saying they make it all the way to the coast. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1263.6200000000001s)]
*  The trouble is we haven't yet done good enough tracking to know. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1266.58s)]
*  Can we put like a little GPS band on a bat or is it too big? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1270.66s)]
*  Yeah, we can radio track bats. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1274.06s)]
*  We'd love to radio track them when they migrate south and see where they're going but it can [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1277.3s)]
*  be a real problem trying to track a bat at night across the U.S. Mexican border without [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1281.9s)]
*  getting shot down by somebody. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1286.8200000000002s)]
*  I was down looking for bats in the daytime one time with a friend who was an ex-aircraft [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1288.8400000000001s)]
*  Navy pilot and we were in his private plane looking for bats down low along the New Mexico-Texas [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1295.92s)]
*  border and first thing we knew we got forced to land by drug agents that had overtaken [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1302.92s)]
*  us and when we landed we were surrounded by guys with guns thinking they had really made [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1312.52s)]
*  the catch of the year, somebody dumb enough to fly in the daytime with his drugs and they [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1320.12s)]
*  were very disappointed to find out we were just bat people. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1325.12s)]
*  So when it comes to bats around the world, how much variation is there? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1331.04s)]
*  I know that there's some really large bats in Asia, right? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1335.56s)]
*  There's some big variation. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1340.4s)]
*  There's yes, large bats in Southeast and in Asia, Africa. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1343.92s)]
*  What's the biggest bat? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1347.76s)]
*  The biggest bat has a wingspan of almost six feet. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1349.56s)]
*  I have a colleague who swears that the biggest ones sometimes actually get to six feet. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1353.56s)]
*  What is that bat? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1359.92s)]
*  Flying foxes. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1361.74s)]
*  There are 200 kinds of flying foxes. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1362.74s)]
*  Some of them are small, some are big. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1365.0s)]
*  Look at the size of that sucker. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1368.0s)]
*  These are really neat bats and it's not just these great big bats but one of the world's [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1370.1200000000001s)]
*  smallest mammals is a bat. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1377.52s)]
*  The little bumblebee bat from Thailand weighs a third less than a U.S. penny. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1380.0800000000002s)]
*  Look at the size of that thing. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1384.48s)]
*  That's in the Philippines? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1386.48s)]
*  Is that what that is? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1387.48s)]
*  Is that what it says, Jane? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1388.48s)]
*  These flying foxes are in the Philippines, yes, but they're in a wide area of the old [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1390.5600000000002s)]
*  world tropics. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1397.64s)]
*  We're very concerned about them because for one thing... [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1398.92s)]
*  Go back to that photo with the guy next to it so we can see it, the perspective. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1401.44s)]
*  No, the one, yeah, that one. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1406.88s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1410.2800000000002s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1411.2800000000002s)]
*  I think it's a little too close. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1412.2800000000002s)]
*  Well, that's kind of like holding your fish out a bit in front of you to exaggerate. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1413.2800000000002s)]
*  But it seems, even if it's a forced perspective, that's pretty large. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1419.92s)]
*  You know, I've never gone there and personally seen it, but I'm told that there's a place [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1424.6000000000001s)]
*  on the island of Bali where there's a guy that has tamed wild flying foxes that have [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1428.96s)]
*  these nearly six-foot wingspans. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1435.12s)]
*  And visitors can actually come and he'll call them down out of the trees and they can hang [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1437.96s)]
*  on their arms sometimes for a photo. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1442.72s)]
*  These are wild bats. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1445.8799999999999s)]
*  So he tamed them with food just to get them accustomed to feeding? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1447.2s)]
*  Well, one of the secrets of my... [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1450.8400000000001s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen my large photo collection. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1453.28s)]
*  I have the largest collection of bat photos in the world. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1458.68s)]
*  And a lot of my photos, I get these incredible pictures because I can actually train bats [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1462.92s)]
*  to come and do their natural thing where I can photograph them. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1468.28s)]
*  And how do you do that? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1472.52s)]
*  Well, when I was a teenager, I learned falconry. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1473.52s)]
*  In falconry, you train the hawk to come back on call for a small reward in your hand. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1477.84s)]
*  And it's the same thing with bats. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1484.16s)]
*  You train them to get a reward from coming to your hand. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1487.12s)]
*  And there's some of your photos there? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1491.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1493.92s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1494.92s)]
*  And what does that little fellow got in his mouth? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1495.92s)]
*  He's got a fig. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1496.92s)]
*  Now that brings up a whole other story. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1497.92s)]
*  Bats like that account for up to 98% of the first seed dispersal into cleared areas in [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1502.8s)]
*  Africa. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1509.3999999999999s)]
*  And as you may be aware, desertification is one of the biggest threats in Africa. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1510.3999999999999s)]
*  People cut down the forests. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1516.24s)]
*  They abandon the land after a few years when it's not any longer productive. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1517.92s)]
*  And then you very much need something to reseed it. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1522.0s)]
*  And these fruit-eating bats are often badly over-harvested for human food and most recently [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1527.2s)]
*  because they've been wrongly blamed as a source of Ebola. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1532.96s)]
*  And when that happens, people don't tolerate them anymore. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1538.64s)]
*  And there goes the seed dispersal that people need if they're going to continue to have [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1543.52s)]
*  viable land. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1547.68s)]
*  Now you said over-harvested for human food. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1549.6s)]
*  So it's really common that people eat bats? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1553.52s)]
*  I know that that was the wet market theory initially out of the Wuhan area that people [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1556.5200000000002s)]
*  were eating bats. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1562.4s)]
*  Actually, although that was speculated early on, when they searched the market they could [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1564.4s)]
*  find no evidence that bats had been sold there. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1570.48s)]
*  But there's evidence that bats were eaten at one time by American Indians. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1574.1200000000001s)]
*  There have been clay pots found with full of bat bones that looked like people were [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1582.28s)]
*  cooking them up to eat. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1588.1599999999999s)]
*  But in memorable history, there hasn't been bat eating in the New World. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1590.28s)]
*  In memorable history? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1596.84s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1597.84s)]
*  Well, what I'm saying is there is evidence that American Indians occasionally ate bats [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1598.84s)]
*  because there have been jugs, pottery jugs with lots of bat bones in them that looked [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1604.8799999999999s)]
*  like they were eaten probably by Indians. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1611.48s)]
*  But in the Old World, where bats are much larger, they are frequently eaten and that's [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1614.68s)]

*  Where are bats, what part of the world are bats eaten the most? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1625.12s)]
*  Pacific Islands and Indonesia, Southeast Asia, but also the places like Madagascar. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1631.0s)]
*  And so how do they cook bats? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1646.24s)]
*  Like what's a common way to serve up a bat? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1648.04s)]
*  Got a picture of them boiled in coconut milk in Guam. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1651.96s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1655.28s)]
*  Did you try it? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1656.28s)]
*  No. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1657.6s)]
*  Would you feel bad about eating a bat since you love them so much? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1659.1999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think we, I don't see a reason to play favorites among animals. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1662.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, some people think it's okay to rear cattle and poultry and things in horrible [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1675.1599999999999s)]
*  circumstances to eat, but it's totally bad if a hunter goes out and shoots something [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1685.96s)]
*  from the wild to eat. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1693.2s)]
*  Actually, I know this isn't going to sit well with everybody, but I would rather in many [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1695.04s)]
*  cases see us harvesting wild animals and it would be more compatible with a healthy environment [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1701.16s)]
*  than cutting down all the trees in a rainforest so that we can run cattle. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1709.16s)]
*  Listen, I agree with you. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1713.52s)]
*  I'm on your side with that. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1714.96s)]
*  But there's not enough wild animals for everybody. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1717.2s)]
*  Well they're not, but there is something to be said for the hunting side. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1720.72s)]
*  Hunters get abused a lot by conservationists that become too emotionally involved with [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1728.08s)]
*  their animals. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1733.68s)]
*  People often ask me, you must really love bats. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1735.0s)]
*  No, I don't really love bats. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1738.76s)]
*  I'm a scientist who's very fascinated by them and I'm impressed with how valuable they are, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1741.1999999999998s)]
*  how much we need them. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1745.4399999999998s)]
*  But when I go out to do conservation, I'm looking out for both bats and people. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1747.36s)]
*  And I think that's the only way we can really be successful. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1752.7199999999998s)]
*  When we get too emotional about animals and we think they have rights that we need to [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1756.3999999999999s)]
*  look out for over human needs, then we start getting into trouble. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1761.1999999999998s)]
*  For example, years ago, I led the way in getting a national park created in American Samoa. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1771.0s)]
*  And how it all started was there were commercial hunters that were devastating flying foxes. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1780.28s)]
*  They were shooing them and selling them to Guam for a delicacy. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1786.36s)]
*  And in a very short time, they had wiped out most of the flying foxes from the whole area. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1790.88s)]
*  And I was asked by a then Harvard botanist graduate student who's finishing up his PhD [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1797.72s)]
*  if I would come and do something to help save the bats. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1805.72s)]
*  So I got together a couple donors and him and we went out to American Samoa. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1810.92s)]
*  And the first thing I did, the first day, my collaborators were all worn out from an [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1816.72s)]
*  overnight flight, so they slept in. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1822.44s)]
*  While they were sleeping in, I went out and made friends with the commercial hunters. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1824.8799999999999s)]
*  And I just came across another guy that was perfectly happy with hunting. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1829.28s)]
*  And in fact, I am sure as a population ecologist that we need hunters. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1838.36s)]
*  We've wiped out most of the dominant predators in the world, and if somebody doesn't act [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1845.76s)]
*  as the dominant predators, we're going to have trouble. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1849.84s)]
*  But I went out and I made friends with the hunters and they actually invited me to go [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1853.68s)]
*  out on a hunt with them that night. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1858.96s)]
*  Well, I didn't shoot any of the bats, but they only shot two in the whole evening and [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1860.36s)]
*  they were saying, oh, you should have been here last year. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1865.56s)]
*  We could have shot a hundred in an hour. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1868.84s)]
*  And I just asked innocent questions, you know, not too many of them at once. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1871.56s)]
*  What do you think caused all this? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1876.6s)]
*  And they readily admitted that they shot too many. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1879.48s)]
*  So, you know, eventually I'd ask, well, what are you going to do? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1883.5200000000002s)]
*  You know, your grandchildren are not going to be able to hunt bats anymore because you [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1887.44s)]
*  hunt them all out. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1891.3600000000001s)]
*  And after just a few nights, now, when my colleagues found out what I'd been doing, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1894.48s)]
*  oh, my God, if I'd been fireable, I would have been fired. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1900.64s)]
*  They were very upset that I had consorted with the enemy. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1905.72s)]
*  But in the end, these commercial hunters recognized they had a problem. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1910.16s)]
*  And they actually, when I told them that in a few days I was going to be meeting with [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1918.0800000000002s)]
*  Governor Lutale, they were thrilled when I offered to intercede with the governor on [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1922.74s)]
*  behalf of getting game laws to make sure there were flying foxes in the future. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1928.5400000000002s)]
*  We joined forces that way. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1934.3200000000002s)]
*  And as they learned more about the flying foxes and what they did, they not only got [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1936.84s)]
*  game laws passed in record time, but they self-imposed on themselves. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1942.36s)]
*  Well, actually, they completely outlawed commercial hunting. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1948.6399999999999s)]
*  The commercial hunters did. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1952.48s)]
*  And then they themselves declared a five-year moratorium on all flying fox hunting so that [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1954.6s)]
*  they could recover. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1959.6799999999998s)]
*  And when I asked about it of a Samoan biologist 25 years later, he said they still weren't [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1961.1200000000001s)]
*  hunting flying foxes, and the flying foxes had recovered. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1970.2s)]
*  I think there is some hunting now, but the point is, if we had just gone barreling in [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1973.92s)]
*  there that we hated these guys because they did something that we didn't like and they [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1982.24s)]
*  almost caused the extinction of a bat, we would have gotten nowhere. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1986.24s)]
*  If we had insisted that they quit all hunting immediately, we would have gotten nowhere. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1990.64s)]
*  But by being willing to compromise and see both sides early on, we gained a whole national [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=1995.08s)]
*  park in addition to solving our original problem and showed the value of making friends instead [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2001.24s)]
*  of winning battles. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2007.96s)]
*  The value of diplomacy. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2008.96s)]
*  So what did they hunt instead of the flying foxes? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2010.5s)]
*  What did they transition over to? [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2013.96s)]
*  They're commercial hunters. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2015.52s)]
*  Oh, they quit commercial hunting. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2017.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2019.68s)]
*  So are you curious? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2021.32s)]
*  Have you had bat before? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2023.32s)]
*  Have you eaten it? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2026.56s)]
*  This is something that... [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2028.8600000000001s)]
*  Is it difficult to discuss? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2029.8600000000001s)]
*  I guess I'm going to be honest with you. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2031.4s)]
*  Please do. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2034.28s)]
*  The reason I'm hesitant is that one time I was coming out of a news conference at National [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2035.28s)]
*  Geographic. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2039.16s)]
*  I've done five articles with them and they'd just done a news conference about my article [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2041.16s)]
*  on flying foxes. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2046.68s)]
*  As I was coming out of their front door, an Associated Press reporter approached me and [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2048.8s)]
*  said, well, you said that there's a real problem with people eating too many flying foxes. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2055.44s)]
*  Have you ever had one? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2059.7200000000003s)]
*  And being honest, I said, well, you know, in Thailand one morning I'd been out with [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2061.76s)]
*  poachers learning about what they were doing to cause problems. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2066.56s)]
*  And you know, they were doing something that I really wanted to stop, but they were really [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2070.84s)]
*  nice people. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2079.32s)]
*  The guys, the poachers were just trying to support their families and we got to be friends. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2080.76s)]
*  And they invited me for breakfast and what did they serve me? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2086.72s)]
*  Bat pancake, bat burger. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2090.0s)]
*  They chopped up the bats. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2094.68s)]
*  They did this with chickens and fish too. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2097.44s)]
*  They would chop them up bones and all. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2099.24s)]
*  My God, I used to kid some of them about how they survived without dying of punctured throats [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2100.8799999999997s)]
*  or stomachs from all those bones. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2107.8799999999997s)]
*  Well, they chopped up these patties. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2110.04s)]
*  And in Thailand, especially in those days, if you refused to eat what somebody served [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2112.9199999999996s)]
*  you, it was the ultimate insult. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2117.8799999999997s)]
*  You're implying that they were trying to poison you and you didn't trust them. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2119.68s)]
*  So I ended up trying to eat part of one of those burgers. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2124.16s)]
*  Well, I didn't get very far. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2132.52s)]
*  Is that your alarm that's telling you to take your pill? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2134.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's my alarm going off. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2136.7599999999998s)]
*  Remember where I was and... [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2140.04s)]
*  You were talking about eating bats. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2141.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm ready. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2143.3199999999997s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2144.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I've got Parkinson's and I have to take pills several times a day. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2145.32s)]
*  But I mentioned that I do have Parkinson's because I'd like to encourage others that [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2150.6000000000004s)]
*  have it that, you know, oftentimes if you've got something you're living for and you're [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2156.36s)]
*  working out, staying in health, you can still function perfectly fine taking a few pills [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2162.76s)]
*  and going on with your life. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2168.2400000000002s)]
*  I still travel the whole world. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2170.48s)]
*  I was in South Africa and Zambia just recently. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2172.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2175.04s)]
*  There's water right there. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2177.2s)]
*  So they take these bats and they just chop them up and turn them into patties and make [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2184.32s)]
*  burgers out of them? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2189.04s)]
*  That's what they were doing. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2190.52s)]
*  No, they're doing it...so they take the skin off of it? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2191.52s)]
*  Actually, I'm told that in the South Pacific it's considered bad etiquette if you don't [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2195.16s)]
*  eat the skin too. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2200.44s)]
*  But to finish these guys' story, I surreptitiously spit most of it out because I just wasn't [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2203.48s)]
*  about to swallow all those chopped up bones. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2211.56s)]
*  But I admitted that I had had a couple mouthfuls of bat. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2214.92s)]
*  This reporter went out and did a major story in which he claimed that Dr. Merlin Tuttle, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2220.24s)]
*  this famous bat conservationist, traveled the world looking for new ways to eat bats. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2226.92s)]
*  And I was so...I've never been so beside myself angry. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2234.2000000000003s)]
*  I went to a judge friend and asked if there was anything I could do and he said, no, no, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2238.0s)]
*  you're too well known as a public figure. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2244.32s)]
*  You're exempted. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2246.7200000000003s)]
*  You can't defend yourself that way. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2247.7200000000003s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2250.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2251.16s)]
*  So that's why I was a little hesitant when you asked me. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2252.16s)]
*  Well, I mean, that's the media for you. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2255.32s)]
*  It's not the media. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2258.6000000000004s)]
*  It's people that use the media and they're unscrupulous. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2259.6000000000004s)]
*  It's very discouraging. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2263.84s)]
*  That sucks. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2266.6800000000003s)]
*  But so what did it taste like? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2267.96s)]
*  You know, everybody says when you got something unusual like that, well, it was like chicken, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2272.6000000000004s)]
*  but I don't know what it tasted like. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2277.0s)]
*  I was so busy trying to get the bones out of my mouth. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2278.88s)]
*  And how do these people, did you ask them? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2281.84s)]
*  How do you guys deal with the bones? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2283.56s)]
*  They just swallow them? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2288.0s)]
*  No problem? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2289.0s)]
*  Yeah, I guess. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2290.0s)]
*  I mean, my Thai assistant, Sirupong Doanke, he was a great guy, but he never had any problem. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2291.0s)]
*  And although I must say he didn't eat bats while he was with me, but I do have a funny [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2299.44s)]
*  story to tell on him. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2307.16s)]
*  One of the caves that we ended up saving, we were going up to it early one morning before [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2308.56s)]
*  sunup and we're having to go through jumbled boulders and brush. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2315.2400000000002s)]
*  And I'm aware that snakes often congregate at cave entrances to try to catch and eat [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2320.32s)]
*  bats, especially in that area, cobras. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2325.56s)]
*  So I'm saying, Sirupong, are we OK? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2329.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, how about cobras here? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2334.8s)]
*  And he says, oh, no worry. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2337.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, when I was in the military, they taught us cobras gentle, no attack, no problem. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2342.96s)]
*  And then a few days later, I saw a man, we saw a man running real hard down the road. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2349.64s)]
*  And Sirupong says, man, run like chased by cobra. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2355.2s)]
*  And I said, well, I thought you said cobras don't attack people. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2361.52s)]
*  He said, oh, only when they're guarding their eggs. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2366.32s)]
*  I said, well, when do they have their eggs? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2370.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't remember. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2372.6800000000003s)]
*  So you were at the mouth of these caves where the cobras are. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2378.76s)]
*  That's where they like to hang out? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2385.1600000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2387.04s)]
*  They like to hang out and wait for bats to come out. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2387.76s)]
*  How do they catch them? [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2389.76s)]
*  Just snatch them out of the air? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2391.08s)]
*  Well, snakes usually, they'll like to hang from a vine or a bush or something where they [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2392.68s)]
*  can hang their head down into the flight plan of the bats. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2398.8399999999997s)]
*  And they'll wait until a wing touches their nose. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2402.0s)]
*  And then they can be incredibly fast about grabbing the bat. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2404.7999999999997s)]
*  You got video of that? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2408.7599999999998s)]
*  No, I have still pictures of bats being caught by snakes. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2411.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2415.3599999999997s)]
*  Can we see them? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2416.12s)]
*  I didn't bring any. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2418.8799999999997s)]
*  Is there any online? [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2420.24s)]
*  There are. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2423.24s)]
*  I have at least one picture of a snake eating a bat. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2424.8799999999997s)]
*  I remember it. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2427.56s)]
*  So mostly it's snakes that eat bats? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2428.52s)]
*  Is that what bats' number one predators are other than human beings? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2430.7999999999997s)]
*  In the United States, a major predator of bats [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2434.8799999999997s)]
*  are two major predators, feral cats and raccoons. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2437.52s)]
*  Feral cats kill everything. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2442.3999999999996s)]
*  And I could have brought a video that I. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2445.68s)]
*  So here we go. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2450.16s)]
*  You can't see it catch it, but it's caught. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2451.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's a python catching flying foxes. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2455.52s)]
*  That's a big, big bat too, boy. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2459.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2463.24s)]
*  It just crushes that poor little guy. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2463.7599999999998s)]
*  That's another one here too. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2465.16s)]
*  So it's on the ground. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2466.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2467.7599999999998s)]
*  So I know that people make bat soup too, right? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2469.12s)]
*  Isn't that a common thing in Asia? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2473.56s)]
*  I suppose you could say that. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2477.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, I'm not a guy who's out to stop all bat eating. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2481.72s)]
*  I think what we need to do is get balance in the world first. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2487.3199999999997s)]
*  If we can get some balance and compromise [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2491.0s)]
*  while we're getting the balance, then maybe eventually we [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2493.3199999999997s)]
*  get further where we want to go. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2495.6s)]
*  But I'm OK with eating bats as long as it's not done excessively. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2497.7999999999997s)]
*  If I could use eating bats as a reason for saving a colony, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2507.4s)]
*  I would be happy to advocate eating bats. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2512.84s)]
*  I want to do whatever it takes to keep nature in balance. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2516.52s)]
*  We live in a world where all these living things [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2520.36s)]
*  are interdependent. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2522.96s)]
*  And we can't afford to just love one and hate another. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2524.48s)]
*  We need them all. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2529.88s)]
*  And if we don't compromise some about what [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2531.6s)]
*  we want or the ones we love, we're [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2535.2799999999997s)]
*  probably going to lose them all. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2538.9199999999996s)]
*  That's a very good point. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2540.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2542.08s)]
*  And a thing that's brought up oftentimes about hunters [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2542.56s)]
*  is the conservation aspect of it, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2548.12s)]
*  is that in wanting to preserve these animals so they can hunt [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2550.4399999999996s)]
*  them, they actually contribute more money towards conservation [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2553.8399999999997s)]
*  than anyone does. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2557.16s)]
*  I know of cases like that. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2558.56s)]
*  For example, in Mexico, they have desert bighorn sheep. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2561.4s)]
*  I'm told that a good trophy-sized bighorn ram, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2567.32s)]
*  you might pay $100,000 to shoot one. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2572.44s)]
*  And I'm told that there's at least one and maybe [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2576.32s)]
*  several ranches now in Mexico where the owner has found that [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2580.6800000000003s)]
*  is more profitable to reduce his cattle [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2586.44s)]
*  and promote bighorn sheep. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2590.52s)]
*  And if he can make $100,000 for one sheep being shot, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2594.4s)]
*  he has to run a lot of cattle and go to a lot of work [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2600.64s)]
*  to make that kind of money off his cattle. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2603.2000000000003s)]
*  And so actually, I like these situations [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2605.88s)]
*  where there's economic incentive for preserving [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2611.2s)]
*  a wild animal. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2615.0s)]
*  I'm told that where that is happening, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2617.0s)]
*  that natural vegetation is recurring, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2619.08s)]
*  biodiversity is expanding. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2621.48s)]
*  Cattle aren't adapted to live in those places. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2624.52s)]
*  They do a lot of destruction. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2627.3999999999996s)]
*  But as long as the ultimate goal is [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2630.16s)]
*  that we're improving the health of the natural world [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2634.04s)]
*  and all creatures are benefiting, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2638.8s)]
*  I'm happy with whatever it takes to get there. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2644.28s)]
*  I am, too. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2646.4s)]
*  So what is this large coconut that you brought? [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2647.2400000000002s)]
*  What's the deal with that? [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2650.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, this isn't exactly a coconut. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2652.04s)]
*  What is it? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2654.0s)]
*  Now look here. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2655.84s)]
*  See how well this looks like it's all one piece? [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2656.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2660.76s)]
*  It's a perfect fit. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2663.04s)]
*  Now. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2664.2400000000002s)]
*  What is it? [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2665.0s)]
*  Inside. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2666.48s)]
*  That's not a coconut? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2668.04s)]
*  No. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2669.2s)]
*  Inside, you have, if this had just picked off the tree, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2670.8s)]
*  this would be a fruit. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2675.52s)]
*  And in each fruit, you'd have a seed. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2677.44s)]
*  This is exactly how Brazil nuts grow. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2679.8s)]
*  And the reason for all this armor plating around is this. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2684.72s)]
*  There is a bat with more than two foot wingspan [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2691.32s)]
*  that disperses the seeds of this tree. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2696.2000000000003s)]
*  And this tree doesn't, bats are such, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2700.12s)]
*  most people aren't aware of this, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2705.04s)]
*  but bats are by far the best, the most effective long distance [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2706.32s)]
*  seed dispersers and pollinators in the world. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2711.64s)]
*  More than bees? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2714.4s)]
*  Oh, much more. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2715.48s)]
*  Really? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2716.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2717.52s)]
*  And so here's what happens with this. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2718.7200000000003s)]
*  This hangs down like this, 100 feet up in a big tree. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2721.56s)]
*  So that's like a tree pod, like a pod for seeds. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2725.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2729.36s)]
*  And when it's ready to be seed dispersed, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2730.44s)]
*  it opens just a crack enough to let the scent out. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2734.04s)]
*  And there's this big bat that knows exactly [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2737.16s)]
*  how to pry this loose. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2739.32s)]
*  The reason for all this armor plating [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2742.48s)]
*  is that the plant does not want monkeys or other primates [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2744.52s)]
*  or parrots or other birds. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2749.28s)]
*  It just wants bats because bats are the best seed dispersers. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2752.1600000000003s)]
*  And so it's going to all this energetic trouble [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2755.92s)]
*  to protect itself from everything but bats. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2758.88s)]
*  The bat pries this off. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2761.52s)]
*  So that just kind of falls open. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2765.0400000000004s)]
*  It opens up a little bit, and then the bat [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2767.88s)]
*  pries it the rest of the way. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2769.92s)]
*  So it's almost like it's just a little built in door. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2771.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2773.6000000000004s)]
*  And then he carries this. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2774.32s)]
*  This would be a fruit. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2775.96s)]
*  This is dried with the seed inside. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2776.92s)]
*  He carries this away and drops the seed [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2779.36s)]
*  when he finishes eating. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2782.16s)]
*  And in fact, this nut that's in this fruit [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2784.32s)]
*  would be commercially sold if we could figure out [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2790.08s)]
*  how to beat the bats to it. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2792.6800000000003s)]
*  But it's grown way up high on trees, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2794.0s)]
*  and we don't have a system for beating the bats to it. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2796.08s)]
*  And this is Brazil nuts. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2800.28s)]
*  Can I see that? [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2801.64s)]
*  This is very similar to Brazil nuts. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2803.0s)]
*  Brazil nuts. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2806.8s)]
*  What is it called? [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2808.7200000000003s)]
*  Sapicaya. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2810.84s)]
*  And these are edible? [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2812.6400000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2813.92s)]
*  We can crack this sucker open and eat it? [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2814.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2816.2400000000002s)]
*  What's it taste like? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2817.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2818.1600000000003s)]
*  I've never eaten one. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2818.76s)]
*  Really? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2819.7200000000003s)]
*  But you have all these. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2820.2200000000003s)]
*  You're not curious? [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2821.7200000000003s)]
*  If I was you, I'd be eating bats and trying to eat these seeds. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2823.0800000000004s)]
*  I would eat them, but I've never been [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2825.0s)]
*  able to beat the bats to them. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2826.5600000000004s)]
*  And these aren't good? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2829.2000000000003s)]
*  The ones you have here in this thing, are they dried up? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2830.1600000000003s)]
*  They're dried up long since. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2832.44s)]
*  It's fascinating because it seems like it's been cut. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2834.92s)]
*  It's crazy that this is just a natural feature in the seed pod. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2837.88s)]
*  And the people that are not watching this, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2841.7200000000003s)]
*  just listening to this, it seems just like a coconut. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2844.88s)]
*  It's so thick and hard. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2848.08s)]
*  You can hear it here. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2850.36s)]
*  I'll knock on it. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2851.1600000000003s)]
*  Very hard and very big, like a bowling ball. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2853.1600000000003s)]
*  The coevolution between bats and plants [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2855.6400000000003s)]
*  is absolutely incredible. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2858.1600000000003s)]
*  We haven't talked at all about pollination. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2861.2400000000002s)]
*  This is just about seed dispersal. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2863.36s)]
*  There are flowers, a whole suite of different kinds of flowers, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2867.6s)]
*  that produce reflectors to guide bats to them on dark nights. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2872.6800000000003s)]
*  Flowers that bloom in dense foliage, where bats [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2879.48s)]
*  have a hard time finding them. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2884.6800000000003s)]
*  They produce reflectors out of either their petals [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2887.28s)]
*  or a leaf turned up the wrong way. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2891.52s)]
*  There's a vine in Cuba that the flowers hang down [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2894.92s)]
*  on a long stem. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2902.32s)]
*  And then the last leaf above where the flowers are [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2904.6s)]
*  turns exactly upside down. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2907.96s)]
*  Instead of going this way to catch sunlight [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2909.68s)]
*  to photosynthesize, it turns around this way [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2911.96s)]
*  and then acts as a reflector. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2915.48s)]
*  Let's see, that's one that does that, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2917.4s)]
*  but it's not the one I'm talking about. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2918.88s)]
*  But it's a similar effect. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2920.72s)]
*  The red one. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2921.7599999999998s)]
*  Now that's a hummingbird there, but look, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2923.12s)]
*  I want to show you something while we're on that. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2925.24s)]
*  See how the reproductive organs, the anthers and stigma, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2927.7599999999998s)]
*  are up there above the bird's head? [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2931.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, talking to Michael. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2933.9599999999996s)]
*  That bird is too small to fill the gap. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2935.08s)]
*  And I took over 400 pictures of that for National Geographic [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2937.6s)]
*  and never once saw one of those hummingbirds [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2941.8399999999997s)]
*  touch the reproductive organs of the flower. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2944.8399999999997s)]
*  It was thought for probably 100 years [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2947.3199999999997s)]
*  that this plant was pollinated by hummingbirds. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2949.52s)]
*  But when later I photographed bats coming to it, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2953.44s)]
*  the bats filled up that gap and got covered in pollen. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2958.04s)]
*  Wow, interesting. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2963.16s)]
*  Now, let's see, one of the flowers you first showed, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2965.08s)]
*  you can see all these on my website. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2969.56s)]
*  Merlin, Merlin, talking to the microphone. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2971.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2973.72s)]
*  You can see all these probably on my website. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2974.8s)]
*  Let's see, I'm trying to... [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2979.56s)]
*  Okay, watch this one, the one you've got up now. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2982.16s)]
*  That's that bad as pollen named mucuna flowers. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2985.72s)]
*  So all that stuff that's coming off of those flowers, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2989.04s)]
*  that's all the pollen. That's pollen. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2991.84s)]
*  And that's gonna get on him [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2993.32s)]
*  and then he's gonna disperse that. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2994.32s)]
*  Yeah, it took me 11,000 pictures to get that picture. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=2996.36s)]
*  That's an amazing picture. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3000.28s)]
*  Look at his tongue poking out. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3001.72s)]
*  National Geographic must have invested [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3003.08s)]
*  close to $70,000 in getting that. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3005.08s)]
*  Well, it's worth it. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3008.24s)]
*  I mean, it's really cool. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3009.72s)]
*  But I got a whole series where he's coming [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3010.64s)]
*  and see that turned up petal that's right in front of his tongue? [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3013.2799999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3016.7999999999997s)]
*  That's the reflector for that flower [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3017.64s)]
*  that guides the bat to find the flower. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3020.2s)]
*  It acts like airport landing lights on a runway [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3023.24s)]
*  for a pilot at night. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3025.92s)]
*  See, I've always, I mean, I don't know much about bat vision, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3027.2799999999997s)]
*  but I always thought bats had very poor vision [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3030.7599999999998s)]
*  and they used sound and they used like a radar [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3032.92s)]
*  to find where they're going. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3036.4s)]
*  They have quite good vision, most of them, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3037.92s)]
*  but in addition, they can see everything with sound [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3039.92s)]
*  that we can except color. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3043.2400000000002s)]
*  And they can see a lot more that we can't. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3046.0s)]
*  Like a bat would know if from the reflection off my hand [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3047.6800000000003s)]
*  that it was a soft surface [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3052.0s)]
*  as opposed to this mic being a hard surface. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3053.7200000000003s)]
*  Really? [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3056.44s)]
*  Because I had always heard that they used echolocation [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3058.32s)]
*  because their eyesight was poor. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3061.2400000000002s)]
*  That's really interesting. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3063.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3064.48s)]
*  Let me finish that story about that mucuna flower. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3065.32s)]
*  Sure. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3067.52s)]
*  The flower so wants to be pollinated. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3068.84s)]
*  I don't want to be anthropomorphic, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3071.92s)]
*  but it's very advantageous to be visited by, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3073.56s)]
*  oh, here's the other one. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3076.64s)]
*  See how the bat fills up the gap and carries pollen? [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3077.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3081.88s)]
*  In the mucuna flowers, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3083.48s)]
*  the flower doesn't even open and become reproductively active [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3088.4s)]
*  until about 45 minutes after dark [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3091.7599999999998s)]
*  so that it's totally avoiding any late coming hummingbirds [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3093.88s)]
*  or bees or anything like that. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3097.76s)]
*  It's on a long stem that hangs down [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3099.7200000000003s)]
*  so possums or anything like that can't get to it. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3101.96s)]
*  And it opens late, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3105.2000000000003s)]
*  and then it has just a little slit [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3107.2400000000002s)]
*  that's a millimeter or two wide. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3109.4s)]
*  And the tongue of the bat has to go into that [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3112.4s)]
*  just like a lock, a key in a door in a lock. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3115.52s)]
*  Wow. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3120.92s)]
*  That is fascinating. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3122.08s)]
*  That's a different kind of flower. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3124.04s)]
*  Look at the tongue on that guy. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3124.88s)]
*  Look over at the next one over in the picture there, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3126.88s)]
*  that one. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3129.56s)]
*  Okay, this bat is echo, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3131.2400000000002s)]
*  he's saying his echolocation sounds out through his nose, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3132.68s)]
*  and that leaf on his nose is aiming into the reflector. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3138.16s)]
*  And so that's guiding him in. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3142.12s)]
*  And then just below that is the slit I was telling you about [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3143.48s)]
*  that's just a millimeter or two wide. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3146.2000000000003s)]
*  And the bat has to perfectly get his tongue in that slit [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3148.2000000000003s)]
*  in order to get nectar or pollinate the flower. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3152.0s)]
*  Go to that other picture again, Jamie, the one you just said. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3155.2s)]
*  Right here on the corner, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3156.84s)]
*  you got the tongue going into the slit. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3158.16s)]
*  Go over one to the right. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3161.7200000000003s)]
*  No, the one you just had, go back. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3168.32s)]
*  Go back, go back. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3170.68s)]
*  There's the far right. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3173.04s)]
*  There you go. Yeah. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3174.52s)]
*  That one. That one. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3175.32s)]
*  Okay, there he's got his tongue in the slit. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3176.56s)]
*  Wow. Now. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3179.04s)]
*  So that it's almost like it's designed for a bat's tongue. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3180.0s)]
*  The reason it took me 11,000 pictures to get this [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3183.28s)]
*  is that this all happens in tiny fractions of a second. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3186.36s)]
*  And what's going to happen next is his tongue goes in there, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3189.68s)]
*  the flower actually has spring loaded anthers [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3193.2s)]
*  and fires the pollen onto his rump. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3196.84s)]
*  That's why you see it, pollen flying around [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3199.72s)]
*  as he's just been shot. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3202.52s)]
*  And by putting it on the bat's rump, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3204.84s)]
*  then that flower doesn't mix pollen with other species, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3208.08s)]
*  which might cause hybridization [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3210.96s)]
*  that would result in inferior plant production. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3212.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3216.88s)]
*  So at that location, I found some flowers, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3218.04s)]
*  they're all blooming at the same time, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3222.92s)]
*  but one species was the bat, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3224.64s)]
*  it put pollen on the bat's rump. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3227.94s)]
*  Another one put it on his throat. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3229.68s)]
*  Another one put it on his snout. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3231.64s)]
*  Another one put it on the back of his head. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3233.72s)]
*  And one put it between his shoulders. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3235.24s)]
*  And another one put it on his wings. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3237.88s)]
*  So they have very specific areas [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3239.76s)]
*  where they disperse their pollen specifically. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3241.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3244.1600000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3245.12s)]
*  You can see it. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3245.96s)]
*  Go back to that photo with the one with the tongue [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3246.8s)]
*  deep into the leaf. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3248.28s)]
*  You can see all... [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3250.8s)]
*  Look at that, that is crazy. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3252.08s)]
*  Now this one has a really cool tongue [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3254.28s)]
*  that acts like a soda straw. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3257.8s)]
*  And he can stick it down there [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3260.44s)]
*  and by, I think you'd call it peristaltic action, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3261.76s)]
*  he can bring the... [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3265.56s)]
*  He's got a groove down each side of the tongue [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3268.44s)]
*  and those grooves then form cavities like straws [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3271.48s)]
*  and he can bring the nectar up [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3275.52s)]
*  just like he had a long straw in the flower. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3278.3999999999996s)]
*  It's so fascinating that these flowers, [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3281.04s)]
*  it seems like they've evolved symbiotically with the bats. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3283.96s)]
*  Oh yes. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3289.3199999999997s)]
*  That's so fast. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3290.52s)]
*  I mean, how does that happen? [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3291.3599999999997s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3293.52s)]
*  I mean, I'm so... [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3294.48s)]
*  Look at him covered in pollen. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3296.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3297.7599999999998s)]
*  That looks like a bear that got into a bag of cereal. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3298.7599999999998s)]
*  Well now this illustrates what I'm saying [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3302.12s)]
*  when I talk about bats being the most, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3304.24s)]
*  by far the most efficient carriers [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3306.2s)]
*  of large amounts of pollen long distances. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3308.2s)]
*  Some bats fly over a hundred miles in a night [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3310.88s)]
*  pollinating flowers. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3314.4s)]
*  And look at how much more pollen [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3316.92s)]
*  a bat can carry on its fur [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3318.72s)]
*  than you'll see on a hummingbird or an insect. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3320.32s)]
*  For folks that are just listening, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3323.48s)]
*  he's covered like a bag of pollen [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3325.12s)]
*  just blew off in his face. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3327.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3329.9199999999996s)]
*  I mean, so, but it is absolutely fascinating [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3330.7599999999998s)]
*  that these bats and these flowers, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3334.3199999999997s)]
*  they seem to have symbiotically evolved. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3338.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3341.2s)]
*  Like what is the explanation for that? [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3342.04s)]
*  Like is there any theory as to how this takes place? [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3343.68s)]
*  Just natural selection, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3347.72s)]
*  brand of mutation. Dr. Darwin. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3349.16s)]
*  It's amazing, right? [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3350.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3352.72s)]
*  I find it mind boggling. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3353.64s)]
*  Not just, I can kind of understand the bats adapting, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3356.2s)]
*  but the plants, it's like the plants are almost thinking, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3360.04s)]
*  there's so and so over there that's doing this, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3363.7999999999997s)]
*  so I gotta do that. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3365.6s)]
*  Yeah, like they have a partnership. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3366.8799999999997s)]
*  It's truly amazing. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3368.7999999999997s)]
*  And not just a partnership with the bats, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3371.16s)]
*  but an understanding that other plants [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3373.3199999999997s)]
*  are gonna pollinate on different parts of the bat. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3375.8799999999997s)]
*  And you don't wanna mix your pollen with that pollen [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3378.7999999999997s)]
*  so we're gonna pollinate on an area [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3382.7200000000003s)]
*  when the bat is feeding, we know we can get to his head. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3384.08s)]
*  And this one's like, we'll get to his wings. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3387.16s)]
*  And this one's like, we'll get to his rump. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3389.08s)]
*  Well, I wouldn't go so far as to claim bats think, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3390.8s)]
*  but you know, the more we discover about the natural world, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3393.32s)]
*  the more we find that there's just a whole lot of thinking [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3396.56s)]
*  and behavior that we never even suspected. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3399.6s)]
*  For example, the bats, it's been found in recent years [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3402.56s)]
*  that they have social systems strikingly similar [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3407.0s)]
*  to those of primates, whales, and elephants. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3409.88s)]
*  Really? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3413.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3414.12s)]
*  Like they have an alpha bat and they have a bat leader. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3414.96s)]
*  Sure, they know each other. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3417.48s)]
*  In my own banding studies years ago, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3419.92s)]
*  I banded 40 some thousand bats in one study. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3422.12s)]
*  And I showed that over periods of a decade, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3425.6800000000003s)]
*  sometimes you'd find the same bats [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3429.56s)]
*  that like you caught four or five bats together [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3431.52s)]
*  in a place at one time, 10 years before. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3434.44s)]
*  And then you might catch them five years later, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3438.7599999999998s)]
*  two miles away, 10 years later, 20 miles away, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3442.48s)]
*  all still together. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3446.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3448.8399999999997s)]
*  And bats not only know each other and have what we, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3449.7999999999997s)]
*  you know, we used to criticize people soundly [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3454.68s)]
*  for what we call anthropomorphizing, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3459.0s)]
*  but that's almost getting to be an out-of-date word [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3462.12s)]
*  as we find more about what animals really do and think. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3467.3199999999997s)]
*  Bats help each other in need. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3472.68s)]
*  They'll adopt orphans. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3476.48s)]
*  They form apparently long-term friendships. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3478.8399999999997s)]
*  There are all kinds of cool things [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3482.48s)]
*  that are going on in the world of bats. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3484.92s)]
*  So our previous thoughts about bats, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3486.7999999999997s)]
*  that they're primitive, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3490.52s)]
*  it's really just based on a lack of examination. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3491.64s)]
*  Lack of understanding for sure. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3494.7999999999997s)]
*  One thing I would like to point out to your listeners, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3497.96s)]
*  all these things that we're talking about [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3501.8399999999997s)]
*  in these pictures you're seeing, [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3503.8399999999997s)]
*  I have thousands of those pictures available [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3505.44s)]
*  on my website at merlintuttle.org. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3507.7999999999997s)]
*  And you can go there and see all these things [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3510.64s)]
*  that you're seeing glimpses of now. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3513.3599999999997s)]
*  Now, are there some bats that are more complex [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3516.16s)]
*  than other bats that are more intelligent than other bats? [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3519.72s)]
*  Well, let me tell you an interesting story. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3522.92s)]
*  After I learned to train frog-eating bats for my research, [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3526.08s)]
*  I thought, well, these carnivores are just, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3531.3199999999997s)]
*  they're smarter than other bats. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3533.68s)]
*  And it never dawned on me that other bats [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3536.08s)]
*  might be trainable too, especially really small bats. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3538.6s)]
*  And then one time I went out to West Texas [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3543.48s)]
*  and I caught a fairly large pallid bat [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3546.84s)]
*  and I wanted to take a picture for National Geographic [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3549.24s)]
*  of it catching centipedes six, eight inches long. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3552.3599999999997s)]
*  They're immune to the stings [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3556.08s)]
*  and they eat centipedes and scorpions. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3557.48s)]
*  And so I was trained this bat to come to my hand on call [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3559.92s)]
*  because I was gonna put in a natural looking set, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3564.4s)]
*  a centipede, and call it to come down [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3568.7599999999998s)]
*  and catch the centipede to get the picture. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3570.96s)]
*  And after the bat finally got too full [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3573.4s)]
*  to wanna come again, I had this little Western pimpestrel [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3577.4s)]
*  that weighs less than a nickel, tiny little bat, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3581.16s)]
*  body about that big. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3585.44s)]
*  So you're holding up the tip of your pinky. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3587.64s)]
*  Yeah, and that bat had been in my portable studio [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3589.8399999999997s)]
*  watching me train the bigger bat. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3595.72s)]
*  And when the bigger bat decided not to come on call, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3598.08s)]
*  the little bat came and got the reward. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3600.7999999999997s)]
*  And I couldn't believe it. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3602.72s)]
*  Here was this little guy that I was sure [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3603.7999999999997s)]
*  didn't have enough intelligence to be trained [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3605.72s)]
*  and it trained by just watching me train another bat. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3607.92s)]
*  Wow. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3611.6800000000003s)]
*  And let me- [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3613.4s)]
*  Do you think it's watching and observing [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3614.2400000000002s)]
*  or do you think there's some other information [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3616.28s)]
*  that might be being distributed, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3618.64s)]
*  whether it's through sound or whether it's through [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3622.04s)]
*  some sort of, maybe some sort of like [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3626.16s)]
*  some unknown connection that they have to each other, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3629.96s)]
*  pheromonal connection, psychic connection? [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3633.36s)]
*  Well, pheromones certainly play a role, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3636.32s)]
*  but mostly everything that I've seen, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3639.76s)]
*  I would ascribe to intelligence and thinking. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3643.96s)]
*  Let me- An observation. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3647.56s)]
*  Let me tell you a story that really still boggles my mind. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3649.48s)]
*  My wife and I had gone to Borneo [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3653.96s)]
*  and set up my portable photo studio. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3655.88s)]
*  We were gonna photograph little wooly bats [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3659.88s)]
*  that weigh less than a nickel. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3662.56s)]
*  Again, tiny, tiny little guys. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3665.08s)]
*  And they live out in swamps where there's no way [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3667.16s)]
*  we could go out in the swamp to photograph. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3670.2799999999997s)]
*  And they live in pitcher plants. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3672.16s)]
*  And get this, the pitcher plant puts up a reflector [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3673.84s)]
*  over the top to guide the bat to get to the pitcher plant [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3678.16s)]
*  and then has a special ridge inside where he can sleep, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3681.4s)]
*  almost like providing a bunk bed. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3684.52s)]
*  And we had gone out there to photograph these bats, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3687.4s)]
*  but we couldn't do it out in the swamp [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3690.36s)]
*  because it rained every little bit [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3691.8s)]
*  and you're wading waist deep [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3693.3599999999997s)]
*  and there are poisonous snakes hanging from the vines [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3694.68s)]
*  and it just wasn't a good place to take pictures. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3697.2s)]
*  So we caught this bat, brought it back to my studio. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3699.64s)]
*  And the first evening I hand fed it mealworms, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3703.72s)]
*  holding it one hand and handing it mealworms to the other. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3706.64s)]
*  And then the next morning when my wife [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3710.56s)]
*  and I came back to the studio, [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3713.0s)]
*  this bat was hanging up in one corner of the studio [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3715.12s)]
*  and it immediately recognized me. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3718.8399999999997s)]
*  It didn't try to go to her. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3720.8799999999997s)]
*  She didn't feed it before. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3722.44s)]
*  It came to me and started bumping me in the nose. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3724.96s)]
*  In fact, I believe you may have a video of that [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3728.4s)]
*  that you can share. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3732.64s)]
*  He started bumping me in the nose [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3733.96s)]
*  and I don't know how I so quickly figured it out, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3737.56s)]
*  but I figured out that he wanted to be fed. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3741.48s)]
*  He wasn't really attacking me. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3743.44s)]
*  And so my wife saw this and said, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3745.44s)]
*  get your shirt on, it was really hot [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3751.24s)]
*  and I didn't have a shirt on. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3753.3199999999997s)]
*  And get your shirt on and she grabbed a camera, [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3755.12s)]
*  watch this bat. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3759.0s)]
*  He's coming up pestering me to give him a mealworm. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3760.4799999999996s)]
*  He's only one time in his whole life eating a mealworm, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3765.12s)]
*  only one time gotten it from me. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3768.4799999999996s)]
*  And how did he figure out that my face [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3771.0s)]
*  was the place to get my attention? [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3773.0s)]
*  And so I went and got my shirt on, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3775.3599999999997s)]
*  she grabbed and it was still doing this. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3777.72s)]
*  When I held up my hand, it knew to come and get the mealworm. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3780.28s)]
*  And this bat had never had a mealworm in his life before, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3783.84s)]
*  may never have eaten a non-flying insect before, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3786.6000000000004s)]
*  certainly never seen a human until the night before. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3789.4s)]
*  Absolutely mind boggling. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3793.32s)]
*  Wow, that's wild. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3795.1600000000003s)]
*  So that it just learned. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3797.84s)]
*  It learned and it remembered you. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3800.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3802.0400000000004s)]
*  So have you tried other kinds of experiments to see, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3803.2000000000003s)]
*  you know how they've done experiments with crows, [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3808.2s)]
*  where they find out how intelligent crows are [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3811.12s)]
*  because they can get them to use tools [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3813.08s)]
*  and there's a little cough button if you wanna use that. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3814.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm okay, thank you. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3816.96s)]
*  But there's, they've done all these experiments with crows [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3818.6s)]
*  and found out that crows are incredibly intelligent [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3822.8799999999997s)]
*  and much more intelligent than we ever suspected. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3825.3999999999996s)]
*  Do you think that would be the case with bats as well, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3828.2s)]
*  that you could get them to do things? [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3830.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3832.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't know what you could get them to do, [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3834.3199999999997s)]
*  it had to be something in line with what they, [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3836.32s)]
*  I can't comment. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3839.28s)]
*  What I can tell you is that one of the smartest colleagues [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3841.44s)]
*  that I ever had, guy named Jack Bradbury, [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3844.04s)]
*  he was a top-notch bat researcher. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3848.0s)]
*  He ended up going off studying, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3850.36s)]
*  I think it was grouse or something. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3852.2000000000003s)]
*  But back when he was studying bats many years ago, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3854.6000000000004s)]
*  he announced that he was going to try to test [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3859.0800000000004s)]
*  Vampirem Spectrum, this is a big carnivorous bat [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3862.04s)]
*  with a nearly three-foot wingspan, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3865.44s)]
*  it's the biggest new world bat, [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3868.04s)]
*  lives in the tropical America. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3869.56s)]
*  He was gonna test them to see how smart they were. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3872.0s)]
*  And this is a cool bat, before I tell you about his test, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3876.44s)]
*  the parents take turns babysitting, [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3880.8s)]
*  they go out and they hunt and bring food back [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3883.56s)]
*  for the one that stayed and watched the pup. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3885.36s)]
*  They appear to have made for life. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3888.8s)]
*  And their carnivores eat everything from insects [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3891.0s)]
*  and frogs to rats and parrots. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3896.28s)]
*  And this is a vampire bat? [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3898.48s)]
*  It's not a vampire bat, it's named Vampirem Spectrum [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3900.28s)]
*  because somebody mistook its big teeth [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3903.52s)]
*  and thought that it was a vampire when they named it. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3905.4s)]
*  And what is it? [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3907.84s)]
*  You wanna tell more about this bat? [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3908.6800000000003s)]
*  Well. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3910.44s)]
*  Is that what this is? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3911.28s)]
*  Is that this kind of bat? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3912.1200000000003s)]
*  No, that is a vampire bat. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3912.94s)]
*  Oh. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3913.78s)]
*  It just switched this. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3914.6200000000003s)]
*  That is a vampire bat. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3915.44s)]
*  That bat is crazy, play that. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3916.52s)]
*  It's on a horse, I think. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3920.8s)]
*  Oh, what a little creep. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3923.1200000000003s)]
*  Well, hang on a minute. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3924.68s)]
*  Let's stick with one story until we get it. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3926.4s)]
*  Stick with your first one. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3929.68s)]
*  The Vampirem Spectrum, what's, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3930.52s)]
*  you know, there's a whole bunch of bats named Vampirem, [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3932.48s)]
*  named with vampire type names, scientifically. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3935.72s)]
*  Not a single one of them is a true vampire. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3938.66s)]
*  They're all mistakenly named vampires. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3941.1s)]
*  So the one I was originally telling you about [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3944.72s)]
*  is not a vampire, it's a carnivore. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3947.04s)]
*  But this colleague of mine that I so highly respected [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3949.48s)]
*  announced that he was gonna do some tests [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3952.52s)]
*  to test the intelligence of this species of bat. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3954.4s)]
*  I saw him a year later and said, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3959.04s)]
*  well, how'd your research go? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3960.84s)]
*  He laughed, shook his head, and said, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3963.56s)]
*  I gave it up, the bat was smarter than I was. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3966.12s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3968.68s)]
*  What was wrong with the test? [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3970.96s)]
*  Like, why did he say the bat was smarter than him? [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3972.88s)]
*  He would design a test that he thought the bat couldn't, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3975.16s)]
*  you know, would have to do it a certain way. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3978.86s)]
*  And then the bat would find an alternative. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3982.04s)]
*  Wow. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3984.92s)]
*  So there's carnivorous bats, there's bats that eat fruit, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3985.84s)]
*  and then why do we call bats vampire bats? [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3989.96s)]
*  Did we initially think at one point in time [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3993.84s)]
*  they were sucking blood? [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3995.84s)]
*  There are some vampire bats. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3997.0s)]
*  They're found only in Latin America now. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=3998.72s)]
*  Oh, so they're real? [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4000.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4001.68s)]
*  We were just looking at a vampire bat a moment ago. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4002.68s)]
*  Okay, so these guys with the teeth. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4005.4s)]
*  That's a real vampire bat. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4007.68s)]
*  And so they actually bite animals and suck their blood? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4009.32s)]
*  Lap their blood. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4013.28s)]
*  What is this that we're looking at? [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4015.96s)]
*  That's the kind of special tongue [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4017.6000000000004s)]
*  that a vampire bat has for that. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4019.3s)]
*  Oh, whoa. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4020.6400000000003s)]
*  Now, before you get too put off by vampire bats, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4022.1600000000003s)]
*  let me point- I'm not put off, I'm excited. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4024.84s)]
*  Let me point out that these are really sophisticated animals [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4026.6000000000004s)]
*  that in every way, they're the ones that were first found [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4030.8s)]
*  to have altruistic relationships with friends [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4035.28s)]
*  and help them and even feed them in times of need. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4039.5600000000004s)]
*  They adopt orphans. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4043.76s)]
*  These are animals that- [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4046.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4048.0s)]
*  They're always- [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4049.32s)]
*  Now, you didn't get this from my website. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4051.92s)]
*  No, no, no, this is YouTube. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4054.0400000000004s)]
*  If you went to my website, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4055.76s)]
*  one of the cutest pictures on my website, [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4057.28s)]
*  one that I get a big kick out of showing people, [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4059.8s)]
*  because when I show it to them, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4063.1200000000003s)]
*  their reaction is, oh my God, isn't he cute? [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4066.24s)]
*  And it's a vampire. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4067.9599999999996s)]
*  It depends on how you show these bats. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4069.24s)]
*  They're right there at the bottom. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4071.3999999999996s)]
*  That's a vampire. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4073.08s)]
*  All right, not that one. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4075.7999999999997s)]
*  That one, that's a vampire. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4078.08s)]
*  He's very cute. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4080.4399999999996s)]
*  And just how you show these animals- [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4081.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, you're very defensive, [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4084.16s)]
*  because I don't have a problem with them being vampires. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4085.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, I don't have a problem with- [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4087.8399999999997s)]
*  Now, the first one you're looking at [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4091.2s)]
*  that was lapping blood, [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4093.2799999999997s)]
*  that was Desmodus rotundus. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4095.7999999999997s)]
*  It's fascinating. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4097.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, I don't have a problem with it. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4098.599999999999s)]
*  I think it's really interesting. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4100.24s)]
*  It's the kind of vampire that causes most of the trouble, [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4101.599999999999s)]
*  that gets vampires in trouble in Latin America. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4104.5599999999995s)]
*  They're a problem because we came in [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4107.16s)]
*  and cut down the rainforest and brought in cattle, [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4108.84s)]
*  and they overpopulated [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4111.24s)]
*  because they had an easy food supply. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4112.76s)]
*  Okay, so that's what they're causing trouble [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4115.96s)]
*  down in Latin America, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4118.32s)]
*  because there's so many of them? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4119.599999999999s)]
*  They're overpopulated because we screwed up the habitat [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4121.599999999999s)]
*  and brought in easy food. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4125.08s)]
*  Well, not you and I. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4125.92s)]
*  Someone else did it. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4127.2s)]
*  Well, we kind of do it [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4128.36s)]
*  because we buy the beef from Latin America [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4130.36s)]
*  that it's a roundabout chain. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4132.48s)]
*  So these bats that prey on the cattle, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4135.58s)]
*  do they carry diseases? [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4139.84s)]
*  Are they a problem in some way? [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4141.84s)]
*  Not commonly. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4145.639999999999s)]
*  You can get rabies from a vampire bat. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4147.84s)]
*  You can get rabies from any mammal, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4151.56s)]
*  but rabies has been vastly exaggerated in bats. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4154.56s)]
*  For example, here in the United States, [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4159.96s)]
*  there was a time when people thought that all bats [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4161.64s)]
*  or most of them were rabid, [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4163.96s)]
*  but in fact, put this in perspective, [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4165.74s)]
*  only one or two people in a year [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4169.66s)]
*  in all of the US and Canada combined [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4172.68s)]
*  die of rabies from a bat. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4175.58s)]
*  And those people die because they picked up a sick one, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4177.78s)]
*  got bit in self-defense and didn't use good sense [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4180.82s)]
*  and go get checked out. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4183.94s)]
*  And there's a vaccination you can take [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4186.1s)]
*  that would be 100% effective. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4188.54s)]
*  I read a story about a guy who was outside of a cave [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4191.0199999999995s)]
*  and bats flew by and scratched him. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4194.86s)]
*  And then he wound up getting rabies from that. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4197.62s)]
*  Sounds like a bit of an exaggeration [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4201.46s)]
*  maybe taken a bit out of context. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4204.54s)]
*  Oh yeah, I already died. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4206.54s)]
*  Well, if you get rabies, you're gonna die, [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4209.42s)]
*  but most of the time you will. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4211.8s)]
*  But take me for example. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4214.3s)]
*  I've been studying bats for over 60 years worldwide. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4217.22s)]
*  I've studied bats in 45 countries, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4220.4400000000005s)]
*  photographed hundreds of species, [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4223.08s)]
*  handled them, spent countless hours with millions in caves. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4225.6s)]
*  And I have never ever been attacked by a bat. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4229.34s)]
*  I have only been bitten when I was handling one [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4233.5s)]
*  and he bit in self-defense. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4235.82s)]
*  Did you ever see a rabid bat? [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4237.38s)]
*  Yes. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4239.86s)]
*  How would you be able to discern [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4240.68s)]
*  whether a bat is rabid in the wild? [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4242.72s)]
*  I probably could not only, it would be a good guess, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4245.56s)]
*  but I'm sure that I have seen a rabid bat. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4248.46s)]
*  They're not a whole lot with rabies. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4252.5s)]
*  When you sample wild populations, [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4255.98s)]
*  actually one of the things that bats get a bad name for [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4258.1s)]
*  is it's much easier to catch a sick bat than a healthy bat. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4261.5s)]
*  So when they go out and catch bats and they say, [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4264.9s)]
*  well, up to a half of 1% are rabid. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4267.46s)]
*  What that's like is if you go to the waiting room [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4271.58s)]
*  of a cancer specialist doctor [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4274.66s)]
*  and you examine the people there, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4277.38s)]
*  you're gonna get a bit higher frequency of cancer [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4279.1s)]
*  than you would from the base population. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4281.62s)]
*  We don't really know how many have rabies, [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4284.34s)]
*  but what we can tell you is it's very few. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4286.74s)]
*  You can forget disease from bats just about entirely [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4290.1s)]
*  if you just don't go around picking up. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4293.78s)]
*  If you find a bat where you can handle it in the daytime, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4296.74s)]
*  it's probably a sick bat. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4299.1s)]
*  Don't handle it. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4300.74s)]
*  You leave it alone. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4301.74s)]
*  You got no problem. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4302.9s)]
*  They don't attack people. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4304.06s)]
*  We probably shouldn't be out there handling bats anyway [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4305.66s)]
*  unless you're a bat scientist, right? [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4307.66s)]
*  Well, you shouldn't handle unfamiliar animals. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4308.62s)]
*  Let me point out that while we make a big deal [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4311.42s)]
*  out of the one or two people in a year [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4314.62s)]
*  that die of rabies from a bat bite, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4316.54s)]
*  the US and Canada combined, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4318.42s)]
*  in the US alone, we lose between 40 and 50 people a year [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4320.26s)]
*  from dog attacks. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4325.74s)]
*  But before I would, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4328.42s)]
*  before we go on a rampage to rid dogs from our neighborhoods, [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4330.26s)]
*  we might consider how hypocritical that would be [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4334.34s)]
*  in a country where our spouses kill us off by the thousands. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4336.7s)]
*  So the moral of the story is [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4341.38s)]
*  if you're brave enough to own a dog and get married, [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4342.900000000001s)]
*  you certainly ought to be brave enough to handle [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4345.900000000001s)]
*  having a few bats in your neighborhood. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4347.78s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4349.98s)]
*  It's all about numbers, right? [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4351.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4352.42s)]
*  So these vampire bats, [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4353.259999999999s)]
*  do any of them prey on humans? [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4357.0599999999995s)]
*  Do any of them try to bite humans [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4360.099999999999s)]
*  and drink the blood of humans? [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4362.34s)]
*  The common vampire, Desmodus rotundus, will bite humans. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4364.34s)]
*  But the humans have to be doing something foolish. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4368.0199999999995s)]
*  It's not like if you're camping [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4371.42s)]
*  and you just take a nap in a hammock [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4372.66s)]
*  and a vampire bat comes and bites you. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4374.54s)]
*  Well, I would certainly, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4376.5s)]
*  I've taken plenty, I've slept plenty a night [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4378.54s)]
*  in a hammock in the rainforest, [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4380.9800000000005s)]
*  but never without a mosquito net over me. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4382.94s)]
*  There are a whole lot of things that can bite you [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4385.66s)]
*  besides vampire bats. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4387.34s)]
*  And it's just foolish to be sleeping out in the open [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4389.14s)]
*  in a South American rainforest. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4392.78s)]
*  And that's where most of the vampire bats are? [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4396.86s)]
*  They're all limited to Latin America. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4400.1s)]
*  Really? [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4402.26s)]
*  So this idea of vampire bats being in Romania, [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4403.1s)]
*  where Dracula lived. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4407.42s)]
*  The original vampire stories came from tales [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4408.5s)]
*  about horrible behavior in humans. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4411.14s)]
*  Like Vlad the Impaler? [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4414.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4416.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4417.26s)]
*  But bats, how did they get connected to bats? [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4418.3s)]
*  Do you know the story of the origins of the lore? [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4420.62s)]
*  Apparently vampire bats weren't discovered until, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4423.66s)]
*  I think it was Columbus, when we first came to America [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4427.18s)]
*  and they heard about bats biting people. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4430.66s)]
*  But long before that, the vampire stories [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4432.78s)]
*  and myths had evolved based on human behavior. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4435.7s)]
*  And so that's just something that just got spread [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4439.9s)]
*  and turned into this lore. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4445.099999999999s)]
*  And they don't even exist in the place [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4447.22s)]
*  where they were supposedly like turned into vampires. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4448.94s)]
*  Yeah, even in Latin America, [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4451.42s)]
*  vampires are a small proportion of the species present. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4453.74s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4457.86s)]
*  So what's the most common bat in the world? [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4458.78s)]
*  That's a hard one to say. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4462.900000000001s)]
*  The largest colonies we know are free-tailed bats, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4465.900000000001s)]
*  particularly the species that lives [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4471.22s)]
*  under our Congress Avenue Bridge. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4472.820000000001s)]
*  We have colonies of those that get up to 10, [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4476.5s)]
*  20 million in one cave. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4479.02s)]
*  And that opens the discussion for why bats [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4481.540000000001s)]
*  are the most endangered animals, [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4485.820000000001s)]
*  are among the most endangered animals on our planet. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4488.42s)]
*  What if we have 1.5 million of them living under Congress? [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4491.22s)]
*  How do we say that they're endangered? [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4494.820000000001s)]
*  Well, they're extremely vulnerable. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4498.06s)]
*  First of all, they're among the least known, [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4501.02s)]
*  most feared, most often needlessly persecuted animals. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4503.54s)]
*  Secondly, they have very slow reproductive rates. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4506.780000000001s)]
*  They are programmed to live up to 40 years or more. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4510.7s)]
*  And that brings up another interesting aspect. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4515.26s)]
*  Instead of trying to find ways to fear bats, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4517.9400000000005s)]
*  we ought to be finding ways to understand better [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4520.22s)]
*  why they can do the really neat things that they can do. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4523.1s)]
*  They can survive up to 40 years in the wild, [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4527.5s)]
*  and that's the equivalent of a human living to be 100 [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4532.740000000001s)]
*  and still able to run sprints through obstacle courses. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4536.46s)]
*  They're also largely immune to things [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4540.1s)]
*  like arthritis and cancer. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4543.06s)]
*  But they're very vulnerable because they're dependent [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4546.7s)]
*  on long lifespans and slow reproduction. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4550.900000000001s)]
*  Most bats produce only one pup per year. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4552.9800000000005s)]
*  They aggregate in these huge concentrations. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4556.26s)]
*  You can get millions in a single cave. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4558.700000000001s)]
*  And here in the New World, [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4561.1s)]
*  I personally investigated cases where somebody [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4563.46s)]
*  just put old car tires in a cave entrance, [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4568.700000000001s)]
*  poured kerosene on it, lit it on fire, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4571.780000000001s)]
*  and killed millions in single incidents. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4574.740000000001s)]
*  Because bats form the largest, most conspicuous colonies [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4578.78s)]
*  are the most easily seen and also misunderstood [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4583.46s)]
*  and have slow reproduction, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4589.34s)]
*  they're prime targets for bad things to happen [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4590.7s)]
*  in terms of survival. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4593.66s)]
*  What is the common reason why people are killing bats? [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4595.139999999999s)]
*  Someone would go out of their way to do something like that, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4598.0199999999995s)]
*  like light tires on fire to kill them. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4599.86s)]
*  Fear. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4601.9s)]
*  Fear, misconceptions. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4602.74s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4603.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4604.82s)]
*  Nobody who fully understood bats [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4605.64s)]
*  would be out there killing them. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4607.4800000000005s)]
*  And when they're lighting these fires, [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4609.76s)]
*  it's just the smoke that's killing the bats? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4611.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, toxic smoke a lot. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4613.88s)]
*  What is this tube that you brought? [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4617.400000000001s)]
*  You said there's something crazy in there. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4619.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4622.0s)]
*  I bet you never seen anything like this on your show before. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4623.280000000001s)]
*  I bet you're right. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4625.88s)]
*  What is it? [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4626.96s)]
*  Well, I don't wanna sidetrack the whole conversation here [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4628.400000000001s)]
*  but I've had a lot of really wild adventure experiences [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4633.4s)]
*  while looking for bats. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4637.36s)]
*  This is a Yanomamo Indians arrowhead container. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4639.32s)]
*  Notice the top of it is made out of ocelot [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4645.46s)]
*  for the fur still on the hide on the inside. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4647.98s)]
*  And if we look in here, [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4653.08s)]
*  this is an arrowhead. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4658.08s)]
*  Now, that is coated in curare. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4660.88s)]
*  That's not still lethal because it's very old. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4669.28s)]
*  I've had it for decades. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4671.839999999999s)]
*  But when I first got it, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4674.0s)]
*  if somebody had poked you with it, [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4675.5599999999995s)]
*  you'd be dead in a couple of minutes. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4677.82s)]
*  Really? [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4679.639999999999s)]
*  And that is made specifically to kill humans. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4680.48s)]
*  Notice the notches. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4683.599999999999s)]
*  Every few inches, you see the three notches? [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4685.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4688.88s)]
*  Where your thumb, your base thumb is, [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4689.8s)]
*  that's where it fits into the end of the arrow, the shaft. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4692.08s)]
*  And then when that hits you, [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4695.400000000001s)]
*  it can't just go through and not poison you. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4698.52s)]
*  It's very clever. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4701.6s)]
*  It like shrapnel into you. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4703.16s)]
*  So once that arrow hits you, no matter where it hits you, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4707.2s)]
*  you're gonna die because you've got all that [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4709.68s)]
*  like shrapnel that's soaked in curare in you. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4711.8s)]
*  Wow. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4715.84s)]
*  So in my travels studying bats, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4716.88s)]
*  I have had every kind of experience you can imagine [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4723.12s)]
*  from living with Aboriginal Indians [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4727.32s)]
*  to being captured by terrorist insurgents to- [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4731.400000000001s)]
*  You got captured? [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4736.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, having my camp attacked by bandits, [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4737.400000000001s)]
*  being hunted by Aborigines that didn't want, [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4741.92s)]
*  that had bad experience with other outsiders [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4744.8s)]
*  and wanted to kill me, [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4747.84s)]
*  being charged by angry elephants, stalked by lions. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4750.360000000001s)]
*  You name it and I've had it. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4754.68s)]
*  Tell me about being captured. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4756.4800000000005s)]
*  What happened there? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4758.12s)]
*  Well, that's a really good story to illustrate [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4759.08s)]
*  the value of being able to make friends, [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4762.04s)]
*  whether you agree with somebody or not. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4765.84s)]
*  Back in my first big job out of college, [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4769.56s)]
*  I was co-director of the Smithsonian's Venezuelan project, [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4772.48s)]
*  a big $400,000 field project collecting small mammals. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4776.32s)]
*  And one of the first places we stayed [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4781.4s)]
*  was high up on a mountain top in a resort setting [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4784.599999999999s)]
*  where the previous dictator of the country had built this. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4789.36s)]
*  And when he was thrown out of power, [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4792.4s)]
*  nobody wanted to acknowledge that that was worth anything. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4795.4s)]
*  So it was just sitting up there with a caretaker. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4798.599999999999s)]
*  Well, we were allowed to go up there [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4801.28s)]
*  and use it for collecting. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4803.92s)]
*  It was beautiful habitat surrounding it. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4806.639999999999s)]
*  And I quickly found out, figured out [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4810.12s)]
*  that the head caretaker there was actually [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4815.36s)]
*  one of the local communist leaders. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4818.48s)]
*  And we got to be good friends. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4821.92s)]
*  And he would laughingly call me his young, [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4825.36s)]
*  his amigo Yonkey, and I'd call him me amigo commie. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4830.12s)]
*  And it wasn't very hard to find common ground [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4834.5599999999995s)]
*  that neither one of us agreed with everything [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4841.599999999999s)]
*  our governments did. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4843.4s)]
*  And I got to be such good friends with him [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4845.24s)]
*  that when my boss, Dr. Hanley came down, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4848.719999999999s)]
*  he was the director of the mammal division [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4851.24s)]
*  at the Smithsonian, when he came down to visit [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4853.92s)]
*  and see how things were going, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4856.2s)]
*  I borrowed the local communist leader, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4858.28s)]
*  borrowed his Jeep, because ours hadn't arrived yet. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4862.5599999999995s)]
*  And I took Dr. Hanley with me, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4866.32s)]
*  looking for bats up in the mountains. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4868.96s)]
*  And we had the misfortune of running into a secret meeting [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4870.599999999999s)]
*  of communist insurgents. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4873.28s)]
*  They're in suit of wild chase. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4876.12s)]
*  We're on a muddy, slick road, very narrow one lane, [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4878.5599999999995s)]
*  sometimes dropping off 200 feet on one side. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4882.0s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4885.0s)]
*  They finally caught us. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4886.72s)]
*  And when they caught us, the only thing that saved us [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4888.6s)]
*  was we were in the communist party boss's Jeep, [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4890.8s)]
*  and they radioed him for instructions what to do with us. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4895.2s)]
*  Wow. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4898.76s)]
*  So if you were just in an unmarked car. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4899.76s)]
*  Right, we'd have been in big trouble. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4902.280000000001s)]
*  At that time, the insurgents were killing [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4904.08s)]
*  an average of 65 police a year on the streets of Caracas. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4907.2s)]
*  And what did they think you guys were up to? [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4913.12s)]
*  Well, they knew that we were friends of their leader. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4916.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4920.0s)]
*  And their leader knew we were studying bats. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4921.0s)]
*  But why were they chasing you? [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4923.2s)]
*  Because they didn't know who we were. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4925.32s)]
*  Right, but what did they think you were doing? [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4926.96s)]
*  Some kind of Yankee spies trying to figure out [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4929.639999999999s)]
*  where they were and how to attack them, probably. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4932.719999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4935.12s)]
*  Was that the most danger you've ever been in on an exhibition? [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4936.599999999999s)]
*  Expedition, rather? [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4940.2s)]
*  Probably not. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4942.2s)]
*  No? [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4943.599999999999s)]
*  One night on the upper Mavocca River, [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4946.32s)]
*  we were named bats in an area where we didn't think [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4952.759999999999s)]
*  there were any Aborigines that would bother us, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4956.5599999999995s)]
*  because we had camped with a group of Yanomamo. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4960.04s)]
*  And the idea was you couldn't put a camp [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4964.88s)]
*  between village of Yanomamo, [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4966.84s)]
*  because then they would all think they could prey on you. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4968.84s)]
*  But if you became friends of one village, [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4971.84s)]
*  at least they wouldn't bother you. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4974.0s)]
*  And they would view you as useful. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4976.44s)]
*  So the village that we were staying with, [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4978.28s)]
*  the guys informed me that now way up the river, [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4980.68s)]
*  30 miles or so, there was an area [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4985.08s)]
*  that I would love to have collected in, [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4987.72s)]
*  but I couldn't because it was controlled [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4990.32s)]
*  by a group of Yanomamo that had shot at everybody [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4992.8s)]
*  who had ever gotten near there and shot arrows. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=4996.04s)]
*  And so I was afraid to go up there to do any collecting. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5000.56s)]
*  But then our group of Yanomamo informed me [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5004.92s)]
*  that these guys had gone off on a raid [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5007.88s)]
*  to attack another group and probably wouldn't be back [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5010.080000000001s)]
*  for a couple of months. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5012.240000000001s)]
*  So I got brave and went up into their area [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5013.92s)]
*  where I didn't think they were going to be, [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5018.200000000001s)]
*  with a young man, Venezuelan, who worked for me. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5020.64s)]
*  And we had just parked our dugout canoe on the bank [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5025.200000000001s)]
*  and had gone out into the woods to set nets for bats. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5029.56s)]
*  When we hear 100 or so, maybe not 100, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5033.4400000000005s)]
*  but a goodly number of Yanomamo men coming down the trail, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5037.4800000000005s)]
*  and we immediately thought, oh my God, [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5045.200000000001s)]
*  we're going to be absolutely dead ducks if they find us. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5049.88s)]
*  But I did know that they don't usually go after their quarry, [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5054.280000000001s)]
*  they usually wait in ambush. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5058.2s)]
*  So we hid out in the jungle until about two o'clock [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5060.32s)]
*  in the morning and then tried turning our lights really dim [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5063.08s)]
*  and sneaking along without making any noise [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5067.16s)]
*  to get back to our canoe and hoping they were asleep. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5069.32s)]
*  And we'll never know whether they were asleep or not [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5072.639999999999s)]
*  because we did get shoved off and got away. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5075.96s)]
*  But the very next night, we were stupid enough [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5081.0s)]
*  to think we had gone far enough away [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5084.12s)]
*  that they wouldn't find us. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5086.2s)]
*  And we went back and tried to net again. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5087.6s)]
*  And then we heard jaguar noises. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5090.88s)]
*  And I had a Yanomamo and a Micah-D-Tari Indian working for me, [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5094.92s)]
*  and they immediately started warning me, [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5099.200000000001s)]
*  that's not El Tigre, that's the Indians [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5103.64s)]
*  that we're trying to avoid. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5109.92s)]
*  And- [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5111.84s)]
*  Just making jaguar noises. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5112.68s)]
*  Right, to communicate among themselves. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5113.92s)]
*  Wow. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5117.2s)]
*  But I insisted, I thought that these guys were just [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5119.4800000000005s)]
*  trying to get out of work [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5123.4800000000005s)]
*  because I'd been working them pretty hard [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5124.6s)]
*  and that they wanted to go to bed early that night. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5126.12s)]
*  So I didn't really take them very seriously. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5128.4400000000005s)]
*  And I went off with my shotgun. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5131.4s)]
*  Back then we were collecting everything [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5133.12s)]
*  from jogwars to mice. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5135.16s)]
*  And so, in those days it was a big macho thing [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5138.28s)]
*  to shoot a jogwire. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5143.4s)]
*  So I go off with my shotgun to hunt the jogwire. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5144.96s)]
*  And it kept moving too fast without noise in between. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5148.28s)]
*  And I finally dawned on me that, [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5153.0s)]
*  hey, this is more like Indians than jogwars to me even. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5154.76s)]
*  I went back and my guys were just ready [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5159.44s)]
*  to actually abandon me and leave me. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5161.4s)]
*  They were so scared. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5163.12s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5164.24s)]
*  We didn't even take the nets down. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5165.08s)]
*  We got out of there as fast as we could. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5167.0s)]
*  Went back to camp. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5169.68s)]
*  And the next day when we came back to get our nets, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5171.36s)]
*  all the main strands of the nets had been stolen, [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5173.88s)]
*  proving that these were Indians that were after us. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5176.360000000001s)]
*  And we probably just got out in time. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5179.360000000001s)]
*  So that's the most danger you've ever been in. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5183.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5189.24s)]
*  I mean, there was the time I was crawling into a cave [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5190.08s)]
*  and on my belly in a narrow passage [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5193.16s)]
*  and all of a sudden found that there was a big cobra [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5195.8s)]
*  coming out and I had to lay perfectly still [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5197.92s)]
*  so that the cobra didn't get upset while he was going by. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5200.78s)]
*  So you had to lay perfectly still [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5204.099999999999s)]
*  while the cobra slithered by you? [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5205.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5208.099999999999s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5208.94s)]
*  And there was the time the river bandits came after us. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5210.86s)]
*  River bandits? [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5214.679999999999s)]
*  Where was that? [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5215.5199999999995s)]
*  That was in Venezuela on the Costa Cari Canal. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5216.94s)]
*  We're getting into stories that probably ought to be told [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5227.54s)]
*  another time when we're not distracting from bats. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5229.86s)]
*  No, they're fun. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5233.54s)]
*  We can go back to bats. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5234.42s)]
*  To put a long story shorter, [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5236.099999999999s)]
*  the Costa Cari Canal is the world's longest natural canal [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5239.179999999999s)]
*  and out in the middle of it, there are just no humans around [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5242.78s)]
*  and we were camped out there collecting for the Smithsonian. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5247.78s)]
*  But I carried a lot of small cash to do business [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5251.339999999999s)]
*  when I did come to where there were villages. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5255.96s)]
*  The small cash was hidden in false bottoms of trunks. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5260.0599999999995s)]
*  The way I got the cash, [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5265.0199999999995s)]
*  we were funded through a military grant [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5267.099999999999s)]
*  and anybody that knows anything about the military [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5269.82s)]
*  knows they've got every restriction under the sun [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5272.54s)]
*  on their money and accounting for it. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5274.86s)]
*  I had known that their rules [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5277.42s)]
*  weren't gonna work very well for collecting [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5280.88s)]
*  and so I had gotten bids from plain charter companies [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5283.74s)]
*  to fly us out to this remote savanna [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5289.98s)]
*  and they were gonna charge a lot of money [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5292.94s)]
*  because it was risky to the planes. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5295.98s)]
*  I got the military to send the money [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5302.66s)]
*  to the Bank of America in Caracas [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5308.259999999999s)]
*  and then this was time when you had machine guns [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5310.759999999999s)]
*  at the door of every bank. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5313.92s)]
*  I mean it was a dangerous time in Venezuela, period. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5316.139999999999s)]
*  Well, we pretended to change Christmas gifts [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5321.219999999999s)]
*  and that's how we got our money into small change [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5326.54s)]
*  and took it back to our hotel. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5331.42s)]
*  Then we put it in false bottoms of trunks, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5333.5s)]
*  then we go out to the frontier [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5335.58s)]
*  and after a while the word kinda gets around [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5337.98s)]
*  that these guys can always pay for something. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5341.0599999999995s)]
*  They must have some secret supply of money. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5343.099999999999s)]
*  One day we're at this remote camp [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5346.379999999999s)]
*  and my Venezuelan helpers, Indians, [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5348.94s)]
*  came running up saying, [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5354.2s)]
*  oh, in Spanish, Quedado, [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5356.0s)]
*  not vandals but the robbers are coming. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5364.299999999999s)]
*  And they were coming up the river [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5369.900000000001s)]
*  in a little motorized dugout [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5374.26s)]
*  and so that's how my guys heard them in time [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5377.74s)]
*  to know that they were coming [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5380.46s)]
*  and then they saw them and realized who they were. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5381.54s)]
*  So I had just a couple minutes, [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5386.14s)]
*  it's kinda interesting because I was reared [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5389.26s)]
*  to be a conscientious objector [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5391.72s)]
*  and didn't believe in fighting and war. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5394.54s)]
*  So here we are with the bandits coming armed with, [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5401.46s)]
*  it was kinda interesting, [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5406.98s)]
*  they had old muzzleloader guns [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5408.099999999999s)]
*  that they actually used rocks in, [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5411.0199999999995s)]
*  rocks and black powder still to shoot [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5413.66s)]
*  but here they're coming [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5417.42s)]
*  and I'm responsible for eight or 10 people, [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5418.98s)]
*  they're lives and am I gonna be a conscientious objector [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5423.22s)]
*  or what am I gonna do? [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5426.820000000001s)]
*  And so I broke out all the guns we had, [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5428.660000000001s)]
*  gave everybody everything from an M1 rifle [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5433.06s)]
*  to a couple double-barrel shotguns, pistols [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5437.700000000001s)]
*  and got everybody positioned behind rocks and logs [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5440.900000000001s)]
*  and then as the bandits approached, [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5446.42s)]
*  I yelled down to them in Spanish [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5449.780000000001s)]
*  that we understood who they were [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5451.66s)]
*  and if they touch that rock, we're gonna kill them [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5453.7s)]
*  and they kept coming [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5457.54s)]
*  and so I finally had everybody show themselves [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5459.7s)]
*  in their guns and yelled one more time [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5463.42s)]
*  and the last time I yelled, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5466.74s)]
*  they were within a meter of hitting the bank [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5468.26s)]
*  and at that point, we'd have had to kill them [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5470.7s)]
*  but they finally at the last minute [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5473.66s)]
*  when they saw they were outgunned [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5475.74s)]
*  and then we had the upper hand, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5477.62s)]
*  they backed up and went off. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5479.86s)]
*  That ought to be hair-raising. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5482.66s)]
*  It was. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5484.0199999999995s)]
*  Ooh. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5484.86s)]
*  But I learned a lot about my conscientious objector. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5487.179999999999s)]
*  You're ready to abandon it. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5490.339999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, what are you gonna do? [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5492.7s)]
*  You gonna let good people die [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5494.46s)]
*  just because you don't believe in firing a gun at a human? [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5496.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point, right? [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5500.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5501.62s)]
*  Very important lesson to learn, right? [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5502.46s)]
*  Yeah, it was an important one for me. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5504.259999999999s)]
*  But boy, you've had some pretty amazing experiences [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5507.26s)]
*  just studying bats around the world. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5510.9400000000005s)]
*  It's been a wild life, I bet, huh? [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5513.18s)]
*  Well, I've never chosen to get myself into big adventures [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5515.46s)]
*  but I- [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5519.9s)]
*  The adventures chose you. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5520.74s)]
*  One of my all-time favorite things to do [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5522.46s)]
*  is to go places where almost nobody's ever been. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5524.74s)]
*  Like when I went out to see the Shamantari Indians, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5527.82s)]
*  I had to hike 46 miles across country [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5533.66s)]
*  from the last Yanomama village [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5537.0599999999995s)]
*  to get out there and see them. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5539.86s)]
*  And I just went out there. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5541.94s)]
*  I mean, I knew it was dangerous. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5545.18s)]
*  How dangerous, I didn't know, [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5547.9s)]
*  but I just was driven by curiosity. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5549.46s)]
*  Here's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5553.46s)]
*  to see a group of people [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5555.78s)]
*  that have only seen two other outsiders [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5558.3s)]
*  in their whole existence. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5560.62s)]
*  And it was just so much fun going out there [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5563.66s)]
*  and experiencing that kind of thing. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5567.98s)]
*  But I certainly got into the high adventure [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5571.46s)]
*  while I was out there. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5573.7s)]
*  Yeah, that sounds amazing. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5576.5s)]
*  So you gotta hike, how long did it take you [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5577.62s)]
*  to hike 46 miles to get to them? [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5578.98s)]
*  Well, we did it in a day and a half. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5581.94s)]
*  I had a 40-some pound pack. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5583.9s)]
*  Whew. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5586.9800000000005s)]
*  We went extra fast because I did not know [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5588.620000000001s)]
*  when we started on the trip that the reason, [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5593.26s)]
*  see, these two Shamantari came out [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5596.9400000000005s)]
*  to visit our Yanomama group [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5599.3s)]
*  because they were looking for allies in a battle. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5603.9800000000005s)]
*  They're expecting to be raided by another tribe. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5606.9800000000005s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5609.900000000001s)]
*  And I didn't know this is why they were there. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5610.740000000001s)]
*  But when I asked through my interpreters, [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5613.42s)]
*  and let me point this out too, [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5617.9400000000005s)]
*  when you watch a movie and they're speaking Pidgin English, [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5619.62s)]
*  there's no such thing as a place [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5625.18s)]
*  where people are really aboriginal [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5626.74s)]
*  and you're speaking Pidgin English to them. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5628.34s)]
*  Everything I said on that whole trip out there [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5632.06s)]
*  had to be translated by me from English to Spanish [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5635.58s)]
*  and then from Spanish to Microtari, [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5638.78s)]
*  from Microtari to Yanomama, [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5640.7s)]
*  from Yanomama to Shamantari. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5642.3s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5644.14s)]
*  You can imagine there are a few miscommunications. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5645.42s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5647.860000000001s)]
*  So. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5648.7s)]
*  What year was this that this was happening? [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5650.78s)]
*  This was 1967. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5653.14s)]
*  Okay, so clearly there's no cell phones, [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5655.54s)]
*  no other ways of communicating. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5657.78s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5659.74s)]
*  Wow. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5660.78s)]
*  So we did not know that these guys were expecting an attack [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5661.78s)]
*  until we had already left with them [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5668.42s)]
*  to go out to their village. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5670.42s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5672.34s)]
*  And what we eventually found was that [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5673.38s)]
*  the reason they welcomed us so strongly [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5676.259999999999s)]
*  was that they thought we'd bring our bang sticks with us, [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5678.78s)]
*  meaning guns, and be good in the battle. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5681.259999999999s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5683.58s)]
*  And so by the time we got there, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5684.82s)]
*  well, we found out that we had to camp out [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5688.9s)]
*  along the trail the first night [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5690.9s)]
*  and we found out that they were expecting attack. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5692.34s)]
*  They were expecting attack. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5697.34s)]
*  My two guys, I had to have a Yanomama and a Mycateatari [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5699.860000000001s)]
*  for the translations to go. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5703.5s)]
*  And incidentally, they knew enough that they wouldn't go. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5705.9800000000005s)]
*  I had a terrible time getting them to go. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5711.42s)]
*  When I finally convinced them, [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5714.34s)]
*  I had to pay them a month's wages for every day [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5715.5s)]
*  they went out there with me. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5717.58s)]
*  So that first night, [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5721.66s)]
*  we set up camp by a beautiful stream in the jungle [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5723.62s)]
*  and then my guys got really suspicious [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5728.02s)]
*  when our two Shamatari hosts went off by themselves [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5730.9400000000005s)]
*  quite a ways away in a hidden place in the jungle [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5737.22s)]
*  to put up little shelters for their night. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5740.18s)]
*  And so they got suspicious, went and checked, [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5743.18s)]
*  and found that they were worried about being attacked. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5747.18s)]
*  And they were leaving us out on the trail to be the bait. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5750.06s)]
*  And so, but the next day we arrived out there [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5753.82s)]
*  and my Mycateatari guide had experienced, [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5759.219999999999s)]
*  he had been in a Yanomama village during an attack once. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5763.54s)]
*  And so he, since we knew they were thinking [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5767.82s)]
*  of being attacked anytime, [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5771.139999999999s)]
*  he instructed me what to do if we were attacked. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5772.94s)]
*  And he said, you know, right off, you know, play dead. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5776.139999999999s)]
*  And we were thinking that the attack might come at night. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5781.46s)]
*  And sure enough, the very first night we're there. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5785.42s)]
*  I mean, talk about scary experiences. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5789.5s)]
*  Long before we thought we were being attacked, [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5791.58s)]
*  there were people that had malaria [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5794.02s)]
*  and there were guys getting really high on drugs [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5796.22s)]
*  to chase the Hekura, the devils out. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5800.14s)]
*  And they were going around- [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5803.9800000000005s)]
*  Chase the devils out? [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5805.780000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5806.9800000000005s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5807.820000000001s)]
*  They believed that everything was attributable [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5808.660000000001s)]
*  to spirits, not- [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5811.02s)]
*  Even malaria? [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5812.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5813.3s)]
*  There were good spirits and bad spirits. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5815.14s)]
*  They hadn't evolved to think of one god and one devil. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5817.700000000001s)]
*  There were just a lot of spirits [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5821.900000000001s)]
*  with good ones and bad ones. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5823.34s)]
*  And they were trying to chase the bad ones [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5826.1s)]
*  out of the village by getting high on dope [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5828.06s)]
*  and then shooting those Kuroi tipped arrows [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5830.1s)]
*  at the hallucinated images. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5833.5s)]
*  So what drugs were they getting high on? [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5836.58s)]
*  Ebony. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5840.78s)]
*  It's a powder that they, I'm trying to think what, [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5841.62s)]
*  they make it from a vine, I believe. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5844.0199999999995s)]
*  And what is the psychedelic substance in this drug? [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5846.62s)]
*  They blow it up their noses. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5848.86s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5850.179999999999s)]
*  If you go to my website, [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5851.0199999999995s)]
*  there's a place on the website where you can, [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5854.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm trying to remember, we can tell you later [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5857.98s)]
*  exactly how to get to it. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5860.94s)]
*  But I've got a place on my website [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5862.299999999999s)]
*  where you can actually see that trip, me out there with, [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5864.179999999999s)]
*  I had a movie camera with me. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5866.86s)]
*  You can see them blowing the dope up their nose. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5868.78s)]
*  And I've got it on film right up until the guy [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5871.42s)]
*  tried to attack and kill me. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5874.98s)]
*  And then I had to quit taking pictures. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5877.219999999999s)]
*  He tried to attack and kill you [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5879.5s)]
*  because you were taking pictures? [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5880.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5881.7s)]
*  Napoleon, the famous anthropologist had warned me [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5882.78s)]
*  never to get around him when they were taking dope, [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5886.34s)]
*  but I couldn't resist. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5888.38s)]
*  So is this stuff like an amphetamine? [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5890.259999999999s)]
*  Like what is this stuff they're blowing up their nose? [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5892.7s)]
*  I don't know, I never tried any of it. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5894.98s)]
*  I'm sure that if Napoleon was still alive, [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5897.62s)]
*  he could tell you what it was. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5899.62s)]
*  Did you get tempted to try it? [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5900.9s)]
*  No. No? [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5902.38s)]
*  But- [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5905.26s)]
*  They're out there tripping in the woods [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5906.099999999999s)]
*  and you're not like, what are you doing? [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5907.099999999999s)]
*  So anyway, that first night, [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5908.7s)]
*  I've gone to bed and these guys are getting high [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5912.62s)]
*  and they're running around the village [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5916.46s)]
*  shooting those seven foot curare tipped arrows [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5917.82s)]
*  into hallucinated images. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5920.98s)]
*  And I'm hearing those things go thunk into the side of the, [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5923.5s)]
*  we're sleeping under lean-to's, [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5926.94s)]
*  is how the villages made a big circle of lean-to's. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5929.14s)]
*  And I would hear an arrow go thunk, thunk. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5932.22s)]
*  Poison arrows. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5936.18s)]
*  Poison arrows. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5937.18s)]
*  Hitting the area where you're sleeping [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5938.0199999999995s)]
*  because these people are seeing things- [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5939.7s)]
*  Right, and I'm scared shitless. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5940.78s)]
*  And so I'm laying there in the middle of that [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5944.54s)]
*  when all of a sudden- [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5947.9s)]
*  Is that them? [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5949.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5950.18s)]
*  So this is them blowing the snuff up their nose. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5952.38s)]
*  You can see all this actually in videos on my website. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5955.86s)]
*  I'm just trying to find it. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5960.0199999999995s)]
*  I just couldn't find it. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5960.86s)]
*  Where is it at on your website? [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5962.78s)]
*  I was looking through a gallery. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5966.46s)]
*  I was trying to get through it. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5967.299999999999s)]
*  Look under- [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5968.62s)]
*  Do you have a search area? [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5970.54s)]
*  Bat research Venezuela. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5972.0199999999995s)]
*  Or if you look under Venezuela, [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5975.98s)]
*  I'm almost sure you'll find it. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5978.5s)]
*  You were on TV with David Letterman in 1984 [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5979.86s)]
*  talking about bats? [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5982.179999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5983.099999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5983.94s)]
*  That's pretty crazy. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5985.179999999999s)]
*  Let's go to that. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=5986.98s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6007.78s)]
*  There's a funny story about that. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6008.62s)]
*  I shared the green room that night [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6009.9s)]

*  Stupid Petricks, the list goes on. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6018.22s)]
*  Now this is an okay show. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6021.46s)]
*  I don't like this random whining. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6025.1s)]
*  I'll come up there and teach you people a lesson. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6032.66s)]
*  All right. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6039.0599999999995s)]

*  He has spent 20 years studying bats [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6056.98s)]
*  and feels that they don't get the respect [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6059.98s)]
*  they rightfully deserve. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6061.82s)]

*  Have a seat. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6073.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, young and handsome? [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6075.099999999999s)]
*  You're from Milwaukee? [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6075.94s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6077.0199999999995s)]
*  Everything all right in Wisconsin? [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6077.86s)]
*  Just fine. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6078.94s)]
*  Yeah, you're a brave man having me and bats on [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6079.78s)]
*  right after Ava Gabor. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6083.54s)]
*  Well, how so? [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6084.86s)]
*  Well, you know, this is only the middle of your show. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6087.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6091.379999999999s)]

*  No, would it be crazy in here? [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6094.82s)]
*  We asked the audience. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6096.66s)]
*  I don't know how many would stay. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6097.62s)]
*  Yeah, now that's true. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6099.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm scared silly of bats and probably most people [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6100.74s)]
*  who know nothing about them are also frightened of bats. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6103.98s)]
*  Now, is there any real reason to be worried about bats? [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6106.46s)]
*  Actually, not at all. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6109.94s)]
*  It's very simple. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6111.58s)]
*  No, it's okay. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6112.42s)]
*  We get it. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6113.78s)]
*  That's you. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6114.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6116.0199999999995s)]
*  Is it weird? [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6116.86s)]
*  Well. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6118.54s)]
*  Looking at you from a long time ago. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6119.38s)]
*  I had an interesting experience with Gabor and John Cleese. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6122.18s)]
*  He tried to get her interested in bats. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6128.18s)]
*  He asked her when she came in if she liked animals [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6131.3s)]
*  and she said, oh, I love animals. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6133.900000000001s)]
*  And he said, oh, let me show you. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6136.34s)]
*  Dr. Tuttle here has got bats and oh my God, [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6137.860000000001s)]
*  she just liked they had a fit. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6141.3s)]
*  And so he thought, well, she just doesn't know [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6143.700000000001s)]
*  what they're like and he tried to show her a picture [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6146.1s)]
*  that I had of a cute bat. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6148.22s)]
*  And then she threatened to sue him [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6150.34s)]
*  because she was gonna have nightmares for a month [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6151.82s)]
*  and if she did, she was gonna sue his pants off. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6153.9800000000005s)]
*  She was gonna sue him if she had nightmares? [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6156.74s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6158.82s)]
*  I did notice it said that I had just founded [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6161.34s)]
*  Bat Conservation International. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6166.06s)]
*  I did found Bat Conservation International [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6167.7s)]
*  and I'm proud of what we have managed to accomplish there [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6169.9400000000005s)]
*  in the nearly 30 years that I led the organization [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6173.06s)]
*  but I'm no longer there as often happens [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6175.66s)]
*  with founders of nonprofits or even corporations. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6178.66s)]
*  Over time, the directors sometimes diverge [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6182.54s)]
*  in their priorities from what the founder wants to have. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6185.18s)]
*  And eventually it just got to be untenable [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6189.7s)]
*  where we weren't accomplishing what we needed to accomplish [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6195.22s)]
*  because we're disagreeing over what we should be doing. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6197.78s)]
*  What did they wanna do? [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6201.3s)]
*  Well, it started I think with, [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6203.42s)]
*  you're too old to lead anymore. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6208.7s)]
*  You're 60 years old. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6210.22s)]
*  We need to find the next leader. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6211.62s)]
*  And obviously I wasn't too old. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6214.62s)]
*  I've done a pretty damn good job [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6217.38s)]
*  of founding Merlin Tuttle's Bat Conservation [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6219.38s)]
*  and we're doing very well. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6222.9s)]
*  They were just trying to take over, assume the reins. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6225.38s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6229.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6230.58s)]
*  And so I just wanted to be clear [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6231.42s)]
*  that that's not where I'm at. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6233.9s)]
*  If somebody wants to find me [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6235.26s)]
*  or learn more about what I do, [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6237.54s)]
*  I'm at merlinuttle.org is the organization. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6239.74s)]
*  Merlin Tuttle's Bat Conservation is where I am supported [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6244.38s)]
*  and where I do all my work these days. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6247.86s)]
*  So what do you do these days? [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6251.22s)]
*  What are you up to now? [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6252.74s)]
*  How much more bat work is there to be done? [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6254.18s)]
*  An enormous amount. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6257.54s)]
*  The thing is, despite, [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6259.06s)]
*  I can tell you stories endlessly [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6262.22s)]
*  of the great things we've accomplished. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6264.42s)]
*  We didn't just protect the bats [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6266.18s)]
*  at the Congress Avenue Bridge. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6267.58s)]
*  I've gotten millions of bats protected [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6268.780000000001s)]
*  in many other places. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6271.1s)]
*  Got a national park in Samoa. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6272.14s)]
*  But right now, bats are in big, big trouble. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6274.38s)]
*  Despite all that progress we've made [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6283.780000000001s)]
*  protecting individual groups of bats [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6285.9800000000005s)]
*  and species of bats, [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6288.58s)]
*  bats are among the most rapidly declining animals, [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6290.5s)]
*  most endangered animals on the planet. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6294.14s)]
*  I've already pointed out how susceptible they are [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6297.46s)]
*  because of their slow reproduction [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6300.46s)]
*  and congregating in large numbers [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6302.660000000001s)]
*  where they're easy to pick on. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6305.14s)]
*  Right now, one of my biggest concerns [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6309.58s)]
*  is to form an entity that, [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6313.38s)]
*  well, we've already formed Merlin Tuttle's Bat Conservation, [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6320.54s)]
*  but what I need to do next is to ensure [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6323.26s)]
*  that my legacy of information, photographs, [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6326.860000000001s)]
*  and other things remains available [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6331.06s)]
*  to help others long after I'm dead. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6334.06s)]
*  I know I'm not gonna live forever. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6338.820000000001s)]
*  I'm 81. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6341.58s)]
*  I've got Parkinson's, but I'm still going great. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6342.820000000001s)]
*  And I'm hoping to go great until I'm 90. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6346.3s)]
*  I love what I do. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6350.1s)]
*  And I love helping both people and bats, [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6352.06s)]
*  and that's what makes me successful. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6355.06s)]
*  I'm not just animals have rights, step aside. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6357.1s)]
*  I'm trying to solve problems for people, [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6360.9800000000005s)]
*  help people live in a better world [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6363.3s)]
*  with healthier surroundings. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6365.1s)]
*  And in doing that, I'm helping bats. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6367.9800000000005s)]
*  But the next big challenge is [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6370.780000000001s)]
*  we need to raise an endowment for my organization. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6376.9400000000005s)]
*  And that would seem to be a bit much for an organization [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6380.7s)]
*  that's saving traditionally unpopular animals. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6386.22s)]
*  But I was thinking over breakfast this morning, [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6390.139999999999s)]
*  all that would have to happen is people listening right now [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6394.5s)]
*  give even a couple dollars a piece, [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6399.34s)]
*  and we'd have the endowment that it would take [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6402.42s)]
*  to make a huge difference for bats, for people, [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6404.38s)]
*  and make an old man damn happy. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6408.94s)]
*  Well, maybe we could do that. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6411.179999999999s)]
*  So what is the website that they should go to? [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6412.66s)]
*  Is it your website? [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6415.0199999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6416.339999999999s)]
*  MerlinTuttle.org. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6417.179999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6418.219999999999s)]
*  And is it, there's a very clear donate link up there? [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6419.58s)]
*  There it is. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6424.139999999999s)]
*  Donate, far right side. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6425.219999999999s)]
*  Inspiring bat conservation worldwide. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6427.299999999999s)]
*  And Merlin, do you have social media [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6429.54s)]
*  that people could go to as well? [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6432.219999999999s)]
*  Yes, we do. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6433.58s)]
*  I'm sorry I'm not our social media person, [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6435.86s)]
*  at my age I'm pretty illiterate [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6439.26s)]
*  when it comes to social media. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6440.9800000000005s)]
*  It's Merlin Tuttle Bats, and it's on Instagram. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6442.42s)]
*  And as of right now, it has 25,000 followers. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6445.5s)]
*  So hopefully we get you a lot more than that, [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6448.74s)]
*  get people to pay attention. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6450.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, I really, really appreciate, Joe, [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6452.18s)]
*  you're having me on and getting this exposure for bats. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6455.06s)]
*  Well, I'm a curious person, and you're a fascinating guy, [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6459.06s)]
*  and your work has been really amazing. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6462.02s)]
*  And so it's very cool to check it out. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6463.66s)]
*  Oh, here's the video. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6466.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's from my website. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6467.820000000001s)]
*  This is you from 1966 to 1967, [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6468.660000000001s)]
*  Adventures of a Real Batman. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6471.820000000001s)]
*  And so this is you, this is the Yanomami? [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6473.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, this guy is, he's just blown dope up his nose. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6477.34s)]
*  Now, he's hiring a kite here, and he's, [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6482.700000000001s)]
*  ra ra ra ra, he's yelling so loud I don't wanna do it, [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6486.1s)]
*  because I'd hurt my throat. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6489.860000000001s)]
*  But he's trying to scare the- [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6493.3s)]
*  The demons. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6497.34s)]
*  Demons out of the village. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6498.38s)]
*  And he's naked. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6499.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean, that's the way he goes. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6500.66s)]
*  And you notice he's got a string around his waist [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6503.02s)]
*  that's tying his foreskin up. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6505.38s)]
*  If that ever breaks, they act as though they've, [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6507.34s)]

*  Somehow that's leaving them naked if that string breaks. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6514.66s)]
*  So it's just the foreskin pressed up against his body? [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6517.74s)]
*  Is that what it is? Tied. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6521.26s)]
*  And there you see blowing the dope up the nose [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6524.22s)]
*  how they do it. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6525.740000000001s)]
*  And boy, so what is this stuff? [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6526.9800000000005s)]
*  Like, what's in there? [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6530.06s)]
*  I don't know, I wasn't about to try it. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6531.22s)]
*  What is it called again? [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6534.06s)]
*  Ebene. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6534.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, E-B-E-N-E is how I'm finding it spelled. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6535.740000000001s)]
*  And what is in there? [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6537.9400000000005s)]
*  What's in that stuff? [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6540.18s)]
*  Doesn't say. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6541.58s)]
*  Yeah, let's Google that. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6542.42s)]
*  I tried a hallucinogenic plant form as well, [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6543.5s)]
*  it was really getting- [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6546.5s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6547.34s)]
*  I'll try again, but. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6548.18s)]
*  So that was the recreation. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6549.22s)]
*  Well, it wasn't really recreation, I don't think. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6552.7s)]
*  The guys would get high as a part of, [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6555.54s)]
*  when they got high, they would see these, [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6559.0599999999995s)]
*  quotes, Hekura, the spirits that they thought they saw [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6561.34s)]
*  in their hallucinations. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6565.26s)]
*  And then they'd go try to chase them out of the village. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6566.78s)]
*  And in 1967, no internet, [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6572.0199999999995s)]
*  so there's really no way to know about these people [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6574.0599999999995s)]
*  other than to be there, right? [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6576.94s)]
*  That's right. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6578.3s)]
*  And if anything happened to me out there, [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6579.139999999999s)]
*  it would just be, remember years ago [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6581.18s)]
*  when the Rockefeller person just disappeared [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6583.18s)]
*  and nobody knew what happened to him. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6586.34s)]
*  So here it is. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6588.26s)]
*  What does it say? [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6590.38s)]
*  It says, also known as Yopa, Jopa, [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6591.22s)]
*  Khohoba, Parika, or calcium tree. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6594.740000000001s)]
*  It's a perennial tree of the genus Anandinanthera, [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6598.18s)]
*  native to the Caribbean in South America. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6606.3s)]
*  Da da da da da da da. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6609.14s)]
*  What's in it, the seeds? [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6610.34s)]
*  The genic stuff is all I got to still in here. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6612.900000000001s)]
*  Oh, dimethyltryptamine. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6615.46s)]
*  5-MeO. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6617.7s)]
*  5-MeO, dimethyltryptamine. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6618.54s)]
*  Bufatine, oh wow, there's a lot of good stuff in there. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6620.74s)]
*  A lot of DMT. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6624.3s)]
*  Okay, that makes sense. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6625.74s)]
*  So they were really hallucinating. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6627.06s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6629.42s)]
*  So they were taking an orally, [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6630.26s)]
*  or a snuff version, rather, of DMT. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6631.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6636.42s)]
*  Very interesting. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gace_3mMAJE&t=6637.26s)]
