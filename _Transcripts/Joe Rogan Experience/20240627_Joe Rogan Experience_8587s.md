# Joe Rogan Experience #2004 - Ice Cube
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6.0s)]
*  Man, that's what you was doing. You just wanted to go smoke weed with Joe and shit. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=10.0s)]
*  I could have did that. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=19.0s)]
*  I could have keep up with Snoop. Snoop just keeps going. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=20.0s)]
*  Man, Snoop, he got a fucking professional bud roller. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=22.0s)]
*  I think he's paying 40 grand a year or some shit. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=28.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=31.0s)]
*  I don't know how much, but I know it's a dude who's eight hours a day. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=32.0s)]
*  He just bringing Snoop like a hundred blunts in a bag. Here you go, Snoop. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=37.0s)]
*  He's the one dude that's exempt anywhere he goes. No one's going to fuck with Snoop with weed. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=46.0s)]
*  He smoked weed at the White House. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=50.0s)]
*  Did he really? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=52.0s)]
*  Yeah, he went in the bathroom and got down. I said, oh man. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=54.0s)]
*  I said, yeah, he blaze anywhere. Church, swimming pools. He inside the pool blazing underwater. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=59.0s)]
*  He's got a card. You can just let him slide. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=66.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. He's Snoop. What you going to say? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=69.0s)]
*  What are you going to say? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=74.0s)]
*  What you going to say, man? Everybody loves Snoop. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=75.0s)]
*  Same thing with Chappelle. When we go out with Dave, Dave just fire up in a restaurant. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=77.0s)]
*  Hey man, you know. Got to let him know you in the house. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=81.0s)]
*  Nobody says anything. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=86.0s)]
*  Yeah, what they going to say? Who wants to be part of his next comedy special? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=87.0s)]
*  The person that told Dave Chappelle, you came blaze in Ruth Chris. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=93.0s)]
*  Nah, nah, nah. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=99.0s)]
*  Well, hey man, thank you very much for being here. I really appreciate it. You want some coffee? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=104.0s)]
*  No, thanks for having me. I probably had too much coffee. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=107.0s)]
*  Yeah, today I probably had about two cups already, so I should be cool till this afternoon. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=110.0s)]
*  So I saw this video where you said you're doing just a podcast tour. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=117.0s)]
*  Yeah. I'm going to hit everybody. Everybody want to talk to me. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=121.0s)]
*  I just want to be able to get the message out to the people, talk to the people. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=126.0s)]
*  I've been trying to push my league and mainstream sports media have really basically ignored what we're doing for the last six years. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=133.0s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=144.0s)]
*  I think they're nervous about the NBA. They're nervous about their relationship with the NBA could be damaged if they promote the big three. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=147.0s)]
*  I would think it would help everybody. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=159.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's basketball in the summer. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=162.0s)]
*  You know, they got the WNBA, but we really don't play at the same time. You know, they got the games, we got our games. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=168.0s)]
*  And you know, what's crazy is we got their former Hall of Famers as a part of this league. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=178.0s)]
*  And they wanted to be a part of this league. So it's not like we hijacking them or we, you know, kidnapping them. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=187.0s)]
*  They want to be a part of this league. They want it to be successful. And they want to make money in the summer. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=196.0s)]
*  So I don't know what the NBA is thinking about trying to deprive Dr. J and Rick Berry and Iceman, George Gervin, a little check in the summer. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=201.0s)]
*  What's the problem? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=213.0s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't seem like it would compete at all. It seems like it would enhance. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=215.0s)]
*  When you have more basketball for basketball, I mean, basketball fans, they have a season. When it's over, it's over. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=219.0s)]
*  The fact that there's more basketball seems to me. But I'm a person that's like, I feel like there's enough pie for everybody with everything. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=227.0s)]
*  I feel like that with fighting with MMA, when there's a new organization comes out, I'm like, good, good. Give people more opportunity to make money. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=235.0s)]
*  Without a doubt, you know, and it's about who do it the best. And we're not trying to compete in any way, shape or form with the NBA. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=241.0s)]
*  We're very complimentary. So I don't understand why they would, you know, do some of the things that's being done behind the scenes that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=250.0s)]
*  Are they like encouraging people to not do it? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=261.0s)]
*  Encouraging people to not sponsor us. I mean, like, yeah. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=264.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=268.0s)]
*  Encouraging networks not to play us. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=269.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=272.0s)]
*  Yeah. Those things. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=273.0s)]
*  We've been able to survive, but, you know, at a certain point, it's just redundant and ridiculous. And we got to fight back some way, shape or form. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=278.0s)]
*  It just, in my mind, it seems silly. It seems like it only enhance. But that's what happens when you get big corporations, man. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=289.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you know what, Joe? It's not the players. It's not the owners. It's not GMs or Scouts because they, you know, name a big owner. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=296.0s)]
*  He probably loves the league. And we've heard from a lot of them that they love the league. They would love to invest. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=307.0s)]
*  And the players love the league. They come to the games. They play in the league when they're done with the NBA. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=315.0s)]
*  GMs, Scouts come sit next to me on the front row and be like, oh, man, you know, and they even pull some of our guys, put them in the G League. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=324.0s)]
*  A couple of our guys made it all the way back to the NBA, you know, 10 day contracts, things like that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=335.0s)]
*  So it's not the culture of the NBA. It's just the suits. It's the corporate people. You know what I mean? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=342.0s)]
*  It's the brass. It's the top guys that are scared of what we got. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=349.0s)]
*  Just scared of competition in general always. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=355.0s)]
*  Well, they think they own basketball. They think like we own basketball. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=358.0s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=365.0s)]
*  It's nuts. It's fucking nuts because I don't hear kids running out saying, mom, I'm about to go play NBA. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=367.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=375.0s)]
*  No, they say, mom, I'm about to go play basketball with my friends. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=376.0s)]
*  So basketball doesn't have an owner. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=380.0s)]
*  And they are, I think, intimidated that we have changed the game. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=384.0s)]
*  And we haven't changed it just to change it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=391.0s)]
*  We've changed it for the better. And we've changed it within our own version of the sport. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=394.0s)]
*  So we're not trying to change five on five. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=402.0s)]
*  We're just trying to introduce three on three and elevate it to the professional level, which we have. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=405.0s)]
*  I only think that would be a good thing. Those suits are silly. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=411.0s)]
*  It is a good thing, man. They are silly. That's why I'm here, man. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=414.0s)]
*  It's like it's time for these suits to get out the way and let the relationship flourish if it's going to flourish. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=418.0s)]
*  And even if it don't, look, we're doing fine. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=426.0s)]
*  We're doing fine. We're doing fine. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=430.0s)]
*  We're doing fine. We're doing fine. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=432.0s)]
*  We're doing fine. We're doing fine. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=434.0s)]
*  We're doing fine. We're doing fine. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=436.0s)]
*  We're doing fine. We're doing fine. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=438.0s)]
*  We're doing fine. We're doing fine. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=440.0s)]
*  We're doing fine. We're doing fine. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=442.0s)]
*  We're doing fine. We're doing fine. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=444.0s)]
*  We're doing fine. We're doing fine. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=446.0s)]
*  We're doing fine. We're doing fine. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=448.0s)]
*  We're doing fine. We're doing fine. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=450.0s)]
*  We're doing fine. We're doing fine. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=452.0s)]
*  We're doing fine. We're doing fine. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=454.0s)]
*  We're doing fine. We're doing fine. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=456.0s)]
*  Kobe scored 60 points in his last game. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=458.0s)]
*  Now, this idea had been blowing in me, but it was like, you know, it's sports. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=462.0s)]
*  I'm an entertainment guy. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=469.0s)]
*  You know, I'm in rap. I'm in the music and movies and television and that. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=471.0s)]
*  So it had just been sitting there, and this dude hit 60 points in his last game, and then there's nowhere else you can see him play. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=477.0s)]
*  He's done. Bye. Wave going to tunnel. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=487.0s)]
*  And we're like, that sucks. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=491.0s)]
*  It sucks that we cannot ever see Kobe Bryant playing a professional basketball game again. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=493.0s)]
*  There's got to be other guys that people want to see that still got it. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=499.0s)]
*  They may not be able to play 82 games. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=507.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=510.0s)]
*  They may not be able to play back to backs and three games in four nights, but half court three on three to 50. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=512.0s)]
*  They don't look like all stars. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=523.0s)]
*  And so that's where the idea started to germinate. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=525.0s)]
*  That makes sense, too, that it's just the breakdown. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=530.0s)]
*  As you get older, you just can't do as many games. That makes sense. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=532.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, they still can play. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=536.0s)]
*  Like, if you put them out there one game, give it all you got against the 20 year olds, they'll do great. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=538.0s)]
*  But if you haven't played the next day, you know, they just can't recover as fast as the 20 year olds. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=548.0s)]
*  So they look like they can't play the next day. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=557.0s)]
*  So by having a week off, you get to recover. It's like football. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=562.0s)]
*  You get a chance to let your body recover, heal. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=567.0s)]
*  So by the time that next weekend come around, you're 100% ready, good to go. Let's do it. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=571.0s)]
*  Especially with the way guys train today, where older guys can train today, and with the science of sports nutrition and science of recovery. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=577.0s)]
*  There's so much better at it now than there's ever been before. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=587.0s)]
*  We changed our mind. We got rid of the suits. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=592.0s)]
*  We heard you was on Joe. What can we do? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=595.0s)]
*  This is so stupid. That's the thing with older fighters, too. They have a hard time getting through camps. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=599.0s)]
*  That's the next part. It's like they can still fight, but getting through an eight week camp is two a days, all the sparring. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=604.0s)]
*  Too much. I remember, I forgot the football player. He played for the Giants receiver. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=613.0s)]
*  Plexico Burris. The coaches hated him. Why I ain't going to say hated him? I'm just exaggerating. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=622.0s)]
*  They didn't like the fact that he would not practice at all, come in the game on Sunday and score a touchdown. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=632.0s)]
*  It's like it goes against everything that they preach. You have to practice, you have to practice, you have to practice. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=641.0s)]
*  Then you are conditioned to score the touchdown. He's like, no, I got to recover, I got to recover, I got to recover. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=647.0s)]
*  Then by Sunday, I can go out and score a touchdown. That goes against coaches' philosophy. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=656.0s)]
*  But he knew his own body. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=663.0s)]
*  Of course. We all know our own body to a certain extent. I think you should always save an athlete from himself, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=664.0s)]
*  but you shouldn't push an athlete before he's ready to go. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=676.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's always different for different people, too. Some people recover quicker. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=681.0s)]
*  It's just, as athletes get older in particular, they get more and more wise to that, more and more wise to how their body works [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=688.0s)]
*  and what they need to do and not need to do. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=696.0s)]
*  Yeah. I heard one player say that, man, they don't pay me to play in the game. I'll do that for free. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=698.0s)]
*  I don't know if they would pay me $70,000, $15,000 fans. Who wouldn't do that for free? They pay me to practice. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=710.0s)]
*  They pay me to show up on time. They pay me to do all the stuff I don't want to do. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=719.0s)]
*  That makes sense, but sometimes you don't practice somebody just because you're paying them. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=725.0s)]
*  Well, the difference is you can never do this. When football players are done, they're kind of done because of just the damage they take. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=734.0s)]
*  Some, I think it depends on the style. I think you could do an interesting flag version of football. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=742.0s)]
*  I think you could sell it if it was thought about and really worked on to be pleasing to the fans. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=757.0s)]
*  How would you do that? Because people love touchdowns, but they also love tackles. They love people getting hit. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=769.0s)]
*  Yeah. There's a few ways to do it. You could do pads, 7 on 7, and kind of open the game up a little bit so it's not so many collisions coming from so many different angles. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=776.0s)]
*  Less people, more space, more skill set, not so brute, but a little bit of hitting. You could do it that way too. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=795.0s)]
*  Yeah, that could work. The flag one I would think would be kind of tough. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=805.0s)]
*  It's tough because people look at flag as kind of like a side, a byproduct of football, not real football. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=810.0s)]
*  Almost like football for kids. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=822.0s)]
*  Yeah. But guys would go out and play two-hand touch all day. Maybe that's it. Who knows? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=824.0s)]
*  Well, it's interesting when fighters figure out ways to do that too, like what Floyd is doing. What Floyd is doing is so interesting. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=833.0s)]
*  He retires from fighting and he says, I'll just start boxing people who have no chance. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=840.0s)]
*  Hey, why not? Exhibition. We saw that in, what was it, Rocky III or something? He started doing exhibitions with Hulk Hogan and got hurt dealing with that. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=846.0s)]
*  I think people want to see Floyd fight. Some people want to see him lose. I never wanted to see Floyd lose. So he'll always have some interest even if he's fighting. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=866.0s)]
*  What he did is just complete genius. First of all, from just changing his style. He broke his hands a lot. So when he was younger they called him Pretty Boy Floyd. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=882.0s)]
*  Then he changed his name to Money. When he changed his name to Money, he turned to heel. He became like this guy and everybody wanted to see him get beat. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=892.0s)]
*  He's the most unhittable guy in the history of the sport. He's right up there with Purnell Whitaker. Those are the two guys that I say are the most elusive guys in modern, past Willie Pepp, in modern era. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=900.0s)]
*  We're talking about Purnell Whitaker and Floyd. Floyd's even more impressive because he stands right in front of guys. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=914.0s)]
*  He stands right in front of you and you can't hit him. And you can't get a good one on him. It's one of the most amazing skill sets. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=920.0s)]
*  He's like one of those Minnesota Fats kind of pool players that know all the trick shots. You can't beat him. A guy that can play a hand or board game or ping pong. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=930.0s)]
*  You just can't beat him. He's that way in boxing. He just knows all the tricks of the trade and he's just better. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=946.0s)]
*  He has way more information about where you should be, where he can hit you and where he should be where you can't hit him. He's got it all in his head. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=955.0s)]
*  He knows what punch can be thrown at what time and what punch can't. When he knows you can't throw a punch, that's where he is. And when he knows you can, that's where he ain't. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=963.0s)]
*  My favorite fight, I've had a lot of favorite fights, but one of my favorites was the Canelo fight because it was just a master class. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=974.0s)]
*  Master class and just a young, incredibly promising champion. A guy who's going to be an all-time great, but not yet. You're not ready for that guy. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=981.0s)]
*  You know, Floyd always catch him young. He catches you coming up. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=991.0s)]
*  He catches you young or old. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=995.0s)]
*  Yeah, he catches you young or old. And he taps you up and then he says, thank you. Next. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=996.0s)]
*  He did a smart thing too. He got him to cut down 152 pounds. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1002.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1005.0s)]
*  Got him a little lighter. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1006.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1007.0s)]
*  A little smaller, a little more dehydrated. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1008.0s)]
*  A little weaker. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1009.0s)]
*  Yeah, a little weaker and then just box him up. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1010.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1012.0s)]
*  But if you see what it did to Canelo's game, like you see Canelo when he fought Danny Jacobs later on, he was moving like Floyd. Like he mirrored that. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1013.0s)]
*  You have to. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1020.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1021.0s)]
*  I mean, you're dealing with a master. And when you fight a master or you, you know, if I rapped against a master or if I, you know, you spar against a master, you better take a few tricks of the trade with you. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1022.0s)]
*  You know, that's the whole thing about respecting the game. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1037.0s)]
*  Daniel Cormier always says you get the rub. Like when someone fights for the title and you fight a world champion, you feel what that's like. Like, okay. And you either get way better or you kind of like realize I'll never beat that guy. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1042.0s)]
*  You'll never get that level. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1054.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1055.0s)]
*  There was like a lot of, like during the Tyson era, nobody got the rub. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1056.0s)]
*  He was like, you got in there and you were like, fuck this. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1060.0s)]
*  I mean, Tyson had you so many, he has so many psychological advantages. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1063.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1068.0s)]
*  You know, everybody else, you know, you know, give me the pretty robe, put this satin on the robe. I need to, you know, I need to look, I had to have flares coming from my tassels, you know, have to be right. You know, I got to look pretty coming in there. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1069.0s)]
*  Floyd coming in gladiator style. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1083.0s)]
*  Yeah, Mike had a towel over his head with a hole in it. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1086.0s)]
*  And no socks on. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1089.0s)]
*  He ain't here for none of that. He just here to whoop your ass. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1093.0s)]
*  It was the best. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1098.0s)]
*  And you know, and he psychologically beat a lot of people before he even landed that fatal punch. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1099.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. Even after the Buster Douglas fight, that didn't even take it away from him. A lot of times when a guy gets knocked out, like their aura of invincibility goes away, but with Mike it was still there. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1105.0s)]
*  Yeah, because people are always scared of the, you know, when you snap, nobody want to deal with crazy. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1116.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? Everybody could deal with everything, but you know, everybody get out the way of crazy. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1124.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1130.0s)]
*  When Mike was screaming, I'll eat your children. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1131.0s)]
*  Man. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1134.0s)]
*  This is the walkout. Like you're just pushing everybody out the way. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1136.0s)]
*  Nobody even want to give him a Dap because they don't know if he going to knock them out on his way to the ring. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1139.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's, I mean, this is some of the G-ish shit ever. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1146.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1150.0s)]
*  Like just a tap, cut the towel in half, man. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1152.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? I ain't got time for this shit. I'm ready to knock somebody the fuck out. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1155.0s)]
*  It was a special time in boxing because it was a long time where the heavyweight champion, you know, Larry Holmes didn't get his due because he beat up Muhammad Ali. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1162.0s)]
*  Everybody was always mad at Larry. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1170.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1171.0s)]
*  And then when Mike Tyson came along, it was like all of a sudden there's like a real heavyweight champion where everybody wants to see him fight. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1172.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, he was my first experience of a guy who was just, you know, the incredible Hulk, like going and knocking people out, you know, two or three rounds, it's over. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1180.0s)]
*  You know, I grew up watching Muhammad Ali and Larry Holmes and all the other fighters in between. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1195.0s)]
*  You know, I wasn't really, you know, old enough to appreciate Joe Frazier or nothing like that. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1202.0s)]
*  When Tyson came around, he was like, oh, this is what this is what you want in a fighter. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1208.0s)]
*  That's why he was a superhero. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1215.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1217.0s)]
*  I was like, this is what you want. You want that attitude. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1218.0s)]
*  You know, pretty fighters are OK, but you want you want a ferocious fighter. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1222.0s)]
*  Yeah, pretty fighters are fun to watch. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1229.0s)]
*  Floyd's fun. Look, as a person who appreciates what Floyd can do, the way he expresses himself, it's just it's genius. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1231.0s)]
*  It's genius boxing when, you know, a lot of people want to know who's the best ever. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1239.0s)]
*  I feel like you go on who got hit the least, who won the most fights and who got hit the least. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1243.0s)]
*  If you look at that, Floyd's at the top of the heap by far. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1248.0s)]
*  Like, no one's even close. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1251.0s)]
*  Yeah. And count the money. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1253.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1255.0s)]
*  And count the money. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1256.0s)]
*  I got to say he, you know, he is the best. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1257.0s)]
*  You know, when you want to see like a destruction, the Mike Tyson fights were a completely different kind of an event. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1260.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, the thing is, is, you know, I think people would love Floyd if he, you know, had a little more pop on the punch. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1267.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, he can hit you and get you and pop you and drop you and back you up and do all those good stuff and make you look bad. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1281.0s)]
*  And I think, you know, he's just people, you know, fought him for not, you know, when he hit it, you know, it hurt. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1289.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, he always had hand problems. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1300.0s)]
*  He had multiple hand breaks. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1302.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1305.0s)]
*  But that also probably contributed to how skillful he was because he couldn't get guys out with one shot. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1307.0s)]
*  So he had to just always be in the right spot, piece you up, hit and not get hit. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1312.0s)]
*  Just the way he did it standing in front of people. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1317.0s)]
*  I don't think folks understand how hard that is to do. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1320.0s)]
*  So crazy. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1323.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's almost like magic. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1324.0s)]
*  You know, it's almost like magic. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1328.0s)]
*  You know how, you know, like you stand in there and you're saying, come on, come with your best shot and you can't get it. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1330.0s)]
*  You can't land it. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1337.0s)]
*  How? How? Why? Why can't I land this shot? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1338.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1341.0s)]
*  Everybody thinks they can too. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1343.0s)]
*  That's what's interesting. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1344.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1345.0s)]
*  Especially in this whole promo tour he's doing where he's just running around doing these exhibitions. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1346.0s)]
*  They all think, I could probably land a shot. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1351.0s)]
*  No. He's 46. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1354.0s)]
*  No. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1357.0s)]
*  They're talking about him fighting Pacquiao. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1358.0s)]
*  Well, them doing it again. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1360.0s)]
*  I've watched that. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1362.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, hell yeah. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1363.0s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1366.0s)]
*  I don't think age should really keep you from checking out somebody you know who's a master. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1367.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1379.0s)]
*  Especially if he's fighting someone his age. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1380.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's two masters going at it. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1382.0s)]
*  And you know, age is just a number. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1385.0s)]
*  You know, it's really just a number. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1391.0s)]
*  It's not reality. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1393.0s)]
*  Reality is how you feel. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1395.0s)]
*  You know, it's a saying, if you didn't know how old you were, would you know how old you are? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1398.0s)]
*  Mmm. Some people would. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1404.0s)]
*  It's an indicator of how well your body's functioning. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1407.0s)]
*  It's a pretty good indicator though. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1411.0s)]
*  Like if you said someone wants to fight and they're 60, you go, 60. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1413.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1417.0s)]
*  60 is too old. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1418.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it's too old to see fast skills. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1419.0s)]
*  But have you ever seen an old man fight? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1424.0s)]
*  It's pretty interesting. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1426.0s)]
*  You know, a couple old dudes. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1427.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1429.0s)]
*  I've seen on the internet a couple old dudes get at it. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1430.0s)]
*  And it's fun. You know, one round get down. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1433.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1437.0s)]
*  You know, it's like, we got the 60 year olds with the one round get down. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1438.0s)]
*  We're going to go as long as they can before they fall out. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1441.0s)]
*  You get fucked up as a 60 year old though. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1443.0s)]
*  You don't recover. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1445.0s)]
*  Yeah. That's true. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1447.0s)]
*  You get your ass kicked as a 60 year old. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1448.0s)]
*  You might be fucked for the rest of your life. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1450.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1451.0s)]
*  You're risking a lot. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1452.0s)]
*  Yeah. Some people would do it though. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1453.0s)]
*  I've seen some guys that are young that got fucked up that were never the same. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1455.0s)]
*  You know, it's the roughest way to make a dollar in sports. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1460.0s)]
*  The roughest. The roughest. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1467.0s)]
*  And UFC even take it to another notch because, you know, somebody can kick your mouth open. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1469.0s)]
*  Kick your jaw open. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1475.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1476.0s)]
*  Knee you in the face. Elbow you in the eye socket. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1477.0s)]
*  Yeah. Or just, you know what I mean? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1479.0s)]
*  You know, pull your shit out of socket. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1482.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1484.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1485.0s)]
*  It's like. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1486.0s)]
*  It's a rough game. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1487.0s)]
*  It is. It's a rough game, you know. Tap out, baby. Tap out. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1488.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's just. But it's the most exciting thing to watch. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1493.0s)]
*  Combat sports to me is just like, man, when you watch like a world title fight, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1497.0s)]
*  there's very few things, whether it's boxing or MMA, like when Terrence Crawford's going to fight Earl Spence. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1502.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1508.0s)]
*  That fight is going to be crazy. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1509.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1511.0s)]
*  That is a crazy moment where you got two undefeated champions in their prime. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1512.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1517.0s)]
*  And no one knows what's going to happen. You're like, I don't know. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1518.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it's interesting. You know, sometimes those fights, they're just too skilled. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1520.0s)]
*  You know, have you ever seen guys just fight? They're too skilled and they're just both missing [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1529.0s)]
*  because they can't hit each other because they both got the skills, you know. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1533.0s)]
*  And they don't want to take too many chances and open up. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1537.0s)]
*  Yeah. So hopefully it's not one of them. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1540.0s)]
*  You know, hopefully it's one of those, they take it personal from the first couple of rounds and keep it going. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1543.0s)]
*  Yeah, I can't imagine. Terrence Crawford's never been in a boring fight ever. Neither has Earl Spence. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1550.0s)]
*  I think they're going to go after each other. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1554.0s)]
*  Well, they know how to tattoo their opponent. So I can imagine them just tattooing each other, you know, back and forth. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1556.0s)]
*  Yeah. I'm interested to see how Terrence, what stance he uses too. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1565.0s)]
*  Because he, in my opinion, he's the best switch hitter since Marvin Hagler. Nobody switches like Terrence. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1570.0s)]
*  Yeah. Terrence just, he's southpawed and he's orthodox and he's just as good from both sides. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1575.0s)]
*  And you got to like do all this calculating in the middle of the fight and switch it up. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1580.0s)]
*  Everything's coming from a different angle now. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1584.0s)]
*  Yeah, your brain is not moving as fast as it should be. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1586.0s)]
*  That's such a big advantage. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1591.0s)]
*  Your body can't move that fast if your brain is thinking so much. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1592.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1596.0s)]
*  Yeah, it should be instincts. But yeah, it's going to be an amazing fight. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1597.0s)]
*  And I'm worried a little bit about Earl. You know, he's been in those car accidents. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1601.0s)]
*  That one? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1606.0s)]
*  That one with the Ferrari. That's a crazy car accident. He could have died in that 100%. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1607.0s)]
*  If he didn't have a seatbelt, I mean, he wasn't wearing a seatbelt. But if he was wearing a seatbelt, he might be dead. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1611.0s)]
*  If he was wearing one. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1616.0s)]
*  Yeah, he got thrown from the Ferrari. He was in a convertible. Have you seen it? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1617.0s)]
*  No, I haven't. I've seen the car. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1621.0s)]
*  Have you seen the video? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1623.0s)]
*  I haven't seen the video. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1624.0s)]
*  Oh, shit. Watch this. This video is crazy. Here it goes. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1625.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1628.0s)]
*  Yeah. So he got thrown out of the car. And that's how he survived. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1630.0s)]
*  I didn't know it was like that. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1636.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1637.0s)]
*  Geez. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1638.0s)]
*  Dude, 100% could have been dead. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1639.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1642.0s)]
*  100%. I mean, that was a terrible accident. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1643.0s)]
*  It's hard to say that you 100% out there. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1645.0s)]
*  I mean, he rolled like five, six, seven times. Look at that car. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1649.0s)]
*  If he wasn't a master athlete, could he had survived that? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1652.0s)]
*  And who knows what happened to him when he survived, right? Like, did he hit his head? Did he hit his neck? Like, is he okay? Like, is he 100%? Or is he always going to be a little fuck from that? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1657.0s)]
*  There's another angle. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1668.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1669.0s)]
*  Jesus. Oh my God. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1670.0s)]
*  That's one of the most horrific ones I've seen. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1672.0s)]
*  But he was okay. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1675.0s)]
*  That's good. Thank God. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1677.0s)]
*  Amazing. Because like a talent like that, to take that guy at a young age, it would be so horrible. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1678.0s)]
*  Yes. Yes. It would be devastating. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1684.0s)]
*  They give these dudes money and you could just go buy one of those cars. It's kind of crazy. You could just go buy a 700 horsepower car. You don't even know how to drive. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1688.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1697.0s)]
*  You just have money. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1698.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know. I used to, there was a trip because I remember being at the studio, Echo Sound one time and Tupac came. He pulled up and like, Benz. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1699.0s)]
*  It's like, oh man, Pac, you got your Benz. He's like, yep. I don't have my license, man. I hope I don't wreck it. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1710.0s)]
*  I'm like, damn. Man, park that car, man. You don't know how to drive it. He's like, no, man. I've been in New York, man, for so long. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1716.0s)]
*  I don't worry about driving. I'm like, oh, you know, I think he did wreck it a few times. You know what I'm saying? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1724.0s)]
*  It was all said and done. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1732.0s)]
*  Learning how to drive first cars and Benz. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1733.0s)]
*  Yeah. Benz, you know, it was like 500. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1735.0s)]
*  What was the first thing you bought when you started making money? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1738.0s)]
*  Oh man, the first thing I bought. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1741.0s)]
*  Like the first car? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1744.0s)]
*  Oh man, I bought a Honda Accord. I bought a Honda Accord. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1748.0s)]
*  You know, they had just come out with a new model. It was about 20 Gs. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1754.0s)]
*  And I was like, you know, I'm sick of rolling around here. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1760.0s)]
*  You know, at first I had like a sidekick, you know, Suzuki sidekick. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1764.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1770.0s)]
*  Suzuki made cars. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1771.0s)]
*  I remember those. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1772.0s)]
*  I was like, man, I need some luxury. You know what I mean? I'm starting to make money. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1773.0s)]
*  You know, let's go down here and get this Honda Accord. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1778.0s)]
*  Kim, she's my wife, but she was my girlfriend at the time. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1781.0s)]
*  So we went down there, place on, I think it was Losianica. They had a Honda spot. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1785.0s)]
*  And I just went in there and bought a black Honda Accord. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1790.0s)]
*  Cash. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1793.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1794.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1795.0s)]
*  That's a pretty reasonable car. But you didn't go crazy. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1796.0s)]
*  I only had 20 Gs. So if I had had 40, I'd have bought, you know, probably a BMW, you know what I mean? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1800.0s)]
*  Three series or something. So, you know, at the time it was the first cool thing I was able to buy and not sweat it. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1807.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like that's the key is to buy it and not sweat it. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1816.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1820.0s)]
*  You know, if you buying it and you sweating it still, you like, damn. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1821.0s)]
*  I remember one day I remember Dre and Yella, they got checks. I think they got checks for like $35,000. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1825.0s)]
*  Next thing I seen them, they had both had vets, I think Corvettes. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1832.0s)]
*  And I was like, how much you pay in 31? How much you pay for yours? 33? [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1837.0s)]
*  I'm like, y'all broke now. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1841.0s)]
*  So what? We look good. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1847.0s)]
*  It's funny, but that's the temptation, you know? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1850.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, you, man, you like, you only live once and we know a lot of people that die young. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1853.0s)]
*  And so it's kind of like getting what you're getting is good. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1864.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's also you're young. When you're young, when I first started making money, my manager thought I had a gambling problem. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1868.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1875.0s)]
*  He called me up and said, are you having a gambling problem? Because he knew how much money I was burning through. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1876.0s)]
*  I go, no, man, I'm eating lobster every night. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1880.0s)]
*  I grew up poor. I'm like, I'm eating steak and lobster. I'm taking my friends out. I'm like, I'm spending money. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1883.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's what you do, you know, and it feels good. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1890.0s)]
*  Yeah, it feels good. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1894.0s)]
*  It feels good to finally be able to treat and not, you know, worry about what it's going to look like. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1895.0s)]
*  That's the big thing is the worry. I remember the first check I got, I got a check from Disney for a development deal from Disney in like 1993. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1901.0s)]
*  And when I got the check, it was like weight lifted off my shoulders. It was like, whoo. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1909.0s)]
*  Like I could look at my bank account. I got money in the bank account. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1915.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1919.0s)]
*  I could pay the bills. I don't have to think about the bills right now. It was like, like I was lighter. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1920.0s)]
*  Without a doubt. I mean, it does weigh on you when you can't, you know, when you don't know exactly where the money's going to come from. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1924.0s)]
*  You know, the bills here, you know when you got to pay it, but you really don't know exactly how this is all going to come together. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1934.0s)]
*  You know, you you hope the universe bless you with an opportunity. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1941.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1946.0s)]
*  And and so to not have that worry, it is a weight lifted off, you know, and I wish I wish more people could feel the weight lifted off. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1947.0s)]
*  But there's another thing. The more you make, the more you spend. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1958.0s)]
*  So sometimes the weight comes back, comes back on. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1963.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, the weight comes back on. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1967.0s)]
*  And then you have employees and that's another way. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1969.0s)]
*  That's a different way. That's like you think about other people's families. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1972.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1975.0s)]
*  You're making money for them, too. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1976.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, you really, you know, that's why I don't do nothing crazy. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1978.0s)]
*  You know, I'm not in the skydiving like that. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1983.0s)]
*  You know, I'm definitely not going down in no damn submarine. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1987.0s)]
*  Yeah. What the fuck? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1990.0s)]
*  Titanic. I don't do I don't take those crazy chances because, you know, I got generations depending on me. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=1992.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2002.0s)]
*  And so, you know, got to take that responsibility serious because you never know when others in my family bloodline or whatever are going to be able to have the opportunities that I have. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2003.0s)]
*  You know, even though my son O'Shea Jr., you know, he's working constantly. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2018.0s)]
*  He's in Spain right now. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2024.0s)]
*  Yeah, he is. That's amazing. That's amazing that he's carrying on. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2026.0s)]
*  That's beautiful. It is. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2030.0s)]
*  That must make you very proud. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2031.0s)]
*  Man, it's like the best. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2033.0s)]
*  One guy asked me, you know, how does it feel seeing your son, you know, straight out of Compton and does so well? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2035.0s)]
*  I said it's like it's like winning the Super Bowl on a team. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2044.0s)]
*  And then your son comes and win the Super Bowl for that same team. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2051.0s)]
*  That's the feeling. I don't know if anybody has ever had that feeling, but it seems like that's how I feel. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2058.0s)]
*  It's like I won with NWA and he won with NWA. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2064.0s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2071.0s)]
*  That's amazing. And what a perfect person to play. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2073.0s)]
*  I mean, who would be better to play you? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2075.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2078.0s)]
*  It's perfect. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2079.0s)]
*  It's perfect. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2080.0s)]
*  I mean, before he decided to take the movie, I would take him on tour with me and we would do we was doing that anyway. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2081.0s)]
*  He would jump on stage. He would do Dope Man. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2092.0s)]
*  You know, I'm like, oh, that's my son, you know, and I'm like, man, he got that swagger up here. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2095.0s)]
*  I mean, mommy of a young me. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2102.0s)]
*  OK, so when it was time to do the movie, when it was really a go, I went to him and I said, hey, man, this this NWA movie looked like it's going to go. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2105.0s)]
*  He's like, cool, man. That's good. Good luck, man. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2118.0s)]
*  That's great. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2120.0s)]
*  Hold on. Hold on. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2122.0s)]
*  I said, I want you to play me. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2123.0s)]
*  He was like, OK. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2128.0s)]
*  And I'm like, wow, that was too easy. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2131.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2134.0s)]
*  I was like, you know, that was he was like, OK. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2135.0s)]
*  And he just kept on walking. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2138.0s)]
*  I'm like, wait a minute. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2139.0s)]
*  And then I said, I got to see if he's serious or he's just, you know, saying OK, just say OK. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2141.0s)]
*  But it's a hell of a lot of work. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2148.0s)]
*  So I started putting him through the ringer a little bit. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2150.0s)]
*  You know, I was like, hey, man, we got to act and we got to act and coach for you. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2156.0s)]
*  You know, LA, you need to go down there on Thursday. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2162.0s)]
*  You know, you need to be there at this time. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2165.0s)]
*  Boom, boom, boom. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2167.0s)]
*  All right. All right. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2168.0s)]
*  And he would go. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2170.0s)]
*  And I'm like, OK, he's starting to go. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2171.0s)]
*  But is he just going? Is he participating? Is he into it? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2174.0s)]
*  You know, boom. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2177.0s)]
*  So I said, I'm going to try something else. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2179.0s)]
*  I sent him to New York to a guy for, you know, training, acting. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2181.0s)]
*  I'm like, I'm sitting with him in New York and see if he'll do that, because that's when he'll bail. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2189.0s)]
*  Be like, oh, you know, I got something to do. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2194.0s)]
*  So he got on the plane, flew to New York, worked with this cat, flew back. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2198.0s)]
*  Now, when he flew back, I was checking him out, saying what he was doing. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2205.0s)]
*  You know, we was far from actually casting a movie at that time. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2210.0s)]
*  And then he was like, he came up, he was like, I'm going to go work with my coach today. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2214.0s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2220.0s)]
*  He said, yeah, me and my acting coach, we're going to get together. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2221.0s)]
*  We're going to do a couple of things. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2223.0s)]
*  I'm like, he's into it. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2225.0s)]
*  He's into it. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2227.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2229.0s)]
*  So then I let him do that. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2230.0s)]
*  Let him do that. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2232.0s)]
*  So now I have to approach Gary Gray. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2233.0s)]
*  Now, Gary Gray is the director of Straight Outta Compton. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2235.0s)]
*  He also directed Friday and he directed It Was a Good Day. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2239.0s)]
*  You know, these are some of my biggest projects. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2243.0s)]
*  And when I told him, he was like, yeah, man, it's cool. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2246.0s)]
*  You know, he just thinking about who he going to get to play here. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2250.0s)]
*  I said, OK, guess who I want to play Ice Cube? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2253.0s)]
*  He's like, who, who, who? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2256.0s)]
*  I said, my son. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2258.0s)]
*  He was like, oh, Cube. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2260.0s)]
*  I said, what the fuck, man? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2265.0s)]
*  I thought we was making a real movie, man. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2268.0s)]
*  I said, we are making a real movie. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2270.0s)]
*  What you talking about? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2277.0s)]
*  I said, he's going to be great, ain't it? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2279.0s)]
*  He's going to be great. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2282.0s)]
*  If you get the part, he'll have to audition and Universal will sign off on him. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2283.0s)]
*  But you're going to work with him, just like John Singleton worked with me. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2289.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2293.0s)]
*  John put me in Boys in the Hood. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2294.0s)]
*  I didn't act. I wasn't no actor. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2296.0s)]
*  I was just a rapper. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2298.0s)]
*  And he saw something in me, put me in the movie and he helped me through it. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2299.0s)]
*  And the rest is history. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2304.0s)]
*  And you're going to do the same thing. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2306.0s)]
*  And he was like, wow. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2308.0s)]
*  So, make a long story short. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2310.0s)]
*  It's audition time. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2313.0s)]
*  Screen test time. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2315.0s)]
*  Now, my son go in there and he said, he got pissed off. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2317.0s)]
*  Because there's five other fucking ice cubes there to audition. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2324.0s)]
*  He's like, these dudes think they about to take this? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2328.0s)]
*  He said, man, I felt like I had the family name on my back. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2331.0s)]
*  I had to go in there and house this shit. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2335.0s)]
*  And he said, you know, when he left the screen test, Dona Langley from Universal called me. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2339.0s)]
*  And I was like, your son was great. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2347.0s)]
*  He was actually the best one. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2349.0s)]
*  And we're going to sign off on it. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2350.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2352.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2353.0s)]
*  It's cool. Cool story. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2354.0s)]
*  That's a great story. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2356.0s)]
*  It's a great story the way you made him do it, too. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2357.0s)]
*  That's so smart. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2359.0s)]
*  He worked harder than any of the other actors. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2360.0s)]
*  Like two years of grinding. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2363.0s)]
*  Because you know the coach's son always, he get it the worst. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2366.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2370.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2371.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2372.0s)]
*  And it was no different on this movie. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2373.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2376.0s)]
*  I had to make sure that he won. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2377.0s)]
*  And he set up himself for a career in this game. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2380.0s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2385.0s)]
*  Your career, one of the things that's so fascinating about your career is there was never anyone like you before that did what you did. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2387.0s)]
*  You went from gangster rap to like family movies. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2395.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2400.0s)]
*  Like no one's ever done that. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2401.0s)]
*  And then sports entertainment. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2403.0s)]
*  Like you've branched out into so many things. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2405.0s)]
*  But the key part of it that people need to understand today is when you guys came out, when NWA came out, the whole world went, what the fuck? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2407.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2418.0s)]
*  The whole world. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2419.0s)]
*  I remember I was in Revere, Massachusetts. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2420.0s)]
*  I was on an elliptical machine at the gym. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2422.0s)]
*  And a friend of mine told me, you gotta listen to this shit. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2424.0s)]
*  And I had a cassette walkman. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2427.0s)]
*  So I'm there with a cassette walkman on an elliptical machine listening straight out of Compton going, holy shit. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2429.0s)]
*  Like this is wild. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2436.0s)]
*  There was nothing like that before that. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2438.0s)]
*  And I remember like laughing while I was riding the elliptical. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2440.0s)]
*  I'm like, these guys ride their fucking mics. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2443.0s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2445.0s)]
*  And then there was like the Tipper Gore shit where Al Gore's wife was trying to censor rap music. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2448.0s)]
*  The PMRC, Parents Resources Against Music Council or something like that. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2455.0s)]
*  That was the Democrats, folks. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2462.0s)]
*  That's the reason you have an advisory sticker on the record. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2465.0s)]
*  Because that was the compromise. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2470.0s)]
*  They were saying, you know, I sent my daughter to the record store to buy a record. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2473.0s)]
*  She came home with the fucking two live crew. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2482.0s)]
*  I didn't know this shit was going to be like this. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2484.0s)]
*  You know, so the compromise from the record industry was we'll put a parental advisory sticker on the record. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2487.0s)]
*  So if a parent was buying a record for Christmas, you know, their parents was like, I want too short. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2501.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2508.0s)]
*  They go buy the too short record, put it in, and they're like, what the hell? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2509.0s)]
*  So we were the first group to put that sticker on our records. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2513.0s)]
*  We were the very first group because Priority Records designed that parental advisory sticker. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2519.0s)]
*  And, yep, that sticker. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2529.0s)]
*  And it was actually it had to be stuck on the record like a sticker. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2532.0s)]
*  And they had to go through all our records in every record store and put the sticker on. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2539.0s)]
*  So the next time we did artwork, we just planted it in the artwork. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2545.0s)]
*  And then kids wouldn't buy your shit if it didn't have to stick. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2550.0s)]
*  It's like putting a sticker on clean records. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2557.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2561.0s)]
*  It's like a clean record, not one ounce of profanity on it. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2562.0s)]
*  But they was putting the parental advisory because kids was looking at it and it was like, we're just sticking with no... [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2566.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. The opposite effect. It promotes it. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2571.0s)]
*  Yes, that's exactly what happened. It promoted it. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2575.0s)]
*  Two Live Crew was the first band that got arrested, though, right? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2578.0s)]
*  Were they the first band that got arrested? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2581.0s)]
*  On stage, I believe. I'm not sure. Rap got a long history. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2585.0s)]
*  I don't know if somebody tackled Kool Herc or somebody. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2591.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2595.0s)]
*  But that's the one that went nationwide news. And yeah, he got arrested. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2596.0s)]
*  Luke fought for all of our freedom of speech, to be honest. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2605.0s)]
*  If they would have took Luke down and the Two Live Crew at the time and said that his music is too obscene and you can't sell stuff like this, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2611.0s)]
*  everything would probably be so sterile right now. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2621.0s)]
*  Yeah, oh, for sure. That's the same thing with Howard Stern and radio. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2628.0s)]
*  They went after Howard. They find them insane amounts of money for the Howard Stern show. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2633.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I remember. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2639.0s)]
*  And if he just folded and gave into that, there'd probably be no podcasts. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2640.0s)]
*  Or it would have taken a lot longer for people to figure this out. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2644.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's incredible when you stand up at the moment of truth. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2647.0s)]
*  You know, yeah, it's important for us to stand up at the time that is going on and not back down and then try to regroup it. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2657.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then go at it. You know, it's really important. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2670.0s)]
*  It is. For people to stand up for themselves. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2674.0s)]
*  But it's hard. Yes. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2677.0s)]
*  It's hard today more than ever because you get so much pressure, people like especially during COVID, people ganged up on people, people were doing the man's work for the man. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2679.0s)]
*  It's like, who the fuck are you trusting? Like, why are you trusting these people that have been lying forever? [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2689.0s)]
*  Yeah, man, it was wild during that time. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2695.0s)]
*  Like, you know, people being bullied into doing things that they didn't want to do. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2698.0s)]
*  A lot of them didn't want to do it. They did it because of their work or their, you know, their situations. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2710.0s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of them are hurting right now. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2719.0s)]
*  I know a guy that's been dealing with tinnitus since he got it. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2722.0s)]
*  And so, you know, it's just... [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2732.0s)]
*  I know quite a few people that got fucked up. Some of them pretty bad. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2736.0s)]
*  It's just... [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2742.0s)]
*  If you wanted to do it in a textbook way, like if it was a conspiracy, that's how I would do it. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2745.0s)]
*  I'd isolate people, make them stay at home, take away their livelihood, make them scared, give them small checks, you know, and then give them this thing that you got to take to get back to normal. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2751.0s)]
*  Want to get back to normal? Yeah. Go take that. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2760.0s)]
*  Don't worry. It's safe and effective, safe and effective, safe and effective. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2763.0s)]
*  And then you have all this pressure and everyone is yelling at you if you don't do it. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2766.0s)]
*  But if you don't do it, we're not going to get back to normal. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2771.0s)]
*  And everybody got scared and everybody just stepped in line. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2774.0s)]
*  It was strange. It's strange. Yeah, it was. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2778.0s)]
*  You know, stepping in line sometimes is not the way to go. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2784.0s)]
*  No, it's not always the way to go. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2789.0s)]
*  You know, you're trying to prevent and trying to make things all smooth and easy and no issues and back to normal and all that. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2792.0s)]
*  And the world might be back to normal, but are you normal? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2802.0s)]
*  Well, you got to be able to make informed decisions. Yes. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2808.0s)]
*  And when you can't make an informed decision and you're being pressured anyway, it's like, what do you... [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2811.0s)]
*  And this is the thing that was driving me crazy. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2816.0s)]
*  Before the election, when Donald Trump was president, all they were talking about is, I'm not going to take the shot. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2819.0s)]
*  You're going to take a shot that Trump made? Who's going to take that shot? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2826.0s)]
*  Even Biden was saying it. Who's going to take it? Kamala Harris is saying it. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2829.0s)]
*  They were all saying it. Don't take that. I would never take that. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2833.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, Biden becomes president. And they're like, you got to take it. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2836.0s)]
*  Because it's the same thing. This is the same thing. You know how long it takes to develop a vaccine? [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2839.0s)]
*  This is the same vaccine. Same one. You guys were just talking shit. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2843.0s)]
*  And no matter who tried to give it to you at the end of the day, it wasn't ready. It's not ready. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2846.0s)]
*  Six months to try to turn this thing into something effective that was totally experimental. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2854.0s)]
*  And everybody who took it was basically signing up to take an experimental drug. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2867.0s)]
*  And I'm not anti-vax. I've been vaxed before. I've had vaccines. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2877.0s)]
*  They have out all of them. Everyone I was supposed to get. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2883.0s)]
*  Exactly. But those have been... some have been around 80 years, some have been around 50, 40. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2886.0s)]
*  And I just wasn't comfortable after six months. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2894.0s)]
*  I was ready to take it. The UFC allocated 150 vaccines, I think, for all their employees. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2899.0s)]
*  And this was when we were doing shows during the lockdowns. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2905.0s)]
*  So we'd go. There was a COVID bubble. You'd get tested. You'd get tested the day of the event. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2908.0s)]
*  And I was there. And they said, oh, we got the vaccines. You want to take it? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2912.0s)]
*  I said, yeah. So I called up the doctor. I said, hey, man, can I take it? [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2915.0s)]
*  And they said, yeah, hold on. We'll set it up. I was going to take it like before the show. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2918.0s)]
*  I thought it was just like a flu shot. Give me that thing. It's normal, right? [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2922.0s)]
*  And they call me up and they say, no, we can't do it until Monday. It has to be done at the clinic. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2925.0s)]
*  Can you go on Monday? I said, I can't. I'd better be back for another event in two weeks. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2931.0s)]
*  Okay, we'll do it then. And during that time, it got pulled. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2935.0s)]
*  During the time, it got pulled for blood clots. And two guys I knew had strokes. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2938.0s)]
*  Two guys I knew. Wow. Yeah. Wow. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2943.0s)]
*  And then I was like, okay, what is going on? And then my friend got it and got over it quick. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2945.0s)]
*  And I was like, what's going on? My real estate lady had it and she didn't even have any symptoms. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2950.0s)]
*  She tested positive twice and she's like, well, I got to isolate, but I feel fine. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2954.0s)]
*  And I was like, what is this? Is this a death sentence or is this like how many people are asymptomatic? [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2958.0s)]
*  You find out like 65 percent of the people are asymptomatic. Like what the fuck is going on here? [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2963.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then I knew some people that got in and got real sick, but they were fat or they were out of shape or they had other problems. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2968.0s)]
*  Then I knew a few friends who were real healthy that got it. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2977.0s)]
*  They got wrecked because they didn't take it seriously and they kept working out. So there was a lot of confusion. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2979.0s)]
*  Yes. And, you know, it was a lot of a lot of fear. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2983.0s)]
*  But when I finally got it and I got over quick and then they started attacking me for taking a horse medication, I was like, what the fuck is going on? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2987.0s)]
*  Shouldn't you be more interested in the fact that this deadly disease hit this 55 year old dude and he was better in three days? [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=2994.0s)]
*  Isn't that more interesting? Like, why don't you ask what I took? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3001.0s)]
*  Yeah. Why did I get better? What is it? Yeah, I wasn't vaccinated. Yeah, I wasn't vaccinated. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3004.0s)]
*  But I got over it quick. So what's wrong with that in any other fucking rational, sane world? [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3010.0s)]
*  When there's a disease and someone goes to a doctor and gets medication for that disease and gets better in three days, you go, oh, well, that's a way to get better from that disease. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3017.0s)]
*  Yes. This is one singular thing that you have to do that I can't even do now because I already have antibodies. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3026.0s)]
*  Like, this is stupid. It's crazy. And, you know, the thing is, is when money is the driving force and, you know, I don't know if they can even get money off of what you took. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3032.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? It seems like something has been around for a long time. That's just one of the things I took. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3048.0s)]
*  And there's no money in it. Right. No new money in it. Yes. Zero money in it. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3054.0s)]
*  So that's really what it's all about. You know, it's not about if it works or if it's effective. It's about they can't make no money off of it. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3059.0s)]
*  And we got this new stuff that we can make billions. So that's where the pressure comes from. And that's why they pushing it. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3067.0s)]
*  That's why you have to think for yourself because money is driving these people to give you bad advice or give you the wrong advice or or the high, you know, solutions and cures and remedies from you. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3076.0s)]
*  And, you know, you got to once you peep that out, you have to take a step back and make sure that you're following the money to make sure it's not going to take you down. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3096.0s)]
*  It's just so hard to do in the middle of a pandemic. That's why it was so hard because everybody was just like locked in their house and scared, especially in California. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3109.0s)]
*  The attitude in California was so much different than the attitude here. We came to Texas. I'm like, don't have a mask on. This is crazy. You're just out normal. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3117.0s)]
*  Yeah, Callie. They went crazy with it. You know, I was using a mask really as a disguise. Finally walked, finally walked through here and nobody asked for a selfie. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3125.0s)]
*  I mean, cool. So, you know, I kind of like I got the mask in my pocket for that, too. You know, I mean, pop it on the airport. It's just a disguise now. Yeah. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3137.0s)]
*  Well, finally, you can wear a mask. Yeah. The other time. And that's what I tripped off, too. I was like, they let all these people stand around in these stores, walking through these stores with their face covered. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3148.0s)]
*  Yeah. And banks. Yeah. When is a guy just going to pull out a pistol? I don't know. They all have masks. We don't know who it was. Who's that masked man? [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3159.0s)]
*  Well, it's happening so often in New York City. They made people take their masks down when they went into stores. They made that a rule so that the camera can get a shot of your face. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3168.0s)]
*  Lord. It's so stupid. It's so stupid. I'm supposed to keep this on to protect everybody. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3176.0s)]
*  Well, and then they found out real early that it didn't even work. They knew early that those things were bullshit. But it was a it was a thing that get you to comply with. Yeah. And it's also you did it so you didn't feel like an asshole. If everybody had a mask on you didn't you felt like an asshole. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3183.0s)]
*  So I put a mask. Yeah. And you know, people were looking at you like you're the one spreading all the covid around here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was crazy. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3197.0s)]
*  I knew a guy got sick wearing the mask like he had this cloth mask that he just felt it was the thing that was going to protect them. I'm like, dude, you're breathing in and like wash that thing. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? You breathing that you I don't know what you breathe. You breathing in last week's bad breath. Yeah. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3208.0s)]
*  Fat burger like dude, you know what I'm saying? Take that off your face. Yeah. You wouldn't want that on a wound. No. Right. A dirty ass rag over a cut. Yeah. He's breathing through it all day every day. Getting right in your bloodstream. Yeah. You smoking weed through that thing. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3231.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was just weird. This is a weird time. I saw that you would you'd have to pass out a movie because they wanted you to get shot. Yeah. You know, they strangest thing, you know, say we're doing a movie. We're doing a movie. I'm like, okay. And then [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3248.0s)]
*  All the producers in Hollywood decided that they don't want anybody on their movie set that haven't gotten a vaccine. And what year was this? This is 2020. Okay, so it's in the middle of it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we're coming out of it. I think it might be 21 when we know okay, everything is going back to normal. But [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3270.0s)]
*  I believe the news came out during 2020. And so, you know, I never thought it was a producer's mandate. You know, I thought it was a studio mandate. But I think the studios really wanted to have, you know, kind of a little out. So they put it on a producer like this is not us. This is [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3300.0s)]
*  This production that production this production that production I'm like, but it is every production. So you mean tell me every producer in Hollywood has this mandate. Give me a break. It has to come from the studio to hit every producer because every producer don't think the same way. Right. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3326.0s)]
*  Some producers, you know, had their own different opinions. So anyway, it was a studio mandate. They put it on individual producers. So producers talking to my people. And they're like, if he don't take it, you know, we can't be in the movie. It's like it's not taking it's not taking it. So I okay can do the movie. Okay, no problem. Now I didn't go out telling everybody what happened. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3343.0s)]
*  I didn't [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3374.0s)]
*  Put the word out that I didn't even tell people that I wasn't vaccinated. I didn't tell people not to go get vaccinated. I didn't tell people that I'm not doing this movie because I don't want to be vaccinated. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3377.0s)]
*  But somehow some way the news hit the you know, I don't know if the Hollywood Reporter or somebody put it out that this is why cube is not doing the movie. And I thought it was chicken shit. Thought it was, you know, like what happened to the HIPAA laws, you know, or OSHA one of them. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3389.0s)]
*  I think it's hip, you know, where you're not supposed to reveal a person's medical status. And here it is. They print mine. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3413.0s)]
*  And so I just thought it was bullshit. And, and it just kind of snowballed, you know, I'm like, what they want is for people to tell me I'm stupid. You know, I mean, they want people to tell me you turn it you turn it down $9 million. You stupid. You know, I'll do anything for $9 million. How stupid can cube be? [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3422.0s)]
*  And I don't care about that. You know, it's like, I didn't lose $9 million. Because I never had it. Like if you never have some shit, you can't lose it. Okay. You lose it when it's in your bank account, then you look up and it's gone. You know what I'm saying? But if you never had it, I didn't lose it. It just was never given to me. And so, you know, they tried to, you know, put my business in the street, put pressure on me. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3447.0s)]
*  Everybody around me telling me how stupid I am so I can go get vaxxed and say, you know, please let me do the movie. You know, that was never gonna happen. I don't care if it was 20 million. That was never gonna happen. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3477.0s)]
*  And if you got injured from that vaccine, you would have paid that 20 million to be healthy again. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3490.0s)]
*  Damn right. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3495.0s)]
*  Damn right. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3496.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3497.0s)]
*  Damn right. There's a lot of people out there that wish they weren't forced into making that decision. And that's where the real lawsuits are gonna come from. The real lawsuits, since you can't sue the vaccine companies, they're gonna start suing these businesses and they're already lining up. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3498.0s)]
*  Without a doubt. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3511.0s)]
*  Without a doubt. It was a gigantic error. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3512.0s)]
*  And they're, you know, they fired a lot of people. You know, I think they fired a lot of cops in New York. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3514.0s)]
*  And they had to hire them back. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3523.0s)]
*  And give them back pay. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3526.0s)]
*  And give them back pay. But what about the ones that were injured that took the vax? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3527.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3532.0s)]
*  You know, they gotta have some kind of repercussion because, you know, they just proved that, they just kind of told on themselves that we got this wrong. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3533.0s)]
*  Yeah. And nobody wants to talk about it. That's the crazy thing. Cause all the news stories. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3544.0s)]
*  They can. You know, that's when I'm talking about the gatekeepers. Nobody can talk about it because somebody above them told them no. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3549.0s)]
*  From this outlet, that outlet. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3559.0s)]
*  You know, the NBA, going back to that, you know, I'm just kind of putting it in perspective. But the guys in the NBA used to talk about the big three. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3563.0s)]
*  If you go back to year one, all the time. And then they just stopped. And then I asked, you know, I asked my guy, you know, what happened, man? Why y'all stop? [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3574.0s)]
*  They told us we couldn't mention the big three anymore on air. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3586.0s)]
*  So I'm like, that's chicken shit. You know, that's that, that's that bullshit that I'm talking about. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3592.0s)]
*  That, you know, I'm talking about what happened to me, but it obviously happens everywhere to all of us. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3599.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? And we got to somehow, some way get these people out of our way or not support what they're doing and producing. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3607.0s)]
*  You know, some of these mainstream outlets are really just an extension of these corporate conglomerates who want to, you know, kind of control our emotions, control our movement, control our spinning, control our personalities, control our mind. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3622.0s)]
*  And, you know, what are we going to do about it? Like at the end of the day, you know what I'm saying? [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3649.0s)]
*  Like, we're going to just sit here and let it happen day after day to where steam rolled and and and wore out and have no fight in us. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3657.0s)]
*  Or are we going to stand up where we can? You know what I mean? And push back when we can. I know everybody can't in all situations and don't feel bad when you can't. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3673.0s)]
*  But when you can and you know you can do it. Yes. Do it like when you have the leverage. Take it. Yeah. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3685.0s)]
*  Take it like UFC when you got the leverage, you got to go. Yeah. Use that to your advantage. You might not always have the leverage. You might not always have, you know, the right timing. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3694.0s)]
*  But when you do when you can, we got to we got to buck buck back, you know. If not, we're just going to continue to get steamrolled and not be heard and canceled and all this kind of stupid stuff. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3707.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're just repeating patterns that have played out throughout history. Yes. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3724.0s)]
*  When people get power, they want to have ultimate power. They want more power. Any obstructions they see to their goals, any things that people were doing that would get in the way, they want to silence that, stop that. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3728.0s)]
*  They want to bust unions. They want to do whatever the fuck they can to consolidate their power. Yeah. And it's at a certain point is just ridiculous. Yeah. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3742.0s)]
*  And it was not good for us. These are some of the most unhappy people in the world who just concerned with more and more power and they're powerful. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3751.0s)]
*  You know, whenever you saw a guy who was maxing out, you know, bench pressing or whatever, blew out his shoulder. Like lunchtimes. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3762.0s)]
*  It's like you was maxed out the last time you maxed out. Why are you trying to max out even more and more and more and more? And then you blow out your shoulder. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3777.0s)]
*  So I'm saying so at a certain point, you got to know when you got enough of this and enough of that. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3787.0s)]
*  I think the money people though, they never think that way because it's all about numbers. Like the whole thing is numbers. It's not like, look, I put out a new album. Look, I put out a new movie. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3794.0s)]
*  I'm creating a thing. I'm putting together stuff for them. It's always numbers. It's all numbers. It's just numbers. And so you never feel satisfied. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3804.0s)]
*  And there's always a guy with a bigger jet. There's always a guy with a bigger house. There's always a guy with more of this, more of that. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3812.0s)]
*  And usually, you know, you can find happier people with way, way, way less. Way less. Yeah. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3820.0s)]
*  If your goal is happy, that is not the occupation you should be in. That's not. Yeah. Those people are miserable. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3829.0s)]
*  Yeah. And they're always chasing and they're never satisfied. You know, that to me is torture in itself. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3835.0s)]
*  Well, it's also stupid. And if you run a corporation, it's actually your obligation, your obligation to your shareholders to continue to make as much money as possible. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3843.0s)]
*  So you're trapped in a system that obligates you to behave and think that way. And if you don't, you won't be competitive. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3852.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's a, it's a ugly game, you know, and I don't see where people are being thought about in these type situations. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3858.0s)]
*  You know, it's all about, you know, capital don't care. Yeah. Capital has no emotions. Capital only respects capital. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3871.0s)]
*  Yeah. The only time it respects people's opinions is when people boycott shit and it works like this Bud Light thing. Yeah. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3880.0s)]
*  Then, and now people are like, don't do that again. Yeah. Like, be careful. Because look what happened to Bud Light. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3886.0s)]
*  Well, who controls Bud Light? That's the question. Why would they make a dumb decision like that? Are they trying to ruin Bud Light? [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3892.0s)]
*  And why would they want to ruin Bud Light? Are they trying to take down some of our most iconic American brands? And why would that help them? [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3901.0s)]
*  I don't think they were trying to. I don't think they had any idea this was going to happen. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3912.0s)]
*  This is the ESG thing that everybody has to dedicate a certain amount of their time to, you know, woke stuff. Who, who man, who mandates that? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3916.0s)]
*  It's a good question. Where's the ESG money come from? Is that government? Like, where does that come from? [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3926.0s)]
*  And it's they have scores and the ESG score of your corporation determines what you get. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3932.0s)]
*  And the problem is also you get these people that are coming out of college like this lady who made the decision for Bud Light. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3939.0s)]
*  You know, she's gone through the university system. She's in the corporate system and she's a woman and she thinks, you know, we have to be more inclusive. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3945.0s)]
*  And that's all the language everyone's using today. Yeah. So they don't know any real people. They don't know regular people. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3953.0s)]
*  They have no idea that if you take a brand Bud Light, which is like known for, you know, blue collar drinking people that they like to fucking watch football and drink Bud Light. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3959.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you have this mentally ill person who's just an attention whore and you make a big deal out of putting this person's 365 days of womanhood. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3968.0s)]
*  You put that on a Bud Light can and they freak the fuck out. Yeah. And then Kid Rock shoots a bunch of them and then it's on. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3978.0s)]
*  Once Kid Rock shoots your cans, you got real problems. Yeah, I'm pretty sure you do. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3984.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. It's kind of like I think you got to you got to still ask why. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3990.0s)]
*  Like what do you think is like a conspiracy? Well, you know, who's getting hurt? [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=3998.0s)]
*  Who's getting hurt in this whole thing? Is it the Bud Light? [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4004.0s)]
*  And how's the Bush? Brass? Are they are with their bonuses be affected with their checks and salaries be affected? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4009.0s)]
*  You got this lower level person fired and bunch of middle class guys are paying the price because you got distribution centers, you know, guys that deliver the beer. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4020.0s)]
*  Nobody want and now they're out of a job. Now you're really attacking the middle class by by making a brand that's so big. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4032.0s)]
*  Take a hit like that. You know, the quickest destruction of a company in history. Bud Light sponsors Toronto Pride Parade. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4044.0s)]
*  So, you know, it's a. Oh, that's a one was this. That was just the other day. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4055.0s)]
*  Oh, that's so silly. They leading into it. Why would you gaze at them? [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4062.0s)]
*  The pride people are mad at him because they didn't support Dylan Mulvaney. So they kicked it out. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4067.0s)]
*  You don't win, you know, either way at the end of the day. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4073.0s)]
*  But, you know, I think about the companies that own these companies, the people that own these companies and why would they let a decision like that take the company down? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4077.0s)]
*  I don't think they thought it was going to. I think this is a legitimate public outrage one where they just pushed too far and people and fuck you. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4090.0s)]
*  And it wasn't even like a real look promotion. It was a thing. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4097.0s)]
*  They sent a can to this person is Dylan Mulvaney person. But I don't think it went anywhere else. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4100.0s)]
*  I think it was just like here. This is for you. And you put it on social media. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4106.0s)]
*  They made some sort of a partnering deal, you know, and that was it. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4110.0s)]
*  So why Target do the same thing? Well, I think that's an ESG thing. That's an ESG thing. Right. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4114.0s)]
*  And Target lost billions of dollars, too, because people people are sick of this shit. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4121.0s)]
*  They're sick of social things like that that are controversial getting stuffed into your face and where you have to accept it. Yeah. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4125.0s)]
*  And people are going to want to accept it. It's just like just come in here for fucking toilet paper. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4132.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think, you know, people got to keep it in perspective as well, too. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4136.0s)]
*  You know, I don't think people grab a beer to be so I mean, to, you know, to learn about the newest social event or the social situation going on. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4141.0s)]
*  Grab a beer because you want a beer. Hang with your buddies or hang, you know, people that enjoy beer and shoot the shit. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4153.0s)]
*  And politics really shouldn't be in somebody's beer mug. You know, they just don't get it. They think it has to be in everything. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4160.0s)]
*  And everybody because of social media, everybody feels like they're fighting some sort of social battle with everything they do. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4168.0s)]
*  And, you know, and this is one is another one. It's like it's like forced compliance. You have to you're forced to comply with this. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4174.0s)]
*  And, you know, it's fucking up women's sports in a huge way, in a huge way. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4182.0s)]
*  And, you know, some organization are pushing back against that. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4188.0s)]
*  And some people are pushing back against the organizations that are pushing back against it, which to me is insane. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4192.0s)]
*  Like if you care at all about biological women, you should be against that. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4197.0s)]
*  What I mean, what if like LeBron said he wanted to play in the NBA? [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4201.0s)]
*  I'm retiring from the NBA because I'm 49 and I'm going to play in the NBA. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4206.0s)]
*  Well, they wouldn't be able to stop it if he just decided to say publicly identify as a woman. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4211.0s)]
*  What are they going to do? They can't do anything. And then that would be the end. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4216.0s)]
*  Dave Chappelle has a bit about it. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4220.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4223.0s)]
*  LeBron scores 100 again tonight. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4226.0s)]
*  Well, there was some fucking knucklehead that was getting an interview. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4229.0s)]
*  They said if Mike Tyson identified as a woman, should he be able to fight women? [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4232.0s)]
*  And they were like, well, the short answer is yes. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4236.0s)]
*  Lord. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4240.0s)]
*  It's so crazy. Yeah, it's OK. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4243.0s)]
*  There's also different specifications. It's like what you have to do and how long you have to take hormones before you can identify as a woman and compete as a woman. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4245.0s)]
*  Just fucking stop. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4251.0s)]
*  Who's going to check all that? [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4253.0s)]
*  Yeah. There's a reason why there's women's sports. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4255.0s)]
*  There's a reason why there's men's sports. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4257.0s)]
*  You're not talking about who you are or what your truth is. Live your truth. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4259.0s)]
*  I mean, Title IX just got, you know, just turned what? 30 or something like that. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4263.0s)]
*  Protecting women's sports. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4271.0s)]
*  Yeah, which is which is great because it forces schools and, you know, they make a lot of money, you know, teaching whatever they teaching them schools. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4273.0s)]
*  And they should carve out some for women to be able to play for their school. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4285.0s)]
*  You know, that's great. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4290.0s)]
*  And so I don't understand. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4291.0s)]
*  You know, sometimes things don't make crazy man sense. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4296.0s)]
*  And when they when they don't make crazy man sense, I just back out. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4299.0s)]
*  Stop thinking about it. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4306.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's probably a good move because you're not going to solve it. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4308.0s)]
*  I mean, people are I think ultimately it gets solved where people just don't accept it anymore. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4311.0s)]
*  And then hopefully it'll go. I mean, maybe they could just develop a transgender league where trans people play against trans people. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4316.0s)]
*  That would be great. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4322.0s)]
*  But you can't pretend you're a biological female just because you wish you were like you can't pretend you're a woman. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4323.0s)]
*  It's like you can't pretend when it comes to women's sports, you can't pretend when it comes to women's rights issues. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4328.0s)]
*  It's like that's not this is this. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4333.0s)]
*  You don't want men dominating that because that's what it is. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4336.0s)]
*  It's men entering to women's spaces. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4339.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4342.0s)]
*  And whether they're ultimately they identify as a woman, that's great. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4343.0s)]
*  But you physically you're a biological male. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4346.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4349.0s)]
*  And you want to compete against them. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4350.0s)]
*  You want to play rugby against women. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4352.0s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4353.0s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4355.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4356.0s)]
*  They want to dominate. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4357.0s)]
*  They want to dominate. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4358.0s)]
*  There's a lot of that. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4359.0s)]
*  They want to dominate. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4360.0s)]
*  They want to be winners. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4361.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4362.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4363.0s)]
*  If all of a sudden you can be a woman and a winner and just fucking kick everybody's ass. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4364.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4367.0s)]
*  You know how you used to like play the kids in basketball like they ate and just shat out there. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4368.0s)]
*  You just shat. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4376.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4377.0s)]
*  It's like. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4378.0s)]
*  It's the ultimate sandbagging. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4379.0s)]
*  You know. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4381.0s)]
*  It's like you know you have a giant advantage. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4382.0s)]
*  Like the one that drove me the craziest was the MMA fighter. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4384.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4387.0s)]
*  Because that person became a woman for two years and then started competing as women and not telling them and saying it was a medical issue. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4388.0s)]
*  I don't have to disclose a medical condition like that. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4395.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4398.0s)]
*  That's not what that is. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4399.0s)]
*  If they if that person said that they were a woman and competed against women, that's deception. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4400.0s)]
*  That's a fucking lie. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4407.0s)]
*  But if you said you're biological male and the women still want to fight you. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4408.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4411.0s)]
*  All good. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4412.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4413.0s)]
*  You know it's tricky man. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4414.0s)]
*  It's like a slippery slope. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4417.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4419.0s)]
*  You know that really starts to get bizarre after a while. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4420.0s)]
*  You know because where does it where does it actually end at the end of the day. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4424.0s)]
*  You know. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4433.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4434.0s)]
*  What if somebody say I don't I don't identify as black. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4435.0s)]
*  I want to be another color. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4438.0s)]

*  Identify. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4473.0s)]
*  These people identify as younger people. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4474.0s)]
*  It's like the whole it is a slippery slope. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4476.0s)]

*  Because people can you know people always can be extreme with stuff like that. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4480.0s)]
*  They're extremely and they keep pushing boundaries and they're pushing boundaries on the age [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4486.0s)]
*  of consent now which is crazy. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4490.0s)]
*  You know there's there's people that are also pushing boundaries. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4492.0s)]
*  There's people that are also pushing back against calling people pedophiles and saying [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4496.0s)]
*  you should call them minor attracted persons. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4501.0s)]
*  Man come on. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4503.0s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4504.0s)]
*  I mean you're getting academics that are saying this. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4505.0s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4509.0s)]
*  Yeah it is. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4510.0s)]
*  It's you know it's borderline madness somewhere almost there. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4511.0s)]
*  Yeah well it's the end of an empire. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4517.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4519.0s)]
*  You know there's this guy Douglas Murray he's his English British intellectual and he said [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4520.0s)]
*  every time a civilization is close to collapsing they become obsessed with gender. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4524.0s)]
*  It happened with the ancient Greeks the Romans. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4530.0s)]
*  It's just like some weird thing that happens when everything is just going too good and [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4532.0s)]
*  life is too easy. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4536.0s)]
*  People get obsessed with the weirdest things and now we're obsessed with gender. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4537.0s)]
*  It's the beginning of the day too. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4545.0s)]
*  Yeah who knows. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4547.0s)]
*  I mean maybe we'll bounce back. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4548.0s)]
*  You know get a good president in there. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4550.0s)]
*  You know turn it around. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4553.0s)]
*  I don't put a lot on the president. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4555.0s)]
*  I don't put a lot on the president. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4560.0s)]
*  Well I wonder what would happen if Robert Kennedy Jr. got in there. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4562.0s)]
*  Very interested to see what happens with that guy. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4566.0s)]
*  Yeah you know he's a you know he seemed like a guy who at least is down to deep dive. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4569.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4580.0s)]
*  And talk real and you know really try to dissect what's really going on instead of just going [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4581.0s)]
*  with the herd which would be easy for him to do. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4594.0s)]
*  Like go with the herd. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4599.0s)]
*  You know he may be you know even ahead more or he may even be doing better you know when [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4601.0s)]
*  they poll thinking like 20 percent of people or something. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4609.0s)]
*  Yeah he'd probably be doing better. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4612.0s)]
*  He'd probably be doing better and you know instead of you know maybe he'd be one of [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4614.0s)]
*  their guys and so by him going this route it seems like he's on a more noble route and [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4620.0s)]
*  we just check him out and see how he navigates some of this stuff. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4630.0s)]
*  He's definitely on a more noble route and it's definitely not something he planned to do initially. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4635.0s)]
*  I mean he was an environmental attorney. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4640.0s)]
*  He was a guy that cleaned up the Hudson River. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4642.0s)]
*  They would go after these corporations that were dumping toxic waste and that was his thing. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4644.0s)]
*  It was like mercury in the water and you know trying to hold the corporations accountable [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4649.0s)]
*  and then these women started showing up every time he would give these speeches and they [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4654.0s)]
*  said we want you to look at the mercury in vaccines. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4659.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4661.0s)]
*  And so this is 18 years ago and so for 18 years this guy's been saying all this stuff about [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4662.0s)]
*  environmental concerns and that was what his whole thing was and it wasn't until COVID came along [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4669.0s)]
*  and then he wrote that book The Real Anthony Fauci detailing you know what it is that these [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4674.0s)]
*  people are actually doing and how they are engineering these viruses and they give grants [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4680.0s)]
*  and it's dangerous gain of function research and then they give you one medication that you have [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4685.0s)]
*  to take and everybody gets on board with it and they're making fucking billions of dollars. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4691.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4696.0s)]
*  And no one's talking about what he's saying and he's saying it in a well informed way and he's [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4697.0s)]
*  expressing it to people like this is the playbook they always use and they just used it on everybody. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4701.0s)]
*  Look he's dealing with the same people we probably all are dealing with and it's really time for us [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4707.0s)]
*  to really come up with a plan on how we're going to deal with this because it's just going to [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4715.0s)]
*  continue to happen. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4724.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4725.0s)]
*  It's just going to continue to happen you know I don't have all the answers but I think we need to [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4726.0s)]
*  collectively start to not just give a pass to people doing things like this and you know we've [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4732.0s)]
*  got major outlets that's not delivering the right message to the people. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4743.0s)]
*  Not delivering the right message. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4750.0s)]
*  Basically steering them the way that you know these super rich people want us to go and it's not cool. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4754.0s)]
*  No it's not and I'm hoping people wake up enough to at least slow it down. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4765.0s)]
*  Because these people are pushing in a very obvious and very specific direction. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4771.0s)]
*  They want digital currency centralized digital currency that they control and they want to get everybody on a [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4776.0s)]
*  social credit score system and they'll probably connect it to some sort of a vaccine app or if you want to [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4782.0s)]
*  travel around all they would need is another pandemic to try to push that shit through and they're [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4787.0s)]
*  already talking about that. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4791.0s)]
*  It's very spooky because when you look into the history of this lab and them funding it and this getting [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4792.0s)]
*  out and the way they responded to it the whole thing is so scary because it was effective. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4799.0s)]
*  It was effective and very very financially effective. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4805.0s)]
*  I mean they made a lot of fucking money. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4808.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4810.0s)]
*  And if they could do something similar again and then clamp down more on people that's what scares me. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4811.0s)]
*  This talk of centralized digital currency that's what they have in China. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4817.0s)]
*  If you fuck up in China and you get a bad social credit score because you tweeted something they didn't [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4820.0s)]
*  like what now you can't buy a plane ticket. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4826.0s)]
*  Now you can't buy a car. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4829.0s)]
*  Now you can't get a loan. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4831.0s)]
*  Now you can't do something. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4832.0s)]
*  You step the fucking line and people self censor. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4833.0s)]
*  They don't want to be a part of that. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4836.0s)]
*  Now they got you. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4838.0s)]
*  Yeah they got you. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4839.0s)]
*  Once you self censor. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4840.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4841.0s)]
*  That's where they want you. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4842.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4845.0s)]
*  We know that they were involved in Twitter. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4846.0s)]
*  We know that the government was involved in silencing different voices. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4847.0s)]
*  You know they stopped that Hunter Biden laptop story from getting out before the election. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4852.0s)]
*  It's just it's so obviously dirty shit. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4856.0s)]
*  I did a record called Everything's Corrupt and it is when you really look around. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4860.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4867.0s)]

*  It's up to him to say where that money goes. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4924.0s)]
*  It's up to him to say where that money goes. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4929.0s)]
*  And I'm like, well, how often do you talk to people at Congress? [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4934.0s)]
*  He said, never. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4938.0s)]
*  He said, they can't even get me on the phone. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4941.0s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4944.0s)]
*  He said, these people can't even get me on the phone, man. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4946.0s)]
*  I don't listen to them. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4950.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4952.0s)]
*  I just tell them where the money got to go. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4953.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4955.0s)]
*  So he gets to decide? [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4956.0s)]
*  He's part of the government that, when they allocate the money, it goes to these different agencies and departments. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4957.0s)]
*  And then they allocate where it goes. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4966.0s)]
*  They can't spend any of it. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4970.0s)]
*  So they can't take it, but they can spend it. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4972.0s)]
*  And then they can develop relationships with the people that give the money. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4976.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4979.0s)]
*  So the people in Congress are, to me, actually powerless. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4980.0s)]
*  They're just theater at the end of the day. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4989.0s)]
*  Well, they're theater who also gets the inside trade. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4993.0s)]
*  That's the beautiful thing. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4996.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4998.0s)]
*  I mean, they know where that money's going. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=4999.0s)]
*  They might not be able to touch it, but they can be on the other end to make sure their investments are going. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5001.0s)]
*  Their investments are carved out, and they make a pretty penny off of it. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5008.0s)]
*  Well, not only that, they do it openly in front of everybody. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5012.0s)]
*  It's not illegal. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5015.0s)]
*  And every time people call to ban it, like Nancy Pelosi's like, what? [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5016.0s)]
*  No, we're not going to do that. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5020.0s)]
*  Why would we do that? [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5023.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5025.0s)]
*  The ladies are at $200 million. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5026.0s)]
*  She makes 200 grand a year. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5027.0s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5028.0s)]
*  She's better at stock trading than Warren Buffett and George Soros. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5030.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5034.0s)]
*  Why wouldn't she be? [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5035.0s)]
*  She know where everything is going to hit. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5036.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5040.0s)]
*  You know what's going to hit, when it's going to hit, and how much it's going to hit for. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5041.0s)]
*  And unless that's illegal, fuck you. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5046.0s)]
*  Fuck your whole system. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5049.0s)]
*  Exactly, because it's easy to corrupt these people. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5051.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5060.0s)]
*  It's all money. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5062.0s)]
*  Did you ever think you would have to think about it so much, though? [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5063.0s)]
*  I didn't think about this so much like 10, 15 years ago. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5066.0s)]
*  Well, I always had my kind of, you know, every since people like Tipper Gore come after you, [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5070.0s)]
*  you pay attention to where the shots are being fired. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5077.0s)]
*  So before then, just a little, I was sitting, my pops would look at the news and yell at the screen. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5081.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5089.0s)]
*  That's how I know what was bullshit and what was real. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5090.0s)]
*  And then I started doing my thing and then the law, the FBI, all these agencies started to come down on us. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5094.0s)]
*  Really scared the shit out of the record company because we couldn't care less. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5108.0s)]
*  We was like, the day we got the FBI letter. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5114.0s)]
*  What was the FBI letter? [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5118.0s)]
*  We got an FBI letter. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5120.0s)]
*  They sent the letter to Priority Records saying, one guy was like, I'm part of this department of the FBI [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5121.0s)]
*  and we're very concerned with this record called Straight Outta Compton. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5132.0s)]
*  You guys got a song on there called Fuck the Police. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5136.0s)]
*  We think this song could encourage people to go against law enforcement and blah, blah, blah, and blah, blah, that. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5139.0s)]
*  Basically, we'd like it if you guys took it off the shelf, you know what I'm saying? [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5149.0s)]
*  To that tip. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5156.0s)]
*  So they call us up there, they panicking. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5157.0s)]
*  We don't know why they want us to come. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5162.0s)]
*  They're just like, man, you got to come over here. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5165.0s)]
*  We got to talk to you. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5166.0s)]
*  We get up there and pull out this letter, FBI. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5167.0s)]
*  We're like, it's like, man, do you know what this is? [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5172.0s)]
*  This fucking agent, he sent me this letter and they was all nervous and shit. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5176.0s)]
*  We're looking like, a letter? [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5183.0s)]
*  That's all you get? [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5185.0s)]
*  They not going to come in here and try to fuck with us? [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5186.0s)]
*  They not going to arrest us, cuff us, rough us up, none of that? [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5188.0s)]
*  And we're like, y'all scared over a fucking letter? [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5194.0s)]
*  Come back to South Central with us. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5198.0s)]
*  Deal with the sheriffs down there. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5201.0s)]
*  They do way more than give you a letter. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5203.0s)]
*  So we felt that it was like, Eazy was like, we're going to be big as fuck after this. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5206.0s)]
*  But the guys at the record company, this was the first time they ever dealt with pushback. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5216.0s)]
*  First time the government probably even knew they existed. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5223.0s)]
*  So they were freaked out. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5226.0s)]
*  And we were like, okay, we was looking for them to raid our houses and shit. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5228.0s)]
*  Like, damn, because we've seen the battle ram. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5235.0s)]
*  We've seen them run up in people's houses on dope charges or whatever, especially in the late 80s, early 90s. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5238.0s)]
*  That's like, they got a kick out of just running up in people's houses and shit. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5245.0s)]
*  So we were looking for that to come in the next few weeks. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5250.0s)]
*  We was looking like, oh, they about to hit us. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5256.0s)]
*  And it never happened. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5259.0s)]
*  So we was like, what's the issue? What's the problem? [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5261.0s)]
*  So it was just that letter and that was it? [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5264.0s)]
*  It was just that letter. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5266.0s)]
*  And then we made the letter public and they kind of just backed off and shit. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5268.0s)]
*  And then it became this big story of the FBI hates this group. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5273.0s)]
*  I think we was on the cover of one of those New York magazines and it was like, the FBI hates this group. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5278.0s)]
*  Yeah, look at this. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5288.0s)]
*  Yeah, the FBI hates this man. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5289.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5292.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5293.0s)]
*  Eazy was right. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5295.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was. That's the letter. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5296.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5298.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5300.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5301.0s)]
*  Reached an unprecedented high in 1988. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5331.0s)]
*  Seventy eight law enforcement officers were feloniously slain in the feloniously slain the line of duty during 1988. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5334.0s)]
*  Four more in 1987. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5344.0s)]
*  Law enforcement officers dedicate their lives to protection of our citizens and recordings such as the one from NWA are both discouraging and degrading to these brave, dedicated officers. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5346.0s)]
*  Music plays a significant role in society. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5360.0s)]
*  And I'd want you to be aware of the FBI's position relative to this song and its message. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5363.0s)]
*  I believe my reviews reflect the opinion of the entire law enforcement community. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5367.0s)]
*  Huh? Yeah. Never met this dude. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5372.0s)]
*  No, no, never. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5374.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5376.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5377.0s)]
*  1988 was a different world. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5378.0s)]
*  And that was the first. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5380.0s)]
*  That was like the first moment of that where we had heard that the government and politicians were concerned about rap music. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5381.0s)]
*  Without a doubt. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5389.0s)]
*  And then it just, you know, they didn't come after me, but all these other different agencies were starting to hit us up. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5391.0s)]
*  And, you know, they were going, they started going after Ice T, you know, a little bit because he, Body Count did a song called Cop Killer. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5398.0s)]
*  And yeah, you know, it was a time when we grew up real fast. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5408.0s)]
*  We had to understand that, you know, this is bigger than hip hop and we got to stand up for what we know is true and right. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5415.0s)]
*  It's like we're not making shit up, you know, go down, you know. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5425.0s)]
*  I've seen guys tell cops, you know what I mean? [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5431.0s)]
*  Take off that gun, take off that badge and we can knuckle it up in the streets and do it like men. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5436.0s)]
*  And so, you know, we knew that sentiment was out there where people was really like, yo, if you're not going to, if you're going to act like a thug, you know what I'm saying? [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5442.0s)]
*  Let's thug it out. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5454.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5455.0s)]
*  You're going to act like an officer, then we'll, you know, we'll respect your authority. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5456.0s)]
*  You see what I mean? [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5466.0s)]
*  So it was a lot of cops that we respected that came through and they would treat us like, you know, real humans, you know, not like, you know, suspects. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5467.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5479.0s)]
*  You don't want anybody to come through just treating you like a suspect. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5480.0s)]
*  You ain't out here doing nothing. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5482.0s)]
*  These dudes, so we knew some dudes that would come through and talk to us, tell us, you know, y'all need to watch out, be careful, you know what I'm saying? [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5484.0s)]
*  And, you know, do anybody know something that happened around the corner and all this little stuff? [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5491.0s)]

[[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5704.0s)]

*  Did they have to go back? [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5807.0s)]
*  They had to go back to court. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5808.0s)]
*  Yeah, they had to go back to court and fight it. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5810.0s)]
*  What happened? [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5812.0s)]
*  I don't remember because I ended up leaving the group. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5813.0s)]
*  And they're leaving the group. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5817.0s)]
*  So I don't really know what happened kind of after 89 with everybody. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5818.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5822.0s)]
*  What a wild time. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5823.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5825.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5826.0s)]
*  But fun. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5827.0s)]
*  Like we were living the time of our lives because we never knew we was going to be this popular throughout the country. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5828.0s)]
*  We thought the records that we did were just local. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5836.0s)]
*  You know, we was going to be, you know, hood stars. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5841.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5844.0s)]
*  Right there in our neighborhood, people was going to love us. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5845.0s)]
*  But outside of Compton, South Central, Long Beach, Watts, we were like, you know, people, they not even going to know what we talking about. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5847.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5857.0s)]
*  Little did we know that everybody was kind of going through the same things that we were going through. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5858.0s)]
*  That's so wild. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5864.0s)]
*  So what like, what was it like when it blew up? [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5867.0s)]
*  I mean, that had to be for you to be a young guy in this, you know, hip hop just in general was relatively new. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5871.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5879.0s)]
*  And for it to blow up that big, that had to be a wild change of your life. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5880.0s)]
*  It was, you know, because you think you think you're only going to be an underground artist. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5885.0s)]
*  Like before we sold our records, records like ours would be in the section with like the the Red Fox records and Richard Pryor, the Eddie Murphy, the dirty, you know, you know, comedy, dirty comedy records. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5890.0s)]
*  That's where you would find these dirty hip hop records. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5907.0s)]
*  And there was a few, you know, there's a dude named Blowfly. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5911.0s)]
*  Blowfly would have songs called, he had a song, he got one a song called Rap Dirty. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5918.0s)]
*  And like those kind of songs would be in this section and nobody went to unless you just wanted to laugh or something. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5923.0s)]
*  So we thought our records would end up there and that being and it just it just blew up. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5930.0s)]
*  MTV banned our straight out of Compton video. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5938.0s)]
*  And that blew the group up because people wanted to know why did they do something that even MTV was scared to show. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5943.0s)]
*  And so we went from thinking we were going to be in that little bin to they put us in the front of the record store and promoting that. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5953.0s)]
*  You can get straight out of Compton here. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5963.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5966.0s)]
*  So it just took us from, you know, that back of the store stuff to prime real estate. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5967.0s)]
*  How many records straight out of Compton? [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5975.0s)]
*  So I don't know the exact in figure, but even that while I was still in the group, it was like two million records and then it was just growing. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5977.0s)]
*  So by now, it's got to be up to at least four. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5988.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5993.0s)]
*  That had to be a fucking crazy experience to not think that that was ever going to happen. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=5995.0s)]
*  And then boom, it was controversial ban in America. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6000.0s)]
*  We went from being straight locals to like being everywhere. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6005.0s)]
*  Matter of fact, I went to school after I was in the group. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6010.0s)]
*  Like I was like, you know, I can't I can't hang my hat on this. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6015.0s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to live, you know, on dirty rap records. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6020.0s)]
*  You know, I'm saying can't play them on the radio. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6024.0s)]
*  You know, only underground people are going to hear it. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6027.0s)]
*  So I went off to a trade school, Phoenix, Arizona, called Phoenix Institute of Technology. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6032.0s)]
*  What did you go to learn? [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6039.0s)]

*  Wow. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6044.0s)]
*  Yeah, I took drafting in school and I dug it and sent some pamphlet in the mail. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6045.0s)]

*  I filled it out. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6057.0s)]
*  Fuck, it showed up to my house and it was in there talking to my mother and father. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6059.0s)]

*  Damn. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6073.0s)]
*  How long was that for? [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6074.0s)]
*  A year. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6075.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6076.0s)]
*  Yep. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6077.0s)]
*  Fall of 87 to the fall of 88. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6078.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6084.0s)]
*  So you got out of trade school and then the album blows up. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6085.0s)]
*  I mean, we got out of trade school and then we was working on Eazy's solo album. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6088.0s)]
*  Eazy does it. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6093.0s)]
*  His solo album came out right before NWA. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6094.0s)]
*  And that blew him up and we were along for the ride. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6097.0s)]
*  So when the NWA record came and he was part of the NWA group, it just put a spotlight on the group. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6103.0s)]
*  And then the record was crazy. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6112.0s)]
*  So just took it to the next level. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6114.0s)]
*  What was your earliest influences in hip hop? [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6117.0s)]
*  Curtis Blow, Run DMC, Sugarhill Gang, Rock King. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6120.0s)]
*  Big Daddy Kane, Bismarck Key, Salt and Pepper. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6132.0s)]
*  You know, like the greats. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6137.0s)]
*  All the greats. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6141.0s)]
*  Beastie Boys, LL Cool J for sure. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6142.0s)]
*  You know, we loved LL. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6146.0s)]
*  LL was the man always. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6148.0s)]
*  And so when was the first time you actually performed? [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6151.0s)]
*  How old were you? [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6155.0s)]
*  I was probably 15. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6157.0s)]
*  Is that a local thing? [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6162.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, we would do rap battles. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6164.0s)]
*  So we would go up to people's school and find out. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6167.0s)]
*  You know, everybody didn't rap like now everybody raps. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6170.0s)]
*  But back then it was like a niche group. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6174.0s)]
*  So we was we had honed our skills. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6177.0s)]
*  So we would go up to different high schools and hop the fence and nutrition and shit and like find a spot and battle. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6182.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6191.0s)]
*  So it was it was fun. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6192.0s)]
*  I was like it was like a karate master looking for us. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6194.0s)]
*  Or you know, we walking around like who go to that school? [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6198.0s)]
*  Who rap over there? [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6202.0s)]
*  Who over here? [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6203.0s)]
*  It's like some dudes in my school, man, they can bust me. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6204.0s)]
*  I should come up here. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6207.0s)]
*  You know, I was trying to set it up for Friday. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6208.0s)]
*  Y'all come up here Friday, hit the fence, you know, bust. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6210.0s)]
*  And then y'all got to get out before, you know, I mean, the counselors come. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6213.0s)]
*  Well, I'm saying so we'd find ourselves going from different high schools. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6217.0s)]
*  We would ditch our own school to go up to different schools and and rap against people. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6221.0s)]
*  But first time I really hit the stage, we we did this contest called the Best Rappers of the West Contest. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6227.0s)]
*  And we entered our song and man, we we made it all the way to the finals. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6236.0s)]
*  They did the finals at the Olympic Auditorium in L.A. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6244.0s)]
*  That's what they used to do all the old wrestling matches and fights. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6248.0s)]
*  So they used to roll a derby here to Thunderbirds. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6252.0s)]
*  And so we there we performed Drake came, you know, Dre was in the world class record crew, DJ crew, you know. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6258.0s)]
*  So everybody, our family, friends, and they messed up our tape like, you know, our music was instrumental, but it was cassette. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6265.0s)]
*  And when they hit it, it was in the wrong spot. They didn't rewind it. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6275.0s)]
*  So we got it was off cue and then they had to rewind it and then start over. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6279.0s)]
*  The thrill was gone. We lost. We lost. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6284.0s)]
*  We came in second place. And so that was my first taste of, you know, hitting the stage. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6287.0s)]
*  Did you knew that's what you wanted to do? [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6294.0s)]
*  I loved it. You know, I had a great time. Yeah, I did. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6296.0s)]
*  And hanging with Dre more and more, you know, he saw us that night. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6299.0s)]
*  He knew we had got kind of robbed a little bit. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6303.0s)]
*  And he was like, we'll let you we'll let you all perform at Dudo's, which is the club he DJ'd in Compton. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6307.0s)]
*  It's right down Central Avenue. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6314.0s)]
*  And we went down there, you know, it's a party, I mean, full of bloods. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6318.0s)]
*  It's like full of Compton bloods, pyroos all through this place. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6325.0s)]
*  This is right in their neighborhood. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6330.0s)]
*  Dre is like, y'all better be good. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6333.0s)]
*  Better be good, man. He's doing I don't know what they're going to do. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6338.0s)]
*  They might throw shit at you, you know, I want to fuck you up. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6341.0s)]
*  Y'all better be good. That's all he kept saying. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6345.0s)]
*  So we were like, damn, we got to think of something clever. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6347.0s)]
*  We got to be good. We got to be good. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6350.0s)]
*  So we started doing parody raps. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6353.0s)]
*  We take the hit song and do a dirty version of it. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6355.0s)]
*  Roxanne, Roxanne was the hit song that was out. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6359.0s)]
*  UTFO. And we we made a song called Diane, Diane. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6362.0s)]
*  And it was a dirty version of it. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6366.0s)]
*  It went crazy. It went crazy. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6368.0s)]
*  So we knew like, oh, damn, this this is a style like we can we can do our own raps. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6371.0s)]
*  Hardcore like this. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6378.0s)]
*  We don't have to try to be, you know, fat boys. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6380.0s)]
*  We don't have to try to be mainstream. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6388.0s)]
*  Yeah, we can just give it to them raw how they want it. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6391.0s)]
*  Talk about the neighborhood, you know. Yeah. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6394.0s)]
*  That's what we started doing. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6397.0s)]
*  So that's interesting. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6398.0s)]
*  Like that. So that sort of led to the way the band became doing that show. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6400.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And during that show, we see I wasn't in NWI. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6406.0s)]
*  I had my own group. So we start working with EZ. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6412.0s)]
*  And NWA is actually an all star group. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6418.0s)]
*  It's it's easy kind of plucking different people from different groups, [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6422.0s)]
*  putting them together and saying we're going to make we're going to huddle up and make these dirty records. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6428.0s)]
*  And then after we finish, I can go back and make clean little records. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6435.0s)]
*  That's kind of how NWA was formed. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6439.0s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. So they grabbed Dre and Yella from Wrecking Crew. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6442.0s)]
*  They grabbed me. I was in a group called Stereo Crew. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6446.0s)]
*  We changed our name to CIA. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6449.0s)]
*  Criminals in action. But Lazo made us call ourselves crew in action because he was like, [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6451.0s)]
*  nobody going to buy a record that say criminals. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6456.0s)]
*  So so and then you had EZ. You know what I mean? [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6460.0s)]
*  So we formed NWA. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6463.0s)]
*  Ren came later when I went to school. That's when Ren came. MC Ren. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6466.0s)]
*  So yeah. And then what happened is we do the record. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6471.0s)]
*  We go up and everybody say to the groups, hey, man, this shit is popping in no way in the world. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6475.0s)]
*  We are going back to being nobody in our groups. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6484.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? We got to run with this. And it just I'm still running with it. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6490.0s)]
*  You were always known for your lyrics. You're a great writer. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6494.0s)]
*  Like if you did you always have that ability? Did you write before you wrote lyrics? [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6498.0s)]
*  Yeah. But you know, what I what I did when I was young, you know, the teachers would always ask like, well, OK, what you do over summer vacation? [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6505.0s)]
*  What you do? Right. Right down. What you guys do? [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6516.0s)]
*  So mine would be thorough. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6520.0s)]
*  You know, I would be able to really explain everything that I did. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6523.0s)]
*  And they were really impressed. My teachers were impressed that I could remember all that and put it in a comprehensive form where they can read, you know, my whole summer, really. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6528.0s)]
*  And so by getting those kind of, you know, extra credit for being good or, you know, teaching, hang your stuff up there, you know, you're like, OK, I can do this. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6541.0s)]
*  I could do this. Same with art, you know, and I actually they had me do a speech during my sixth grade graduation. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6556.0s)]
*  Like they asked me, would you go up there and address the graduation class? [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6566.0s)]
*  So, you know, the writing that speech, these things I knew, OK, I could I could put words together and I can speak them in front of a crowd. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6571.0s)]
*  And it wasn't a nightmare. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6583.0s)]
*  So when it was time to rap and time to rhyme, which was a couple of years later when I turned 14, then I was able to put it together and feel like, OK, I know how to write and I know how to rap. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6586.0s)]
*  So jump in front of the crowd. Get busy. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6601.0s)]
*  That's amazing. That's that's that's so interesting that that's the genesis of your writing, because it makes sense. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6604.0s)]
*  Because like your writing was always so thorough and well thought out, you know, and when you went solo, that was like very evident. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6611.0s)]
*  It was very evident, like this is great fucking writing like the lyrics back then. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6618.0s)]
*  Like, that's my favorite era. Yeah. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6623.0s)]
*  Hip hop is like early 90s, late 80s, early 90s, like in the East Coast, like Kumo D. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6625.0s)]
*  Yeah. Prolific. Yeah. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6634.0s)]
*  Set the bar. You know, those guys started to set the bar higher and higher. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6637.0s)]
*  And, you know, you had to keep up to even get attention. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6643.0s)]
*  So, yeah, you know, those early pioneers of hip hop, even LL was, you know, amazing lyricists. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6647.0s)]
*  Word Smith, you know, the original rock the bells. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6658.0s)]
*  He's another guy's done everything. Yeah. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6662.0s)]
*  He's movies. I call him, you know, the hip hop LeBron. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6665.0s)]
*  You know, he he's been doing this since he was 15 at the highest level and never came down. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6669.0s)]
*  You know, so it still looks great. Yeah. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6674.0s)]
*  Still, you know, looks like superstar. Yeah. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6677.0s)]
*  So it's cool, you know, to, you know, to be friends with these guys that that I looked up to so much as a youngster. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6681.0s)]
*  That was there was a weird time, though, the East Coast versus West Coast shit. Yeah. Very weird. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6691.0s)]
*  Yeah. It was, you know, people equated to Tupac and I mean, and bad boy and death row. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6696.0s)]
*  But it was actually bubbling before that. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6706.0s)]
*  It was to me an industry thing in a way like New York had the throne for so long. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6709.0s)]
*  And here go, well, at least a decade or more. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6717.0s)]
*  And here comes these West Coast rappers, you know, kind of taking attention away. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6721.0s)]
*  And so the the the industry people is started to bubble up with them that, you know, we're doing real hip hop. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6729.0s)]
*  They're just doing gangster records, you know. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6741.0s)]
*  And so that started to to kind of get into the artists. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6744.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, that that sentiment started to poison the artists and artists named Tim Dogg did a song called Fuck Compton. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6749.0s)]
*  Like out of nowhere, we was like, damn, we we like New York. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6758.0s)]
*  Why, you know, why why he take a shot and nobody really rebutted him. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6764.0s)]
*  Like, you know, they kind of let it slide. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6771.0s)]
*  And then more and more artists start taking shots here and there. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6774.0s)]
*  And and then the thing with Bad Boy and Death Row, it kind of just took it over the top. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6780.0s)]
*  It just made it because they were the hottest labels. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6790.0s)]
*  You had the hottest label on the East Coast battling with the hottest label on the West Coast. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6794.0s)]
*  So that made that undercurrent of animosity that was growing blow all the way up and look like it was a feud. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6799.0s)]
*  How did that ever get resolved? [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6809.0s)]
*  I think when when a two pot got killed and then Biggie was murdered shortly after. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6812.0s)]
*  People realized this is a dead end road like. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6822.0s)]
*  People stopped listening really to East Coast and West Coast at that time, and that's how the immersion of the South came. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6827.0s)]
*  You know, the South was there bubbling. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6836.0s)]
*  They was doing their thing. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6838.0s)]
*  They had groups that were that was making a dent. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6840.0s)]
*  But at one point, all the hip hop fans were so fed up with the East Coast, West Coast beef that they said, you know, [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6844.0s)]
*  we're just going to pay attention to what the South is doing. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6853.0s)]
*  You guys got to heal your wounds and come back. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6856.0s)]
*  And so that's the emergence of the South and, you know, all the groups that came out back then. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6860.0s)]
*  Were you were you touring on the East Coast? [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6866.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6869.0s)]
*  So what was it like when you were touring on the East Coast in the middle of all that shit? [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6870.0s)]
*  I mean, it was always love. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6874.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, some fans took sides, but most most of it was, you know, industry stuff. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6877.0s)]
*  And they were kind of caught in the middle. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6883.0s)]
*  So I did a record called, you know, Bowdown with the West Side Connection, [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6885.0s)]
*  which we addressed a lot of the beef because we felt like most of the industry was in New York at the time. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6891.0s)]
*  So we felt like we didn't stand up for ourselves in some way, shape or form. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6900.0s)]
*  What we accomplished the last decade would be erased and eroded and dismissed, discredited. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6906.0s)]
*  And we wouldn't we would be played out. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6913.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, we wouldn't have longevity. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6917.0s)]
*  So, you know, there was, you know, back and forth. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6920.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, you know, Tupac being killed, Biggie being killed was just a wake up call for the whole industry. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6925.0s)]
*  That's sad that that's how the wake up call had to go. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6936.0s)]
*  It's crazy. Crazy. Yeah. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6941.0s)]
*  I mean, I remember I was on news radio on the set of news radio when someone told me Tupac got killed. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6943.0s)]
*  And I was thinking, how is that possible? [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6951.0s)]
*  How is that real? Yeah. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6954.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just you know, it was a new day. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6959.0s)]
*  Like, it's like, oh, we we're in a new era where celebrity means nothing. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6962.0s)]
*  You know, celebrity means nothing. Anybody can get it. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6971.0s)]
*  Yeah. So it's damn near like we back where we started from back in the hood, you know, trying not to get it. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6974.0s)]
*  And here you're a celebrity and you can still get it. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6981.0s)]
*  How dangerous did that feel to you back then? [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6985.0s)]
*  You know, no more dangerous than it feels when any of people, you know, any person I know get shot, you know, feels like, you know, damn, you know, this never ends. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=6989.0s)]
*  I don't remember taking any more precaution than I usually would. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7008.0s)]
*  But I knew people, you know, some dudes getting bulletproof trucks and shit and bulletproof vans and all this stuff. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7015.0s)]
*  I was like, no, I ain't going to that extent. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7025.0s)]
*  It's just a crazy time in music history, too, because, you know, there'd never been like rock bands that were feuding with each other to the point where you were worried about people getting murdered. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7029.0s)]
*  No, not that I know of. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7039.0s)]
*  You know, rock bands do feud. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7043.0s)]
*  They usually don't do diss records either. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7045.0s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7048.0s)]
*  You know, they just feud or they have subliminal, subliminal disses. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7049.0s)]
*  It's never like. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7054.0s)]
*  The diss record thing was wild. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7055.0s)]
*  That was really the first time artists ever went after each other like that. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7056.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's, but, you know, it's, it's like, it's like sparring. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7059.0s)]
*  It's like battling. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7065.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, it's part of the game. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7066.0s)]
*  So it's welcomed in a way. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7069.0s)]
*  You know, you, you spar, you practice, you know how to fight. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7073.0s)]
*  And then somebody get in your face and challenge you like, OK, this is what we do. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7078.0s)]
*  It's rumble. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7084.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7085.0s)]
*  So it's like you grow up battling. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7086.0s)]
*  You know, you got your raps, you say your cocky shit. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7088.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7091.0s)]
*  And somebody want to, you know, put it on wax and battle like we can battle on wax any day. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7093.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7102.0s)]
*  So let's go for it. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7103.0s)]
*  When did it feel like for you all that shit sort of like went away? [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7105.0s)]
*  Like the feud stuff, the when did it seem like it was just back to just making music? [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7110.0s)]
*  For some reason, I think. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7119.0s)]
*  Like 9-11, like that tragedy of 9-11. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7124.0s)]
*  For some reason, like it seemed like from then the feud stopped. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7129.0s)]
*  And people kind of reassessed and reorganized their thought process when it comes to that. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7133.0s)]
*  Like they it was like that's when it seemed like a ceasefire just was the best thing to do. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7141.0s)]
*  Because, you know, like the country went through a crazy shakeup. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7152.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7159.0s)]
*  And it's a trip. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7160.0s)]
*  You know, you had groups like Rockin' the Red, White and Blue. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7163.0s)]
*  And it was like into, you know, patriotism and really into, you know, uh-oh, you know, [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7168.0s)]
*  we got other forces out there that's trying to take down New York City. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7179.0s)]
*  I mean, we can't be hating on New York after that. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7186.0s)]
*  Like we all got to band together. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7191.0s)]
*  That was the sentiment. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7194.0s)]
*  It's crazy that sometimes it takes something like that, like a national tragedy to wake people up to what's really important. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7195.0s)]
*  Yeah, major shakeup. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7201.0s)]
*  So how the fuck did you go from NWA, your solo career, and then movies, and then family movies? [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7204.0s)]
*  Like was there like a resistance for that? [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7216.0s)]
*  People like, did you listen to his old shit? [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7219.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, because people were taking their kids to see those movies and then those kids became Ice Cube fans. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7224.0s)]
*  And then they go into your old shit and like, wow. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7229.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a great, it's kind of like, you know, they're caught in the Ice Cube vortex in a way. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7232.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7241.0s)]
*  Because here's how it happened. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7242.0s)]
*  Like I'm in NWA, I go solo, I'm just trying to be the best rapper in the world. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7246.0s)]
*  That's all I'm concerned about. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7254.0s)]
*  And I meet this kid, John Singleton, who's an intern. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7256.0s)]
*  I meet him at the Arsenio Hall Show. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7261.0s)]
*  He's an intern there. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7263.0s)]
*  I'm there to talk to Arsenio to say, dude, you had two live crew on. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7265.0s)]
*  Why don't you have NWA on? [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7270.0s)]
*  So never had that conversation with Arsenio because John Singleton is talking my ear off. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7273.0s)]
*  And he's like, I'm a junior at USC. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7280.0s)]
*  I'm put you in a movie. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7283.0s)]
*  I'm like, dude, what? [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7285.0s)]
*  I'm not an actor. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7289.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7291.0s)]
*  I thought you had to go to Juilliard for 18 years to be an actor. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7292.0s)]
*  So I'm like, what? [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7295.0s)]
*  What you talking about, man? [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7296.0s)]
*  No. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7297.0s)]
*  And then he pursued me two years, dude, two years. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7298.0s)]
*  He and then he finally said, yo, I got the movie. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7303.0s)]
*  You know, we're going to do it. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7308.0s)]
*  And so that was Boys in the Hood. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7309.0s)]
*  So he discovered me. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7312.0s)]
*  That's how I got into movies. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7315.0s)]
*  And when we're doing that movie, he said, when you going to write a movie? [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7317.0s)]
*  Like, what? [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7324.0s)]
*  Dude, what are you talking about? [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7325.0s)]
*  Why you keep hitting me with this stuff that I don't do? [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7327.0s)]
*  He said, man, you can write a song like that. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7331.0s)]
*  You can write a movie like that. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7333.0s)]
*  I'm like, OK. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7336.0s)]
*  I go by a computer that same day and final draft, which is a script writing. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7337.0s)]
*  And I start writing a script like don't know one thing about writing a script. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7343.0s)]
*  Just start writing one. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7349.0s)]
*  It was terrible. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7351.0s)]
*  But he helped me. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7352.0s)]
*  He just kept telling me, keep writing, keep more pages, just keep going till you finish it. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7354.0s)]
*  And long story short, I end up a few years later writing Friday. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7360.0s)]
*  OK, Friday, 1995 comes out. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7367.0s)]
*  Big cult classic. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7371.0s)]
*  So as the years go on, got these little kids coming to me doing all these cuss lines from Friday. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7374.0s)]
*  What's your little ass doing watching Friday? [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7386.0s)]
*  So I did another movie called Barbershop. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7391.0s)]
*  Now, that's an R-rated comedy Friday. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7393.0s)]
*  So I do Barbershop. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7396.0s)]
*  It's good reaction. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7397.0s)]
*  People love it. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7400.0s)]
*  It's PG-13. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7401.0s)]
*  So the movie is bigger because it appeals to a bigger audience. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7403.0s)]
*  So I'm like, damn, we was able to work it at Rated R. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7411.0s)]
*  We were able to work it at PG-13. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7415.0s)]
*  What if I did a PG movie? [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7419.0s)]
*  Because I still got little kids coming to me talking about, you got knocked the fuck out in name seven. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7422.0s)]
*  I need to do something for your little seven-year-old ass so you don't have to go watch Friday. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7428.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7435.0s)]
*  You should be watching Friday when you get about 11, 12, not seven. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7436.0s)]
*  So I was with Joe Rolfe over at Revolution. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7441.0s)]
*  And he was like, yo, we got this movie that Adam Sandler was going to do, but he can't do it. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7448.0s)]
*  Will you take a look at it? [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7454.0s)]
*  I said, yeah, I'll take a look at it. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7456.0s)]
*  And it was, are we there yet? [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7458.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, this is a kids movie. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7461.0s)]
*  He's like, yeah, that's okay. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7463.0s)]
*  I think I can tailor-make it where it fits me. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7465.0s)]
*  But yeah, let's give it a try. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7469.0s)]
*  And we do it. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7471.0s)]
*  And of course, everybody go ape shit. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7473.0s)]
*  Like, Cube, you gangster. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7475.0s)]
*  What you doing these kids movies for? [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7477.0s)]
*  What's wrong with you? [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7479.0s)]
*  What the hell's going on, man? [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7480.0s)]
*  You don't got to suck. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7481.0s)]
*  All this stuff they was talking, right? [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7482.0s)]
*  So movie comes out and kids lose their mind. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7484.0s)]
*  They love the movie. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7490.0s)]
*  So now this is the vortex, right? [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7492.0s)]
*  They come in, they love, are we there yet? [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7496.0s)]
*  Five, six, seven, eight. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7500.0s)]
*  By the time they get 10 or 11, somebody show them Barbershop or maybe Friday. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7502.0s)]
*  So they love me from are we there yet? [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7510.0s)]
*  Now they love me from Friday. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7514.0s)]
*  And then somebody says, listen to this. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7516.0s)]
*  And hands them my music. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7519.0s)]
*  And they get about 15, 14. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7521.0s)]
*  And they say, I love this guy. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7524.0s)]
*  And I got fans all ages who love Ice Cube because they've been like walked up from [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7528.0s)]
*  are we there yet? [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7539.0s)]
*  To Barbershop, to Friday, to my music, which is a whole different animal. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7541.0s)]
*  I don't think there's anybody else like that that has that varied of a career. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7547.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7554.0s)]
*  I haven't thought about it. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7555.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7556.0s)]
*  But it's pretty cool and dynamic. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7557.0s)]
*  I know I met your daughter. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7559.0s)]
*  She's 27. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7561.0s)]
*  And first thing she was exposed to was are we there yet? [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7563.0s)]
*  She's a fan. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7567.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7568.0s)]
*  So that movie was a way to stay connected to the younger generation always without the [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7569.0s)]
*  parents saying, do you know who this is? [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7576.0s)]
*  This is Ice Cube. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7579.0s)]
*  He used to be blah, blah, blah, and blah, blah, blah. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7580.0s)]
*  Now the kids know who I am before the parents even have to point it out. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7583.0s)]
*  So it's been a great thing for my career as far as longevity and gaining new fans, [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7589.0s)]
*  without necessarily having to have a new hit record. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7596.0s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7600.0s)]
*  You have a giant library of content. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7601.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7605.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7606.0s)]
*  And it's cool because there's always going to be kids, always going to be new kids. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7607.0s)]
*  There's always going to be something for parents to try to shove in front of them to watch, [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7615.0s)]
*  to take their time. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7620.0s)]
*  And are we there yet is a cool option. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7621.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7623.0s)]
*  And then we did Are We Done Yet? [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7624.0s)]
*  And people are asking me, when are you going to do the next one? [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7626.0s)]
*  I'm like, I want a third one. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7630.0s)]
*  Okay, let's think about it. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7632.0s)]
*  Are you going to do a third one? [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7634.0s)]
*  We'll see. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7635.0s)]
*  We got to talk to Joe and Revolution and get it right. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7636.0s)]
*  When I found out that you wrote Friday, I was like, that's insane. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7640.0s)]
*  That's incredible. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7644.0s)]
*  Yeah, me and DJ Poo. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7645.0s)]
*  That's a funny fucking movie. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7647.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7649.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7650.0s)]
*  I mean, DJ Poo, he's like one of those undercover geniuses that been involved in a lot of hip [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7651.0s)]
*  hop. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7661.0s)]
*  I mean, he helped LL do Going Back to Cali. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7662.0s)]
*  He's been around forever. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7665.0s)]
*  And we're all fans of Poo. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7669.0s)]
*  And Poo is funny. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7673.0s)]
*  He's technical. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7677.0s)]
*  He's the one who got Rockstar to do the Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, that whole, you know, [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7678.0s)]
*  like take it from Miami and put it in LA. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7689.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7692.0s)]
*  Take it from the Miami dope culture to the LA gang culture. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7693.0s)]
*  So he's the one who's behind the scenes with stuff like that. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7697.0s)]
*  And he helped me write Friday. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7702.0s)]
*  He produced It Was a Good Day, the song. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7704.0s)]
*  So whenever we together, it's just magic. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7708.0s)]
*  And we wrote Friday because we were watching In Living Color and we loved Hollywood Shuffle [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7712.0s)]
*  by Robert Townsend. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7722.0s)]
*  And we was like, let's write a movie about the neighborhood. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7724.0s)]
*  Because everything that was coming out was depressing. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7729.0s)]

*  And it's an all-time classic. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7766.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a movie that I get commented on more than any other. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7768.0s)]
*  Like people quote it, love it. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7774.0s)]

*  It's just like everybody yells. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7816.0s)]
*  When someone goes down, it's automatic. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7818.0s)]
*  It's automatic. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7820.0s)]
*  That's as an artist, that's all you want is to have a couple classics that people remember you for. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7822.0s)]
*  For when you 80 in a cafe drinking coffee, somebody run up and be like, yo, Craig, what's up? [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7830.0s)]

*  It's being part of the mix. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7871.0s)]
*  When I go on movies and I'm just an actor, I'll be like, damn, this is so boring. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7874.0s)]
*  Just sitting around waiting to act. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7882.0s)]

*  We're going to still do that stunt at 3 o'clock. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7892.0s)]
*  I just need to be part of the mix to stay motivated and interested. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7894.0s)]
*  If I'm just a piece of the puzzle and sitting off to the side waiting to be used like a tool, it's not as cool for me. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7901.0s)]
*  Understandable. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7911.0s)]
*  Why would it be? [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7913.0s)]
*  You don't have to do that anymore. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7914.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7916.0s)]

*  I want to be in the kitchen cooking it. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7919.0s)]
*  I don't just want to sit down and eat it. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7922.0s)]
*  No matter what it is. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7924.0s)]
*  No matter what it is. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7925.0s)]
*  If I'm going to be a part of it, I've got to be in the kitchen. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7926.0s)]
*  I can't just play a... [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7929.0s)]

*  I'm fine with that. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7942.0s)]
*  Don't think, okay, we can't hire Q because he just want to produce. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7943.0s)]
*  But I like to produce. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7948.0s)]
*  I think I add a lot to the movies that I produce. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7950.0s)]
*  The movies I produce, you can watch over and over and over again and never get tired. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7954.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7960.0s)]

*  When you just decided to... [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7963.0s)]
*  You kind of just do whatever you're interested in now. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7965.0s)]
*  Whatever you feel like pursuing. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7968.0s)]
*  That's a beautiful freedom. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7970.0s)]
*  Because I'm not playing the game no more. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7972.0s)]
*  I don't play the radio game. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7975.0s)]
*  How many spins did I get on that song? [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7978.0s)]
*  How many spins? [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7981.0s)]
*  I look at Ice Cube fans like clientele. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7982.0s)]
*  I just want to serve them, give them what they like, give them what they love, and go back to the lab. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7986.0s)]
*  I'm not worried about charts and all these measuring sticks on if you're good or not, [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=7993.0s)]
*  or is your work good, views, or whatever. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8001.0s)]
*  I'm into doing dope shit that I feel and giving it to the people that want it. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8006.0s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8014.0s)]
*  It's great for artists. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8015.0s)]
*  It's a beautiful life. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8017.0s)]
*  I'm pretty blessed in that aspect. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8019.0s)]
*  Because I know guys and I know people who are bigger than me on major labels, and they're miserable [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8023.0s)]
*  because they're so scheduled and structured. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8031.0s)]
*  They feel obligated because this and that going on. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8038.0s)]
*  I don't want to feel obligated when I'm making music to the people who's spending money. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8044.0s)]
*  I want to make the music I feel, and if you like it, spend money on it. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8051.0s)]
*  You have a very wise philosophy on how to live your life. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8056.0s)]
*  Just the way you talk about rich people, there's a lot of rich people that are miserable as fuck. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8060.0s)]
*  You don't want to be rich. You want to be happy. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8065.0s)]
*  You'd rather be less rich and more happy. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8067.0s)]
*  Without a doubt. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8071.0s)]
*  Whatever it is, it's more important to be happy doing it. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8075.0s)]
*  I notice when you're happy doing things and when you love what you do and when you put your all into it, [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8082.0s)]
*  the money comes. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8091.0s)]
*  When you focus on the money and you're doing things to get the money, [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8093.0s)]
*  you're never happy doing it or rarely happy doing it. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8099.0s)]
*  At the end of the day, you wish you could have got more money, so you're not even happy with what you would pay. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8104.0s)]
*  It also doesn't resonate with people the same way. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8110.0s)]
*  It resonates with people when you do what you love. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8112.0s)]
*  When you do what you love and it comes out, especially when you're talking about music. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8115.0s)]
*  You do what you love, people get it. They feel it. They feel it from the work. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8118.0s)]
*  If you're just doing it because you're hoping it's going to be successful, people feel that too. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8122.0s)]
*  Or just doing what you think is a hit. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8127.0s)]
*  That's the worst thing an artist can do, is to go try to make a hit. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8130.0s)]
*  You've got to make a good song. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8138.0s)]
*  Damn if it's a hit. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8142.0s)]
*  A good song is a good song whether it's played a thousand times or once. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8144.0s)]
*  That's what you focus on, making good music. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8149.0s)]
*  Whether it's a hit or not, that's in the stars. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8154.0s)]
*  Where do you think you got this wisdom to look at things so objectively and clearly? [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8160.0s)]
*  I think when I look at how I grew up, my pops is an independent man, independent thinker. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8171.0s)]
*  He's not part of any club or any organization or any fraternity or any gang. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8182.0s)]
*  It's no man that can come and tell him what to do unless he's at work. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8191.0s)]
*  I like that. I saw him stand on his own two feet. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8197.0s)]
*  He moved to LA when he was 19 years old from Louisiana. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8206.0s)]
*  He's been a man that handled his business from day one. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8212.0s)]
*  I think he's the foundation of how I view things. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8218.0s)]
*  Living and being young thrown into the fire, it seems like every time I look up, [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8224.0s)]
*  there's something that needs my focus and attention that's trying to take down what I've built. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8234.0s)]
*  I'm always paying attention. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8242.0s)]
*  I never go in something blind. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8248.0s)]
*  I try to understand all the angles before I make a decision. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8254.0s)]
*  That's very fortunate you have a father like that. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8260.0s)]
*  I am. I thank him all the time for just hanging around. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8264.0s)]
*  The statistics are what they are. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8268.0s)]
*  As men, we've got to raise our kids. We've got to be there. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8272.0s)]
*  As much as we can. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8280.0s)]
*  It makes a difference. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8284.0s)]
*  It makes a difference with the person that you're raising and the person that you're sending out into the world. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8288.0s)]
*  You want to give your family stability. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8296.0s)]
*  Fathers can do a lot of that. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8302.0s)]
*  They can do a lot of that. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8306.0s)]
*  It's got to feel great for you to see your son taken off like this. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8308.0s)]
*  With the wisdom that you got from your father, your son has obviously acquired that as well. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8312.0s)]
*  He works hard. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8320.0s)]
*  It's great, man. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8322.0s)]
*  All you want to do is you want your kids to step up in the moment of truth. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8324.0s)]
*  You want them to do what it takes at the time that it's mandatory or the situation arises that they can step up. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8330.0s)]
*  Even if it's taking out the trash. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8342.0s)]
*  When I get back, I want this done. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8344.0s)]
*  When you get back and it's done, you feel better as a parent. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8350.0s)]
*  You feel like, okay, they stepped up when they needed to, when I asked them to. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8356.0s)]
*  It makes you feel good that you've got people that you're sending out into the world that are dependable and responsible and not trying to fuck over nobody. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8364.0s)]
*  Yeah, fuck yeah. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8376.0s)]
*  That's one of the greatest accomplishments you can make as a human being. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8378.0s)]
*  You made the world better by raising better people. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8382.0s)]
*  Yeah, raise good people. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8385.0s)]
*  That's the number one job of a parent, I believe, is to raise a good person. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8387.0s)]
*  The world don't need another asshole. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8396.0s)]
*  Trust me. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8399.0s)]
*  We don't need another one. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8401.0s)]
*  We got plenty. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8403.0s)]
*  Yeah, we got plenty. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8404.0s)]
*  We're all full. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8405.0s)]
*  For show show. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8406.0s)]
*  It's also great that you set a standard with maybe people that don't even have a father figure. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8407.0s)]
*  That you set a standard with your words, the way you talk about things and address things and think about things and you're so thorough. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8412.0s)]
*  You set a standard with other young kids that admire you too, which is beautiful. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8418.0s)]
*  That's good. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8422.0s)]
*  That's great. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8423.0s)]
*  I'm blessed to be in a position to do that. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8425.0s)]
*  I want to do that. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8429.0s)]
*  I hope I'm a good example. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8431.0s)]
*  I have fun with the music and the entertainment and this and that, but I want to be a solid person. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8435.0s)]
*  Say what I mean, mean what I say, and do what I say. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8444.0s)]
*  All you got is your balls and your word, man. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8454.0s)]
*  That's it. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8457.0s)]
*  Tony Montana. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8458.0s)]

*  That's all you got. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8460.0s)]
*  You've done it and you've done it in an amazing way. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8462.0s)]
*  You set a great standard. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8465.0s)]
*  Appreciate it, man. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8467.0s)]
*  You have too. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8469.0s)]
*  You are a great communicator. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8472.0s)]
*  People need to hear somebody with courage speak for the people when others are so scared to. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8478.0s)]
*  Some of the things that you said today, a lot of people would be scared to even bring that stuff up. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8488.0s)]
*  It's what you said. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8497.0s)]
*  If you can, you should. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8499.0s)]
*  When you got the mic, use it. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8501.0s)]
*  I can, so I do. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8503.0s)]
*  When you got the mic, use it. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8505.0s)]
*  Someone has to. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8507.0s)]
*  It's a wild-ass fucking time. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8509.0s)]
*  It is, man. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8511.0s)]
*  We need people to step up that we trust. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8513.0s)]
*  We don't need no more people to let us down than we believe in. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8515.0s)]

*  It's your passion for the sport, your knowledge of the sport, your breakdown, your ability to go back and say the origin of this move, [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xpp1A1KJyU&t=8544.0s)]
