# Joe Rogan Experience #2198 - Bret Weinstein
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [September 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOQdjgdRcfA)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  Good to see you my friend.
*  Oh good to see you man.
*  Strange times we're living in.
*  The strangest and getting stranger.
*  Didn't some shit go down today?
*  Didn't we steal the president of Venezuela's plane?
*  Yeah, I think we just stole his plane.
*  I didn't.
*  No, not us.
*  Okay, good.
*  We stole his plane in the United States.
*  So someone stole his plane.
*  Which is kind of an act of war.
*  What is that?
*  Was he in it?
*  I don't think so.
*  No, I think we just stole his plane.
*  Just like for a joyride?
*  So what's the story?
*  US seizes Venezuela president Nicolas Maduro's airplane in the Dominican Republic.
*  So we said, no, we're stealing that.
*  How does that work?
*  Even if you don't get along with like a president of a country, how disrespectful is it to
*  steal their plane?
*  This, you're right.
*  It's an act of war.
*  Imagine if Xi Jinping landed somewhere and we're like, we're going to steal your fucking
*  plane.
*  Yeah.
*  No chance.
*  That's a bully move.
*  That's a move you can only do to a country like Venezuela.
*  Yes.
*  Right.
*  I'm trying to remember exactly what the story was, but there was a point where Ecuador was
*  acting very courageously with respect to Julian Assange.
*  And there was a question about whether the president of Ecuador could fly Assange out
*  so that he could be outside of the embassy and inside of Ecuador proper.
*  And I believe the reasoning was they couldn't do it because they expected the plane to be
*  forced down.
*  Same, same issue.
*  So this says Merrick Garland said that the Justice Department seized an aircraft we allege
*  was illegally purchased for 13 million dollars through a shell company and smuggled out of
*  the United States for use by Nicolas Maduro and his cronies.
*  What business is that of ours though?
*  This is what I don't understand.
*  Like, if it was purchased through a shell company, then it was purchased.
*  Right.
*  And was there a trial that established that this was ill-gotten gain?
*  It says smuggled out of the United States.
*  The plane was purchased from a company in Florida, the Justice Department said, and
*  was illegally exported in April 2023 from the United States to Venezuela through the
*  Caribbean.
*  So are we not allowed to sell them planes?
*  Is that what it is?
*  Because we have a problem with them?
*  Would they say it?
*  How much it cost?
*  13 million bucks?
*  Yeah.
*  Okay, so he's got this 13 million dollar plane, a Dassault Falcon 900EX, since been used to
*  fly almost exclusively to and from military base in Venezuela.
*  Justice Department said CNN reached out to Venezuelan government, US.
*  It seems like though that's like, there's more to it than that plane was illegal.
*  You shouldn't have that plane.
*  For years, officials have sought to disrupt the flow of billions of dollars to the regime.
*  Homeland Security Investigations, the second largest investigative agency in the federal
*  government has seized dozens of luxury vehicles, among other assets, headed to Venezuela.
*  So there's a US sanction.
*  So there's a sanction.
*  This is it.
*  The plane was seized in violation of US sanctions with Venezuela and other criminal matters
*  that we're looking at regarding this aircraft.
*  They're going to find a reason to keep it.
*  Like they stole all those boats from all those Russian cats.
*  Sorry, you're too rich and you know Putin, so give me your boat.
*  Well that's the thing.
*  There's a hidden story for everything and this is about incentivizing the world and
*  we in the public don't get to know the real story.
*  Don't you think now though, most people, I feel like genuinely most people are aware
*  there's more to the story.
*  Every story.
*  Everything in the news.
*  Every time something comes up, people are like, what's the whole story here?
*  Well you know I coined this term, the Cartesian crisis.
*  And the Cartesian crisis basically means the point at which you can't really be certain
*  of anything.
*  And the problem is, yes I do think people are catching on to the fact that they never
*  know the real story, but the response to that is either that you start believing the bullshit
*  that they tell you or that you just become cynical and stop believing anything and neither
*  of those are functional ways to exist.
*  And both those ways are good for the people that are running scams.
*  Exactly.
*  They're good for the people who want to maintain power because it just keeps us back on our
*  heels.
*  Yeah because if you don't know what's true and what's not true, you're like, oh geez.
*  You know and then you get cynical, oh it's all bullshit, this whole system's rigged,
*  then you just go fishing.
*  Right.
*  And that's the thing people don't understand is that at the point that you think you're
*  striking a blow by checking out of their system, you're actually doing them a favor.
*  It's actually beneficial to them because then you have a smaller number of people that are
*  voting.
*  So essentially in the 2020 elections, it was the largest ever win, right?
*  The Democrats got 80 something million votes, which is, so let's say, let's even if it was
*  50-50.
*  So somewhere in the neighborhood of 160 million people, how many people are women and children,
*  I mean how many people are children, women can vote, what am I saying?
*  How many people are children rather?
*  Oh geez, I have no idea on the percentage.
*  Under 18, it's probably in the 30%.
*  So that's a pretty high turnout.
*  Yes, if that was even the turnout.
*  If it was real.
*  Yeah, that's the problem.
*  We have no idea.
*  There and that's the problem with the whole cynical game because I'm not convinced.
*  You know why I'm not convinced?
*  Because everybody wants me to be convinced.
*  When they yell at you, if you ask a question, like hey, one of the things that I've always
*  said and everyone sort of agrees with this, I mean literally everyone, even people that
*  think that the election was 100% legitimate.
*  The percentage of voter fraud is never zero, correct?
*  And they're always like, yes.
*  No one can say it's zero.
*  It's not zero.
*  There's a bunch of slippery people that get arrested on both sides of the aisle.
*  Republicans and Democrats get arrested for election fraud.
*  It's a real crime.
*  The idea that they commit all these other acts of fraud and deception, but when it comes
*  Brett, that's a sacred institution that we don't violate at any cost.
*  Yep.
*  Well, and the way they maintain that story is by ruthlessly punishing anybody who questions
*  it even though questioning it is the obvious thing to do.
*  Because for one thing, elections used to be different as you remember, right?
*  First of all, you used to vote in person and voting by mail was something you were very
*  reluctant to do because you knew that if your vote got counted, it was going to be very
*  late in the process.
*  It wasn't really going to matter.
*  It was mostly for soldiers serving overseas.
*  Right, exactly.
*  It was for people who just simply couldn't vote in person and never really mattered except
*  in very rare cases.
*  The disappearance of that and the normalization of voting by mail, the normalization of voting
*  across a period of time so that you're not all voting on the same day, and the absence
*  of exit polls, right?
*  When everybody's voting from home or wherever, you can't detect fraud by virtue of the fact
*  that the count that came in from that precinct didn't match what the exit pollers registered.
*  Right.
*  And so, you know, I don't think we are wrong to imagine that we have lost the ability to
*  check whether an election is fair and that that's not an accident.
*  That that leaves the possibility open to cheat.
*  And as you point out, they cheat in every other way.
*  Are we supposed to believe that they won't do that because their patriotism is so deep?
*  I don't see any patriotism to them at all.
*  Well, not only that, they've established this narrative that it's imperative that the Democrats
*  win to save democracy.
*  So they've already made all of these statements that it's more important for them to win than
*  anything.
*  More important than anything.
*  More important than having primaries.
*  letting the people decide who the representative is.
*  More important than having like live actual conversations, interviews that aren't edited
*  on CNN and said they have a 40 plus minute one that's edited down to 18 minutes.
*  Like what?
*  Well, and we just went through this with them over COVID.
*  We know that when they think they're in the right, they feel entitled to lie about everything.
*  They feel entitled to coerce.
*  So the idea that we're supposed to imagine that our elections are somehow different to
*  them, I can't imagine how that would even work.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  And it's it's one of those things again, that you're you're forced into agreeing with just
*  out of fear, because people get very aggressive with it, just like people were super aggressive
*  about the vaccine.
*  You know, I hate seeing people die because they made a poor choice.
*  But there's something insane about how many people were like pro vaccine advocates that
*  were shaming people and angry people.
*  And now they're dead.
*  And they're not dead because they ran their time and they got old and they died.
*  And you know, it's unfortunate, but it happens to all.
*  No, they're dead young, like a lot, a lot of people, not one, not 20.
*  We don't even know what the real numbers are, because it's not something the mainstream
*  media covers, because they've all been vaccinated to and they're probably freaking the fuck
*  out, too.
*  Yeah, it's a huge number of people.
*  We can detect that statistically.
*  The trouble is that it's hard in any individual case to know whether or not you're looking
*  at something that would have happened anyway.
*  Right.
*  So you remember John Ritter?
*  Yes.
*  From Three's Company.
*  Sure.
*  Died of a rupture.
*  Oh, you did.
*  Yeah, did an episode of News Radio with him.
*  Super nice guy.
*  Good guy.
*  Yeah, I got that impression.
*  Anyway, he died of a ruptured aorta, if I remember correctly, long before there was
*  COVID vaccines.
*  So the point is, if that had happened last year, we'd all be saying, come on, he's in
*  Hollywood, he got faxed and now look at him.
*  So it happens.
*  100%.
*  Right.
*  But the rate at which it's happening has changed radically.
*  And the very people who say, oh, that's not the vaccine are very uninterested in figuring
*  out what it is.
*  So, you know, let's put two and two together.
*  Well, they don't even want to consider the vaccine, which is so crazy.
*  If you called it anything else, if it wasn't called the vaccine, if it wasn't for COVID,
*  okay, let's because COVID became so it became so politicized and it was like culturally
*  so polarizing.
*  Let's pretend it was for something else.
*  And there was some medication and the people that were taking that medication were dropping
*  like flies.
*  They would 100% make a correlation and they would make it publicly and it'd be in the
*  news.
*  It might not actually be in the news today because this is part of the problem with what
*  we're dealing with with advertising and the media is that there's so much revenue that
*  comes from pharmaceutical drug companies that there's just a reality about them reluctant
*  to print or or put any stores on television that are negative.
*  There's too much money involved.
*  Right.
*  There's too much money involved and it becomes impossible to override this narrative.
*  The narrative takes on a reality of its own, even though it is contradicted by the facts
*  and we, you know, our scientific tools are they're tremendously powerful at discovering
*  patterns like this.
*  It's not difficult to do and yet we deliberately avoid using them in the ways that they were
*  intended.
*  Do you think in the future we'll look back on this and there'll be some sort of some
*  sort of a shift in the way we discuss it?
*  There's a lot of things in history that during the time where they were happening, I'm sure
*  people were all like the McCarthy era.
*  You know, I'm sure people thought it was very important to root out these communists, but
*  they didn't exactly understand.
*  Like, hey, you're calling a lot of people communists aren't even communists.
*  You're going after people that just went to meetings to find out what's going on.
*  The world didn't exactly understand what that even meant back then.
*  There's, you know, we look back at it now.
*  The Red Scare is like a negative thing.
*  It's a dangerous sort of negative aspect of our history.
*  Yeah, although, you know, I'm sure you're having the same experience where lots of stuff
*  that you learned as a clear narrative, like, you know, the Red Scare took over people and
*  it was like a witch hunt.
*  And the answer is actually more nuanced than that.
*  There was more truth to it than I was taught.
*  Right.
*  The Rosenbergs really were guilty of passing secrets to the Russians.
*  Oh, yeah, there definitely was a lot of that.
*  So, you know, it's a mixed story.
*  Right.
*  You asked the question, though, if in the future we're going to have a different conversation
*  about what's taking place.
*  And I just want to put a little placeholder there.
*  The answer kind of depends if there is a future.
*  And I worry a lot that not only are we headed into chaos, but that we are going to be denied
*  the ability to have a proper historical account of the present, that we're never going to
*  understand what these stories were doing, why they played out the way they did, you
*  know, why people disappeared when they did, and that that's not healthy.
*  You need to be able to create a record.
*  It's never going to be perfect, but you need to be able to create a record of what took
*  place that has been exposed to some kind of analytical standard so that you can correct
*  your course.
*  And if you don't know what happened, you can't improve on your thought process going forward.
*  And that's extremely dangerous.
*  It's like, you know, flying with a blindfold.
*  Yeah, that's a great way to put it.
*  And I'm glad you did point out the fact that there were really things.
*  The Red Scare is a weird example because people would like to kind of dismiss the impact that
*  the communists, especially Russia, was having on our government.
*  And there was pretty big impact.
*  I mean, they did steal the plans for the nuclear bomb.
*  There's a lot of shit that happened because of actual communist interference.
*  But the narrative when I was in high school was that the Red Scare was bad.
*  Right.
*  It was like everybody went crazy and they were all looking for, which was true, too.
*  But that's part of the problem when you don't know.
*  Like back then, no Internet, very little paper trail.
*  It's really hard to find out who's talking to whom unless you get an actual listening
*  device in the room and capture them talking.
*  Yeah, we can't know.
*  And it's important to get your comeuppance on these stories.
*  You grow up comfortable that you understand what happened during the Red Scare.
*  And then one day you're doing a little reading and you discover the story just isn't the
*  one you were taught.
*  And the more stories you dig into, the more frequently that happens.
*  Well, if you just get one good one, you're hooked.
*  For me, it was the Kennedy assassination.
*  One good book on the Kennedy assassination, I was like, God damn it, they killed the fucking
*  president and it freaked me out forever.
*  That was like I literally had a giant shift in how I viewed the world after reading that
*  book because before that, I was never a questioner of whatever was in the news or whatever the
*  narrative was that we were being told about anything.
*  Well, but I mean, I have exactly the same reaction to that story.
*  And I've been down that rabbit hole.
*  And I think you're just ultimately left to the question.
*  Something happened in 1963.
*  That's before either of us were born.
*  Right?
*  Right.
*  That thing was either an anomaly that robbed the nation of a president and the nation continued
*  to be a democratic republic in the aftermath of it, or that was interference with democracy.
*  And we don't know how to look at all of the seemingly democratic things that have happened
*  since.
*  How much of what has happened since are the people who took control with that assassination?
*  How much is them continuing to maintain control with a certain amount of democracy?
*  And how much was that an aberration that then returned us to our normal course?
*  That's a good point.
*  A certain amount of democracy.
*  A certain amount.
*  There's clearly a certain amount.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, which is one of the reasons why they're so terrified of Trump.
*  There's a certain amount of stealing they can do.
*  Let's imagine if it is dirty and you really can manipulate elections.
*  How much can you manipulate by?
*  Can you manipulate it by 30%?
*  You know?
*  Because we don't know.
*  And as long as they can have you believing in the polls, this is what's really important,
*  polls.
*  Kamala Harris is up by 3%.
*  Oh, she's up.
*  She's winning.
*  Who the fuck are you talking to?
*  Who are you talking to?
*  Right.
*  And you're not talking to me.
*  How narrative is it in which Kamala has done something that might have caused a surge in
*  her popularity?
*  Like, I didn't see it.
*  Well, some magic.
*  It's like, you know, there's that theory, that concept about multiple dimensions, multiple
*  universes that we all live.
*  Yeah.
*  This possibility that there's infinite numbers of universes all around us all the time and
*  we enter into a different timeline.
*  We entered into a different timeline.
*  Well, clearly.
*  Something happened.
*  I think the multiverse thing is nonsense.
*  I think it's an accounting scheme for figuring out how to deal with the fact that actually
*  the universe is not deterministic, which people wrestle with because we don't exactly know
*  why it isn't.
*  But to your point about how much can they cheat, I call that factor, which none of us
*  can put a number on.
*  Maybe they can.
*  Right.
*  I call it the cheat factor, right?
*  The cheat margin.
*  One of the things that I'm trying to convince people of is that it's not hopeless because
*  they can cheat, but it means that you have to succeed at a level that exceeds their capacity
*  to erase it.
*  Right.
*  So that's what we're talking about.
*  So we're talking about maybe they can cheat by 10%.
*  Right.
*  And what we know, and I think actually we owe Trump a huge debt of gratitude for proving
*  something that I couldn't have told you if it was true before he won the presidency,
*  which is is there still enough democracy left in the system for something to upend the plan?
*  Right?
*  Because he was clearly off narrative and he did become president.
*  So he did something for us that I don't know anybody else who could have done it.
*  Yeah.
*  It would take a person with that kind of personality that could withstand that kind of abuse because
*  he didn't freak out at all when they went after him.
*  He's like, right, just brushed it off like it was nothing and no one's done that.
*  He's also the only guy that's ever gone through four years and didn't age like he went through
*  30 years.
*  That's true.
*  He aged normal.
*  Yeah.
*  He's used to it.
*  He's used to pressure, you know, and Bush, he aged a ton.
*  Obama aged a ton.
*  Everybody aged a ton.
*  Biden was already cooked before he got in, but he's hard, but he aged a ton.
*  I mean, Biden from 2019 to today is a different person.
*  Yeah.
*  And he was already visibly degraded.
*  But wow, was it a precipitous decline.
*  Big jump now.
*  Yeah.
*  Trump was fine.
*  Yeah, Trump physically.
*  And actually, I think he sounds better.
*  I think, you know, he drives me crazy sometimes when he talks, but I think he's getting better
*  at it.
*  I think he's trying to be a little bit more reasonable, you know, and try to appeal to
*  more people because of that, you know, that effort to be more reasonable.
*  Like he's he's changed his mind about a lot of things.
*  He's talking about legalizing marijuana.
*  He's talking about all these different things that are like where, you know, you're going
*  to get a lot of different responses from like the hardcore Republicans are not going to
*  be for that.
*  You know, any any idea of abortion, the hardcore right wing are not interested at all and any
*  restrictions on abortion at all, you get your hardcore left wing.
*  So it's mostly it's the people in the middle.
*  Abortion is a good one, right?
*  Because most people are like, no one should be able to tell you what you could do with
*  your body.
*  But also, aborting an eight month old fetus is kind of fucking insane.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, the funny thing, and I've been saying this forever, is that almost everybody agrees
*  on the basics on abortion.
*  We're supposed to not be able to even talk about it.
*  Right.
*  I think most people believe that abortion is negative, that if you've got a blastula,
*  right, a clump of cells doesn't yet have a nervous system, that you have the right to
*  terminate that pregnancy and that the farther you go through that pregnancy, the less right
*  you have.
*  And most people are incredibly queasy about it, I think, as they should be in the third
*  trimester.
*  And, you know, that's what we agree on.
*  So it's really the extremists on both sides that we are up against.
*  But to the question of what Trump is doing with an issue like this, I want to make a
*  couple of points.
*  One, I think there are two issues that are getting tangled.
*  One, I think he's politically going to some places that are not traditionally Republican.
*  Because I don't even think, I think he's destroyed the Republican Party.
*  I just don't see the same Republican Party I remember at all.
*  I see a different thing and it's flagged.
*  It's a MAGA party.
*  Yeah, it's a MAGA party.
*  Right, exactly.
*  And that's a very different thing because I see MAGA as mostly the labor faction that
*  was cut loose by the Democrats in the Clinton administration.
*  And so they've now found a home under MAGA.
*  Interesting, right?
*  Like, because blue collar people were generally union people, which were generally Democrats.
*  Totally.
*  Clinton turned the Democratic Party into a second corporate party so that those people
*  were homeless.
*  And then Trump picked them up as MAGA and they're now under the Republican banner.
*  But it doesn't read like the Republican Party at all to me.
*  And now it's picked up a, you know, I don't want to say technocratic, that's dismissive.
*  But it's got this Silicon Valley component to it.
*  Yes, that's recent.
*  Yep.
*  That's recent over the last year.
*  Yep.
*  Yeah.
*  It's interesting, right?
*  Because we did growing up always associate unions and blue collar people with voting
*  Democrat because Democrats were looking out for the middle class, looking out for people's
*  best interests, supporting unions and fair wages and funding schools and all that kind
*  of stuff.
*  Keeping neighborhoods safe.
*  And Republicans were more like small government, fuck you, figure it out, I don't want to pay
*  taxes.
*  Yes, stingy.
*  And they were the ones that are encouraging war.
*  Yep.
*  It's crazy today that you have this massive 180 degree shift and the Democrats are talking
*  about how important it is that we keep funding Ukraine and that, you know, we have some sort
*  of, whether you're pro Hamas or pro Palestine, I should say, or whether you're pro Israel,
*  there's involvement in that.
*  No one is saying, neither, no Democrats are saying we need to get the fuck out of there.
*  Right.
*  They're saying we need to free Palestine.
*  Oh, okay.
*  How are you going to do that?
*  How are you going to do that?
*  How much is involved in that?
*  Are you going to bring in people?
*  Are you going to send people there?
*  Like, what are you going to do?
*  Are you going to kill people for this?
*  What are we doing?
*  The Democrats are, you guys are looking for war, you're not looking for peaceful solutions.
*  Like, this is kind of weird.
*  This is interesting.
*  You know, that we need to beat Russia.
*  Are you out of your fucking mind?
*  Are you serious?
*  Do you know how big that place is?
*  Do you know how much military force is behind Putin?
*  What are you talking about?
*  What are you talking about?
*  Like, what if he just decides to go nuclear at any point in time?
*  If he gets pressured, you keep advancing further and further into Russia.
*  And he's like, I'll just end this right now.
*  I'll just turn Kiev into a fucking sandbox.
*  Boom.
*  And then what do we do?
*  No, it's insane.
*  And the hardest part, I'm sure you have these people in your life too, but let's just take
*  my parents for a second.
*  Okay.
*  Lifelong Democrats, they live in LA, surrounded by Hollywood types.
*  They cannot seem to grasp the fact that the party that they believed in is now doing the
*  inverse of everything they signed up for.
*  Exactly.
*  Because the New York Times rephrases everything, so it seems like the values are still there.
*  Right.
*  Which is wild.
*  It's crazy.
*  If you're not a New York Times reader, you can barely figure out what these people are
*  talking about.
*  Did you see the article that I posted on my Instagram that's a title of a New York Times
*  article for today?
*  Which one?
*  Jamie, pull this up.
*  I want Brett to see this so you know this is real.
*  This isn't the Babylon Bee.
*  This is an actual New York Times article.
*  You see it?
*  This is so crazy.
*  It's really hard to believe that someone would print this and the New York Times would say,
*  yeah, we like it.
*  Put it out there.
*  I'm not quite sure what to expect.
*  Look at this.
*  Oh yeah, of course.
*  The Constitution is sacred.
*  Is it also dangerous?
*  One of the biggest threats to American politics might be the country's founding document.
*  What the fuck are you talking about?
*  One of the biggest threats to America's politics might be one of the greatest documents that
*  any country has ever founded on, if not the greatest ever.
*  That could be a threat to America's politics.
*  What politics are we talking about?
*  How could you possibly gaslight me enough to go along with you on this?
*  It's incredible.
*  On the one hand, completely predictable, right?
*  Because there's obviously an authoritarian force there that just grinds its teeth at
*  night over the Constitution and the fact that it prevents it from doing things that it just
*  wants to do last week.
*  Of course, they're scratching their heads.
*  Can we come up with an argument for why it might be time to get rid of that thing?
*  Of course, if you're a normal thinking person, this is complete insanity.
*  But if you're a New York Times reader, I'm sure that fits with the kind of ethos that's
*  been cultivated.
*  Well, this is why a person like Trump is so important to them.
*  Because if you don't have someone that is an imminent threat on the horizon in three
*  months, it's very difficult to justify all this shit.
*  So if you have Kamala Harris and she's competing against Ron DeSantis, if it's just Kamala
*  Harris and Ron DeSantis and Trump doesn't exist, maybe he died.
*  Maybe he died in the last few years.
*  How could you, you wouldn't be able to make that argument.
*  There's no imminent threat.
*  Let's say Mitt Romney, let's say someone even more moderate as a Republican, even more palatable.
*  You can't make that argument that we can't have a First Amendment because the First Amendment
*  is getting in the way.
*  The First Amendment is allowing people to say things that aren't true, misinformation
*  and disinformation.
*  And we're right here.
*  We're September 2nd.
*  I think yesterday was the first day where Brazil banned Twitter.
*  So X is illegal to have in Brazil as of today, as of yesterday.
*  Not only is it illegal, but you go through it through a VPN and they will charge you
*  $8,000 a day.
*  I know it's it's incredible that we are watching this.
*  Insane.
*  I want to remind you, they did pull this stuff when it was Mitt Romney, when it was George
*  W. Bush.
*  Right.
*  The rhetoric was still existential threat.
*  Right.
*  And they always have particular versions of this.
*  Right.
*  Not as ramped up as this.
*  Right.
*  This is like Hitler, Hitler talk.
*  No, I.
*  They never talked about Mitt Romney like he was Hitler.
*  I agree.
*  And as I've been saying since the beginning of this electoral cycle, they fear Bobby Kennedy
*  far more than they fear Trump, because actually Trump gives them the only argument for their
*  existence that is functional.
*  Right.
*  They don't have an affirmative argument for why they should be in power.
*  But being the alternative to Trump is, you know, that's a that's a pitch.
*  Right.
*  So we are now somewhere pretty interesting in the sense that I think, you know, to the
*  faithful, that argument still works.
*  But to a larger and larger group of people, they're seeing right through it.
*  Yeah.
*  They're understanding.
*  First of all, we lived through four years of Trump.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  There were good aspects.
*  There were bad aspects.
*  But, you know, it was not distinguished as some moment of, you know, total failure of
*  our system or something.
*  Right.
*  You know, there were a lot of elements of it that were very positive.
*  Right.
*  That's that's a that's where a fun meme is.
*  There's a fun meme that someone made about how you're telling me that he's going to do
*  these things that he didn't when he was in office.
*  And you're telling me that you're going to do these things that you didn't do.
*  And you're in office now.
*  Right.
*  Like what?
*  And add to that, you're doing the things that you're accusing him of intending to do.
*  Right.
*  All this lawfare stuff.
*  That's frightening.
*  They're weaponizing the courts.
*  Yeah.
*  They're weaponizing the courts over what was a misdemeanor with that's already if you look
*  at the like Bill Ackman had a post that he made on Twitter laying out the legality of
*  this thirty four count thing that they convicted him of, that this is essentially an accounting
*  error or deception.
*  That's a misdemeanor that is past the statute of limitations.
*  Not only that, but I don't think you have to really even squint at it to see that it's
*  just simply unconstitutional to point the courts at particular people and not other
*  people.
*  Right.
*  We have a constitutional right to equal protection under the law.
*  And obviously they are setting a different standard for Trump because they want to keep
*  him tied up in court.
*  Maybe they want to lock him up and put him in prison.
*  But whatever they're doing is un-American.
*  It is anti-American.
*  And very dangerous because you've set a precedent now.
*  Now let's imagine like we've gone through shifts in this country where we leaned heavily
*  left like during the Carter administration was run by serious lefty.
*  You know and then what if now it is run by a hardcore right winger?
*  What if there's some sort of an attack on American soil and it ramps up patriotism and
*  people get real angry and right.
*  Just like the left has moved so far left that if you're not in favor of hormone blockers
*  for kids, somehow you're transphobic and you're a bigot.
*  Like somehow or another if you're not in favor of that you're a bigot.
*  What if it gets so right that if you're not in favor of stops and frisks all over the
*  country for everyone then somehow or another you're anti-safety of the nation.
*  And if you're not in favor of no-knock raids on people's homes with no warrants that somehow
*  or another you're a danger to our democracy.
*  It can go really creepy far right just like it's really creepy far left and then they're
*  utilizing the courts.
*  If they fill the courts up with a bunch of hardcore Republicans now you're utilizing
*  the courts against people in a way that you would find very offensive because you've made
*  it you set a precedent.
*  Right and and I think actually we are already living this nightmare in one way because what
*  they did was loaded powers into the executive branch that were never supposed to be there.
*  They created emperor like discretion and they gave those powers to the president I think
*  believing that they would never be in the hands of anybody that wasn't on their team
*  right.
*  I'm not talking red or blue right.
*  I'm talking about inside versus outside and one of the reasons that I think the reaction
*  to Trump is what it was is that he was taking over an office that had been given all of
*  these exotic tools that he could in principle use against anybody.
*  These are tools that are absolutely a violation of our constitution and yet they exist there
*  and so the need to prevent him from having access to those things was existential in
*  their mind and so anyway the point is they created tools they never expected to be in
*  the hands of someone else and that is the situation that's the scenario you're describing
*  here as well.
*  Why do you think the multiverse is bullshit.
*  I just don't think it makes any sense because if you take the multiverse literally so let
*  me back up a second.
*  We have a principle that tells us more or less what is true called parsimony right.
*  We take the simplest explanation that accounts for what we observe and we imagine it's true
*  and there's a little imperfection in there but if you had all the information it would
*  work I think perfectly and then there's a flaw in how we apply it.
*  The multiverse is analytically very simple right.
*  It's just one move.
*  Oh there are an infinite number of universes in every moment there are an infinite number
*  of things that could happen and a universe is created for each one that's very simple.
*  I just said it in one sentence.
*  On the other hand at the practical level it couldn't possibly be more wasteful and absurd
*  right.
*  The idea that you know there's going to be a different there's going to be two universes
*  you're going to double the universe because I just move my glasses and we need one universe
*  in which I didn't and one universe in which I did and then each of those universes is
*  going to proliferate out from each moment.
*  This does not make any sense so I think what it is is this is just part of the process
*  of discovery.
*  Imagine an infinite number of proliferating universes from each branching point right.
*  That accounts that allows us to understand we could describe it that way and it allows
*  us to understand the universe as we observe it.
*  Now the question is what's really going on that allows that to take place without the
*  proliferation of universes.
*  That's why I think it's wrong.
*  It's the intermediate it's the immature analytical point at which we have noticed that something
*  is going on.
*  We know we need to explain it and we haven't yet stood in the right place to explain it
*  in a way that's actually efficient.
*  So what we're doing is we're explaining it in a way that if you typed it out it's one
*  tweet.
*  But isn't existence itself insane.
*  The universe itself is insane.
*  Like particles are insane going all the way out to solar nurseries.
*  It's all insane.
*  The whole thing's insane.
*  It's insane in scope.
*  It's insane in size.
*  It's insane in its complexity.
*  It's almost incomprehensible.
*  Almost incomprehensible.
*  So why would it be more incomprehensible if it was there was infinite variety and infinite
*  numbers of them.
*  It would just be a different level of crazy that we weren't aware of.
*  Well no.
*  No.
*  I mean I don't think so because it's not a different level.
*  Let's just agree that the universe the size of it is impossible to actually comprehend.
*  I think it's impossible.
*  It's literally impossible.
*  We just look at it as a number.
*  It's a small number actually.
*  You look at it.
*  Oh like what's the most recent the James Wynn telescope the most recent advanced versions
*  of it.
*  They're talking about 22 billion plus years for the Big Bang.
*  They're looking at that now because of the because of the structure of some galaxies
*  that shouldn't exist.
*  It shouldn't exist in the time period of which they would have to be formed in a certain
*  amount of years.
*  And so there's it's very contentious but there's some of these people studying the results
*  that seem to believe it's very quite possible that you might want to push that date back
*  for whatever the Big Bang is.
*  Right.
*  OK.
*  I'm open to all these ideas except ones like the multiverse because let's put it this way.
*  You haven't solved a problem by invoking the multiverse.
*  What you've done is you've caused a problem that is like the original problem that you
*  had raised to the infinity.
*  Right.
*  So my feeling is anytime you've made the problem the philosophical problem you had that we
*  all admit is really really difficult infinitely worse you probably made a wrong move.
*  I don't know about that.
*  I don't I don't think that's necessarily true because just because we haven't solved the
*  problem of this immense thing that's impossible to grasp.
*  It doesn't mean it can't be way bigger than we even imagine in a concept that's impossible
*  to grasp.
*  And there's got to be some reason why so many people are entertaining this multiverse theory.
*  It's not.
*  Well that's just because we're not very because we're descendants of chimp like ancestors
*  and we have limited tools to bring to bear to this sort of exciting.
*  Right.
*  It's exciting.
*  It's a good way to think of it as if you think of it as a temporary stand in for whatever
*  the answer is that's going to dawn us on us at some point.
*  It's fine.
*  It's a good it's a good thought problem.
*  But imagining that it's real you know you said you know maybe the problem is infinitely
*  bigger than we thought.
*  It's not infinitely bigger.
*  It's the rate of growth of the problem is every instant needs multiple universes for
*  the most trivial of modifications.
*  I'm sorry that just does not sound like nature to me.
*  I think it sounds like the universe though.
*  I don't think the universe necessarily sounds like nature.
*  Nature is what we see here.
*  But what we see everywhere is so bizarre with black holes are so bizarre supernovas.
*  They're so fucking bizarre.
*  The fact that there's a giant black hole in the center of every galaxy that's one half
*  of one percent of the mass of the galaxy and it might be another universe inside of that
*  thing.
*  But see I actually think that one I mean I was waiting for that discovery for my whole
*  life and when I finally heard it was like OK now I understand why you've got this huge
*  swirling thing.
*  You've got this giant gravitational mass in the center that you can't see.
*  Now it makes sense.
*  So that was like a simplifying discovery.
*  Well the existence of the black hole but the concept of a black hole being essentially
*  a portal into another universe where there's hundreds of billions of galaxies each one
*  with a black hole in the center of them.
*  You go through each one of those you have hundreds of billions of galaxies each one
*  with a black hole in the center of it and you just keep doing that forever and ever
*  and ever.
*  Isn't that kind of the multiverse.
*  Well let's put it this way.
*  I mean a we're a little bit safe here because by definition there's no way of peering into
*  those right.
*  For now I think forever.
*  You think I can't get a grasp on this in a better way.
*  Well it might be able to quantum computing a thousand years from now.
*  The problem is that there's a physical reason you can't for the same reason the light can't
*  get out.
*  There's no way to peer in.
*  Right.
*  So am I cool with the idea that maybe there's an equilibrium that you know a black hole
*  where things once they're pulled in over that threshold they never emerge again and that
*  maybe they emerge somewhere else.
*  Yeah I could imagine parallel things that are entangled in this way.
*  That does not sound inherently like an insane cheat to me because what we have is a mystery
*  staring us in the face in every one of those ultra massive black holes.
*  What the hell is it.
*  Right.
*  What about a future in which we develop some sort of propulsion system and attach it to
*  a drone that's not it's not based on fuel.
*  It's based on some sort of gravity thing and allows you to traverse immense distances very
*  quickly and then we could actually get that fucker way out there and take some video and
*  bring it back.
*  Well you're going to avoid the warranty I'm pretty sure.
*  Well it's OK.
*  It's all funded by the government.
*  Oh right.
*  Infinite money.
*  We just print checks.
*  Oh we'll just tax people and we'll blame the UFOs.
*  Which is what I think they're doing by the way.
*  Using the UFO story.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I think so too.
*  Yeah I think both things are true.
*  I think we have been visited and I think it only makes sense.
*  I think there is life out there because it doesn't make sense there isn't and I think
*  I would visit if I got a thousand years more advanced than we are and we found out about
*  some planet that's 2000 light years away that actually is making nuclear bombs.
*  Fuck yeah I'd visit.
*  Of course I'd visit.
*  A hundred percent.
*  So of course they would visit and of course they would want to protect us from the overwhelming
*  shock to our culture that would undoubtedly be thrust upon us if we were confronted with
*  a city-sized spaceship that's hovering over Detroit.
*  Just hovering over there.
*  It would send the world into a massive panic.
*  No one would know what to do.
*  I'm not sure about this.
*  So I want to just adjust a couple things you said.
*  Okay please do.
*  From my perspective you're absolutely right.
*  It would be there's every reason to think there's lots of life in the universe.
*  That life that attains a certain level of cognition will inevitably create technologies
*  that break boundaries that it can't biologically break.
*  So it'll you know traverse some distance across space.
*  But the real question is how many islands of life what's the closest one how traversable
*  is the cosmos.
*  It may not be traversable at all at those scales or it may be much more traversable
*  than we know and then it doesn't take very many islands of life to have somebody visit us.
*  But as to your last point I actually well first of all everybody every thinking person I know
*  is pretty troubled by the present and you know a hostile alien force would freak everybody out.
*  But I A I can't see a reason why aliens would be hostile.
*  It doesn't make sense to me.
*  They don't have to be hostile.
*  Yeah.
*  Just being there.
*  Right but then if they were just there first of all we've been training for this.
*  Right we all spend a lot of time on sci-fi stories aliens and all that stuff.
*  Right.
*  So I think actually we wouldn't be impressed enough because we've seen really impressive
*  stuff on screens again and again and again.
*  If you actually heard that this stuff was going on if the ship showed up in the sky
*  and you could see it with your binoculars I think the question is well are they friendly
*  and what do they have to say.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  I honestly don't think you know I don't if I heard about it I would think that's got to be good news
*  because.
*  Right but to anyone in power this would be a
*  gigantic threat to anyone trying to pass off some sort of narrative that this is the
*  we're in the lead in terms of like the moral high ground of the world and that we're you know we're
*  the wisest we're the best we're going to make decisions for everybody that would throw a monkey
*  wrench completely into the gears of that.
*  Oh totally.
*  So they would lose all control.
*  Right.
*  Lose all authority.
*  They would lose all respect.
*  But why are the aliens abiding by their plan.
*  Because I don't think they are.
*  That's not what I'm saying.
*  I think that would freak them out and they're not doing that.
*  Right.
*  I think if they are real and they do observe us they probably observe us in a way where
*  there's a limited amount of detection and I think there's probably if I was going to acclimate a
*  culture to the idea that they're not alone I would do it slowly.
*  That way you could have the same ultimate effect eventually and maybe.
*  Maybe help them along their evolution as well along their cultural evolution to like slowly
*  introduce this concept that they're not alone and then do it over decades which is exactly
*  what's been happening.
*  And the acceptance of it has changed from when I was a kid you talk about UFOs you're a fucking
*  kook 100 percent straight up kook.
*  And then the Bob Lazar story came around and everybody was like hey wait a minute is that
*  guy telling the truth and that was like 89 but still seemed like bullshit and then there's a
*  bunch of questions about his education background.
*  Bullshit artist.
*  But then over time more people have seen enough things like Commander David Fravor and more
*  people have seen things that like have no explanation whatsoever and you start hearing
*  stories from high level people about retrieved vehicles and this and that.
*  It's more and more and more and more and more normal people talking about it and more and more
*  professors at Stanford and the New York Times in 2017 prints a story and respected
*  Air Force pilots are coming out and talking about it.
*  It's a different world and it's a different world just over a few decades.
*  Yeah it's a different world but I still haven't seen anything that isn't best explained as
*  Psyop bullshit.
*  Right.
*  I haven't either but but also I haven't seen anything right.
*  These are unique experiences and the problem with unique experiences is
*  everyone has to just sort of trust you unless you have some kind of evidence.
*  Everyone has to trust you even if it's a whole town.
*  It's a unique experience in the town.
*  Mass hypnosis bunch of bullshit artists.
*  They're taking advantage of it for tourism like Virginia and Brazil.
*  The entire town saw this thing.
*  So you know I'm not sure if it's all bullshit.
*  I think there's some bullshit mixed in with some real stuff.
*  That's what I think.
*  This is my conclusion over time because if you go back to like the Kenneth Arnold
*  sightings the 1950s we didn't have anything that moved like that.
*  Nobody did.
*  There's no way anybody had anything in the 1950s that could shoot across the sky.
*  Soundless make no noise skip like flying saucers is what the way described it.
*  There was a I think there was nine of them together.
*  Like there was no we didn't have anything like that.
*  So maybe occasionally we're visited maybe occasionally they show themselves
*  and maybe they have been here.
*  Tucker thinks they've been here all along.
*  He thinks they're a part of this world that we live in.
*  They just they they hide from us and maybe they live in the ocean.
*  Yeah I mean you know you know what my stock and trade is and my feeling is I'm perfectly open to
*  the possibility that there are alien intelligences in the universe.
*  I'm perfectly open to the possibility that they would stop by.
*  Um but I'm going to need something like evidence that isn't better explained by
*  terrestrial bullshit because frankly the terrestrial bullshit is guaranteed.
*  Right.
*  If they had some sort of a drone that used gravity and could zip across the sky like
*  you know 10x light speed they wouldn't tell you about it.
*  Yeah but I don't even think it's I don't look I think the fact and I think we may have talked
*  about this before but the fact that these things are doing stuff that's beyond any
*  terrestrial craft that we know of and they're silent that's because they're not craft.
*  They're projections of some kind and so they're visually very compelling but they do not disturb
*  the atoms that they're passing through because they're not they don't displace anything.
*  So you think the radar when they use radar and they find these things.
*  What do you think that is?
*  Oh man I think that's people putting blips on other people's radar and it's not the only
*  place in history that that shows up right.
*  So you could force a blip onto someone's radar sure hack the radar and heck if you had a
*  how would you do that.
*  Well these radars are all computerized.
*  Well let's talk about the David Fravor one right because this is 2004 so it kind of limits our
*  ability in terms of you know you have high technology you have extremely powerful computers
*  you have a lot of stuff going on but we certainly don't have what we have 20 years later right.
*  Yep.
*  We all agree that now they have multiple different mediums multiple different types of evidence.
*  They have visual eyewitness testimony and more than one jet sees this thing more than one pilot
*  sees this thing they all have the same story this thing zips across the sky.
*  They have the radar that shows that this thing went from 50,000 feet above sea level to 50
*  in a second.
*  They have this thing moving at speeds on video where you see it move on video that would turn
*  anybody inside it into jello.
*  Yep.
*  So it's whatever the fuck this is it's doing something that we didn't think human beings
*  could do.
*  Right so you have three different ways of verifying that there's something there you
*  have the radar you have video you have eyewitness testimony you have this thing flying to the cat
*  point where they were initially supposed to when they were doing their training mission
*  they were supposed to meet.
*  Yep.
*  There's a lot of weird shit with that.
*  Yep.
*  But.
*  Do you think they could fake that.
*  Yeah I mean I do think you could fake it because you just have multiple attack vectors.
*  So how would you fake a visual sighting from trained fighter jet pilots over the ocean.
*  A projection.
*  A projection.
*  And where would the projector be.
*  I don't know could be could be coming from space could be from an aircraft that's flying
*  too high to see.
*  I don't know.
*  But how would you do that what technology would enable you to make something.
*  I mean they even had a disturbance of the ocean floor or of the ocean surface rather.
*  So I'm not an expert in these technologies.
*  I'm not claiming that I could do it.
*  But what I'm saying is a you have a huge amount of classified technology.
*  Just imagine for a second how useful it would be to be able to convince your enemy that you had
*  aircraft in its airspace that they were able to exceed limits whatever.
*  So do you think we've worked on the ability to fool an enemy into believing that we have
*  capacities that we don't have.
*  Of course.
*  So given that those programs are essentially certain to exist do you think anybody's ever
*  going to have the idea that actually in this case it would be useful if some you know
*  unassailable authorities were to have undeniable experiences that suggest X Y or Z.
*  Somebody's going to come up with that idea.
*  So this would explain why these things are able to stay stationary in 120 knot winds
*  because they're not affected by physical reality.
*  Yeah.
*  They're just images.
*  I mean I know you have.
*  There are incredibly good magicians who will do stuff in front of you that you know you
*  don't walk out of there thinking the laws of physics have been broken because you understand
*  that magic is a genre where you walk in and you agree to suspend your disbelief enough to look
*  through your eyes and register something as if it's violated a law of physics.
*  But we all know it's magic.
*  Right.
*  David Blaine.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  An illusion.
*  Yeah.
*  Now imagine that you had teams working on illusions who were going to do so in a context
*  that you would have no concept that that's what had happened because you're so used to
*  trusting what your eyes perceive what your ears hear all of those things.
*  So all I'm saying is the evidence that these things exist always hovers in the realm where
*  a ruthless whatever could have faked it.
*  Right.
*  Whether that has to do with an MK ultra intervention where somebody's been given drugs
*  they don't know they've been given and they've been shown things that they are more open to
*  because they were in a state in which they were in induced openness.
*  That's a possibility or a mixture of things you see something you've been brought into a state of
*  openness you accept it more than you think you have because you don't know that anybody
*  tinkered with your wiring.
*  I just am waiting to see a piece of evidence that really makes me go huh.
*  I don't think we could have done that.
*  Have you seen any Gary Nolan stuff on the metallurgy on the different samples they've
*  collected from these supposed down crafts that defy our understanding of how to create
*  alloys and so expensive it would be to craft these things.
*  Let me ask you a question.
*  You've got alloys that are beyond known human technology and you've got discussion of alloys
*  that are beyond human technology.
*  Which is it?
*  Well it's certainly discussions.
*  That's the problem.
*  Right.
*  I mean I don't know who see if you could find anything on Gary Nolan's samples.
*  So Diana Pasolko who'd been on the podcast before she she had done some excavating of
*  these areas where they purport that these things had crashed and they could still find pieces
*  which made me a little skeptical as soon as I see you still find you didn't pick them all up.
*  Why wouldn't they send someone out there to pick everything up?
*  Why would you sift?
*  You would take truckloads and you would sift.
*  You would get every single scrap of that stuff.
*  But if I wanted someone to believe that a craft was there I'd leave a bunch of
*  bullshit out in the field.
*  I'd blindfold them like they did.
*  I'd take them out to the spot.
*  This is the spot.
*  Look around.
*  Oh look you found a piece.
*  Like how do you not know where all the fucking pieces are?
*  If this thing crashed 30 years ago why didn't you go over this place with a fine tooth comb?
*  People do that for arrowheads.
*  Why would you not do that for alien craft metal?
*  Of course you would.
*  Yeah also there's the other problem.
*  It's like why are these things crashing?
*  Right exactly.
*  They're so fucking good they can get here from another dimension.
*  They're partying they got here and they just they don't know they're.
*  They get a hold of some fucking Jack Daniels next thing they know they're crashed in the sand.
*  They're having a good time in America.
*  It's also that's a big problem too.
*  A lot of these sightings are in America.
*  If you look at the chart.
*  Their sightings overseas for sure.
*  They happen all over the world.
*  Look we.
*  Undoubtedly but they have a lot more here.
*  We have an alien problem across many different dimensions.
*  Yeah we do.
*  We go we have multiple alien problems.
*  Yeah we have multiple.
*  That's another thing that they're gaslighting people on.
*  The idea that they would let people come over here so they would vote.
*  Of course they would.
*  That's a great way to like get voters.
*  So these are these pieces that Gary Nolan claims to have had.
*  And what does it say about these pieces.
*  I could only find in the video I was trying to find pictures.
*  U.S. Explosion.
*  Okay so this is from how do you say that Uba Tuba.
*  Uba Tuba Brazil.
*  So this is a different it might be a different pronunciation in Portuguese.
*  But this is a different crash than the Virginia one.
*  So there's been multiple sightings and things happen in Brazil apparently.
*  Brazil also has a little bit of an alien problem.
*  Oh yeah a little little one.
*  But the Virginia one is wild.
*  That's the most wild one.
*  Yeah but those those fragments there appeared from where I'm sitting to look like they were
*  made of pixels.
*  Let me say that again.
*  That could just be a low resolution photograph.
*  No no I'm kidding with you.
*  I'm just saying we're looking at that thing as if we know that it's a fragment of metal
*  and we're being told that it has properties that are unfamiliar.
*  But what we have the evidence you and I have is pixels.
*  Right sure we're not there.
*  We don't get to see these things.
*  Also even if you gave it to me.
*  How's that going to help me?
*  I have no idea.
*  Yeah I don't know what that is.
*  Even if you gave me the microscopes to look at it I'm like what am I seeing.
*  Right.
*  I'm seeing layers.
*  Is that what this is?
*  Right.
*  How'd they do this?
*  Right so that's why look you know I want a team of honest biologists to look at some space
*  biology that would settle this immediately.
*  Yeah immediately.
*  Immediately.
*  Yeah like if there really is a body.
*  Just one.
*  Well everyone says there's frozen bodies somewhere.
*  Just one.
*  That's all that we can settle this tomorrow.
*  Let some people in.
*  Okay here it is alleged extraterrestrial metal from the bottom of a wedge-shaped craft
*  in the late 1940s made of 26 alternating layers one to four microns dark bismuth and
*  100 to 200 microns silver magnesium zinc alloy each of six pieces received from US Army source
*  were formed with a curvature that tapered.
*  Wow that is incredibly compelling metallurgical narrative.
*  If it's true.
*  Transmitted by pixels.
*  Right that's the problem.
*  Yeah that's the problem.
*  Also the late 1940s how many of these fucking things crashed?
*  Oh it's happening all the time.
*  That's the weird thing right?
*  Like think of how many corvettes there are.
*  Yeah.
*  You don't find a whole lot of them like on the side of the road crashed.
*  It's not a common thing.
*  Nobody's finding corvettes in the desert.
*  Look we found a corvette.
*  There's so many corvettes.
*  There's millions of them.
*  Right and yet most of them make it from A to B.
*  But these fucking UFOs they're so smart they can come here from other planets and they just
*  boom.
*  Well maybe we're not on their map and so they're like.
*  Or maybe the only people that are the only intelligent life outside of this planet that's
*  willing to do it they're like Australian outback people.
*  They're like those wild dudes who go overlanding.
*  Australia has a big overlanding culture where they build up these vehicles and they take
*  them off into the bush and they live off of them.
*  My friend Adam Green Tree does that.
*  These people are wild.
*  Australians are wild folk.
*  So maybe they're like the Australians of space.
*  Overlanding and it doesn't always work out.
*  Overlanding.
*  They're these nuts that like you know there's people that go out in the desert for 30 days
*  and they have enough food and water and they have a solar thing on the top of their rig
*  and that's it charges their cell phone and they have you know jerry cans of petrol so
*  they can keep going.
*  Well I kind of dig this.
*  Look that's fine.
*  If if if it were possible to traverse vast empty spaces and go to places that were known
*  to have life I'd be all about that.
*  But it would only be the real hardcore adventures that would take that chance.
*  And maybe those people are nuts.
*  Maybe those alien people are nuts just like the human people are nuts that do that kind
*  of stuff.
*  Right.
*  They like to get into trouble winch themselves out and wild people.
*  Yeah.
*  They got winches on their spaceship.
*  Exactly.
*  Well you got to also think here's here's another problem with the idea of them being biological.
*  It's far more effective to send things that are non-biological into space like what we're
*  doing on Mars.
*  We we don't have a base on Mars allegedly but there's a lot of nutty people that believe
*  we do.
*  But they do certainly have some robots that are on Mars gathering data and they're doing
*  it right now.
*  And so you don't have to worry about radiation all the things that kill people make people
*  sad.
*  If we lose one of those rovers who gives a fuck.
*  Make another rover ship it out there fly it.
*  Nobody cares if you lose 50 people if you take 50 people and they die on your Mars trip
*  you're going to have Congress is going to be meeting about it.
*  What are we doing?
*  Why are we killing people?
*  Let's not do that.
*  And so as time goes on and as technology improves and as sentient artificial intelligence
*  becomes a better option for sending some intelligent robot to gather data.
*  Why would why would anybody go through space as a living creature?
*  It seems stupid.
*  Yeah I mean I agree.
*  On the other hand I probably.
*  You know why why do I want to go to the Amazon right.
*  I can I can see.
*  But you can go to the Amazon.
*  That's the thing humans live in the Amazon.
*  True humans don't live on Mars.
*  It's way simpler to send a robot to Mars.
*  Why would we go to Mars?
*  Yeah yeah there is a good reason to go to Mars and the good reason to go to Mars is.
*  We're in jeopardy here and.
*  I don't think Mars is in any way a long term plan for survival of people but there are.
*  Processes unfolding here in our solar system that put us in jeopardy potentially here on
*  Earth and having just at least an outpost of people somewhere else would not be a bad
*  hedge against that so I think I think we're not close enough but.
*  Right but it's it's definitely a potential reality and if it was possible it would be
*  a good move if you wanted to hedge your bets.
*  Yep and we should hedge our bets.
*  Elon's position on this yeah you know that we're in danger of the human race going extinct
*  from a variety of different things not even our own fault it could be a bunch of different
*  things asteroid impacts super volcanoes a lot of stuff can happen right here that kills us all.
*  Space weather oh yeah fucking some supernova too close sorry everything's cooked.
*  Micronova which is actually a viable hypothesis apparently this is something that can happen it
*  doesn't necessarily destroy the star you can have a burst of radiation that radically alters
*  things down here oh fun yeah and maybe that's what happened to Mars which is also part of
*  the problem because Mars at one time had an atmosphere Mars at one time had liquid water
*  we don't really know what happened yeah no agreed Mars is probably a little closer to the sun at
*  one point in time in the past it turns out that our solar system is dynamic and dangerous in a
*  way that we don't really know because our study is too has has happened in a period of calm.
*  And we're really looking at a very brief amount of time that we can measure in terms of a human
*  experience it's so brief in terms of what we know about what human beings have experienced and then
*  we have to go back to like core samples you have to go back to oh it appears that there was earth
*  one and earth one was hit by another planet that's how we get the moon and then the moon
*  the moon's crazy yeah it what a crazy thing that this thing stabilizes us it's in the exact same
*  right position the exact right size to make sure that we can exist as we exist right now it's
*  like somebody put it there it's a beautiful thing it's a beautiful thing but it's it's kind of kooky
*  it's almost like someone put it there it's very convenient yeah yeah i mean and of course there's
*  an anthropic principle in play here as well because the question is are we here because we do have
*  a moon to play the exact right role you know this planet has a lot a lot going for it and one way
*  to think about that is wow that can't be that's no accident or no we're here to talk about it
*  because those accidents happen to line up here right or yeah it's odd but that's also why there's
*  not life everywhere right and this does happen and when it does happen then you get some life
*  but until it happens and the variety of temperature changes over the course of the seasons is just too
*  vast for what we understand as biological life to survive but then or at least intelligent
*  right see it's not just biological it has to be intelligent it has to be able to manipulate its
*  environment it has to be able to record the previous thoughts and history develop language
*  and it's really tough to do that if you're in an environment and you've adapted to an
*  environment that can vary by 300 degrees right no you're exactly right that the number of things
*  that have to stack up before you get to the point that you're pondering why you're here
*  is many you have to have food you have to have food you have to have your feet up and go why are
*  we here yeah and you have to not be going routinely extinct because they suddenly go haywire
*  exactly this is why this kind of thought emerges once people sort of settle down
*  yep get some food start herding some cattle and go hey stars are kind of crazy yeah you ever looked
*  up instead everybody's just looking in the bushes for what's going to kill them what's going to eat
*  me you know it's funny i've spent a lot of time watching animals they don't look at the sky oh
*  that's interesting it is interesting that is very interesting that's very interesting yeah i mean i'm
*  you know i get it it's not productive until you get pretty deep into thinking about you know
*  abstract things as a way of finding what you're not doing right well we look outward and we look
*  inward which is really like next level right like we look look at microscopes go what is
*  going on here right we're all filled with bacteria this is this whole thing's nuts like we're not
*  even an individual right we're an ecosystem we're individual ecosystems and the healthier your
*  ecosystem is the healthier you are as an individual because you're not really an individual
*  wow if we look so this this is something heather and i talk about frequently is that we have more
*  or less an epidemic of people who are maybe smart but they don't know the difference between a
*  complex system and a complicated one and so they take their complicated system thinking into
*  what is the difference whether it's predictable so for example your computer or your phone
*  you know it's beyond your comprehension or my comprehension but it is well understood
*  how it works there's nothing mysterious about the outputs right it's a it's a it's a system that all
*  of the the functionality of is is well understood but a biological creature isn't anything like this
*  and so when you intervene you know when they give you a drug and they think they know what it's going
*  to do they're intervening in a system in which things are connected in ways that they've not yet
*  discovered and they can't anticipate the cascading effects so you know we keep getting upended by the
*  sense of like you know oh this thing is wrong with you here's a biochemical intervention that
*  will adjust one parameter and put you back into health no almost never true right it is occasionally
*  true if somebody is quite sick that you can push them back in the direction of homeostasis you can
*  rescue them but the idea of improving health with an intervention is almost always the wrong approach
*  right you should be restoring the environment in which the body knows how to take care of itself
*  because it is a complex system given the right inputs given the right parameters it has all of
*  the processes necessary to keep it functioning but if you think you're going to improve it by
*  intervening you're almost certain to do harm hmm but what about medication for people that have
*  like type 1 diabetes right but the question is why do you have type 1 diabetes but it's a genetic
*  thing yeah but is it a you think our ancestors were walking around with type 1 diabetes they might have
*  and just died off well but then you would have a very low rate of that gene so our ancestors right
*  so the question is so you think there's an environmental reason for type 1 diabetes i think
*  there is a massive disruption in all of the environments that we pass through in life that
*  is causing a mismatch between what we are but we're basically perpetual fishes out of water
*  and that process is making us unhealthy in every single regard heather and i call this hyper
*  novelty and in fact it's not even that we're just out of our environment in which we can be healthy
*  but the rate of change is so high that even to the extent that we are highly adaptable we can't adapt
*  fast enough to uh to keep up it's it's a it's a pathology and the flip side of this is if you
*  did recognize exactly where you started that you are actually a system that is complex beyond even
*  the sense that you're an organism i mean you're you're multiple organisms at multiple different
*  levels every single cell in your body is being fueled by mitochondria that started out at a
*  different place on the evolutionary tree and got taken inside of cells to become powerhouses that's
*  a symbiosis so you are a symbiosis you know in each of your cells and even crazier your psychology
*  your mentality affects your physical health profoundly profoundly so the way you think
*  about things the joy you have in your life the happiness that you encounter has an enormous
*  effect on your biology 100 yes which is just madness if you are so the reductionist view of
*  just give them a shot of this and a pill of that like well there's a lot more going on here right
*  now our whole medical uh standpoint is fundamentally flawed and i'm really hoping that we will take the
*  lesson of covid seriously and we will recognize in my opinion allopathic medicine standard western
*  medicine is living on a the gains of a tiny number of subfields right the fact that a surgeon
*  can put you back together after a car accident that's something that we all know we want there
*  for us if we need it right that surgeon's capacity to do that is a predicated on the ability the
*  ability of the body to repair itself right a surgeon can cut you open and go you know take out
*  your spleen but that surgeon is depending on the fact that your body knows how to heal the damage
*  right you can't go up to a car and you know slice it open and pull out the alternator and put it
*  another one and have a car back together again right it doesn't work like that so anyway there
*  are a few things in medicine that are transcendently awesome like the ability of a surgeon to fix you
*  and the ability of an emergency room physician to stabilize you where your body is you know
*  spiraling out of control but those things result in a sense of the godlike powers of medicine
*  and most of the time medicine is in danger of hurting you if it's not of the mindset that we
*  should be minimizing intervention we should be figuring out what the root cause of the pathology
*  is if we have to intervene which it should be a temporary intervention that pushes you back to the
*  place where your body knows what to do and then we should take our hands off which is of course not
*  profitable right the problem is we want you to be hooked on a medication because then we can prescribe
*  that to everybody and then you have the sacra family right the the fact is this process health
*  is far too important to be managed by market forces left to their own devices
*  that's a good point and the problem is right now it is and so we have to figure out how to regain
*  control of that 100 and so i'm hoping that medicine having just gotten its comeuppance during
*  covid where you know almost every doctor ended up poisoning their patients with advice that turned
*  out to be you know and themselves and themselves yeah which is more important because those doctors
*  believed it they they thought that it was true i was just talking to a doctor recently that regretted
*  taking it and they they really believed yeah believed they believed they were telling people
*  what to do and now they're injured and you know yeah and then they have this practice where they
*  told people this is what you should do and then a bunch of people did it and they got all fucked up
*  and now they're in a situation where it's not just that they got fucked up but like how much time
*  they have left like how many of these people are going to drop dead over the next five ten years
*  yeah because it's not just one it's not just two there's probably going to be a bunch there's a
*  bunch of people out there with like real myocarditis there's a bunch of people out there that have blood
*  clots the the d dimer there's this doctor on twitter the other day was talking about how
*  it's very rare that he uses an d dimer test on unvaccinated patients and finds blood clots
*  but he finds a ton of them on vaccinated patients yeah and some of them are micro blood clots some
*  of them are some of them are significant but that they find quite a few yeah there was a paper
*  recently i haven't delved deeply into it but that just says you know that the spike protein which is
*  obviously produced by the shots is interacting with fibrin which is a clot producing protein
*  so it's not surprising that it's having these cascading effects but okay so you had all these
*  doctors who gave terrible advice to patients they assured them not only that this was the right
*  thing to do but that it was safe which they should have known better because it couldn't possibly have
*  been and there's no there's no course taught in medical school about you know repentance
*  how do these people repent for what they did so that they learn the lesson and it can't happen
*  again and the fact is the whole system is rigged around pharma and they can't there's so many people
*  out there that are still all in i've found i've found some lady in my timeline i don't follow her
*  but she was talking about how disturbing it is to her that children are not being vaccinated and that
*  covid is killing kids and the reports that she has of child death and she was talking about how
*  she wears a mask everywhere and then there's all these people in the comments that are commenting
*  on that i only go to places when i know there's going to be minimal amounts of people i always
*  wear a mask and they were all like it was some weird echo chamber where they were all terrified
*  still of what is now like a cold well i don't i will resist portraying it as a cold because i do think
*  that ain't where we are it's not a cold to you right when you got it it was rough
*  i got something that was pretty rough but let's put that aside for a second let's say that this
*  is not a very severe disease and by the way i will just tell you uh at the risk of uh
*  opening old controversies it took me a long time to understand that ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine
*  they have broad applicability across rna viruses and many of the things that make us sick are
*  rna viruses right so there is a strong argument to be made that in a world where we are now being
*  exposed to all of these rna viruses that acting quickly and taking those things is a reasonable
*  thing to do now hydroxychloroquine may have more toxicity than ivermectin in fact it does
*  but ivermectin has such a low toxicity that from the point of view of not doing the damage to the
*  body that comes from being sick with these pathological agents simply being reflexive
*  about taking the stuff quickly is sensible and of course if what i just said is correct you would
*  expect pharma to look anywhere but there because they can't patent the stuff right did you see um
*  chris cuomo on patrick beth david's show admit that he's taking ivermectin now uh i heard about
*  it i didn't see it he admitted it he admitted his doctor azam on ivermectin for long covet and he
*  kept distinguishing the difference between long covet and vaccine injuries like he said had some
*  sort of a vaccine injury then he was talking about how ivermectin is not good for cove but it's good
*  for long covet and like what is long covet long covet it's not even a thing like stop saying that
*  like you're fucked up because either of covet or you're fucked up because of the vaccine one of
*  those two things happen where you got damaged calling it long covet is weird because it's like
*  saying you're still sick from covet that's not really what happened okay if you get pneumonia
*  and you get lung damage you don't don't have a long long pneumonia right you just have no you
*  had damage to your lungs it's not long covet so you're either taking ivermectin because your
*  doctor said like what benefit would ivermectin have on long covet like what is what does that mean
*  well or vaccine injuries it has a benefit for vaccine injuries we can just say that empirically
*  the people who have become successful at treating these things tell us this which vaccine injuries
*  covet but which ones which specific vaccine injuries you mean what are the symptoms yeah what
*  things like brain fog fatigue neuropathy these things and i actually have several friends who
*  report that they were suffering badly i sent him to pierre he treated them ivermectin was core to
*  the treatment and uh they report i don't want to say miraculous but spectacular recovery pierre by
*  pierre you're talking about dr pierre corey yep um who did he lose his license or something yeah
*  i believe so or it's in process but they are punishing him for uh for talking about a beneficial
*  medicine there happens to not be patentable punishing him for doing his job wild yeah that's
*  wild it's crazy that's crazy yeah that's diabolical really it is diabolical um so what would be the
*  mechanism as to which ivermectin would help these people i don't know it has a number of different
*  mechanisms it's certainly an anti-inflammatory you know there's only so far that explanation
*  will take you but uh but it i don't know i can't answer that question i can say it really doesn't
*  much matter if you're sick and it makes you better that's what you want right you know what our
*  understanding of how many medicines work but isn't it bizarre when people that have been vaccinated
*  not once but multiple times and had side effects from the vaccine that they'll report openly we'll
*  talk about it and say it's long covid oh while they're still suffering it's almost like they
*  alleviate themselves from any of the responsibility of making a terrible choice i think they're also
*  being fed this story right um and we've seen that in multiple places so for example you remember
*  these long debates about well okay yes the mrna shots do cause a certain amount of myocarditis
*  but not nearly as much as covid and it goes away quick there was the other thing they kept saying
*  it's temporary yeah which is nonsense and it turns out now that the myocarditis appears to have been
*  vaccine induced myocarditis that was being just like everything else happened with covid they
*  it was a uh i don't want to say an accounting error it was cynical they shoved things into the
*  wrong category right and they also pushed out a narrative that you get more myocarditis from the
*  from the virus rather than you do from the vaccine right and apparently you don't get it from the
*  virus yeah well what you do is get you get hydroponin levels right and um i see mahalta
*  yeah explained all this is that when you test for that you can assume if a person is suffering from
*  a viral infection that they will have high troponin levels but it doesn't mean they have
*  myocarditis right so you're calling it myocarditis without actually doing an mri on the heart
*  right and as i've pointed out in many different places myocarditis is kind of a red herring anyway
*  because what it means is inflammation and inflammation is there for a reason there's
*  an underlying pathology and so the fact that we can detect that you have myocarditis means well
*  okay something's up with your heart what is it and the vaccines create damage in the heart
*  they create damage because they get taken up by heart cells those heart cells produce
*  explain the whole thing with lipid nanoparticles so people understand why they cause damage so the
*  way these shots were supposed to work is you have an mrna transcript that is loaded into lipid
*  nanoparticle the lipid nanoparticles are injected we were told that they stayed in the deltoid
*  where they are injected they do not they circulate in the blood and lymph lipid nanoparticle and this
*  is proven yeah lipid nanoparticle lipid means fat you may remember from high school chemistry
*  that like dissolves likes of fats dissolve other fats so you've got this thing encased in fat any
*  cell it encounters is covered in fat so it gets taken up by cells haphazardly around the body
*  those cells take the message the mrna transcript into the cytoplasm they translate it into protein
*  and that protein gets exported to the surface of the cell this is how the manufacturer wants
*  it to work now if it happened in your arm okay but if it happens in your heart well anywhere it
*  happens it will trigger your immune system to spot this antigen that it doesn't recognize
*  and t cells will come in and kill the cells that are making this foreign protein because
*  in natural circumstances anytime a cell makes a foreign protein it has the signature of a
*  virally infected cell a cell is producing self antigens and foreign antigens that's a virally
*  infected cell no matter what place in the body it exists the right thing to do is to destroy it
*  so the immune system comes in t cells destroy that cell and that leaves you with a wound right you've
*  lost cells that were doing something most of the tissues of the body can tolerate a certain amount
*  of that but in your heart you can't tolerate very much because the heart has an extremely
*  low capacity to repair itself it scars instead and it takes time to scar you have a wound until
*  it scars over so those wounds are vulnerabilities if you're an athlete and you've got a wound in
*  your heart that you don't know about you could easily die because you have a weakened wall in
*  the chambers of your heart and something breaches at the point that your blood pressure is high in
*  the middle of some activity so my point is when we say myocarditis we are effectively accepting
*  a placeholder for there's an underlying pathology that we haven't found and that pathology can be
*  damaged to the heart which is very serious inherently it compromises your lifetime capacity
*  for your heart to function and in the short term it creates a substantial vulnerability to
*  uh cardiac incidents and so these injections which were supposed to stay local is it because
*  that they didn't aspirate that they get into blood vessels like what is what is the reason why it gets
*  through the entire system well the aspiration issue i believe is a contributor but i don't think it is
*  the determinant so in the case that just to explain what people what you're getting at
*  when you inject somebody pulling back on the plunger in the syringe allows you to see whether
*  or not you have accidentally landed inside a vein if you pull back and you see blood the tip of the
*  needle is at least partially in a vein and if you inject there it doesn't go into the spaces between
*  the cells in your muscle it goes into your circulation that's a bad thing if you plunge
*  the needle in you pull back on the syringe and on the plunger and you see blood then you should
*  plunge in further so that you're no longer in that blood vessel but we never saw that in fact
*  people were specifically told not to do it and the rationale was they did not want to create
*  vaccine hesitancy by leaving the needle in the arm any longer than necessary so they did end up
*  doing a certain percentage of intravenous accidental intravenous injections and that means
*  that a globule of this stuff went immediately into the circulation which meant that if it went to your
*  heart and got picked up there it might not just be a small number of cells it might be a large
*  number of cells so that was a completely unnecessary level of harm aspirating the
*  needle was the right thing to do and they should have done it and they didn't and who knows how
*  many people have died because they got a big dose intravenously where it was supposed to be
*  intermuscular and that seems so straightforward that i can't imagine that they were showing
*  people doing it any other way on television yeah even when they did the president remember
*  when they injected him on television they stuck it right in there well there's a question about
*  what they injected him with but um yes they whatever happened on television are you suggesting that
*  that was deception they didn't give him this life-saving vaccine well here's the problem
*  i don't know how dumb these people are it seems to me let's just let's just play this out
*  uh with uh sort of standard parameters
*  inoculations cause a certain number of acute adverse reactions
*  these people wanted everyone injected they didn't want us talking about injuries that were real
*  right they they they went out of their way to make sure that nothing caused anybody to have
*  the sense that there was some problem with them do we really think they rolled the dice injecting
*  an old man with an active shot on tv like i don't think so i suggested it back then and i got called
*  a kook but i was talking about there was a lot of people that were talking about um being injured
*  and they were getting attacked like remember when they were going after um eric clapton yeah
*  remember that one oh yeah that was horrific vicious i mean full bore attacks on eric clapton
*  i mean calling him the most hurtful words an anti-vaxxer and terror he's always been a terrible
*  person and like what the fuck are you talking about yeah the the gas lighting of the injured is
*  insane insane it's especially you've asked people to do something there's always adverse events
*  how is it that somebody who suffers an adverse event is not entitled to our compassion i don't
*  understand yeah how how you would turn vicious in that case and how can you rationalize excuse
*  me how can you rationalize continuing to have these companies exempt oh you can't it doesn't make any
*  sense yeah especially if they're that profitable because we know that if they're profitable they're
*  going to keep selling stuff yeah well let me put it to you this way um i think it makes sense
*  to establish a policy that i will not accept any medical product for which the manufacturer
*  is not liable if it goes wrong and that's not medical advice that's legal advice yeah
*  yeah yeah because there's just too much room for fuckery and profit when when they know that
*  something is profitable and they know they can get away with it because they don't have any liability
*  at all they're gonna fuck with you they're gonna gaslight you they always have because you have two
*  different types of people right they're involved in any kind of medication you have the scientists
*  and the clinicians that develop these things and create these things and then you've got the money
*  people and the money people they're not even scientists what those people are interested in
*  is making the most amount of money for their company in fact they have a responsibility to
*  their shareholders right to make a ton of money absolutely make more money every year so if they
*  know that they can get it's their their job as ceo to push that shit through use it what why do
*  you have all those connections and all those relationships if you don't utilize them to help
*  our company isn't that why you get a fucking gigantic salary every year as a ceo of a
*  pharmaceutical drug company and don't you understand the relationship that we have with the fda and the
*  cdc has been we have cultivated this this relationship forever so we have a revolving door
*  to make it nice and easy so the people that are in charge of regulation they get a nice sweet job
*  nice sweet golden we got it locked in we got it locked up let's sell the shit sell it well the fact
*  is if you understand how the market is supposed to do its magic this doesn't work even in principle
*  just simple evolutionary dynamics guarantee that corporations that are not responsible for the harm
*  that they do will start making a profit by doing harm right they will be out competed by other
*  corporations who do if they don't so it is guaranteed that they will move in that direction
*  which is why i say you shouldn't take any product produced by an entity that is not liable for the
*  harm that it does to you it just doesn't make any any sense yeah anything anything across the board
*  yeah yeah it's just bizarre that we let that slip through because they had decided at one point in
*  time that vaccines create so many problems there's no way they could sell these and be profitable and
*  have legal responsibility and our government was like all right all right yeah i had no
*  responsibility i don't think most people know that little fact that you just mentioned that in fact
*  they were granted immunity from liability because they said it was impossible to make safe vaccines
*  yeah explain when this happened and how it happened to people so they understand that this is
*  this is an issue that came up because of problems from vaccines yeah i believe it happened in the
*  reagan administration that they approached that they they were reluctant to make vaccines the
*  reagan administration wanted them to ratchet up production and they said we can't it can't be done
*  safely and they were granted this immunity and the system the various system was set up and a
*  special court was set up to adjudicate cases and a tremendous amount of evil has flown from that
*  fateful decision including the proliferation of the childhood vaccine schedule yes which is right
*  now pretty fucking insane it's there's so many of them they give them to them so quickly like from
*  the moment they're born they want they want to bang them up with vaccines and it's incredibly
*  profitable and people who are kind people who are intelligent people would never imagine there are
*  human beings that are willing to profit off of injecting babies with things that may very well
*  fuck them up for the rest of their life they're like there's no way no one's that evil right it's
*  hard to imagine and then when you start looking into the evidence it's like oh my goodness oh
*  well you look in just the history of vaccines themselves you read turtles all the way down or
*  dissolving illusions just like wait wait wait wait wait right what what happened because all our lives
*  vaccines are the most important invention vaccines saved countless millions of lives
*  vaccines the way we can be safe today vaccines are the so that was one of the dirtiest tricks
*  about this mrna technology that they piggybacked on an old word that already had
*  pass it already had hall pass yep yeah it's crazy i mean you know heather and i wrote into our book
*  in 2020 that vaccines were one of the three greatest medical inventions in history you know
*  the other two being surgery and antibiotics and i still still believe that in principle there is
*  something potentially very medically valuable there but in practice the way we produce these
*  things the way we manufacture them the way the technology on which they are based has been
*  modified right the the idea that we're going to produce a vaccine that is adjuvant based and
*  we're not going to tell you that we're going to hyper activate your immune system to get a weak
*  shot to function and that that means that you're going to be in danger of creating a sensitivity to
*  anything you encounter or eat during that period like how are we not discussing that right i mean
*  again in 1919 in 2020 i was an enthusiast for this technology now i'm an enthusiast for what it says
*  in the textbook about what this might be able to do but i'm terrified of how it's actually being
*  deployed and i also now recognize i believe i have a vaccine injury my allergy to wheat
*  the only way it adds up is probably a flu shot caused me to become hypersensitive to something
*  that was exposed to my immune system of course wheats and everything so you know it's ever
*  present my children my my older son has an allergy to dairy a profound one i think that's
*  a vaccine injury frankly i don't know what percentage you know i have a friend who has an
*  allergy profound allergy to mold that's driven her from two homes right but wait a minute because
*  isn't allergies have always existed and they existed before even vaccines um no no i mean i'm
*  not going to say there weren't any there's nothing in the literature about vaccine or about allergies
*  before vaccines the proliferation of allergy again i don't want to say there wasn't any
*  but in many of these cases things like alzheimer's disease we of course think oh these things are
*  long-standing they've been there maybe there's been an increase in the amount but the degree
*  to which many of these pathologies including autism frankly turns out to be something that erupts
*  out of nowhere suggesting a novel environmental cause of some kind right is profound and mostly
*  we don't know that because we don't do the legwork to go back and look at well where does this first
*  show up right we think polio has always been with us no that's not true right so we have a pattern
*  that we in the public are not aware of pathologies that are widespread that showed up out of nowhere
*  like obesity and that suggests an environmental cause we should become fascinated by what that
*  cause might be because people are being every new generation has people being maimed by these
*  pathologies and if you can discover what the pathology is and you can eliminate the factor
*  you know how much misery do you erase how much economic growth do you create right these are
*  powerful ways in which we could improve our well-being and we just simply don't do it because
*  all of us carry the vague notion that these things are long-standing but if you think about it
*  do you see animals in the wild being allergic in their environment no sometimes dogs are but
*  dogs get vaccinated the high heaven yes they do right and so anytime you see that pattern where
*  it's like yes wild animals don't have that pathology but domestic animals and people do
*  that's telling you something right right because we share an environment have you seen that they're
*  gonna they're calling for a ceasefire in gaza so that they can vaccinate for polio yes i have seen
*  that and uh what yeah you're gonna you're gonna not blow people up temporarily so they can keep
*  them from a disease which do you know the statistics of um like when people get polio
*  how much of polio is asymptomatic do you know the statistics i don't know the statistics i will tell
*  you i read a jaw-dropping book i mean and this is i keep i keep having this experience where there
*  are various stories that we all carry around that tell us something about uh the world we're living
*  in what and what to be afraid of so for example spanish flu right much of our fear of pandemics
*  is based on the idea that spanish spanish flu erupted out of nowhere it killed young healthy
*  people and you know what it's not that long ago could happen again blah blah blah
*  turns out that story isn't what we all think it is there are two things about that story which
*  are not commonly known one is there was a enthusiasm for prescribing aspirin for people
*  who came in with flu symptoms and they were prescribed aspirin in doses that are now known
*  to be deadly okay so a lot of people drowned basically their lungs filled with liquid
*  because they were overdosed on aspirin that's one thing the other thing is bacterial pneumonia
*  which followed on the viral infection bacterial pneumonia that we can now easily treat with
*  antibiotics yes exactly and so the question is you know would spanish flu if it emerged tomorrow
*  because a pandemic that mattered no it wouldn't but we all think oh goodness it can happen because
*  spanish flu proves it right same thing happened with my understanding of polio i was going to
*  give you the number it's 95 to 99 percent asymptomatic is asymptomatic asymptomatic of
*  polio yeah but you know that do you know why why because i actually know i think i know why based on
*  the the book the moth in the iron lung
*  there is a virus involved in polio that virus is not normally serious it's a gut virus
*  right it causes slight gut pathology goes away of its own accord what appears to have happened
*  that caused polio to be a terrifying debilitating disease is metal toxicity
*  right so polio turns out has some weird quirks right it affects the nerves in the front of the
*  spinal cord but not the back of the spinal cord and it affects children and not adults
*  and the argument that is made in the moth in the iron lung i think quite compellingly
*  is that what's happening is the metals are causing that that bacterium to or the virus to leak out
*  of the gut and it can grow in neurological tissue and in the child the gut is sitting right in front
*  of the spinal cord and so it is affecting the motor neurons but not the sensory neurons which
*  are on the back because of the physical proximity of the gut to the spinal cord and that as you grow
*  those things separate and so the susceptibility disappears but it's the metal toxicity that is
*  taking a non-serious pathogen and causing it to be serious which makes for a very confusing story
*  because you actually do have a pathogen and you can actually prevent the pathogen with a vaccine
*  but the root cause is the metal toxicity that is causing things to leak out of the gut and touch
*  the spinal cord i had read this thing that was connecting ddt as well yep ddt is connected as
*  well and lots of cases of it in rural areas where people sprayed well actually that's what the
*  the book the moth in the iron lung amazingly tracks the history of this where in fact you had a
*  you had a problem where the moths the silk moths were not robust to predation and so
*  entomologists were looking for something to hybridize the silk moths with that would be
*  resistant to things like jays eating them as caterpillars and this one entomologist
*  had gypsy moths from europe in his possession that he was trying to breed with silk moths a
*  experiment that was doomed to failure but nonetheless one day he had them sitting on his
*  kitchen window and a wind blew and blew them into his garden and he knew he tried to recover them
*  and he couldn't find them all and so he knew that he had a problem he tried to alert people locally
*  hey we've got a local gypsy moth problem which is bad because gypsy moths devastate vegetation
*  and in any case they were unable to control the infestation and of course it spread throughout
*  the east oh my god why didn't that guy torch his field well right if you had if you understood
*  what was going to follow from this that would have been a it would not have been an overreaction
*  right right but nonetheless what you have is something like an epidemic of polio that's not
*  really an epidemic of polio you have an epidemic of gypsy moths that are being sprayed for with
*  these toxic pesticides right it's a crazy crazy story but the the upshot is we all carry around
*  stories like polio is a terrifying disease it debilitated people we have a vaccine that ended
*  that horror therefore blah blah blah blah blah that's not the story the story is we actually have
*  an epidemic of stupidity about industrial toxins and in this case they interface with a story about
*  a vaccine and a pathogen but the story isn't the one we think right it's a very strange set of
*  interactions but once you start digging into these stories and you realize that all of them are you
*  know we've been told some fairy tale that leads us to a conclusion that just isn't right then you
*  have to start rethinking things but of course as you discover these things people decide you're
*  a crank but have you seen in new york city they're spraying pesticide in the sky to kill the mosquitoes
*  that might be carrying the west nile virus is there they're going after west nile virus in new york
*  mosquitoes they're spraying pesticide they're letting people know we will be spraying at 8 p.m.
*  stay inside limit your exposure to the pesticide and they're driving trucks down the street that
*  are just spraying pesticides so we don't learn right and isn't that disease west nile virus
*  isn't that like 80 percent of the people it's almost nothing right and then at the same time
*  we're dealing with a set of restrictions in the northeast over eastern equine encephalitis
*  right and so i've been seeing you find the videos of them spraying that shit in new york city because
*  it's it's very orwellian it's very like how do we not how do we not know to not do this anymore
*  like this seems like a great look they're driving down the street spraying what there's mosquitoes
*  we got to kill them so they're spraying at the back of this fucking truck by the way you're not
*  killing anything you're killing what's on that street what about what's in between the houses
*  what's in the fields what's in the park what's at the lake well they all breed well okay so let's
*  let's do this at full six confirmed cases we need to start spraying one of them was dr fauci right
*  well he was hospitalized brett i know yes um so let's let's look at all the components here one
*  i've seen spraying like that in person before i've seen it in panama in the canal zone now the canal
*  zone is malaria free i don't know what the cost i mean people live in the canal zone
*  americans lived there while the canal was in our possession in large numbers
*  i do think that the spraying kept the anopheles mosquitoes
*  to a low enough number that malaria did not exist in the canal zone what the cost of that was i also
*  can't say my guess is the cost of that was very high but not well measured the idea that we are
*  now a why is it we are dealing with a simultaneous panic over eastern equine encephalitis and west
*  nile virus well that is a very odd coincidence one thing that's true is the last the last panic
*  was over covid and the response to covid was massive vaccination with the mrna shots as you
*  know the mrna shots for anybody who got two or more triggered the production of something called
*  igg4 which i don't know if we've talked about it before but igg4 is the immune system's own message
*  to itself to turn itself down okay why two or more that's just empiric i don't know whether
*  anybody expected this result but when it was pursued that was just the number at which we
*  could detect the presence of igg4 so not with one not with one i'm not saying there wasn't any with
*  one but we don't detect it with one shot and then two produces some effect and the more shots you
*  get the bigger the effect does that explain why disease itself appears to have changed in the last
*  year or two right why are people so sick during the summer right do you remember even five years
*  ago right there were summer colds people remarked on them because it was weird when you got sick
*  during the summer right i got a summer cold but people weren't sick with lots of different things
*  during the summer in general you were you know fine during the summer and then when you you got
*  sick when when it was you know cold out and you were driven indoors and that was just the pattern
*  right so something's going on that people are much more susceptible and it just so happens
*  that we've watched a pattern where people have been multiply injected with something that we know
*  turns their immune system down why are we not asking the question if the reason that we may
*  have a problem with west nile virus and eastern equine encephalitis is the result of a self-inflicted
*  wound right we should at least be asking that question instead we are still recommending that
*  god damn covet shot well and then look at a guy like fauci who was one of the rare few that was
*  hospitalized and he's had six shots according to him yeah i gotta say as soon as we get to fauci i
*  just don't believe anything i don't know i'm agnostic as to whether or not the dude took any
*  shots whether he's i don't know what's going on because there's so much garbage surrounding that
*  guy and what he thinks and what he did that i just can't accept any of it at face value
*  but here's what i don't understand let's let's look at the the eastern equine encephalitis issue
*  they are now considering curfews right they are going to start eroding civil liberties over
*  the presence of this disease one person has died it's only one person yeah if you read up on it
*  turns out the average year there are seven diagnosed cases of this so it's not like this
*  is a disease that never shows up and suddenly there's one case and people are freaking out
*  there's apparently an annual rate of this we have an annual rate that even if it's more
*  this does not suggest the possibility of a massive disease spread and if it did we're
*  still giving people a shot that causes their immune systems to turn down so can we at least
*  stop doing that before we start panicking over new diseases because it sure looks like we are
*  creating vulnerability to new diseases over here recommending mrna shots that people don't need
*  and then we are you know having lockdowns like we're also recommending it to people that already
*  have natural immunity which is the most bizarre thing of course the most bizarre because there's
*  no science that backs that up it doesn't make any sense and yet we're still saying to these people
*  you got to get your boosters this i g4 ig g4 ig g4 what does that stand for ig means immunoglobulin
*  that's synonym for antibody ig g ig g is a major class of antibody there are something like five
*  major classes and then ig g4 is a subclass that turns the immune system down and why does this
*  what what is what is it about the mrna shots that causes this to happen we don't know
*  we just know measurably people who have more of them have this yes and it it's alarming i mean
*  it's alarming for multiple reasons um i wasn't i was really unsure what to think about this
*  when it first occurred to me but the more i think about it the more alarmed i am
*  so
*  covid sars-cov-2 virus that causes covid appears to have emerged from laboratory work that was dual
*  use dual use work means bioweapons research the excuse so it's called dual use because you're
*  only allowed to do bioweapons research if it's also research that might contribute to to public
*  health so the excuse is oh we're working you know what what do they tell us they said well the gain
*  of function research is so that we can create pathogens and learn what to do about them before
*  they find themselves out of nature and we don't know what to do right this is a nonsense story
*  it's not it is it is not coherent to think that by creating some pathogen in a laboratory that
*  you're going to learn something about pathogens that might leap out of nature for one thing
*  pathogens leaping out of nature is a difficult thing for them to do they have to do two tricks
*  and it's not easy they have to infect a person okay some pathogens will do that but then before
*  that person dies or gets better they have to jump from one person to the next very very few are ever
*  going to jump that gap so it's not a big risk and then if you've created a pathogen of your own
*  you're going to learn about what to do about that pathogen but it's not broadly applicable and you
*  can see we had research on coronaviruses being done in the wuhan institute being done in north
*  carolina how much help did it give us what did we learn from that research that protected us
*  from covet and the answer is nothing nothing because it's inconceivable that you would so
*  they're using the excuse of public health to do this weapons research but here's the punchline
*  of the story the vaccines are also the product of bio weapons research because they include the spike
*  protein which was the innovation that made the ancestor of sars-cov-2 into an infectious human
*  pathogen right the addition of a foreign cleavage site to spike protein made this thing capable of
*  infecting and spreading between humans that spike protein was the core of the mrna shots
*  get two or more of those shots now you create igg4 and the more of the shots you have the more
*  you produce but was there any literature that indicated that this was going to have this effect
*  before they rolled out the vaccines or was this just an unfortunate byproduct i am not aware of
*  that literature but notice the following problem that igg4 signal to turn down the immune system
*  is now connected to the presence of spike protein at a bioengineering level it is trivial to add
*  spike protein to something else bio weapons researchers have a problem if you create first
*  of all they have two problems one of them is there aren't that many weaponizable human pathogens
*  right so they're sort of bored with the fact that they've got a small number of these things and
*  they've played around with them and you know they're not happy they need something else so
*  there's also a vast number in nature that you could in principle weaponize but most of them can
*  infect a human so they engage in this you know hocus-pocus stuff where they take stuff that
*  doesn't infect a human and they turn it into something that affects a human and of course
*  the risk that will it will escape is very very large and the risk that we will learn anything
*  useful is very very small but nonetheless they play this game and if they create something that
*  is a frightening weapon that could in principle in their warped minds be used for something useful
*  the question is how can you deliver a biological weapon that harms your enemies without harming
*  your population you have to separate those two populations in some way the obvious way to do it
*  is to inoculate your population so that they have an immunity the enemy population doesn't have an
*  immunity right mind you this is all wildly immoral but if you think like a weapons maker this makes
*  some kind of sense but this is not the only way that's where the i-g-g-4 thing really throws me
*  because what they seem to have in the best case accidentally done is created a vulnerability in
*  the populations that took the mrna shots that does not exist in populations that didn't and anytime
*  a pathogen shows up with spike it is likely to trigger the immune system to stand down
*  right that's something that a weapons maker might dream of doing to its enemy
*  the chinese did not inoculate their population with mrna based shots and they did not inoculate
*  them with spike based shots so what did they use other stuff more standard vaccine stuff antigens
*  delivered i mean not effective but doesn't create this effect as far as we know is that like what
*  the nova vax is no nova vax is another new technology i don't know very much about it but
*  the sinovax is what the chinese used and it was a much more standard apparently not very effective
*  shot but nonetheless the creation of a vulnerability in one population that the other
*  population doesn't have we can imagine that that was an accident let's hope it was an accident but
*  it does appear to be something that they have created and the fact that weapons makers seem to
*  have created this with their diabolical research ought to give us pause so if weapons manufacturers
*  were involved in the creation of a virus what especially a virus like a respiratory virus that
*  could go across the entire population of the planet and did what would be the use of something
*  that only kills old people and overweight people well i'm not saying that it was a bioweapon
*  i don't think it was saying it's bio weapons research that created this virus
*  but not that the virus was actually a bioweapon well look i do not know how crazy these people
*  are and i don't really know who they work for right it is obvious that something beyond what
*  most of us would imagine is true because somehow our dual use researchers were collaborating with
*  chinese military associated researchers that's surprising isn't it right so the wuhan lab was
*  a chinese-based weapons lab bio weapons lab certainly military affiliated but the head
*  of the wuhan institute laboratory in question zhi zheng li was trained by ralph barrack
*  right so this is a partnership on dual use research that doesn't seem to make any sense
*  given what we all think we understand about where the tensions are who are the allies and who are
*  the antagonists on the world stage and also the fact that this was this funding was stopped
*  in 2014 by the obama administration but then fauci restarted it under the trump administration
*  and there's no there's no nor is there there's no specified goal in terms of like what's the
*  positive benefit for society if this research is done there's a huge possibility that it leaks
*  and it's incredibly detrimental which which did but there's also even though they were working
*  on this stuff for so long there was no cure for us for covid for the thing that they created
*  so like if you're going to create something that could potentially you know damage the human race
*  so you're worried about like what would happen if this what would happen if there really was a
*  natural spillover and this thing really did come through a pangolin or whatever the fuck it did
*  and then got into people we need to figure out a way to save people but there's no solution
*  they were working on this stuff forever and they didn't have a solution
*  they didn't have a solution and they didn't allow the one process that would quickly generate a
*  solution to function doctors treating patients based on what walks through their office door
*  right but to my way of thinking they already knew what worked ivermectin worked on sars-1
*  sars-1 is an rna virus this stuff works generally across rna viruses it would have rendered covid
*  you know tragic in the sense that we don't need another human pathogen circulating but totally
*  manageable in almost everybody's case and the way you would use ivermectin is upon initial
*  infection that's it's very quickly you you give it to people yeah so there's a certain point in
*  time where after the infection it's not going to be effective anymore absolutely and how much time
*  is that generally well the amazing thing is even in the studies that claimed that it that they
*  proved it didn't work it does work if you look at the data they collected it reflects that it works
*  even though these experiments were set up to fail they dosed late they under dosed they were
*  done in places where the control group was likely to have ivermectin circulating at a fairly high
*  rate so there's all sorts of tricks that were used but even in those cases it still worked but
*  the answer i would say is at least in the case of ivermectin it's a little different with
*  hydroxychloroquine but with ivermectin the stuff is
*  so low harm that treating immediately is the way to go because you know the difference in its
*  efficacy between day one and day two and day two and day three those jumps are substantial so there's
*  no reason not to give it immediately and i guess the question is why we saw all of the skull duggery
*  around portraying ivermectin as dangerous portraying it as ineffective so we know that
*  they just lied through their teeth we also know that they knew that it was essentially certain to
*  work so why'd they do that and you know there's a a a i don't know how bad the answer is but the
*  answer is at least that they wanted the pandemic the so-called pandemic right they redefined
*  pandemic in order that this would qualify but the so-called pandemic would be
*  significant enough to get everybody to engage in the same kinds of behaviors to accept them right so
*  i don't know the problem we're stuck in the same place we always are which is if we just simply
*  navigate this logically we end up in some pretty dark places with respect to what they might have
*  been up to why were the weapons makers lying about the utility of drugs that rendered this novel pathogen
*  minor well don't you think the the most obvious answer would be there was a pathway to extreme wealth
*  if you're going to have a vaccine that is paid for by the government that not only that the
*  government profits off of right so they own patent right they own a piece of modern medicine and
*  right they own a piece of moderna right yeah so they sold these vaccines to themselves essentially
*  they they made incredible amounts of them they distributed them all over the world
*  insane amount of profit and then forced people to take them and then ignored all evidence that
*  there was other medications in fact demonized those medications publicly like what they did on cnn
*  that's the that's the demon showing its eyes when what they did on cnn and all those networks when
*  they were talking and calling it horse dewormer despite the fact that it had won the nobel prize
*  for use in humans all that stuff the most obvious answer would be profit because you look at the
*  amount of money that was generated it's how much money did they make how much money was generated by
*  Pfizer let's let's ask let's take a guess how much money do you think was generated by Pfizer
*  and Moderna between 2021 and 2023 which is like the peak years where people are taking it it's
*  kind of tough to talk people into taking it now but there's a bunch of believers and I follow a
*  few of them on twitter that are all in would take a guess how much money do you think they made
*  between what years 2021 and 2023
*  I think 2023 was the first year it really dropped off
*  yeah I'm not gonna guess I'm gonna guess between the two of them I want to say 90 billion dollars
*  that's what I want to say that's my guess so
*  is it gonna find out how much up okay let me try again uh 200 billion
*  oh I guess no I might see it now it's it's a little over 100 billion I think Pfizer's
*  was real close Coma Nardi says generated 75 billion between 21 and 22 doesn't include 23
*  and then 36 billion for spike facts which I think is is that Moderna yeah so over 100 billion yeah but
*  that ain't nothing that's a lot of money it's not it's not but you don't think that's enough
*  money for them first of all I don't think you have this wonderful thing called the emergency use
*  exemption right yeah and the only way to allow people to get away with the emergency use exemption
*  is you have to have some sort of proof that nothing else works yeah I know that if you have
*  another effective medication you don't get emergency use authorization right first place
*  I heard that hypothesis was Heather I believed it I've come to believe that it's actually not that
*  that the their ability to cheat in the American system at least is so great that that obstacle
*  would not have prevented them from deploying their shots but let's pause pause real quick
*  because I have p and we'll come back right into that because I want to know the whole thing and
*  I can't be thinking I totally get it all right we'll be right back all right and we're back so
*  we were at the emergency use authorization yeah and you think that that wasn't necessary
*  and they could have gotten it through anyway I think it's yeah it's logical enough
*  there's truth in it they you know having a viable preventative for for SARS-CoV-2 in theory should
*  have prevented in the UA but I don't think that that was an obstacle they couldn't have overcome
*  I think the problem was their real goal was to normalize the use of a gene therapy on a population
*  that had never had that idea placed in its mind and so they called it a vaccine that was one thing
*  but they also needed the disease to be frightening enough that people would accept something
*  radical in order to get through it and had doctors been enabled to just simply do what
*  doctors are supposed to do they would have discovered that there were treatments inexpensive ones one of
*  them extremely safe the other one comparatively safe that were highly efficacious they would have
*  discovered the connection to vitamin d all of these things and that would have that would have
*  meant two things one it would have meant that the degree to which the mRNA platform got normalized
*  would have been much reduced and it also would have created a massive control group people who
*  didn't take the shots which would make the harms that much less obvious right so I suspect the
*  reason I say that a hundred billion dollars isn't a lot of money when it obviously is a lot of money
*  is that it's not a lot of money compared to what was at stake in their minds which is the mRNA
*  platform which can be used to reformulate every vaccine they've got to create a bunch of new
*  vaccines this we're talking about a trillion dollar invention that could not be brought to
*  market normally because it's way too dangerous and the emergency made it possible not only to
*  bring it to market but to get everybody or nearly everybody on board with it and I don't know how
*  deep this rabbit hole goes I do think there is something remarkable about the early days of
*  the so-called pandemic where doctors were primed for the horror of this disease so that they were
*  already in the mindset of radical interventions which meant that they did a lot of harm with
*  things like ventilators that didn't need to be done they killed a lot of people because they thought
*  they were rescuing them so the EUA story is good enough it more or less explains it but I don't
*  think it obscures the bigger picture which is that the mRNA platform itself is the ultimate cash cow
*  that couldn't be brought to market under anything but the most extraordinary emergency circumstances
*  and so they took a virus that shouldn't have existed in humans at all and wasn't that terrifying
*  when it was really released into the population and they turned it into something frightening
*  enough that people would contemplate things that they ordinarily would have rejected
*  but doesn't that also make sense that the emergency use authorization would have to be in place in
*  order for them to implement this because you're always going to like you said the lack of a control
*  right if everybody gets vaccinated you don't know what the hell happened you blame it on COVID
*  which is why people who've been hit with the shots say they have long COVID but if you have no emergency
*  use authorization and then people are allowed to make their own decisions and doctors are allowed
*  to make their own decisions there's a lot of it's way easier to do it with this emergency use
*  authorization it's way easier to slip it through oh and the only way you could stop that is if all
*  the sudden if so emergency use authorization is supposed to only exist if there's not some sort
*  of a medication that currently exists that treats it right otherwise you're going to have to go
*  through all the trials if there's another medication that exists so you demonize the medications you
*  sneak it through you make everybody take it therefore you lose the control and now you've
*  got this platform rolled out do you think that they didn't know to the extent of the damage that
*  it was going to cause i think they knew you think they knew it was going to harm that many people
*  yeah because so much i mean i'm not arguing that the eua wasn't important i think it was important
*  i just don't think it was necessary for them to they could have overcome that obstacle the way
*  they overcame i see what you're saying so many others but the most important thing was rolling
*  out this platform and normalizing it getting people to accept the idea that they were going
*  to take an mrna shot right that was a big leap and so the eua was important and we know that
*  because of the shenanigans around they ultimately did get a shot that they said was the same
*  not emergency use authorized but i'm now forgetting the term when the fda actually
*  there's another term it's not authorized but it's a synonym but anyway they did go approved
*  they did get one approved and you couldn't get it they kept giving the one that had the eua
*  they did that for legal reasons it gave them a layer of immunity right they had been given the
*  license to deliver an experimental drug and then they got approval for a non-experimental drug and
*  they kept giving the experimental one even though they said they were the same thing there's
*  something very deep there around the legal status of that emergency use authorized pharmaceutical
*  and so do you think that the blowback from all of this and the amount of people that are reporting
*  vaccine in injuries and the amount of discussion that's happening especially online about these
*  things makes it more difficult for them to roll out that platform for other things yes i think
*  we got in their way i think we outed them but to your earlier question about did they know how much
*  harm if they didn't they'd be behaving differently now notice how it's not slowing them down
*  right they're still recommending these things for six months old what on what planet would you do
*  that we now have and pregnant women and pregnant women right we now have a novel pathogen that
*  presumably these kids are going to be faced with encounters repeatedly for the rest of their lives
*  and you want to mess with their immunity six months into life you have no idea whether you are
*  making it impossible for them to develop some proper immunity so they can fend this thing
*  off for all of the encounters for the rest of their life right you're like creating a consumer
*  at the expense of a child and it's insane and i will tell you i'm i've just found out that there
*  is sort of a next chapter on this this mrna stuff which i don't know if you've paid any attention
*  have you noticed what's going on in japan the self-replicating mrna no so there's a new version
*  apparently when the mrna platform that we got was settled upon there were some competing platforms
*  that didn't make it and those competing platforms are beginning to make their debut and in japan
*  there are currently protests over what's called a self-replicating mrna vaccine i think they call it
*  a replicon and so notice that the whole mrna platform was really about doing away with the
*  vaccine factory by turning you into a vaccine factory right your cells became the vaccine
*  factory and there are reasons that a pharmaceutical company especially an amoral one would prefer that
*  the self rep so remember one of the things that was done to make the
*  mrna vaccines that we got work was the mrna transcript was stabilized with pseudo urodine
*  all of the uracils that would ordinarily have been in that message were replaced by something
*  chemically similar that is sometimes seen in nature but the more of them you have the more stable
*  the molecules so when they told us the mrna molecules were short-lived we didn't have to
*  worry about this shot because the mrna's weren't going to last very long in our bodies right they
*  would disappear that was a lie they had hyper stabilized these things they've now given a
*  nobel prize for the hyper stabilization process they wanted to give a prize for the vaccines and
*  so they gave it for this narrow thing i would argue maybe it's the worst design flaw in the
*  entire thing and that's saying something because there's substantial number of design flaws but
*  these self replicating mrna is the competing platform borrows some machinery from something
*  called an alpha virus and that alpha virus basically they take the genome of an alpha virus and
*  they include the gene for the antigen that they want your body to develop an immunity to
*  but they include it along with some genes for proteins that allow the the rna to
*  basically copy itself right so now instead of taking a molecule of mrna and putting it in
*  lipid nanoparticle and making it hyper stable so it keeps making new messages what they're going
*  to do is they're going to allow the mrna to duplicate itself biologically inside of you
*  right now this is madness right they are running a radical experiment a new one the mrna platform
*  was a radical experiment to begin with self replicating that's a whole new level of radical
*  and they are considering i think they have gotten permission to deliver this stuff in japan this fall
*  right so this is if these people did not understand the damage that they were going to do
*  it would have given them pause they were they would have looked at all of the harm
*  all of the people who died who didn't need to all of the people suffering from
*  you know compromised immunity and they would have thought holy shit what did we miss
*  but that's not what they think this is business as usual for them it's clearly business as usual
*  the only way you're going to develop new novel medications that are effective
*  is commerce you're going to have to have people profiting off of them which is why they fund them
*  costs a lot of money in a current climate if you have fda approval costs billions of dollars to
*  achieve that so you need people to be able to make money but isn't people making money off these
*  medications the real reason why stuff like this happens in the first place i think it's a bad
*  paradigm you know i definitely want those rare pharmaceuticals that actually do more good than
*  harm when you say rare how what percentage you think it is
*  one percent
*  jesus christ um yeah now let me that's going to sound crazy to people but let me defend it for a
*  second okay when you have a pathology that's widespread enough for a company to make a
*  medication to do something about it
*  you are dealing with a failure of the environment in which the creature lives
*  our focus should be on that it should be on what's in our food that we're not expecting
*  right seed oils for example right a lot of us spent our lives not noticing that seed oils
*  weren't what they appeared to be and that they actually have a role to play in the creation of
*  disease right it's not vegetable oil right vegetable oil avocado oil is vegetable oil
*  so it's a fruit oil exactly it's a fatty fruit oil perfect so the point is that one makes sense
*  because a plant does not want you eating its seed right so it puts toxins in the seed the oil from
*  avocados comes from the flesh which is there to induce birds to take the seed various places so
*  the point is it's designed as a food so anyway there's something wrong with the environment
*  the profitable thing to do is not to fix the environment it's to create a remedy or something
*  that masquerades as a remedy and the number of harms that are being done to people is just
*  compounding so my feeling is the paradigm is wrong i want the antibiotic to prevent the gangrene
*  right we've cured gangrene people don't lose their arms anymore because they got a wound that's good
*  that's a pharmaceutical that's worth having we should treat it with respect we should not deliver
*  the stuff where it doesn't belong but by and large the pharmaceuticals we have are creating
*  their own demand sometimes they're being given because somebody has engineered a parameter that
*  causes a doctor you know statins are being delivered because of you know a metric that
*  suggests to somebody that you have ill health in some way that can be remedied by these things it
*  was nonsense to begin with so yeah i think the cost we pay is huge and that the market
*  is going to find plausible stories that cause people to be willing to take drugs and that mostly
*  you know health it starts in the kitchen that's something that doctors i respect have
*  have pointed out that this is about what you're consuming it's about the environment that you
*  live in it's about understanding that sunlight is an important contributor to health and that the
*  way we live means that you're probably deficient in vitamin d it's about all of those things
*  and the amount of good that could be done just by simply recognizing the environmental component is
*  huge well that seems reasonable i must be a crank yeah i know isn't that funny that was what was
*  hilarious to me during the pandemic was people that were clearly not physically healthy saying
*  that the only way that you could be healthy was to take this medication that to me was bizarre
*  it was so bizarre because they weren't even considering taking care of their body
*  they were only considering taking this medication as if taking care of your body was foolish
*  right which is so weird like when i had jose on he was talking about his diet i remember what do
*  you eat what do you do you ever work out like he eats junk food he eats junk food and blasts himself
*  with vaccines yeah it's nuts it's nuts yeah i don't know i don't know what's up with him but
*  it's it's uh something not good yeah yeah i mean just the contradictory statements over the years
*  and and his stance on vaccines when when trump was president his stance on the mrna platform
*  when trump was president versus the immediate 180 he took i mean biden took an office i hate to say
*  this but he's either a cold-hearted liar or the most profoundly unself-aware person that has ever
*  existed i mean it's stunning i think it's two it's number two it's the latter with a little
*  bit of number one that is necessary in order to be number two you know i think you if you're a
*  part of a system and it's really important that you support all the people above you in this system
*  and that you all work together and you're a good company man you find profound ways to justify the
*  things that you're saying and especially if you can use some sciency kind of talk and talk about
*  diseases and inflate people dying and inflate numbers and inflate this and that and yeah yeah
*  well which is why they attacked me so hard they don't want someone healthy get over it real quick
*  and say hey you know me i work out all the time by the way got over it real quick right how i did it
*  well that i mean that that goes back to what i was getting at is that yeah it everything i saw
*  suggested they wanted it to be as terrifying as possible absolutely yeah there was no comforting
*  people no telling people listen it's not nearly as bad as we thought it was going to be you're
*  going to be fine they didn't want to contribute to vaccine hesitancy right because they wanted
*  that money to keep rolling in and that the number i mean just the shift in that imagine if they did
*  imagine if right away they said you know what this is not nearly as bad as we thought it was
*  going to be the way bill gates talks about it now right it actually mostly affected older people
*  and people who are very vulnerable that's those are the people that really affected
*  the amount of profit they would have made would have been significantly less and the enthusiasm
*  for the platform would have been significantly less yes the i really believe you're talking in
*  the end about i think
*  many hundreds of billions is unrealistically low we're talking about an industry that has been
*  playing this game without our knowledge right how do you demonize competing drugs how do you make
*  your pharmaceutical look safe when it isn't how do you make it look effective when it isn't right
*  that's the game every day of the week for these people and they found the ultimate version of
*  that game in the mrna platform which they wanted to normalize and they needed an emergency to do
*  it that's that's the most parsimonious explanation for everything we experienced and you know it's a
*  it's it's playing god with people's lives but it's also the weird thing was especially now
*  because of zuckerberg's recent statement we now know for sure that what he was saying was that
*  they were pressuring them to remove covet 19 information that turned out to be true
*  so the government was involved in this whole thing because the government was probably
*  pressured by the pharmaceutical drug companies yes and you know even those distinctions i think
*  are quaint we are now watching the fusion of corporate power and governmental power
*  that is the definition of fascism we're seeing the breakdown of individual and national sovereignty
*  right what the hell is the five i's why are the intelligence apparatus of these countries
*  conspiring against the citizens of these countries all of the categories that we grew up with
*  are an obstacle to seeing what's actually functioning as our antagonist here it doesn't
*  have a name it doesn't have a national boundary it's clearly targeting the civil liberties that
*  make the west possible and we're going to have to level up quickly if we are actually going to
*  survive this so what's worst case scenario in your mind that's with with all the competing
*  factors that are happening right now what's worst case scenario well let's leave this terrestrial
*  okay there are some space weather stuff i'm pretty concerned about that we really need to have our
*  governmental shit in order in order to deal with but i'm concerned that we are facing
*  the last opportunity to wield the power that remains in our constitution in order
*  to preserve the west i really believe the west is at stake in this election and i know that
*  everybody will laugh and they will say ah everybody always says this is the last opportunity this time
*  it's really dire but i truly believe the republic is in serious jeopardy i believe that however it
*  happened the blue team has become hostile to all of the fundamental values that allow the republic
*  to function and that undergird the west and when i say the west i'm not talking about
*  a set of countries i'm not talking about a geographic description i'm talking about an
*  agreement not to rig the world in favor of your people an agreement on a level playing field in
*  which people are rewarded for creating wealth from which we all benefit that system is incredibly
*  dynamic and powerful it increases human well-being at a rate that no other competing system has ever
*  come close to and it is very strong in one way its capacity to generate wealth is incredible
*  but it is vulnerable the reason that our founding documents have the strange form that they do the
*  reason that the founders of the u.s. carved out all of these counter-intuitive rights are that in
*  order to stabilize that system you needed to have an industrial strength document that prevented all
*  sorts of threats from getting anywhere near the core of that system so i think the worst case
*  is the next election november we don't beat the cheat margin the blue team remains in power
*  and it dismantles the remaining protections of our civil liberties and the basis of our freedom
*  and what would be the way they would go about doing that well you know you saw it right that
*  thing you put up from the new york times the idea is look at some level we've got the first amendment
*  which is already in tremendous peril right we've got brazil turning off x as you pointed out
*  brazil turning off x as you pointed out threatening to ruin anybody who uses a vpm
*  vpn to circumvent their block you've got pavl durov who has been effectively taken hostage
*  in france you have the owner of telegram yeah yeah you have people in britain being arrested for
*  speaking freely and the u.s. is actually in some ways the last holdout why are we the last holdout
*  because our first amendment is spelled out in very clear terms and it's difficult to get around it
*  and you know you and i lived through an era of terrible censorship but it had to be cryptic
*  to be cryptic here you showed the new york times was it experimenting with how to phrase the argument
*  for unhooking the constitution so that people would get used to the idea that that was being
*  done for them right it's dangerous the first amendment's dangerous the first constitution
*  is dangerous don't you see what is it dangerous they pose the question but here's here's the i
*  mean let's flip the topic on its head right yeah the founders of the u.s. enshrined counter
*  intuitive rights right these were brilliant men and they enshrined counter intuitive rights because
*  they understood a thing or two about tyranny because they had faced it they knew that
*  there was no way to eliminate bad speech without eliminating necessary speech
*  so they said you know what you can't do it there is lots of bad speech live with it you know why
*  because there's really uncomfortable stuff that needs to be said that you don't want anyone to
*  have the power to eliminate right that's counter intuitive everybody every child understands
*  people shouldn't be allowed to say bad stuff right maybe that's appropriate in a kindergarten
*  classroom but it's not appropriate in a civilization where we have to figure out
*  what's good and what's bad right and it has to be debated nobody has the position from which to say
*  which speech has no value so that's off limit but here's the frightening part
*  it's even frightening to raise this point that first amendment is where it is for a reason
*  it's the fundamental right to all of these
*  rights they placed the second amendment in the backup position so what i'm telling you is i am
*  concerned that we are you know you can hear our civil liberties creaking you can hear that
*  document threatening to give way you can hear the enemies of it experimenting with explaining what
*  they're doing and why they're really the ones who are looking out for your best interests
*  all of these maniacs are going to make violence inevitable we have to avoid that
*  we absolutely have to avoid that so i don't know if this is the moment to talk about
*  what's brewing over the course of the next month sure all right so
*  several of us are organizing a an event i don't really want to call it an event because although
*  it's technically an event i think it's much more important than that but we're going to hold an
*  event on the capitol mall on september 29th it's going to be between the washington monument and the
*  world war two memorial that event is called rescue the republic and it is really about rescuing the
*  republic and it is really about rescuing the republic in order to save the west
*  this is a an attempt to gather the unity movement that is forming at this moment
*  here you can see some of the characters who will be joining us on the the mall
*  and here's the pitch i would make
*  there are transcendent moments in culture there are moments at which something shifts
*  woodstock was a music festival but it was obviously more than a music festival it was a defining
*  moment for a generation i think there's a lot that's unfortunate about what that generation has done
*  and in fact i believe they've put us in the jeopardy that we're in now and that in some ways
*  what we're struggling to do is get past their vision the event that we are holding on the
*  capitol mall on september 29th is really an attempt to bookend that era to end it and to start a new
*  era in which as bobby kennedy said we love our children more than we hate each other all right
*  and that allows us to come together and recognize each other as allies to fend off this force that
*  is obviously targeting our civil liberties our freedom the very foundations of our system
*  so what we've done is we've outlined eight pillars there are things which
*  i think almost every member of your audience really any patriot anybody who understands the
*  value of the west would resonate with these are just fundamentals and we can go through them in a
*  second if you want but the idea is we're going to get as many people as we can together on the
*  capitol mall and my point would be it could be 50 000 people that's not enough if you want to prevent
*  the other side from being able to cheat its way to victory there needs to be a massive showing of
*  support for this unity coalition that is emerging this unity coalition is not maga it contains maga
*  maga is part of that coalition we saw that begin to happen where president trump brought on bobby
*  kennedy when bobby kennedy stepped out of the race right that was the the most important thing
*  right that was the the moment at which the idea of unity began to catalyze and the question is
*  all right well how many of us are there so gathering on the capitol mall is going to allow us to show
*  just how how many of us there are and how serious we are about restoring the republic and returning
*  to the foundational principles how many fbi ages they're going to show up well you should be able
*  to recognize them by the swastikas that they're carrying the fact that they're inciting violence
*  or you think that's going to happen well let's put it this way the first of the pillars of
*  the rescue the republic event is war is always the last resort and i would broaden that a little
*  bit just so that it's very clear to people who are listening to this and i realize you're an
*  mma guy so i gotta be careful here non-consensual violence is always the last resort if you want to
*  gather with somebody else and fight with them under some agreement that's yeah i don't violence
*  is very different than sport yeah sport violent combat sports it's just violence is just a part
*  of it but it's uh agreed there's some of the nicest guys you ever want to meet oh yeah believe
*  me i want to leave plenty of room for that i just want to say if i say violence is the last resort
*  i don't want anybody to be confused about what that means but the point is look violence is the
*  last resort and this gathering is the attempt to avoid that happening the people who are eroding
*  our rights are making it inevitable we want to head them off at the pass and we want to
*  proclaim what it is that we stand for and the first thing that we stand for is that war is
*  always the last result resort this is not a pacifist movement right in fact i've been
*  all right do you remember learning in school that this country this bastion of freedom was forged
*  by patriots who fought off tyrants who beat the odds and created this country right do you
*  remember learning that thomas jefferson said that the tree of liberty must periodically be refreshed
*  with the blood of patriots and tyrants so this idea that tyranny is a profound problem is written
*  in our dna as a nation and those who are cynically dismantling the nation are putting us in that
*  jeopardy and what i'm afraid that people will do is they will with some justification say to
*  themselves you know what i'm not sure how much my vote counts i'm not sure what we can do i'm
*  expecting them to cheat and then they're going to cross their fingers and we're going to end up with
*  an a result that people are going to have a hard time accepting this is the alternative
*  if you don't know if your vote counts you know what does count if you show up in a large group
*  that makes it very clear that there are lots of us who are intent on keeping our rights
*  so the first of our oh go ahead no first of our pillars war is always the last resort second is
*  that we have to recodify informed consent so the medical freedom movement is part and parcel
*  of what we are and i know that that's a an issue that is profoundly important i'm concerned that
*  the
*  the
*  medical freedom movement was taking shape and then events happened that caused it to get swamped
*  the fact the trump campaign was uninterested in talking about the problems of project warp speed
*  uh dropped that issue to a low priority and we are going to re-prioritize it
*  the third of our pillars is that we have to repel censorship propaganda and information control we
*  have a right to have a public square to have a discussion you have a a right to be incorrect
*  hopefully you're honorable about it and you discover you're incorrect and you fix your error
*  but we have to be able to talk freely there's nobody who knows what the facts are so that they
*  can tell us you know which things we're allowed to talk about any more than there's somebody in a
*  position to tell us which speech is tolerable right this is sacrosanct and so we have to have
*  um an end to censorship the fourth pillar is that we have to return to
*  a modality of truth-seeking you can't have a system of universities or institutes or
*  arms of the government that believe they have the right to lie to us for our own good
*  that leads to a very dark place and so we have to replace that paternalistic
*  anti-truth bent with a return to to open truth-seeking so that's uh that's the fourth one
*  fifth one is an end to lawfare we've seen the radical abuse of the courts much of it a man
*  much of it amounts to election interference so it is breaking down another one of the fundamental
*  elements of a democratic society it is making it impossible to elect the people we would choose
*  to elect we're being steered in a way that is intolerable and i would say the second component
*  of our focus on lawfare is that we have to have elections that we can trust free and fair elections
*  are obviously central to a democratic republic and so that has to be enshrined in a way
*  in my personal opinion this is not the opinion of the organizers of the event necessarily but in
*  my personal opinion um this is a place where the various the the states all coming up with their
*  own mechanisms for voting is a problem and i think actually we have to have a national conversation
*  about how to hold elections that are transparent and verifiable that seems like a minimum
*  requirement i think i'm on the those six that was six so the seventh pillar is um financial
*  freedom so this is essentially about the danger of a central bank digital currency that we need to
*  we retain the capacity to be autonomous and we can't have tyranny inflicted on us
*  through some sort of a social credit system that would be mediated through a central bank digital
*  currency the there are two more and these are out of order on the screen
*  immigration industrial yeah yeah border policy we need a rational border policy
*  um obviously open borders don't make any sense immigration is something that we need to decide
*  what the right level is we need to decide how to bring in people who actually want to be americans
*  and only at the rate that the civilization in question can absorb them and they can be
*  part of this great experiment and then the last one injustice is uh no that's lawfare the last one
*  is going to be
*  where is it oh development right of course the um sovereignty of the family we can't have a
*  civilization in which the government is telling you that because your child said something that
*  they think means uh that uh they are genderqueer that they are you know that they need to have
*  medications and surgeries inflicted on them and that it's not your right as a parent to say no
*  so those are the eight pillars i think if people think about those eight pillars and realize actually
*  it's nothing to disagree with there that reasonable people would all agree to these things
*  because they're not in any way radical and that a unity movement built around these things is
*  exactly where they want to be in an era where there's so much insanity being presented to us
*  as the only way forward hopefully they will gather with us on the capitol mall on september
*  29th and show themselves and really i think if you had you know half a million people show up
*  that will make a pretty unambiguous statement i think it's important to point out that you had
*  this idea a while ago and that it was actually removed from twitter uh in 2020 yeah i um
*  initiated what i called the unity 2020 movement which i actually announced on your show under a
*  different name it was called the dark horse duo before it became unity 2020 and i still think
*  it was the right idea um it was elegant in its construction so that it neutralized uh things
*  by virtue of the balance of the plan that's not what we're faced with now but i do think
*  but i do think yeah if i'm if i'm perfectly frank about it i think unity was the right answer it was
*  the wrong moment for it to catch fire but what's important is that it was removed from twitter
*  yeah it was removed from twitter what was the rationalization what they say it was under false
*  pretenses what they said was that we had engaged in what was their phrase something like inorganic
*  behavior or inauthentic behavior which was code for bots yeah bots that they argued that we had
*  used we did an internal investigation to see if somebody had used them under our banner it turned
*  out there was no truth in it well here's the thing you could do very easily you put bots
*  onto this program so you have these people that are tweeting under this banner and then you send
*  the bots to that page to agree with them they say oh my god we found bots right let's shut it down
*  yeah absolutely i mean it's you know it's the same trick as uh sending people with a swastika flag
*  to the trucker march so you can claim that they're nazis exactly the same stuff it's just uh organized
*  yeah it's organized so um i don't know i do think unity is the right message i think this is exactly
*  the moment at which people do come together because many people feel the jeopardy
*  i sincerely hope that what president trump discovered when he brought bobby kennedy on board
*  continues to grow in his mind because i think actually he has the potential to lead a
*  um a massive movement to restore the republic and make it function and
*  that would be i think it would be wonderful for him i think he would go down in history as
*  not the polarizing figure that people seem intent on turning him into but uh he would go
*  down in history as a galvanizing figure as really a refounder of the country
*  i know that will be hard for many people who have thought ill of him to swallow but um
*  the i don't know what you think but the the joining of the trump campaign and and bobby kennedy
*  and tulsi and tulsi tulsi who is in fact coming to our event i will say tulsi's coming
*  jimmy door russell brand will be there um oh you know who's gonna be there who bobby kennedy
*  uh he's not on the website yet um but he mad taibbi will be there zooby will be there
*  pierre corey robert malone uh colonel douglas mcgregor um and this is uh september 29th and
*  what is the website join the resistance dot org join the resistance dot org is where you find it
*  and uh oh lara logan will be present and there are some folks so by the way bobby says hello
*  there are some other folks that we are
*  negotiating with to see if we can get them there some very big names i wish i could
*  tell you but no worries that's enough big names yeah um but in any case i i can't emphasize enough
*  how important it is that we make a strong showing and the reason that it is important is because
*  it will make it very difficult to sell the story that the enthusiasm simply drove kamala harris
*  who has yet to articulate anything like a vision into the white house we need to make it clear
*  right if you worry that your vote doesn't count your physical presence on the mall the picture
*  of americans coming together across ideological divides and joining together in order to rescue
*  the republic i believe is the antidote to uh the cheating that we all fear all right here here
*  per winestein appreciate you very much right back at you thank you thanks for being you all right
*  goodbye everybody all right we were gonna end ladies and gentlemen a bonus a bonus uh we had
*  forgot to talk about this one thing so when tucker was on he was saying that there was no evidence
*  for evolution yeah and you had a real problem with that well i didn't have a real problem with that
*  small problem with that let's put it this way i don't think i think it's nonsense but i understand
*  that's a problem i understand how he ends up there so let me just say i i saw that segment of course
*  as you would imagine and um i immediately reached out to him and i said tucker you you've got it
*  wrong the evidence for darwinian evolution for adaptation is overwhelming and i would love to
*  sit down with you and talk to you about why that is and he said i would love that we haven't had a
*  chance yet but i do think it's important in um saying something about why that perspective where
*  that perspective is coming from and why it's incorrect it is important to say i really
*  appreciate tucker and his openness to hearing the counter argument uh says a lot about him he was
*  not the slightest bit defensive and in fact was eager to hear about uh about darwinism and well
*  he's absolutely willing to change his mind yeah yeah about everything yeah i agree great it is
*  it is uh it's a very important that he's got such a big voice because of that i agree and i i must
*  just say uh you know it's funny i went on his show he was the first person to reach out when
*  things melted down uh in 2017 at evergreen and i thought him a villain at the time but because
*  nobody else had reached out from any mainstream platform i felt like i had no choice but yeah i
*  remember you took a lot of heat for that for being on his show a lot of heat but i also
*  it was a wake-up call because you know i was expecting him to treat me badly i was expecting
*  him to treat me as a liberal who got what he deserved and instead he was absolutely compassionate
*  and he didn't there was no part of him that was taking a victory lap over some some liberal who
*  was faced with an angry mob so anyway he's oddly misinterpreted yes like the way people pretend he
*  is versus how he actually is i mean he doesn't do himself any favors like when he had that guy on
*  that said he blew obama like what are you doing he's just wild but i mean he's willing to have on
*  anybody i guess but but who he is as a person he's a lovely guy yeah he's a great guy very nice and
*  you know uh he's just like obsessively in love with nature oh yeah right yeah which is really
*  interesting about him um passionate fly fisherman oh yeah passionate yeah passionate outdoorsman
*  and anyway i i have a lot of affection for the guy yeah i do too it's and it is interesting
*  of you tell there's a certain group of people that are just on team blue they say anything
*  positive about tucker and you're some sort of a terrible villain and he represents white supremacy
*  and yeah okay yeah what yeah it was it was a weird a strange discovery but it's a it's it's
*  being connected to fox news you know you get attached to fox news you get attacked especially
*  the most popular voice on fox news yeah i spent a lot of time uh you know he's always being demonized
*  as a white supremacist or something and i got into the habit every time somebody said oh you know
*  tucker's finally revealed himself i would click through and see what the evidence was
*  yeah and it's just like okay the guy just said he wasn't for open borders right there's yeah it's
*  just empty yeah well it's just the rational voice is so discouraged in today's world the rational
*  objective voice where you look at both sides you look at i see why someone would say this i see
*  what you're saying i see this you know everybody immediately gets polarized everybody immediately
*  connects to their ideology and and changes the words of someone to be the least charitable
*  version of what it is and the the most heinous interpretation of who that human being is
*  and if you support them you support this and if you platform them you platform this
*  and it's just nonsense it's nonsense peddled by morons it's a moronic way to look at the world
*  it really is yeah it's almost beyond that because i mean look i remember i remember thinking
*  Bobby Kennedy was a kook yeah 100 i said it to him when he came on the podcast i said i have to be
*  honest that my version of you was connected entirely to you being an anti-vaxxer conspiracy
*  theorist kook the dark cloud of the kennedy family this one guy who's just nuts unfortunately
*  too bad then i read the real anthony falchion i was like hang on yeah oh it's it's but then i
*  talked to some brilliant people that i know that recommended certain things and told me to read
*  some other things that he had written i'm like oh okay this is another one of those another one
*  well there's people that meet me and they think i'm some right wing kook you know conspiracy theorist
*  asshole mean person it's like okay how do you get there like what you're you're getting there
*  because someone's led you there you're not getting there from a normal objective analysis of a person
*  who they are and what they stand for that's exactly it and with him he's connected to that
*  business that business of first environment right so he's an environmental attorney he cleaned up the
*  the east river and you know did a lot of great work yeah he is our he is our champion and we
*  were led to believe that he was a bad guy yeah yeah and he's so well measured when even dealing
*  with these attacks the way he handles things is so admirable it is admirable it really is yeah and
*  and you know it's good for all of us yeah well the discovery i want everybody to have the experience
*  of having thought ill of somebody like tucker or yes like bobby kennedy and then to discover in
*  person that the the rap is just wrong right and you're being led you're being led by what's
*  essentially propaganda and it's to polarize us it's to keep us separated and to keep us thinking
*  that you don't have anything in common with people on the right and they're they're demons you don't
*  have anything in common with people on the left they're loons like you and i are both very socially
*  liberal yeah you know and the idea that you'd be sitting here saying trump's got to win i know who
*  would have thought right it's crazy it is crazy it's crazy but the world's crazy and uh when the
*  world's crazy you have to have crazy solutions i've started when people don't know who i am
*  and they start there they ask just i'm a biologist keep moving well the problem is
*  you know eventually they're going to run into it so i've started saying look i'm happy to tell you
*  what i do but i should warn you i'm a terrible person who's come to believe unforgivable things
*  um
*  it kind of works because you hear somebody say that about themselves it's like well
*  okay what doesn't add up here right um but anyway back to tucker um here's the problem
*  i think there's a lot of concern especially on the right about the story of darwinism being
*  incorrect and to me this is a slow motion train wreck and i i don't fault people for thinking
*  that darwin had it wrong because i think modern darwinists have screwed up their job and in fact
*  they became advocates for darwin in a way that prevented them from seeing that there was a major
*  error in the version that they were presenting and what is the error the error is that the story
*  let's put it this way darwin existed at a moment where his ability to access what was taking place
*  inside of biological creatures was just limited technologically okay so there's a lot that he
*  didn't know and it actually worked to his benefit because what he outlined was an extremely elegant
*  idea in fact richard dawkins said it was the most powerful theory that anyone had ever come up with
*  and his defense for that i find very compelling his defense was the power of a theory is that
*  which it explains divided by that which it assumes and the thing about darwinism is it assumes almost
*  nothing right essentially descent with modification and it explains essentially all of biology so by
*  that rubric it is just far and away the most powerful theory we've got now what he presented
*  was a an outline of how what i would call selection right just the non-random sorting of things
*  when it was coupled with heredity produced adaptation okay creatures being adapted to
*  their environments by the process of selection where some things outdo other things and heredity
*  allows the characteristics that make some things outdo other things to accumulate
*  when dna so the order of events is darwin outlines his hypothesis mendel at the same time is playing
*  games with pea plants and mendel discovers the particulate inheritance he discovers that if he
*  is careful about how he breeds the peas that he can actually identify traits as they move from
*  parent to offspring in a way that suggests that it wasn't like swirling up a bunch of ice cream
*  it was like things that stayed independent that flowed through these breedings right darwin didn't
*  know about it mendel was working at the same time but darwin apparently did not know about what
*  mendel was doing and so darwin worked purely at the level of critters and their characteristics
*  and he knew that there had to be a way for hereditary information to be housed inside of
*  them but he knew nothing about how that worked mendel had the first piece of how it worked it's
*  particulate these things exist we now know they exist on chromosomes in dna form but that took a
*  long time to figure out but at the point that we finally found out watson and crick elucidate the
*  structure of dna they say it hasn't escaped our notice that this provides a place for the
*  information that mendel had pointed to that darwin had implied that that fits in the dna right at
*  that moment our vision of heredity narrowed radically okay because we had this description
*  of how it is that information can live inside of a biological organism be past parent to offspring
*  and be selected in a way that causes adaptation right that story is absolutely true we know it
*  to be true and it's so powerful and elegant that it caused biology to focus on it as if it was
*  darwin's mechanism period the end the error is that it's not darwin's mechanism
*  it is a darwinian mechanism and the problem is as powerful as it is right the story that they teach
*  us random mutations in protein coding genes are almost always bad every so often there's a good
*  one selection tends to accumulate the good ones and the creatures and their special characteristics
*  are all the results of all the collected good adaptations with all of the bad adaptations or
*  mutations all of the good mutations collected and all of the bad mutations
*  lost that story is not in my opinion powerful enough to explain the amazing characteristics
*  of creatures right it explains some of them it can explain for example how you get a pigment
*  molecule right you know so a plant has a plant is green because it can't use green light it's
*  collecting other wavelengths of light how can you get a molecule that happens to collect certain
*  wavelengths of light that story that i just told you about mutations and protein coding genes can
*  get you to a pigment right but can it get you to where an octopus can change its texture and
*  completely camouflage itself to look like a coral reef no and i don't think it can get you from a
*  shrew to a bat right right or to a human right shrew to a human right so you now have a problem
*  which is a you've got darwinists and other biologists who have been backed into a corner
*  and they've sworn up and down that mutations and protein coding genes if you give it enough time
*  and enough selective force can do everything we see and because they know that the story they're
*  telling is true in some regards they just keep stretching it so it covers everything
*  i don't think it does cover everything in fact i've thought since i was in college
*  that there was a missing layer right that there is a layer that explains how the amazing alterations
*  in form that we see is produced by darwinian processes right selection interacting with heredity
*  and i think we've just missed it so just to take an analogy so this will be clearer to people
*  a computer a modern computer functions based on binary the flipping of switches that have exactly
*  two states if you were to sit down with i don't know an ai or a sophisticated computer game
*  and i say yep that thing is programmed in binary to do these amazing things that you're seeing
*  right there's a technical truth there but that's not you couldn't program a game like that in binary
*  nobody did that's not how it happened there's a layer that's missing there's a layer called
*  compilers and computer languages that allows a human being through a very regimented process
*  to specify things such that the binary layer can do its job right the computer is binary but
*  there's a whole layer between binary and halo 3 or whatever right right kids are playing
*  so i'm arguing there's another there's another layer and it i believe it does live in the dna
*  but it is not protein coding genes right it is not limited in the same way
*  so what this does to a guy like tucker is it leaves him debating between two camps
*  and it happened you had uh stephen meyer on yeah so i know stephen meyer really like him too
*  um
*  stephen meyer is obviously a believer in intelligent design true believer true believer
*  believes in resurrection yep now here's the other thing i know about stephen meyer because i've
*  had the good fortune to spend some time with him to break bread to talk to him about biology he
*  really loves biology and he's good at thinking about it
*  he's passionate about it in fact where i overlapped with him was at a little conference and he brought
*  swim goggles for anybody who wanted them because he wanted to go into the mediterranean and go look
*  at animals because it's cool right yeah this guy's passionate he's not a faker right so here's here's
*  what i would say he will not be surprised to hear me say because i've said it directly to him i don't
*  think he's got it right he's looking for flaws in darwinism because he thinks what will be revealed
*  is a divine creator i think there are flaws in darwinism i think they reveal the fact that we've
*  missed a bunch of darwinism right this is no obstacle to us being friends and sharing an
*  appreciation for biology okay but it does mean that in the end we're betting on different outcomes
*  of the experiment but we're both committed to finding those errors and figuring out what's
*  there right should i be troubled by the fact that he believes in a divine creator not really any
*  more than i should be troubled by a biologist who's motivated by a desire to win a big prize
*  so do you think there's a process that it's yet to be discovered there's something else going on
*  yeah and i think we've we've glimpsed it but have we glimpsed it um i think there's another way that
*  information is stored in dna that is not in triplet codons and it allows it's the equivalent of a
*  either you know we have different kinds of computer languages not all of them are compiled some of
*  them you can just write directly and tell the computer to operate but it's the equivalent of
*  a computer language that turbocharges the process of adaptation and so the point about stephen meyer
*  is he makes a number of different arguments about problems he spots with darwinism i don't think
*  some of them really are problems but there is one that strikes me as real right they call it the
*  waiting time problem and the basic point is look we can do the math on how much adaptation we see
*  and there isn't enough time for you to get the adaptations that you're seeing given how much
*  availability of time there was for those things to occur so the point is that process that you're
*  claiming made these creatures couldn't have done it in the amount of time you're claiming they
*  were created now my point is that is actually i think likely true because there's this other
*  process like if you had to if you had to write halo 3 i don't even know if there is a halo 3
*  but i don't know how many hells are okay good thumbs up if you had to write halo 3 in binary
*  how long would it take you it would take you a zillion years because yeah you know it's binary
*  if you had to write it in i don't know c plus plus it might be doable on human timescales
*  so it's that kind of an error so i think you've got um you've got darwinists claiming that the
*  story is more complete than it is my bet is the thing that's missing is every bit as darwinian
*  is the part of the story that we already know so i think you know to the extent that there's an error
*  the error is on biologists who thought too narrowly it's not on darwin right this is not a
*  threat to what darwin gave us it's just a belief that um that darwin was writer than we have yet
*  recognized um and in the end i think that that's what people like steven meier will discover and i
*  would also point out from the perspective you know so if a guy like tucker is listening to this and
*  he's thinking you know the story in which we've got a creator makes more sense to me than the
*  story in which some darwinian process produces all of this biological diversity i would argue
*  that ultimately you still don't escape darwinism right like imagine imagine that this universe
*  was created by somebody who had a plan my claim would be they used darwinian evolution
*  to make all the creatures in fact i would argue if this universe is one that has a creator
*  that it is an evolution simulator that's the most useful thing it does is it figures out how creatures
*  could be by using this process of selection right and they continue to get better right yeah somebody
*  was interested you know i don't think there was a creator but if there was a creator i believe not
*  only a did they use selection and adaptation in order to make the creatures but that's probably
*  the reason they did the whole experiment right that's the most interesting thing it produces
*  um and b let's say you know let's just give the hypothesis it's due let's say that this was
*  a environment created by some intentional being with the purpose of making critters using
*  darwinian evolution okay so then you know you've heard elon say well if it's possible to simulate
*  universes then they're bound to be vastly more simulated universes than there are real universes
*  so we're probably in one now i don't really buy that analysis but let's say that it's true okay
*  so you get outside of your simulated universe into what he calls base reality okay now what
*  right was that one created too by whom right at some level you're going to get far enough out
*  that you have to invoke a natural process and that natural process is going to involve
*  something without a creator right there's no philosophical place even if we're inside something
*  that was intentionally created that something is inside something that wasn't it has to be you
*  eventually get out to that layer and at that point you know if there was a creator you know there was
*  a creator an intelligent designer of this cup right what designed that creator right darwinian
*  selection right let's suppose that's not true let's suppose that the creator of that cup is
*  inside a simulator made by another creator what made that creator darwinian evolution
*  well let's suppose that's not true you go one layer out eventually you're going to get to the
*  place where you're going to have to surrender to the only thing anyone's ever come up with that
*  could in principle create intelligent creatures and it doesn't have a creator it's a darwinian
*  process all right all right you go tucker
*  there's a lot there's a lot more to say to tucker i would say oh yeah the the number of places you
*  know the genomes of the creatures that we have did not have to tell an elegant story of how they're
*  related to each other right if a creator had designed them he'd have no reason to make the
*  phylogeny fit an evolutionary story that fit the paleo biology right so the number of conformations
*  that we have gotten is extraordinary and they're just not familiar but anyway there's there's a
*  lot of power in the in the theory and don't fault the myopia of any generation of scientists
*  the overall story is elegant and fascinating all right that's it bye everybody
