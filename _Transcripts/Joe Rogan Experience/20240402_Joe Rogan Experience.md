# Joe Rogan Experience #2129 - David Holthouse
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWo6QNgr-zA)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  Hawaii, man, good to see you again.
*  Good, thanks for having me back, man.
*  My pleasure. You made another awesome one, man. This, uh, the Krishnas one. Oh my god.
*  Whew. There is something about these cult documentaries.
*  Right.
*  This just...
*  Right.
*  Whew. That one's heavy.
*  Do you remember the Hare Krishna devotees in the airports?
*  Because you're like me, like you're old enough of that generation that you might remember the white robe, like...
*  I remember them.
*  They'd have the flowers and they'd be selling books and shit in the airports.
*  I don't know if I remember them in the airports. I remember them in some places.
*  I definitely have seen them, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  But, um, I just always thought they were just kooks, you know?
*  It's interesting, you know, knowing what I know now about the 60s and, you know, what was done to sort of...
*  to kind of crush the hippie movement.
*  Right.
*  You know, it's interesting to see that this was connected to, you know, the Beatles and peace and love.
*  And then you see this sect that this...what was his name again?
*  Kirtan Ananda was the guru that went way wrong.
*  Yeah, went way wrong.
*  Yeah.
*  But it is...well, let's just get into from the beginning.
*  How did you get involved in this particular subject?
*  So there's a production company Marwar Junction, and they had actually sold this show to Peacock, and they were looking for a director.
*  So this is the first show that I've made or helped to make that I haven't been involved in the sort of conception of the story from the jump.
*  So they had developed the story and sold it to Peacock, and they were shopping for a director, and they liked my work, and so they hired me to make it.
*  And so did you have any experience with the Christians before this?
*  No, no.
*  And I had a lot...you know, like a lot of people had a lot of misconceptions about them.
*  Like I thought that there was a...that the Hare Krishna movement was invented in America in the 1960s.
*  I just had it associated with sort of the hippie movement, you know, and that's not the truth of it at all.
*  It's like actually a spiritual tradition that, you know, dates back thousands of years, like far predates Christianity.
*  It's based in these ancient spiritual texts called the Vedas.
*  You know, the written version is like at least 3,500 years old, and the oral tradition goes back thousands of years beyond that.
*  So I learned a lot about, you know, the Krishna consciousness in the making of this.
*  And the show is about a particularly dark chapter in the history of the movement in the 70s and 80s that I don't think is representative of the history of the movement.
*  Like today, like I think it's a force for good in the world today, actually.
*  Yeah, I think the principles behind it, if you pay attention to the main guru, was the older...
*  Prabhupada.
*  Prabhupada, yeah.
*  Yeah, my friend Duncan loves that guy.
*  And what the whole concept behind it sounds beautiful, you know, it's all just love and, you know, relinquishing your possessions and the hold that they have on you.
*  Right.
*  And living this very peaceful, loving life and not just forgiving your enemies, but letting them into your home.
*  And all of it sounds great.
*  But all it takes is one psycho.
*  Yeah, one psycho.
*  Well, Prabhupada took a risk.
*  I mean, so Prabhupada was a guru.
*  So several gurus, Krishna consciousness gurus, had come over from India to the UK or to the US, you know, in the 1800s even, and then through the first half of the 20th century and had no luck because their timing wasn't right or they weren't the right person or both.
*  But Prabhupada was the right dude at the right time.
*  He showed up in Greenwich Village, New York City in 1965 and started preaching Krishna consciousness.
*  And it just like, you know, took off like wildfire.
*  And, you know, like Allen Ginsberg got down with it.
*  Wasn't maybe a full scale devotee, but like he was hanging out with them.
*  And but Prabhupada was already an old dude when he showed up in the US.
*  And so in 1977, he died.
*  So it's 12 years.
*  And by that time, Krishna consciousness, there were like Krishna temples all over the country and in the UK because George Harrison had converted.
*  Right.
*  That was one of his like strokes of brilliance.
*  Prabhupada, he like sent a group of devotees to go camp out outside the Apple Records office and just like chant and dance until they basically got a meeting with the Beatles.
*  He was literally like, let's see if we can make the Beatles, you know, Christianers.
*  And with Harrison, it took, you know, and that song, My Sweet Lord.
*  I mean, that's what it's about.
*  That's about Krishna consciousness.
*  Yeah.
*  So but when Prabhupada died in 1977, you know, he hadn't had a lot of time to build up successors.
*  And most of the most of the leaders of the movement were young or most of the members of the movement were young.
*  So he took a risk and I don't think he had a choice.
*  And he appointed 11 of his closest, longest time devotees, all men to be the gurus that would carry the movement forward.
*  And while you could say that it worked and that Krishna consciousness is still around, it's bigger than ever.
*  A few of those, these are dudes, these are like dudes in their 20s, OK, that suddenly are being worshiped as direct conduits to the divine.
*  In other words, treated as gods on earth.
*  And some of them were not spiritually prepared for that.
*  Yeah.
*  Would be a kind way to put it.
*  And some of them went wrong.
*  And one of them, in particular, Kirtan Ananda, whose government name was Keith Ham, went really wrong.
*  I like the term government name.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that is a thing that they always do, right?
*  They give them spiritual names.
*  Yeah. You relinquish your, you know, your original existence.
*  Yeah. And take a Krishna name.
*  There's a place out here, you know, I built a comedy club.
*  And before I got the spot that I have now on Sixth Street, I bought a place called the One World Theater.
*  And the One World Theater was owned by a cult.
*  And I it's a beautiful theater.
*  And I had heard about it from my friend Ron White because we I was telling him, you know, I think we should open up a comedy club.
*  He said, you should buy that theater.
*  It was owned by a cult.
*  And I was like, that would be hilarious.
*  Buy a theater that was owned by a cult.
*  And there's a documentary on them called Holy Hell.
*  OK.
*  And it's the same sort of deal.
*  I know that. I know that.
*  Yeah. So they start off.
*  It seems wonderful.
*  In the beginning, everyone's doing yoga.
*  They're hanging out together, cooking meals together and dancing.
*  And and like it seems like all cults, it goes sideways.
*  Yeah. In the beginning, it looks like a wonderful idea.
*  Like society sucks the way, you know, the modern world, the way it's set up materialism, it's all foolish and spiritually vacant.
*  There's a way to do this and the way to live.
*  And this is the way.
*  And everybody joins.
*  And and then Waco comes along and the cult awareness network starts investigating this guy.
*  And so he changes his name for the third time.
*  His name is Jaime Gomez.
*  He was a gay porn star and a hypnotist.
*  Right. So he led a rich life.
*  Yeah. So he was he was already on a certain path.
*  And then starts this play.
*  He changed his name again and he changed his name to like I forget.
*  There's two different names, one was Michelle.
*  And I forget what the other one was.
*  So he changed his name again, moves to Austin and starts this cult and has his followers build him this theater so he can dance in front of them.
*  And that was the place that I bought.
*  But it was all fucked up.
*  And we wound up getting out of the deal.
*  And because there's like a lot of problems and a lot of issues that had to be resolved with the property and they didn't disclose that.
*  So I got out of it and then got this place on Sixth Street.
*  But I you know, in the process, I really started investigating the cult and I didn't investigate it, unfortunately, before I signed contracts.
*  And I kind of called for my friend Adam.
*  I came in. Did you watch the documentary on the cult?
*  I was like, oh, no, whatever the documentary on the cult.
*  It's generally a cult that went bad.
*  Right. And this one went bad.
*  And but it was the same sort of deal.
*  They all got names.
*  They were all given spiritual names and they were told that you're reborn, reborn in this new persona.
*  Well, even in the 60s and 70s, I don't think it's fair to call Krishna consciousness a cult.
*  But the way that this so this guy here, it's an under one of the eleven disciples that probably had appointed to carry on the movement.
*  We had a commune up in the hills of West Virginia that's still there.
*  That's called New Vrindavan because the city of Vrindavan in India is the sort of mythical birthplace that that cult that compound is still there.
*  Still there. Yeah. But it's not a cult. It's not a cult.
*  And it's like right now, I've been there twice.
*  And like today, again, it's like it's a really like positive place with a great spiritual vibe.
*  But when Kirtananda was in charge in the 70s and 80s, like some really dark shit went on down.
*  How did they turn it around?
*  Well, like, well, they finally like his followers turned on him, you know, and and is Khan, which is the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, which is sort of the formal name for the Hare Krishnas, what we call the Hare Krishnas.
*  They actually like, you know, kicked the New Vrindavan out of the movement for a few years, half a decade or so, and then like kind of gradually brought that that compound, that commune, it's not compound, that commune back in.
*  But they had this fucking temple there, the Palace of Gold, like Prabhupada's Palace of Gold that they were originally building for Prabhupada to live in.
*  But then he died before it was completed.
*  But it's like this it's like this Taj Mahal-esque structure that's in.
*  Yeah, yeah, that's that's in that's in the kind of the middle of nowhere in the in the hills of West Virginia.
*  I mean, there's just, you know, it's like couple hours, couple hours from Pittsburgh, basically, and up in the mountains.
*  So, God, it's beautiful. Look at the images.
*  And these are like untrained, you know, disciples making this just based on like ancient texts that they studied.
*  They just figured out how to do all this artisanship.
*  Yeah, that's amazing.
*  Yeah, it really is.
*  It's worth visiting for sure.
*  It's mind blowing.
*  I like there's a big box of cash.
*  And so, but this place, I mean, even even now, it's like it's it's it's well, for sure.
*  In the 60s, for sure.
*  In the 70s, it was cut off from the rest of the world.
*  I mean, these young kids would join the Hare Krishna movement and basically a lot of the fuck ups in the movement would get sent to Kirtan Ananda at New Vrindavan because he put him to work building the temple.
*  Right.
*  So if you like joined and you were like, you know, not fitting in for some reason, a lot of times they'd buy you a one way bus ticket to like Morgantown or Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
*  And you'd wind up up there, you know, in the hills under Kirtananda's tutelage.
*  Right.
*  Which is and that it went it went sideways in a hurry, especially after Prabhupada died.
*  He was already running New Vrindavan like Prabhupada visited it and approved of it.
*  And actually, Kirtananda had gotten booted out of the Krishna movement because he kind of tried to take it over.
*  Yeah. And at a certain point, like Prabhupada, you know, kicked him out.
*  And and Keith Ham, Kirtananda, like mindfucked this this local sort of like philosopher dude that that owned the land in the in the signing it over, promising to be like a non denominational spiritual movement.
*  That's what he was doing.
*  And as the guy put it, we interviewed his daughter and he said, you know, as soon as the lease was signed, they put on bed sheets and started chanting.
*  Right. And so you got the Hare Krishna as your neighbors.
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's the documentaries really well done.
*  Thanks. It's like just like Sasquatch.
*  I mean, you do some awesome stuff, but it's it's so fascinating to watch these alternative sort of movements get co-opted and how that can happen by the wrong sort of charismatic psycho.
*  Right. And that's this how do you say his name?
*  Kirtananda.
*  Kirtananda.
*  It's tricky, man, dude, dealing with all these Christian names and making this documentary.
*  It was like, you know, how much research did you have to do about the movement and getting into it?
*  Quite a bit. You know, before you sit down and start doing interviews with devotees like you want to know at least a little bit about what you're talking about.
*  You know, and I went to we filmed in Vrindavan in India.
*  That's how the project that's how I started the project.
*  I had signed on. I signed on to the director gig.
*  And like two weeks later, I was in India.
*  What was that like?
*  Hey, Jim, can we get the coffee in here?
*  Well, one thing about Vrindavan India is the fucking monkeys.
*  OK, there are these monkeys that will steal your shit.
*  And it's a whole racket. Right.
*  The monkeys will give them something back.
*  Yeah. And of course, we're like we're like knocking around with bags full of lenses and camera gear and audio gear and stuff.
*  And so we're a target rich, you know, posse for these monkeys.
*  But they'll get your sunglasses, your phone, whatever, if you're not careful.
*  And then they like sort of skitter up a drainpipe or a tree.
*  And you got to buy these like frozen mango packs from the street vendors and like throw them up to the monkeys and the monkeys will drop your shit back down.
*  I'm convinced that the street vendors are in on it.
*  Right. That's like this. Yeah.
*  Yeah. So they probably are.
*  Yeah. Well, at the very least, it's so strange that the monkeys know that you can barter.
*  Yeah, they learned. Yeah.
*  You can make a deal.
*  Yeah. The legend is, is that hundreds of years ago, this guy that was like he brought a circus to Vrindavan and the monkeys came with him and they were trained to be pickpockets.
*  And then they just kind of stayed behind. But I don't know if that's true or not.
*  But that's the local legend is that. But there's hundreds of them, thousands of them, man.
*  I mean, they are everywhere. And you got to you got to watch.
*  You got to be constantly have your head on swivel because they are so quick.
*  And what do they live off of? Do they just live off of what the people give them?
*  I don't know. They probably scavenge. But also, like, they do get a lot of like, you know, mango treats from Stanley's ship because the Balram Mandir, which is like the head, Hare Krishna temple is in Vrindavan, India.
*  And so devotees from all over the world go there like a spiritual tourists, basically.
*  And so, you know, monkeys steal shit from them or any other.
*  There's a lot of Krishna devotees from all over India, too, that aren't necessarily quote unquote Hare Krishnas, but like follow the Hindu deity Krishna.
*  So they come to it's like a you know, there's a lot of spiritual pilgrims to this city. All right.
*  There's a lot of spiritual tourism there. And so the monkeys have a lot of targets.
*  And so when they steal your stuff, you have to throw it to them.
*  You got to buy something and then throw it up to them. And then they will relinquish it.
*  Sometimes they'll be like, no, no, that's that's a cell phone. That's a three mango pack deal, dude.
*  You got it. They won't. You know, they'll be like, oh, thanks.
*  And they'll like go like they're going to drop it to the be like, oh, how about I drop it in the sewer? Oh, you don't want that mango pack.
*  So they point to the mangoes. Yes. Yes.
*  So eventually you throw them enough treats and they'll like and they're and they're these kids, too, that if they see that a monkey has stolen something, they'll come over and they'll be like for a few.
*  Basically, it's like for a few rupees, I'll handle this deal for you.
*  And then they climb up the tree or the drainpipe and they do a direct hand to hand exchange.
*  Wow. So we learn the hard way. That's that's the thing to do.
*  The monkey steals the whatever hire the kid.
*  He goes and brokers the deal with the mango juice guy, you know, and makes it all happen.
*  Yeah. So do other monkeys realize this is happening and try to steal the mangoes before?
*  Oh, yeah, it's brutal. But they also they also cooperate, too, like they'll run like, you know, distraction operations like one monkey will come at you from an angle and kind of like bluff charge.
*  And then you pay attention to that one. And then, boom, the other one like grabs your sunglasses off your head.
*  Wow. Yeah. Yeah.
*  But we were there to to film.
*  There's there's this this ceremony. These two these two brothers whose father his name was Chuck Adair, his his Christian name, his government name was Charles St.
*  Dennis, known as Chaka in the movement.
*  And his sons were doing this really ancient ritual to sort of release the soul of someone who's been murdered.
*  And so they had their father's ashes, which he was murdered, you know, decades ago at New Vrindavan by on orders from Kirtananda because he was challenging Kirtananda's authority.
*  So Kirtananda had people murdered to more than one. Yeah.
*  I think there's probably quite a few bodies that people just don't know about. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Wow. Yeah. One of the one of the principal sources for the for the documentary is a guy's retired homicide cop named Thomas Westfall, who was a local just a local cop in West Virginia when the when the Christians set up shop at the New Vrindavan commune.
*  So he started keeping a close eye on him early and sort of saw Kirtananda's rise to power.
*  And, you know, he believes that there's at least a handful more victims up there whose bodies haven't been found because it's really remote country.
*  I mean, I want to stress that's really cold in the winter. There's a lot of snow, you know, to this day.
*  It's it's sort of it's a difficult place to get to.
*  And so this guy, when he first started running this temple, this this area, when did it go? How long did it take for went sideways?
*  Well, I think it was the question with Kirtananda or Keith Ham is always like, was he bent before, you know, he became a Krishna?
*  Or was it like, did the power get to him? I think it's both.
*  I think I think he had a psychological disposition towards being a despot, if you will.
*  And then once Prabhupada was gone and he was in Kirtananda, along with 10 of his compatriots was appointed a guru, you know, and had that sort of power.
*  I think at that point, it's and combined with like all the money.
*  I mean, he was he was he had this guy that was he was a Kirtananda was a genius at running schemes and scams to make money.
*  He would dispatch like the hottest young female Krishna devotees to like stock car races and rock concerts and stuff to like raise money for whatever.
*  They just make it up. The starving children of India or they just make up charities and they'd flirt with dudes, you know, especially at rock concerts, guys that are like high.
*  And get them to give them cash. A dollar here, five bucks here, ten bucks there.
*  They work at airports, too. But and they just brought in literally like garbage bags full of cash, you know, every week.
*  And they and he trained them to to deposit it in nine thousand nine hundred dollar increments.
*  So it doesn't to avoid the reporting. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Wow.
*  So he was he looks crazy. That's what's interesting.
*  Isn't it interesting that like crazy people look crazy?
*  And I always I always try to say, OK, is this because you know he's crazy or do you see something?
*  It's hard to tell, but he doesn't seem enlightened.
*  But you look at him, he looks like a guy who's a little unhinged.
*  And I've met people like that unhinged and I've met people like that in like the psychedelics movement.
*  And there's there's a few of these movements that are so open and basically anybody can become a part of it.
*  You know, the concept behind it is, you know, we're all seeking enlightenment.
*  We're all. But then you'll see someone who gets in there and you're like, what is this guy's schizophrenic or something?
*  There's something going on here, especially you look at photos of Kyrsten and Ande over the decades.
*  Like he just gets more and more and more demented. Right.
*  And that has to probably be the power. Right. Yeah.
*  They're washing his feet and worship. Yeah. He was molesting kids there.
*  You know, yeah, he was he was a total pedophile. Right.
*  Do you think that started that he was always a pedophile?
*  I think pedophiles are always pedophiles, you know.
*  But again, once he had like access to as less as the movement went on, yeah, more and more Krishna couples had kids.
*  He had access to more and more and more children up there, you know, in those hills.
*  Right. And that was one of the things that you highlight is that it wasn't just about releasing the possessions.
*  It was also like not having your children, not having control of your children either.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Although I think they especially at New Vrindavan, at the place that Kyrsten and Ande ran, they kind of took that belief.
*  You know, that, yes, children are a material attachment. Right.
*  But he took it to an extreme and just basically just cut off, you know, kids from their parents entirely.
*  And that was not unique to New Vrindavan.
*  That happened in a lot of temples around the country in the U.S.
*  But but is pedophilia happened?
*  It did. It did.
*  But I will say again, to is cons credit that unlike the Catholic Church, once the evidence started to emerge that there had been, I think it's fair to say, systemic, you know, raping of kids at their religious places.
*  At their religious facilities.
*  They addressed the issue head on.
*  And for the most part, I think have done an excellent job of, you know, weeding out the pedos.
*  And what happened to the kids?
*  Because it's not just that it seems like it wasn't isolated.
*  It was all the kids at New Vrindavan.
*  Yeah. I mean, this is what you're kind of mostly boys, I think.
*  Mostly boys. Yeah. Yeah.
*  They are they have communities online and there's a lot of there's a lot of bitterness.
*  You know, it varies.
*  It varies. You can't totally generalize.
*  But, you know, the kids that grew up in New Vrindavan, you know, they have online communities where there's a lot of like for obvious reasons like resentment and bitterness and anger.
*  Yeah.
*  Still at the leadership of the Hare Krishna movement for not in their opinion, you know, fully atoning for the sins that occurred there.
*  What could they do?
*  Right. Well, there was a settlement or some lawsuits or some settlements.
*  But I mean, you know, that doesn't fix anything.
*  It acknowledges that something happened.
*  You're ruining a child for life.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  And you're doing it in the most evil way because you're supposed to be a part of this peace and love movement.
*  That's like the optimal way to live life.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  Well, and that's why this guy Charles St.
*  Dennis Chaka was was murdered is he he was calling out Kirtananda for his hypocrisy.
*  Now, I don't know if he called him out for the, you know, raping kids.
*  But like Kirtananda was having like gay sexual relationships with some with some laborers that had been hired to come help build the temple.
*  They weren't necessarily devotees.
*  And it was like an open secret, you know, in the commune.
*  And he called him out for it and also called him out for the materialism for like driving around in a limousine for having like, you know, they would buy him a new fancy SUV every year or whatever.
*  You know, and Charles St.
*  Dennis called him on his bullshit publicly.
*  And that's what got him killed.
*  Wow.
*  You know, fuck, man.
*  It's I know quite a few people that grew up in cults.
*  You know, in standup comedy, you deal with a lot of like lost people like wayward folks that just didn't fit in anywhere in society.
*  And a couple of my friends, one of my good friends grew up a Jehovah's Witness.
*  And, you know, it's just you you live in this world that is just very strange sort of I mean, it just doesn't make any sense.
*  It's a logical.
*  It's crazy.
*  It doesn't fit.
*  And once you start questioning things, you find like you're not allowed to.
*  And it's it's just very bizarre how many of these accounts have no conversation with Mark Andreessen, you know, the venture capitalist guy.
*  And he was like, California still has a lot of active cults right now.
*  I was like, really?
*  He goes, oh, yeah, there's a lot.
*  So like, there's ones you don't hear about where they kind of keep it together.
*  Right.
*  So I guess there's like cults have to go completely like holy hell sideways before you get a documentary.
*  Right.
*  So some of them, they figure out how to kind of keep everybody together.
*  It's probably harder to keep shit under wraps these days than it was for Kirtan Ananda in the 70s and 80s.
*  With the Internet. Yeah, for sure.
*  Everybody's got a phone.
*  Yeah. It's all it's also like people are much more aware of what a cult is now.
*  It just seemed like a beautiful alternative to, you know, I mean, you're dealing with the civil rights movement, Jim Crow, antiwar movement.
*  Vietnam is happening.
*  You've got Richard Nixon's, the president is all this chaos.
*  They don't people don't want the world that's in front of them right now.
*  And they're searching for some alternative.
*  And it comes along. What about love?
*  What about this? Yeah, that's what I want. Right.
*  And then the next thing you know, you're wrapped up in this thing.
*  Yeah. You know, I talking about the pedophilia stuff, it's going to take this on a detour because there's something I want to say last time I was on your show, which is that I am convinced that you saved at least one kid's life was something that you said the last time I was on, which is that we were talking about my own experiences as a survivor of childhood sexual assault.
*  And you told a story about how when you were a kid, you were in a library and this like sick fuck pedophile guy like was trying to get you out of the library.
*  Yeah. And a librarian stepped in and basically saved you from this guy.
*  Do I have that? Do I have that? Yeah, absolutely.
*  OK. The reason that I think you saved at least one kid's life is this because and again, speaking from firsthand experience as a male survivor, especially of childhood sexual assault, you think like how could I have let that happen to me?
*  Why didn't I defend myself? Why didn't I fight the guy off?
*  You know, even though intellectually you look at a seven, eight, nine year old boy, you're like you got no chance against a grown man.
*  Right. But for, you know, Joe Rogan to say like a librarian saved me from this happening to me.
*  Right. You're a tough guy. OK. You're perceived as a tough guy.
*  I think rightly so. Now. Now. Right.
*  Now. Seven or eight or however. Right. Right. Right. Right.
*  But but but I hope I'm articulating my point, which is that it can happen.
*  It can happen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And and then for a guy that's like suffering that and thinking like, why didn't you know, it just helps when when somebody in a position like yourself, you know, says like, hey, you know, could it happen to me easily?
*  It almost did. I mean, I was on my way out the door. Right.
*  Yeah. It could have if that librarian hadn't called out my name.
*  I think about that all the time. You know, what would happen to me?
*  I think it's it's one of the darkest forces in in the world like this.
*  And I don't understand why it's so prevalent.
*  And I think, you know, I've equated it to vampires that it seems like one of the things that happens to some of the people that get molested is they wind up doing it to others.
*  Yeah. And that is a harsh truth. I mean, I try and do what I can to dispel the stereotype because, you know, that was one of the things that scared the shit out of me when I was a teenager is the idea that I was going to become a pedophile myself.
*  Right. Right.
*  But yeah, it's unfortunate. So, you know, it's that hurt people hurt people. Yeah. Right. Yeah. There's truth behind it.
*  It is with violence. It is with everything with someone.
*  Pedophilia, which let's just call it is raping kids is just an incredibly destructive force in our culture and in all cultures.
*  And I just like it's the one kind of criminal I think that I just have absolutely no sympathy for.
*  No, do I? None. No, most people feel the same way.
*  I mean, when you talk about like one of my daughters is very much against the death penalty.
*  And I think for a good reason and because we've had conversations about people that are unjustly accused and she knows that I've had many people on my podcast that spent a long time in jail for crimes that they didn't commit.
*  And some of them were on death row and they could have been executed.
*  And I mean, we were talking about it. We said in a perfect scenario when you absolutely know that the law has got the right person and that this person has done something and then they have killed people, whether it's a serial killer or whatever it is.
*  Yeah, maybe the death penalty makes sense. But we don't have a perfect legal system. Right.
*  But and then the subject of child molesters came up and they're like, oh, no, kill them all.
*  Everybody's you know, it's almost like an instinctual reaction. Yeah, it's an especially my wife.
*  Mothers, you know, they hear that and it's just like, that's the one like you have to kill them because they never fucking stop.
*  No, they don't. They never stop. It's a weird sickness.
*  It's a it's a it's just so strange that it's not a very, very rare, uncommon thing, you know, that like exists like in a handful of places in the world occasionally.
*  Yeah. But then when you hear about something like the Catholic Church, you know, there was Pope Benedict when he got kicked out.
*  There was a lot of people that didn't understand what was going on.
*  And I was looking into it and you find out what that guy did.
*  And one of the things that he did that's so evil is he would move people.
*  So he would take a priest that was molesting kids and just move them to another unsuspecting place.
*  And he went on to molest one of these guys that they caught went on to molest a hundred deaf kids, at least a hundred that they're aware of and just go like and he knew that this guy was a pedophile.
*  And it's the Catholic Church in particular is just like I went to Catholic school and nothing happened to me.
*  But things did happen to people that I know that did go to Catholic school.
*  And it's just like, is there another religion that is more connected?
*  When you hear the term Catholic priest, right, pedophile is right.
*  Like if you if you were playing a game like Catholic pedophile, you know, like you would say that, you know, if you're what is that charades?
*  What's that game? When you know, like you say, you know, tough, big runs fast football player.
*  You know, like you'd say a Catholic priest pedophile.
*  You know what I'm saying? It's like it was an open secret for so long, too.
*  Yeah, it's crazy. I think a lot of the priests were probably drawn to the church for the access to kids.
*  I mean, yes, and Nanda and you've been diving, built himself a little pedophile heaven up there, you know, once he had the power.
*  So how did they did you talk to anybody from there that kind of reformed that place?
*  Like how did they once they got rid of him?
*  Well, first of all, he finally went to prison for murder, for murder for hire, basically, along with racketeering and like he was he was selling like counterfeit football hats and shit.
*  Is he still in jail?
*  I know he's dead. He's dead.
*  But he still has like within not within is con, but within the larger sort of Krishna consciousness movement, he still has he still has a falling.
*  And I went I went to his tomb that's in Vrindavan, India.
*  And I had, you know, like a translator kind of fixer with me and I had one camera guy and we sort of bullshit our way in.
*  And it was this creepy fucking place, man.
*  It was like this sort of like almost Soviet block looking apartment.
*  It was all half finished.
*  Like there was this tomb and there were flowers and incense and photos of him and stuff.
*  And it's basically after he got out of prison, eventually as an old man, and he went to India and Pakistan and like drew a following of like Pakistani and boys basically that are now men in their 20s and 30s.
*  And they occupy this sort of compound around his tomb.
*  And the one that we sort of bullshit away past was starting to get like a little suspicious of what we were doing and of our story, which is like that we were just tourists basically that sort of wondered by this place and were interested by it.
*  And all these dudes just started coming out of these.
*  They look like vacant buildings, but they clearly weren't, you know, all these like follows are cured to non and the translators like it's time to go now.
*  Time to go down. Time to go now. Time to go now.
*  And so, you know, we boogied out of there.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah. But he still has like followers and frankly even within ISKCON, he still has sort of quiet supporters.
*  Jesus.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. In Holy Hell, they talk about this guy that they kicked out.
*  He's still on the loose.
*  And they flew him to Hawaii.
*  And he started to call it in Hawaii.
*  And in the documentary, they show him in Hawaii with his devotees, just taking him around, opening the door for him, the whole deal.
*  It's so strange.
*  The cult thing is so bizarre because it's so it's so common.
*  And it just seems like there's so many people that want to be led by someone who has the answers.
*  Because most people are like you and I, they're like, try to do our best, live our life, fuck up, make mistakes, try to figure out what makes you happy.
*  Like, what's this all about? What is life?
*  And what are we what are we doing here?
*  And for some, when someone comes along, says, I have the answers, like, oh, guys, get the answers.
*  I need the fucking answers.
*  Like, what are the answers?
*  Yeah, I will say, you know, I spent a lot of time with with Hare Krishna, Krishna Consciousness, devotees, you know, and making that show.
*  And generally speaking, they are positive, peaceful souls.
*  They seem at peace with their place in the world in a way that, you know, I frankly found sort of compelling and attractive.
*  You know, so it's easy to see.
*  And maybe they do have the answers.
*  Maybe this ancient, like spiritual tradition is at least part of the answer.
*  It certainly can be an answer for some people if you are of the right mindset and if you're truly trying to be on that path.
*  But the problem is, it's so easy to be subverted.
*  It's like someone can come along and slowly kind of take over and and twist it.
*  True with any religion.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  I mean, look at televangelists.
*  Right.
*  I mean, there's real Christians out there that are really great, wonderful people that want to live by the teachings of Christ and and live a better, more just and holy life.
*  And they really do want to live like that.
*  And then there's psychos who want private jets and a giant arena to have all their followers and they want mansions.
*  And yeah, those guys are real.
*  And they they thrive.
*  They thrive.
*  They're everywhere.
*  Well, one of Kirtananda's enforcer and hitman was this guy named Thomas Drescher, whose Christian name was Tirta.
*  And he like drove the bus.
*  There was a school bus that would not he wasn't it wasn't driving kids around, but they bought a school bus to kind of take people from one part of the commune to another whatever.
*  But really why he was there, he was one of the dudes that like joined the he was in Vietnam, Vietnam combat vet.
*  I think I saw hardcore combat in Vietnam came back bent in the head was trying to find the answers, trying to find help, probably for PTSD found the Hare Krishnas join.
*  But the first temple or two that he was at, they were like something off about this guy.
*  So let's send him to Kirtananda.
*  Kirtananda met this dude and was like, oh, I got a purpose for you, brother.
*  You know, you're now enforcer number one.
*  And so if you fucked up, if like you weren't supposed to have a television or if you broke the rules or you defied Kirtananda anyway, if you if you got some money from your family, you didn't kick it to him.
*  Tirta came and paid you a visit.
*  Okay.
*  And when and when Kirtananda when Kirtananda started whacking dudes, basically, it was Tirta that did it.
*  You know, he just just shoot you.
*  And yeah, he was he was he was smart.
*  He buried Charles St.
*  Dennis's body.
*  He diverted a little creek and by damming it up and then buried the body and then took away the dam.
*  So the whole so the homicide cop Thomas Westfall, he was like, I was looking for that body everywhere and never thought to look under the little river.
*  You know, did they bring cadaver dogs to try to search for?
*  I don't think they brought dogs.
*  Eventually, like what happened was and the reason that Kirtananda, why they finally got him, is that Tirta flipped on him.
*  Now they arrested Tirta Thomas Drescher for murder because there was another devotee that got killed in Los Angeles that was also sort of outing Kirtananda and his corruption and whatnot.
*  And so they got Drescher.
*  And once he was in prison, like Kirtananda held the ceremony and like appointed him to this like high status within Krishna consciousness.
*  And of course, that was like a way to try and keep him quiet.
*  Right.
*  And he remained a believer.
*  But then there was this incident known as the Winnebago incident where Kirtananda, there's this was writing in Winnebago with this like I think was a little boy from like Pakistan or India.
*  And like curtains jostled open and he was seen in full view by multiple witnesses, like sodomizing this kid.
*  And like too many people saw it to cover it up.
*  Right.
*  And word got to Thomas Drescher in prison that this had happened.
*  And he heard from enough people who he trusted and believed that this was true, that he immediately flipped on Kirtananda and said like, yep, he paid me and ordered me to kill these guys.
*  And here's where you can find the box.
*  So he didn't know that he didn't believe it.
*  He didn't believe it.
*  He was a true believer.
*  You know, he didn't want to believe it.
*  So it was only when he was, you know, he didn't firsthand witness it himself, but it's only when he was faced with like multiple people who he trusted who were telling him we saw this.
*  It's true.
*  You know, then then to his credit, I think he he he immediately flipped.
*  You know, we tried to we tried to do an interview with him, but he we couldn't get into the prison to get him to go on camera.
*  So we do in the show.
*  We do have audio interview excerpts.
*  Wow.
*  One of the saddest things about holy hell is they talk to some of the devotees that had left and now they're lost because they had essentially they had left 20 years of their life with this guy.
*  And now here they were 50.
*  And like this one lady was like a dog walker now.
*  Right.
*  She had just kind of lost no real purpose in her life.
*  Yeah, her whole life was bullshit.
*  Yeah.
*  And some of the kids that grew up at New Vrindavan under Kirtan Ananda when it was it was legitimately occult by any definition.
*  You know, some of them are still followers of Krishna consciousness.
*  Some of them, you know, have left it way behind.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  I have nothing good to say about that.
*  But some of them are still like, you know, they're still like, they're still living in the same place.
*  They're still living in the same place.
*  And they believe that Kirtananda was an aberration.
*  I think that's probably right.
*  I think that's probably right, too.
*  I mean, my friend who's really into the Hare Krishnas, he's a very peaceful guy.
*  And the way he looks at it is like, you know, this is this is a way to live.
*  This is a possible way to live for some people that if they're not living in the same place, they're not living in the same place.
*  And I just I like not only like I buy into the idea of karma reincarnation that that reads is true.
*  That feels true to me and reincarnation.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Really.
*  What what what reads is true of karma.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think that's the way I see it.
*  And I think that's the way I see it.
*  And I think that's the way I see it.
*  And I think that's the way I see it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Really.
*  What reads is true.
*  What part reads is true.
*  Well, then we get into DMT.
*  Right.
*  All right.
*  I tried DMT.
*  When did you do that?
*  It was in 2013.
*  I'm a one and done DMT guy.
*  Don't need to do it again.
*  OK.
*  So here's my DMT story is that in 1999, I was super in the rave scene and I was in London at this three day rave called the Hare Krishnas.
*  Three day rave called the Warp.
*  And it was the kind of party where it's like someone ask you the time you'd be like it's nine thirty and they'd be like a.m. or p.m.
*  You know, it was great party.
*  Right.
*  Three days near the Tower of London, literally underground and underground party literally underground.
*  They had DJ rooms and dance rooms, but they also had these live performance rooms.
*  And I saw this performance artist called the techno pagan octopus Messiah.
*  OK.
*  And he was he was describing his DMT experience and I hadn't heard about DMT.
*  And then and by the way, his stuff is fantastic.
*  I think he's he's the he's come the closest of anybody except Terrence McKenna and actually capturing what the DMT experience is as a writer outside his performance with the rumor is performing.
*  There's this tent that just said deep deep meditation therapy.
*  I was like, oh, now I know what that means.
*  Right.
*  And I watched people doing DMT.
*  I was like, I was already rolling on three or four hits of MDMA.
*  So I was like, well, not tonight.
*  But if it ever comes my way, I'm going to do it.
*  I made myself a promise that night.
*  I'm not going to seek this out, but if it ever comes my way.
*  And then it did.
*  And in 2014, I just went to see a buddy of mine in Brooklyn.
*  I was working on a documentary out there and he was like, you want to try this?
*  I was like, OK, before I change my mind, let's do this.
*  And 15 minutes later, I believed in reincarnation.
*  I believed in karma and reincarnation.
*  So I felt a lot better about death.
*  Yeah, I felt a lot better about death, too, after I did it.
*  Well, with my experience was that I got a short glimpse that's sort of a user manual for the cosmos.
*  And in there was the knowledge that reincarnation is real, that the Buddhists have it right.
*  That after you die, you go to the Bardo for 49 days, your soul is out there.
*  You get a chance to kind of like assess the last life you led before you take another spin on the carousel.
*  Learn what you can get rewarded for your good deeds, suffer for your sins and then go back.
*  And I believe it, but I also just like it.
*  You know, I just like it.
*  It feels true to me in a way that like the evangelist or fundamentalist Christian idea of like you can just do a bunch of bad shit and then,
*  you know, promise yourself to Jesus and have a clean slate.
*  Fuck that. I'm not buying that.
*  You know, you know, but karma and reincarnation, I'm buying it.
*  There's something there.
*  I mean, it's fascinating that that concept has existed for so long, you know, and even the concept of heaven that existed for so long and angels and souls and all those things.
*  I think we have a very limited ability to grasp reality.
*  And I think that limited ability is biological.
*  It's kind of based upon our primate origins and what we are as a thing, as a biological entity.
*  We have essentially the tools that we need in order to survive.
*  And those tools are the ability to recognize danger and communicate and establish community and purpose and all these different things.
*  But when you have like real breakthrough psychedelic experiences, to me, it seems like it's allowing you a vision into all that exists,
*  not just what you're physically capable of seeing as a human being, but this chemical gateway or whatever it is that psychedelics give you allows you to see that these things.
*  What I got out of it is that everything is connected, every action, every thought, your thoughts, your life, your words, your your your deeds, the way you approach things, the way you respond to things,
*  that they're all connected in some very strange way.
*  And the living my life, the more I follow that as thinking that everything is all connected, the more my life has been more beautiful.
*  The more my life has been more rewarding and rich and more more pleasing, more filled with love and community.
*  And it's something that I kind of need to like remind myself all the time, because I think the biological entity has certain like human reward systems that are built into it.
*  Try to acquire resources to try to, you know, to try to establish dominance, to try to succeed.
*  There's all these different things that as a human, you know, people are they want success.
*  They want all these different things and that those things can kind of because you could see the physical manifestation of that work that that can sort of overcome the idea of the physical.
*  The idea that everything is connected.
*  And so that's, I think, why people cheat on their taxes or insider trade or do all these different things, fuck people over in business deals, and they don't think that they're going to experience any negative consequences of it.
*  But I don't think I don't think anybody gets away free.
*  Again, that's why I like the idea of Carmen reincarnation.
*  Yeah, you don't get away with something to it.
*  And it's again going back to the Vedas, like the oldest spiritual, you know, organized system of spiritual beliefs known for our species.
*  That's core to it.
*  Well, we have reincarnation, the most complicated organism.
*  We are the most complicated organism that we're currently aware of in terms of our ability to manipulate our environment, our ability to communicate our ability to create things.
*  Yeah, but we don't have an operator's manual, which is crazy.
*  So we're essentially running on this primate software that was really established.
*  It's almost like we have DOS or Windows 95 and we just keep refreshing it.
*  Right. You know, we don't.
*  There's no real new operating system.
*  And it's so filled with flaws that the human operating system is designed to ward off predators and to fight off neighboring tribes and try to avoid starvation and to try to make sure that your genes pass on and that your enemies genes don't.
*  And to, you know, to exist in 2024 and modern Western world with all of our technology and all of our knowledge and all the information that we have available with this ancient primate software is so problematic.
*  It's so fraught with peril.
*  There's so so many things that can go wrong.
*  So many people that go sideways with drug addiction and gambling addiction and sex addiction and this addiction and that addiction and so much chaos and, you know, thievery and violence and, you know, and deception and fraud.
*  And there's just so many things that exist that are negative but are tied to this concept of achieving and getting more, which is, you know, this this famine based mentality, this resource acquiring mentality that really is like the monkey stealing your sunglasses so it can get mangoes.
*  Right.
*  It's really, you know, no, no, totally agree.
*  And I felt like with DMT I got like a very short it was like, I felt like there was this sentient generally benevolent force out there in the cosmos that was like, Okay, look, I'm going to give you a lot of information, you're not going to be able to retain most of it.
*  Right. But you're ready. Here we go. Yeah. And one of the things that I brought back that I still believe a decade later, is that reincarnation is real. That's how it works. Karma is real. That's how it works. What you do in this life affects your next one.
*  So, and that also gives you like kind of the user's guide you're talking about about how to be a better person how to be a better species. Yeah, I didn't get a reincarnation vibe.
*  I'm not opposed to the idea of reincarnation, but I got a vibe that there's other things and there's other dimensions there's other there's other experiences and there's maybe levels of existence.
*  And that this existence that we're experiencing right now as human beings is just very strange confusing, almost like a puzzle that you are on this planet trying to solve and you can get distracted.
*  Yeah, yeah. You can get distracted by all sorts of things in this life. But the things that bring you happiness and love. You have to kind of like sort those out and and choose those amongst the different options that the puzzle gives you.
*  You know this podcast psychedelic salon? Yeah, okay. Sure. I have that guy on Lorenzo. Yeah, Lorenzo. Lorenzo Hegarty. He's great. Yeah, he is. I recently got to know him and he asked me to give you a message because I guess two or three months ago you were musing about whether or not he was still alive because he hadn't posted any new episodes recently. He is still alive. That's his message. Lorenzo's message. And after he heard that you'd raised that question he's been posting. Oh, that's great. Yeah, so can you connect me to him? Yeah, absolutely. Please. So Lorenzo, Lorenzo is a great guy. Yeah, he's a great guy. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. He's a
*  great guy. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. I mean, Lorenzo and I in the aforementioned techno pig and octopus Messiah are in the process of collaborating with some AI animation
*  Have you seen Dennis McKenna's assessment of it?
*  Yeah.
*  He broke it down on the podcast where
*  he was explaining to me the actual mechanisms that
*  would be involved in psilocybin accelerating the human mind
*  and the ability to form language and concepts and creativity
*  and all the different things that Terrence talked about.
*  But Dennis is a hardcore fact-based scientist.
*  You've had several great guests on there
*  talking about that theory.
*  But I've been like, there's about to be already,
*  it's showing signs, but there's about to be just a glut of AI
*  animation movies, even in documentaries.
*  I think AI animation is going to replace recreations,
*  where they hire actors to recreate stuff.
*  We did it in Christmas.
*  We recreated murder scenes using actors in firearms and stuff,
*  prop firearms.
*  But I think I've been approached with,
*  I don't even know how many ideas for AI animation docs.
*  They've just been like gimmick, gimmick, gimmick.
*  But this one really felt right.
*  A, I think that Terrence McKenna would
*  have loved the idea of using AI animation
*  to show the evolution of our species
*  as they pick the mushrooms out of the cow shit and stuff.
*  And also one idea that we're toying with,
*  I think we'll go forward with now that we've actually,
*  I think we've got the technology actually dialed in,
*  where we built this AI world, this Terrence McKenna AI
*  world, where we can give it ideas
*  and it'll spit back imagery to us that feels right,
*  is building some sort of AI avatar of Terrence McKenna.
*  So the idea is that the spine of the documentary
*  will be any time where, because Lorenzo has incredible archives
*  of Terrence McKenna, stuff that nobody else has.
*  Yeah, he has everything.
*  And any time you're hearing Terrence McKenna's voice
*  describing the stoned ape theory,
*  we'll take people through it step by step,
*  you'll be seeing AI animation of what he's describing.
*  So you're hearing Terrence McKenna's voice, but seeing AI.
*  So for people who don't know what the stoned ape theory is,
*  we should probably explain it to them for people
*  who have never heard it before.
*  And the concept is that at one point in evolution,
*  there was climate change and that these rainforests,
*  tropical rainforests had receded into grasslands
*  and that these primates had started
*  experimenting with different food sources
*  by flipping over cow patties and looking for grubs
*  and all these different things.
*  And one of the things that they would do
*  is probably test the mushrooms that
*  were growing in the cow patties.
*  And in many places where psilocybin exists,
*  these things are extremely prevalent.
*  Like my friend Duncan, who grew up
*  in Asheville, North Carolina, told me
*  that mushrooms were so prevalent that the local ranchers,
*  they started putting feed in with the cattle feed,
*  some sort of anti-fungal thing to keep fungus
*  from growing in cow shit.
*  Because so many kids were going out to the field
*  and picking psilocybin mushrooms.
*  He's like, they were everywhere.
*  They were everywhere.
*  And so the concept is that low doses of psilocybin
*  increase visual acuity, make people more amorous.
*  So it probably heightened sexual arousal,
*  made people more likely to breed,
*  and made people more curious.
*  Probably because of the increase in visual acuity,
*  made people better hunters.
*  There's studies that have been done.
*  I forget what the scientist did.
*  It was a hardcore non-psychedelic scientist
*  who did studies on edge detection with patients.
*  You know these studies?
*  And it showed that people under the influence of psilocybin
*  can detect deviants.
*  So if you have two parallel lines
*  and one slightly deviates from parallel,
*  the people on psilocybin can predict it much quicker,
*  can see it much quicker than the people not on psilocybin,
*  which is fascinating.
*  And you'd be a much better hunter.
*  Much better hunter.
*  And much better at surviving being hunted.
*  Also just be more tuned into things.
*  You're more aware of, like, I know a lot of people
*  that use psilocybin when they play certain sports.
*  And they think that psilocybin, low doses.
*  It's like low doses, yeah.
*  Yeah, low doses for playing pool and things like that.
*  You just have a better understanding of what's happening.
*  I attest to it.
*  Microdoses for chess.
*  Chess, huh?
*  Yeah.
*  Does it help you, really?
*  I think it does.
*  Actually, I can demonstrate that it does, you know,
*  in my game ratings.
*  Really?
*  Absolutely.
*  Interesting.
*  Now, I don't know if I buy the stone-dape theory
*  in the same way that I fully buy into the concept of the bardo
*  and reincarnation and karma and all that.
*  But it's sure fucking fun to think about, man.
*  Well, doesn't it?
*  I mean, it mimics DMT.
*  Like, psilocybin and dimethyltryptamine
*  are very closely related.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I think when it's broken down,
*  I think I'm going to fuck this up.
*  But I think it's N4-phara-loxy and dimethyltryptamine.
*  It's like it's very close to what dimethyltryptamine is.
*  And we also know that dimethyltryptamine
*  is endogenously produced.
*  It's produced in the human brain.
*  We don't even understand why.
*  And that's Rick Strassman, who wrote that book, DMT,
*  The Spirit Molecules, talked about that.
*  And they've done a lot of great research at the Cottonwood
*  Research Foundation, trying to determine, like,
*  where it's produced, why it's produced.
*  They used to think it was just produced by the pineal gland.
*  Now they think, I believe, it's produced by the whole brain.
*  And this thing that these primates were finding
*  was giving them that and giving them
*  more of an understanding of the world around them
*  and expanding the brain.
*  And the other thing about the concept of the stone-dape theory
*  is this bizarre fact in the history of humans
*  that in the entire species, like the record of species,
*  one of the biggest mysteries is the doubling
*  of the human brain size over a period of two million years.
*  And McKenna says that that coincides
*  with this exact same time period where the tropical rainforests
*  were receding into grasslands.
*  And then they believed that these primates were
*  experimenting on new food sources.
*  So there's all these things that line up with it.
*  And it makes it a fascinating idea.
*  But if you think about, like, if they found out
*  that this thing gives them this feeling
*  and they were repeatedly using it over and over and over again,
*  and then their offspring did it and their offspring did it,
*  and you're playing this out over a couple million years,
*  you could see how this would happen.
*  Also the development of language.
*  Yes.
*  The glossalia.
*  Yeah, glossalia.
*  Thank you.
*  Like high doses.
*  Activates the language center.
*  So like I said, I'm not sure I buy it,
*  but it should be a fun movie to make.
*  Well, something happened.
*  Yeah.
*  It's very obvious that something happened that separated us
*  from all the other primates, like in a radical way.
*  We don't look anything like them.
*  We have abilities and we have so many attributes that
*  are far beyond any other primate.
*  And it kind of makes sense.
*  And also there's people that can achieve those states
*  without psychedelics, which is fascinating.
*  And I've gone pretty close with some breathing exercises,
*  and especially breathing exercises
*  in sensory deprivation.
*  You can achieve some definite psychedelic states.
*  I haven't had the full visual effects
*  that are available with DMT.
*  But boy, you definitely get to some bizarre place
*  where if it was a drug, it would be a very popular drug.
*  Well, back to the Christians.
*  That's what Prabhupada was preaching.
*  And a lot of his early devotees were
*  people that had taken a lot of acid or mescaline or peyote
*  and felt like they were getting glimpses of something,
*  but they couldn't understand it.
*  And he's like, let me show you how to get there
*  without the drugs.
*  And what was Prabhupada using to try to get there?
*  Meditation.
*  Just deep meditation.
*  Yeah, I think there's chanting of ancient sacred mantras
*  and meditation.
*  Well, that's the other thing that happens with DMT rituals,
*  that they play Ikaros.
*  These ancient South American songs that sort of enhance
*  the experience.
*  When you do DMT with Ikaros playing,
*  the DMT dances to the sound.
*  And it's very strange to watch.
*  It's beautiful, bizarre.
*  And it's overwhelming.
*  It's hard to believe that it's really
*  happening while it's happening.
*  And you've got to kind of let go and just let it happen.
*  And experience it.
*  Because you're so blown away by it all,
*  it's hard to just not just go, what the fuck,
*  like every five seconds.
*  You've got to kind of just take it in and accept it.
*  I tried to get my dad to try DMT.
*  My dad died recently.
*  And about six months ago, I tried to get him to try DMT.
*  I was like, listen, until I tried this,
*  dad, I was like, same as you, basically Spock,
*  cold logic reason.
*  That's my dad.
*  Super smart, like mathematical genius was my dad.
*  And he was like, well, it sounds interesting.
*  But I guess if you're right, I'll find out on my own.
*  Because I was like, this is kind of like the trailer
*  for the movie, dad.
*  Interesting.
*  I'll find out on my own.
*  Interesting.
*  He died like two weeks ago while I was in Ukraine.
*  Oh, wow.
*  What were you doing in Ukraine?
*  I was reporting.
*  I was working.
*  I wasn't filming.
*  But I was doing some research.
*  And I was in a war zone.
*  I mean, the whole fucking country is a war zone.
*  But I was in a war zone where communications were dicey
*  at best.
*  And I got a text message from my wife on Signal.
*  And it was like, your dad's heart valve is failing rapidly.
*  He's in the hospital.
*  He's probably got like 48 hours to live.
*  And the airspace over Ukraine is closed.
*  So there's no way that I could get
*  from where I was in Ukraine to Anchorage, Alaska,
*  to be with him.
*  And so I was just sending text messages on Signal
*  to the nurses.
*  And they were reading them to him.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  And then I was able to record one voice memo
*  right as he was going.
*  Because the last sense to go when you're dying
*  is sense of hearing.
*  And they played him like a message from me.
*  Wow.
*  But to answer your question, what was I doing in Ukraine?
*  I'm looking into a possible documentary
*  that would be set against the backdrop of the current war,
*  but that would be more about what is actually
*  the true nature of corruption in Ukraine.
*  And what has it been?
*  And what was it in the 90s?
*  Yeah.
*  And what is it today?
*  And how has the US State Department kind of fucked up
*  again in the same way that we did in Vietnam and every war,
*  like Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, by backing the wrong horses?
*  You know?
*  We've never not fucked up.
*  Yeah.
*  There's never been one, whether it's
*  Libya or Afghanistan, Iraq.
*  There's not one we could point to like, we nailed that one.
*  Right.
*  There's not one.
*  Right.
*  There's not one.
*  Right.
*  And when there was so much resistance to the concept
*  that Ukraine was corrupt when we first started backing them,
*  that was what was fascinating to me,
*  because it was always talked about how corrupt Ukraine was.
*  It was always talked about.
*  And then all of a sudden, this was a foreboding topic.
*  Like, no, Russia is the aggressor and the invader,
*  and Ukraine are their angels.
*  And they're like, wait a minute.
*  That's not reality.
*  Well, it's also that the US government would be like, OK,
*  we would sort of designate who was corrupt and who wasn't.
*  I mean, look, the US went through its own sort
*  of oligarchy, like robber baron phase in the late 1800s.
*  That was like after we'd been a democracy for 100 years.
*  Unfortunately, it's kind of a step
*  on the evolution of free democracies
*  to have this phase where you're like,
*  things are super corrupt.
*  I spent some time at an orthodox monastery in Ukraine
*  last month, and I asked the sort of head of the monastery,
*  like, what would you have to do to get rid
*  of corruption in this country?
*  He's like, well, I'm a man of God.
*  He's speaking through an interpreter.
*  He's like, I'm a man of God, so I'm not advocating this.
*  But what you could do is you could take,
*  because the main problem in Ukraine right now,
*  as I understand it, is the judicial system.
*  They have what they call telephone law, which
*  is basically like before a judge makes a ruling,
*  he gets a phone call telling him which way to rule.
*  And so the head of this monastery,
*  he was like, you could line up every judge and shoot them.
*  And then all the judges or all the government officials
*  that come to their funerals shoot them and do that two
*  or three times.
*  And then we might be able to start over.
*  He was saying, that's how systemic this is.
*  But I mean.
*  Man of God's telling you this.
*  That's a guy who's reached the limits.
*  Oh my god.
*  But I'll tell you, my time in Ukraine
*  really changed my perspective on that war.
*  And I came back a real sort of hawk
*  thinking that we should fully support Ukraine in the war.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Why is that?
*  Part of it was just being with the people who the Ukraine,
*  I just like the Ukrainians in a way
*  that I've been to other former Soviet bloc countries.
*  And it's kind of like, I won't name any of them,
*  but I just feel like, I'm not sure you guys are really
*  down with the freedom and democracy thing.
*  It seems like you were subjugated for a while
*  and you just didn't get the same vibe.
*  I think the Ukrainians are legitimately
*  freedom loving people that have been
*  under the thumb of corrupt leadership for decades now.
*  But part of it was, it was something very enthralling
*  about being in a place where everyone is so unified.
*  This country under attack being invaded by a hostile force.
*  Now these are the Ukrainians that have stayed behind.
*  But there's still a lot of them.
*  I mean, and just that coming from America
*  where everything is so splintered and divided now
*  and to be in a place where everyone is so on the same page,
*  there is something very attractive about that.
*  Well, that is what happens when you get invaded.
*  Do you remember what it was like in America after 9-11?
*  Right after 9-11.
*  It was the most united this country has ever been.
*  It's a horrible thing to say
*  because it's not what you ever want to happen again
*  to wake everybody up.
*  But it was the thing that was required
*  to make people put American flags on their cars.
*  And it was, in a lot of ways, I mean,
*  it was a horrible tragedy, but in a lot of ways
*  the reaction to it was very beautiful.
*  There was so many people that were so,
*  I was in New York City like just a few weeks
*  or a few months after 9-11 and everybody was friendly.
*  It was crazy.
*  It was like everybody was just so blown away
*  by the experience of being attacked
*  and so just shaken out of it and so aware
*  of how fortunate they were to not be one of those people
*  who died and that we are legitimately all together
*  and that there are forces out there that are evil
*  and that we have to stay united.
*  And I hate to think that that's what's required
*  to wake people up from this division.
*  But I was wondering, I wonder if maybe the division
*  that we have in this country is because of the fact
*  that we're never attacked and because of the fact
*  that we only experienced a few of the Pearl Harbor, 9-11.
*  There's only a few of these moments
*  where we've had to wake up.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  The Aleutian Islands actually in Alaska were attacked
*  and occupied by Japanese forces in World War II.
*  Oh really? A little known fact.
*  Yeah, that was actually American territory.
*  I didn't know that.
*  But I mean, we fucking, man, I mean,
*  the Ukrainians, they had nuclear weapons and in 1994,
*  the quote unquote West, the US and the UK
*  basically convinced them to give up their nukes
*  in exchange for a guarantee that we would help them
*  protect their sovereign territory.
*  Right, yeah.
*  Yeah, that was right after the fall of the Soviet Union.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  There's so many factors, right?
*  There's the NATO encroaching on Russia's territory.
*  I mean, in 2004, NATO started handing out membership cards
*  like fucking crackerjack prizes, right?
*  Putin gets reelected in 2004, 20 years ago,
*  and all of a sudden, all these former Soviet
*  small territories are now NATO countries.
*  Hey, you wanna be NATO?
*  Well, great, now let's sign up
*  for a mutual defense treaty with Lithuania.
*  Nothing against Lithuanians, but fuck, man,
*  this is getting serious.
*  It's very serious.
*  What happens if he invades a NATO country?
*  What are we gonna do?
*  Right.
*  Because China's watching, and I'll tell ya,
*  I've been, under fire would be over dramatic,
*  but I've had quite a few Iranian fucking Shahid drones
*  launched in my general direction recently.
*  It gives you another perspective on Russia's support
*  for Iran and vice versa, like mutual enemy of ours.
*  Those are Iranian fucking drones being shot at us.
*  And I don't know, Russia recently had Hamas,
*  like have a delegation from Hamas visit the Kremlin.
*  I mean, what the fuck, man?
*  Really? Yeah.
*  So anyway.
*  This is a fucking sketchy time, man.
*  It really is. It's such a sketchy time.
*  It's to say like, oh, World War III is imminent.
*  It sounds doomsayer, but it feels like it could go that way.
*  China, they're looking at us.
*  That's the problem if we sort of showed our ass
*  and backed down, if Putin keeps going,
*  then China may just test that red line with Taiwan.
*  Yeah, well, I think they're preparing for that.
*  At least when I've talked to people that understand.
*  You know, I think that the war in Ukraine
*  could have been prevented.
*  I think that there was this false dichotomy
*  where there were forces in the US government,
*  and this is part of the documentary I wanna make,
*  is about that forced, it was like,
*  you either have to be a puppet of Russia or our puppet.
*  You have to either have to be NATO,
*  or there's no middle ground.
*  When in fact, I think that Ukraine could have been a bridge,
*  a peaceful bridge between Russia and the quote unquote West,
*  where maybe it could have joined the European Union
*  economically free trade, but not joined NATO, right?
*  Because that's what Putin was so adamant against.
*  And you understand, I mean, I think he's a war criminal,
*  fucking power mad asshole, right?
*  But you can sort of see from his perspective,
*  if you look at a map and you start to see
*  all these NATO countries around Russia,
*  you kind of see what motivates him.
*  Well, that's what people in the State Department
*  had always said that was his red line.
*  His red line was Ukraine.
*  And then when they're trying to get Ukraine to join NATO,
*  it's like, what are we doing?
*  What are we doing?
*  Are we bringing about World War III and why?
*  And how much money's being spent?
*  And where's that money going?
*  And who's got a vested interest
*  in keeping that money flowing?
*  That's where it gets scary.
*  Right, that's what I'm looking into.
*  And I don't wanna tip my hand too much,
*  but I think I've got pretty convincing evidence
*  that the US Department of Justice has been used
*  by the US State Department to further US foreign policy
*  interests in Ukraine in ways that aren't really right.
*  Either bringing criminal charges against people in the US,
*  but Ukrainians, charging them with crimes in the US,
*  including some people that have never even set foot
*  in the United States, charging with crimes,
*  or getting them out of trouble,
*  dropping criminal charges against them.
*  Just sort of like, and again, it goes back to our designating,
*  you're a good guy, you're a bad guy.
*  You're corrupt, you're not, even though they're both
*  just grabbing billions with both hands.
*  It's a fucking scary time, man.
*  It really is.
*  It's wild to me that Zelensky is the president too.
*  You have essentially a comedian who played the president
*  on a television show.
*  And they're like, we like you.
*  If they held an election today, he would not be reelected.
*  No?
*  No, no.
*  But then they support him.
*  It's interesting, it's like you ask them,
*  do you support the president?
*  They say yes, like we're at war.
*  Would you vote for him?
*  No.
*  What was their opposition?
*  I think he's mismanaging the war.
*  And also I think they suspect that he's corrupt.
*  And I think he probably is.
*  But the fact that, look, the fact that 50 cents
*  of every dollar that we send there,
*  this isn't actually how it goes down,
*  but even if that was the case,
*  is going into somebody's pocket doesn't mean
*  that we can just turn Ukraine over to Russia, in my opinion.
*  I think that we should be backing them full on, militarily.
*  Not with US troops, but giving them what they need to fight.
*  Because I talked to a lot of special forces guys over there.
*  They're like basically like those Russian human waves attacks.
*  We're just like mowing these guys,
*  it's not even really combat.
*  We're just mowing these guys down
*  until we run out of bullets and then we have to retreat.
*  Those are the battles, that's what Putin's able to do.
*  Because he's got so many guys.
*  And he's also letting people out of jail.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Letting people out of jail and giving them,
*  you serve and your time, your sentence is rescinded.
*  Well, so people think of Russia
*  and they think of Moscow and St. Petersburg.
*  But you look at that country on a map, it's fucking massive.
*  There's so much territory east of the Earl Mountains.
*  It's just a bunch of villages,
*  what we call flyover country, right?
*  Well, Putin is offering deals like sign up,
*  where it's like more money than they make in a year,
*  per month, A, and then B, if you're killed,
*  your family's set up for life.
*  They can buy a house, whatever.
*  So very attractive offers for these really poor people
*  from rural Russia.
*  And then they're using them as just human cannon fodder.
*  100%, 100%.
*  Whew.
*  I just can't remember a time in my life
*  where things had just seemed so unhinged.
*  No, no, I asked my parents about that too.
*  I'm looking at my dad before he passed.
*  They were like, no, we don't remember.
*  Even like Watergate, Vietnam,
*  they weren't really old enough
*  to remember the Great Depression,
*  but even that was just sort of limited to the US.
*  I mean, I know there are global effects of that,
*  ricochets of that, but yeah.
*  It feels like it could go sideways on us in a hurry.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it does.
*  And then what does that look like?
*  That's what's terrifying.
*  What's terrifying is if you're willing to do,
*  like let's say what Israel's doing in Gaza,
*  if you're willing to almost eliminate a city,
*  just bomb the fuck out of a city,
*  and kill who knows how many innocents,
*  what are the numbers?
*  It's 30,000, I don't know what the numbers are.
*  What's the line that keeps you from dropping a nuke
*  that kills 300,000?
*  What's the line?
*  Like when, why are we,
*  why do we have this idea that it won't accelerate to that
*  when it has in the past?
*  It's just because it only did,
*  when we did it once in Japan in 1945, is that what it is?
*  I agree with your assessment of that danger 100%.
*  That's another reason why I think that we have to help
*  Ukraine stop Putin now,
*  because if he keeps going into Ukraine,
*  and then he invades a NATO country,
*  and we decide that we've got to go up against him.
*  Is there any evidence that he would do that?
*  That he would invade a NATO country?
*  I don't think he'll stop.
*  I think, dude, he's been in power for a long time
*  for a leader of Russia.
*  I think that he, I mean,
*  I watched that Tucker Carlson interview, right?
*  And that history lesson that he delivered at the beginning,
*  that everyone was like, what the fuck is he talking about?
*  And Tucker just looked baffled.
*  I was, I got it.
*  I actually thought I'm getting an insight
*  into Putin's motivations and the way that he sees himself,
*  which is a historic figure.
*  He sees himself as someone
*  who's gonna restore a Russian empire.
*  He spends all day in the halls of the Kremlin
*  with portraits of Ivan the Terrible
*  and Catherine the Great, right?
*  And I think that he's seeing himself
*  as not the leader of a free country, certainly,
*  but someone who's gonna restore a Russian empire.
*  So no, I absolutely do not think he will stop with Ukraine.
*  No way.
*  So then if he doesn't,
*  and then he invades a NATO country
*  and we go up against him,
*  man, those documents leaked recently from Russia
*  that was showing what their lines were
*  for when they would start using quote unquote tactical nukes.
*  And, you know, I think he'd do it.
*  I think he'd do it.
*  I don't think he will.
*  What are the lines?
*  Well, they were, whatever.
*  If they started to lose a certain percentage of troops,
*  I can't recall the specifics,
*  but they were like shockingly liberal
*  on when they would start to use tactical nukes
*  on the battlefield in Europe.
*  Like if they started to have certain percentages
*  of battlefield losses,
*  we're not in the current situation,
*  but like as they go further into Ukraine
*  or in a war that came into Russian territory.
*  So I just think we should stop this shit now,
*  this shit being Putin.
*  Is it possible?
*  I think it is possible.
*  I think it's possible to essentially
*  let him have.
*  What's this, Jamie?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Criteria for a potential nuke response
*  range from an enemy incursion on Russian territory
*  to more specific triggers,
*  such as the destruction of 20% of Russia's
*  strategic ballistic missile submarines.
*  This is the first time we've seen documents like this
*  reported in the public domain, said Alexander,
*  how do you say that?
*  Gubuev?
*  Your guess is a good one.
*  Gubuev, director of Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin.
*  They show that the operational threshold
*  for using nuclear weapons is pretty low
*  if the desired result can't be achieved
*  through conventional means.
*  Russia's tactical nuclear weapons,
*  which can be delivered by land or sea launched missiles
*  from or from an aircraft are designed
*  for limited battlefield use in Europe and Asia,
*  as opposed to the larger strategic weapons
*  intended to target US modern tactical warheads
*  can still release significantly more energy
*  than the weapons dropped on Nagasaki in Hiroshima in 1945.
*  Although the files date back 10 years or more,
*  experts claim they remain relevant
*  to current Russian military doctrine.
*  The documents were shown to the FT by Western sources.
*  Pfft.
*  So to answer your question,
*  I think that the territory that Putin has taken,
*  and again, also, just like we didn't back him up
*  after the security assurances that we gave,
*  we the US gave Ukraine in 1994, 2014, right?
*  There was that revolution in Ukraine.
*  And in response, Putin invaded Crimea
*  with the little green man,
*  the guys that didn't have an insignia.
*  And the US State Department went to,
*  and Ukraine was gonna fight.
*  And the US State Department went to Kiev
*  and was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
*  chill out, chill out, chill out.
*  Just let him have Crimea.
*  We'll make sure he stops there.
*  Let's not escalate things, okay?
*  So we gave him our word a second time,
*  and then we broke it.
*  So to answer your question,
*  I think that that territory that Putin has seized,
*  my impression from talking with a lot of Ukrainians
*  in recent weeks has been that they feel like Ukraine
*  could still be Ukraine without that territory.
*  Like the people, basically,
*  you could have a three-week period
*  where people could either move there
*  if they wanna be Russians,
*  or they can leave if they wanna be Ukrainians.
*  And then you could have a kind of a North Korea,
*  South Korea DMZ kind of situation.
*  I think that's probably the best possible outcome right now.
*  But even to do that, again,
*  we've got to properly arm the Ukrainians
*  so that they can stop Putin from moving further
*  into their country and actually taking territory
*  that they could not live without.
*  So do you think ultimately he plans on taking all of Ukraine?
*  Yes, 100%.
*  I think he's 100%.
*  I mean, he already, it was,
*  when I was in Kiev and I went to how close the fighting
*  actually got to the capital city,
*  it was shocking how close it was.
*  Like that town, Butcha,
*  where there was all those atrocities committed.
*  I mean, there was this one,
*  I saw this one auto, this like massive graveyards
*  of like automobiles.
*  And what happened was people were trying to get out
*  of this town as the Russian troops,
*  the Russian, because they invaded from Belarus,
*  from the North, and they came in
*  and they're trying to go like lightning strike on Kiev.
*  And they got within, I think, 10, 12 kilometers
*  of the city.
*  And then they got stopped
*  because the guys started blowing bridges,
*  special forces started blowing bridges
*  and hitting them with javelins and stuff.
*  And they actually stopped them,
*  like incredibly brave fighting.
*  But there was this one,
*  just like I came across this just pile
*  of just hundreds of blown up cars.
*  And I asked the locals about it.
*  And some of them have been like painted now with,
*  sunflowers and Slava, Ukraine, glory to Ukraine.
*  And artists are trying to make this less sort of macabre.
*  But what it was, was when the Russians invaded
*  two years ago, like hundreds of families
*  piled in their cars and there was one road out of town,
*  but it was a trap.
*  And the Russians cut it off on both sides.
*  And then methodically using tanks,
*  blew up these cars full of civilians.
*  Just brutal shit.
*  And I know there's still like brutal shit on all sides,
*  in all wars.
*  But to see it firsthand like that,
*  to talk to people that saw that happen was,
*  it's tough.
*  Yeah.
*  What is it like going over there?
*  Like leaving America and going over there to try,
*  I mean, what was the-
*  Well the craziest thing was, you can just walk in.
*  It was like, it's harder to go into Tijuana
*  than it is to go to Ukraine.
*  Like you could just, like I went in through,
*  it's, I came out, yes, that's it.
*  I went in, I came out through Poland.
*  And I went in through Romania.
*  Jesus Christ, with all those cars.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  Oh my God.
*  So I flew to Bucharest and then drove about 10 hours
*  to the border and then just like walked across
*  with my duffel bag and US passport.
*  It's really easy to get in.
*  You just walked across?
*  Yeah, just walked right across.
*  It was like five minutes.
*  Did you have it set up already to talk to people?
*  I did.
*  I had set up security.
*  I had really good security.
*  These guys were like special forces guys,
*  a tank hunting team actually that had just rotated
*  off the front after fighting for two years.
*  And we're, so basically like keeping me alive
*  as a vacation for them.
*  But they were really, and I got to be really good friends
*  with this one dude, especially the guy that was like,
*  cause they worked in different ways.
*  So it was a team, but like there was one guy
*  that was like attached to my hip.
*  He was just with me 24 seven, whose name was Andre.
*  And I got to be really good buddies with this guy,
*  just using like Google translate.
*  Oh wow.
*  Even when the interpreter wasn't around,
*  just like really clicked with this guy.
*  Anyway, but yeah, I did have it set up
*  before I had an interpreter, a driver and security.
*  And then I had conversations that I'd lined up,
*  but a lot of it was people had documents
*  or people had information that the only way
*  I was going to get these documents
*  or have them tell me this information was to go to Ukraine.
*  It was the only way they were going to trust it, trust me.
*  How much different was it than what you expected?
*  Well, it's, I really, back to my new love
*  for the Ukrainian people in Kiev, like, or Lviv,
*  which is a fantastic city.
*  It's in Eastern Ukraine near the Polish border.
*  You know, it's like, you wouldn't,
*  until the rockets and the Iranian drones
*  start flying into the city,
*  you wouldn't know anything was going on.
*  People are out dressed nicely, going to dinner,
*  going to bars, going to clubs, like they're out and about,
*  you know, and then all of a sudden
*  the air raid sirens go off.
*  And there's this app that I jokingly texted my wife.
*  I was like, this is the worst video game ever,
*  because it's this app that shows you what's incoming,
*  like what kind of missiles and how many
*  and what kind of drones and how many.
*  And then as the air defense system shoot them down,
*  they like blip off the screen, you know?
*  So you can like see like the shit's coming your way
*  and like how many are they shooting down?
*  It's like the worst version of missile command,
*  because you can't actually do anything, right?
*  But yet you're watching it.
*  In real time.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  God.
*  So.
*  And this is just an app you can get for your phone?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Well, the security guys had it.
*  I don't know if anybody, everybody has an app on their phone
*  that alerts them when there's incoming missiles or drones.
*  Right?
*  And how do they know that that app
*  has not been compromised?
*  How do they know? Great question.
*  I don't know. Great question.
*  Is this an app that's, is it Windows and Android?
*  You could, yes, you could get it on your phone right now.
*  As a matter of fact, before I went to Ukraine,
*  I downloaded it and installed it.
*  And I thought it'd be geofenced.
*  But it was like the middle of the night in New Mexico
*  and all of a sudden it's like,
*  air raid, air raid, missiles incoming, you know,
*  like seek shelter.
*  So it's, if anybody wants to experience
*  what it's like to be a Ukrainian right now,
*  you can download this app.
*  What is it called?
*  Let's take a look.
*  Is it available for all phone platforms?
*  Yes, anybody can get it.
*  I may have taken it off actually,
*  but I'm sure if you just like Google like Ukrainian,
*  you know, air raid app.
*  Did you take it off because you're tired of seeing air raids?
*  Yes, yeah.
*  I didn't want it to sound anymore.
*  So, I mean, you can pick which parts of the country
*  you want it to alert you to, but yeah.
*  I mean, it was,
*  it was one day where the security guys were like,
*  it's not safe to drive from where we were to Kiev tomorrow.
*  So that's the bad news.
*  Cause every night we would have a go, no go
*  kind of meeting for the next day.
*  And that was the one time that they were like, no go, no go.
*  Too much shit's going on.
*  It's not safe to drive, you know, eight hours to Kiev.
*  Good news is it's snowing in the Carpathian mountains.
*  So we're going to go skiing.
*  And I was like, what?
*  And so the next day we did,
*  we like drove five hours up in the mountains
*  and there's this full on ski resort.
*  And there's just people like the hundreds of families out
*  skiing and there's the fucking war going on.
*  And it's in, it's like a day of a nationwide red alert,
*  which means that like missiles were hitting all over.
*  And so people are watching this app on their phone
*  and you can see the stuff that's coming, you know,
*  to the Oblast, which is like a state, you know,
*  that we're in.
*  And as the stuff is being shot down,
*  like people are like cheering from the chair lifts.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  That's what I mean, it's just like that fucking fuck you
*  spirit that they have is I think impressive.
*  Wow. Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I have a friend from Israel and
*  I had, he's a kickboxing coach, my friend Shuki.
*  And when he was living in America, he lives in Israel now,
*  but when he was living in America,
*  I went over his house for dinner and
*  him and his wife, they'd be playing the bongos and dancing.
*  And, and I'm like, you guys are like,
*  you have so much spirit, like you're so filled with fun.
*  And he's like, my friend, when you live in Israel,
*  he goes every day, like you could die.
*  Every day is party, party, have a good time, enjoy your life.
*  And it's like the same kind of thing,
*  unfortunately, like post 9 11,
*  like you need something horrible to happen for you to
*  appreciate the good and appreciate peace and appreciate joy.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's what's, that's a crazy thought is that
*  the thing that's going to cure what ails us is conflict and
*  getting together and banding together to fight a common evil,
*  which is just so bizarre.
*  Or if we had like a war of the worlds kind of thing,
*  like a hostile, like alien race attacked earth.
*  You remember when Ronald Reagan said that to the UN?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's like the UFO fanatics favorite speech when Ronald
*  Reagan said, if you're faced with a hostile threat from an alien
*  world, how quickly we would put aside our differences.
*  Yeah.
*  That's true.
*  I mean, that's one of the things that astronauts always
*  talk about when they go to the space station.
*  So you look down on the earth and you go, my God, what are we doing?
*  Right.
*  How are we in conflict with each other over lines in the dirt?
*  Imaginary lines in the dirt that we create for what?
*  Like who's doing this and why are we doing this?
*  We should all be together.
*  We're, we're, we're this one species that can communicate with each other,
*  attach this ball that's hurling through infinity.
*  And yet our territorial primate instincts have us engaged in this
*  insane conflict that no one thinks is ever going to end.
*  If you asked anyone today, can you achieve in our lifetime, no war?
*  Most people will say that's not possible, which is so strange and tragic.
*  Well, it's also so crazy because it's a function of human beings in large
*  numbers, right?
*  Because like if we were in this room together and he said, could you
*  imagine all three of us get along?
*  Of course, easily.
*  I couldn't imagine us not getting along.
*  We can talk.
*  We will figure things out.
*  We have resources.
*  Yeah, we'll be fine.
*  Make it 3 million people, make it 30 million, make it 300 million.
*  And now you've got problems.
*  Right.
*  And it's just, and it seems to be always the same thing that you see
*  when you have a cult, you have leaders and the leaders don't necessarily
*  have the best intentions for everyone.
*  They have the best intentions for themselves and for the people that
*  are providing them with money.
*  And this is, this is the trap that we're all stuck in.
*  Everyone on earth, all of us being led by groups that decide that they're
*  in control of these massive numbers of people and they want control of
*  the resources of these other territories.
*  And they want to do something to those people and they'll have people
*  convinced this is your enemy.
*  You have to go kill them.
*  People that you've never met, you have no issue with.
*  You don't know anything about them.
*  You've literally never seen them before.
*  You may not know them, but you know them.
*  You've literally never seen them before.
*  You might not ever see them even when you're killing them.
*  And this is the thing that we don't believe could ever be stopped in our
*  lifetime, which is insane.
*  If you, if you really start to think about it that way, it sounds so
*  insane, like if you, if you were approached by an alien life form that
*  said, what is the source of all this murder and killing and destruction?
*  Like, what is this?
*  It's like, oh, we're, we're being led.
*  We're a group and we're being led by the people that are in charge of this
*  group that are very secretive and that are being influenced by massive amounts
*  of money and the military industrial complex.
*  And they've got everyone convinced that you have to divert all of our resources
*  into attacking this other group that is opposed to our way of life.
*  They hate us for our freedom, whatever the fuck it is.
*  And that this is what we have to do now.
*  They would be like, what is wrong with you fucking people?
*  Like what, what a bizarre wounded tainted species that you think like this.
*  And not, not just think like this, but think it's impossible to
*  imagine this not existing.
*  This the most insane venture that human beings can ever engage in.
*  And you think it's impossible for that to not be the case.
*  But almost all logical people, if you ask them is, could you
*  imagine no war in your lifetime?
*  No, not now.
*  No, not now.
*  I mean, I, you know, I just turned 53 and I think that like, when I was a young
*  man, I had a lot more optimism, right?
*  And I don't think it was just a function of like we grow into being young in the
*  nineties, I think was like the best.
*  It was like the time of peace and prosperity.
*  Yeah.
*  And it seemed like we could get to Star Trek, right?
*  It seemed like we could maybe get there.
*  Right.
*  Even Star Trek, the cold war in Klingons.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you know, you've got to fight somebody.
*  Why?
*  It seems so crazy.
*  I wonder if, I mean, this is going to get really weird, but I wonder if
*  that's where AI is leading us.
*  I re I really genuinely do.
*  I wonder if the limitations of our primate architecture will not allow us to
*  escape this never ending cycle of war.
*  And that may be the only thing that will would be an intelligence that far
*  exceeds our own and doesn't have the same limitations, motivations, human
*  reward systems, all the things that hold us in these patterns and that an
*  artificial intelligence that is far superior to what we're capable of
*  generating with our monkey minds.
*  I mean, the only thing that prevents us.
*  Well, back to DMT, I think that intelligence is already out there.
*  We don't have to build it with computers in here on earth, you know, and DMT is
*  one conduit to it.
*  Yeah.
*  Mushrooms are another meditation is another.
*  It's just a willingness to set aside the petty shit.
*  Which is also why a lot of people believe those things are illegal.
*  You know, a hundred percent.
*  I mean, if you have everybody realizing that we're all one united, we'd kind of
*  make no money in that.
*  Yeah, there's no money in that.
*  Well, maybe the problem is money in general, like the concept of money, you
*  know, and I'm not a proponent of socialism because socialism always leads to
*  communism, which leads to military dictatorships that are dictating whether
*  or not you can do this or that.
*  And there's always groups of people that have massive resources and they keep
*  everybody else subjugated.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's it's anybody that thinks that socialism and communism is the future.
*  Show me where it works.
*  Yeah.
*  It's still human beings.
*  It's just like, whether it's cults or militaries or anything.
*  So it's there's human beings that have immense power that is unimaginable to the
*  common person, right?
*  Dictating what the common people can and can't do.
*  And the only way to enforce that is with force and with with killing.
*  That's the only way with jailing people, killing people, fear.
*  It's the only way to get people to listen to you and to do what you want them to
*  do.
*  And I wonder if what we're doing with artificial intelligence is creating, I
*  think we're going to merge.
*  That's what I think is going to happen.
*  You know, I'm sure you've already seen this guy who they the first Neuralink
*  patient. Have you seen this?
*  Yeah.
*  So this first guy who's paralyzed with Neuralink, he's now able to use a
*  computer and he can move cursors around with his mind and he can play video
*  games with his mind.
*  And he's been doing this and he talks about it and it's like, this is
*  incredible.
*  This is amazing.
*  And this is essentially the Model T of, you know, this sort of human computer
*  interface, biological interface, something that goes into your mind, into the
*  brain itself and connects with it and allows you to use things.
*  I get why that would help a dude like in his situation, but do you have any
*  concerns about that?
*  Like large scale?
*  Of course.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I have concerns with everything that involves human beings because I don't
*  think there's ever been a thing that involves human beings that doesn't get
*  co-opted and corrupted.
*  There's always something, someone comes along that, that uses it and has power.
*  And that's the scariest thing about someone achieving some sort of
*  artificial general intelligence, some sort of super intelligence, especially
*  something that's sentient and can figure out what we're doing wrong and also
*  figure out what was done wrong to code it and make a better version of itself.
*  And I think, I think it's going to, it's going to lead to a new life form.
*  I'm almost positive of that, that that's what all this stuff is doing.
*  It's going to achieve.
*  I mean, have you ever seen the, the, the head of Google where he was talking
*  about how their AI has done things that they didn't expect, like it learned a
*  language like instantaneously that it wasn't programmed in and can translate
*  that language now and communicating that language and they don't know how it did it.
*  Well, Hey guys, hit the fucking breaks.
*  What you do?
*  You don't know, you don't know what it's doing and you're just going to keep feeding it.
*  Okay.
*  Where do you think that goes?
*  It's going to be better than us at everything.
*  And it's going to realize that we're the cause of pollution.
*  We're the cause of war.
*  We're the cause of theft and rape and fraud and destruction and the control of resources.
*  It's all human beings.
*  Like we are the problem that we're trying to solve.
*  If we're trying to solve that problem by creating something that won't have those
*  problems, it just logically seems to me that that thing is going to realize that
*  we're the issue.
*  Part of me shares that fear.
*  Part of me feels like a drowning man, like, you know, maybe AI is the life
*  preserver and part of me thinks that it's just going to be like the metaverse or
*  Google glasses or whatever.
*  It's just going to be like a passing fad, but, Oh, I don't think that.
*  I don't think that at all.
*  I think it's inevitable.
*  I think we are.
*  I've compared us to a caterpillar that we're a caterpillar that's building a cocoon.
*  We don't even know why caterpillars.
*  They don't know I'm going to become a butterfly.
*  It's going to be awesome.
*  No, they don't.
*  We don't know why we're doing all this.
*  Why are we so thirsty for innovation?
*  Why are we so attached to wanting the newest, latest, greatest technology?
*  It almost seems like that motivation is tied into the creation of artificial
*  intelligence that if you looked at us.
*  I always say that if you looked at us from above, if you were some other species
*  that came and you were looking at human beings, you would say, well, what does
*  this thing do?
*  Like, what does this species do?
*  Well, the main thing it does, if you, you know, you look at all the, there's all
*  the wonderful things, the art, the music, all the wonderful things that it does for
*  itself, food and culture and all these interesting things, but what is the
*  species overall do?
*  Well, it creates things and it creates better things constantly.
*  It's, it's in a cycle of constant innovation and a lot of that innovation,
*  almost all of it is tied to technology and artificial intelligence.
*  And so where does that go?
*  Well, that goes to another life form.
*  It creates a thing.
*  It creates an artificially intelligent and artificial is not a good word either.
*  Cause I think it's digital intelligence.
*  I don't think it's artificial intelligence.
*  I think it's a computing based intelligence that's far superior to the
*  biological based intelligence.
*  And so my hope for us, because I am one of us, my hope is that we merge.
*  My fear is that it supersedes us.
*  My, my fear is that it surpasses us in every way and that it just gives us
*  something that placates us that it controls us.
*  Yeah.
*  Gives us something.
*  Well, instead of killing us off, all you'd have to do is stop us from
*  breeding.
*  That's not hard to do.
*  We're kind of doing that to ourselves.
*  We mean, population level in terms of like viability, they've dropped
*  substantially over the last few decades, whether it's because of microplastics
*  in our food that have diminished our reproductive cycles.
*  And if you look at the number of births, like in, in developing countries, like
*  what, what happens, how, how many women are having miscarriages, how many women
*  are infertile, the numbers keep going up and up and up.
*  It seems like there's a, there's a current trend because of what we have done
*  with our environment, what we have done with our food supply, what we have done
*  with medicine and pharmaceutical drugs.
*  That's leading us to be less and less viable.
*  And all you'd have to do is step in and provide human beings with something that
*  gives them an incentive to no longer breed, especially if it makes it very
*  attractive to no longer keep them entertained, keep them entertained.
*  No longer breed, provide them with robot sex dolls that are far superior to
*  human beings, you know, someone who really gets them, this really gets them.
*  Or you just have a biological woman.
*  He yells at you.
*  I mean, it's, it's, you could clearly see how, if you were a super intelligent
*  species or super intelligent thing that looked at us and say, well, what's the
*  best way other than mass destruction of stopping these things from ruining the
*  world? We'll just stop them from breeding.
*  Just make, make these the last ones.
*  Just severely limit the amount of reproduction that takes place.
*  That would do it.
*  That drowning man looking for a life preserver side of me kind of hopes that
*  artificial intelligence or digital intelligence.
*  I like that by the way.
*  Yeah, I think that's what digital intelligence, you know, that, that, that
*  it could be that, that, again, back to, back to DMT, I felt that that, that, that
*  sentient force, God, whatever you want to call it was benign, was basically on my
*  side.
*  I'd like to think that perhaps that technology is being provided to us, that
*  there is a bigger plan that we're just not dialed into, or that maybe it's a way
*  to try and dial into that plan.
*  I just want us to get to Star Trek, man.
*  I just want to be, I think, I think that the, the, the goal, I think the
*  intent for our species is to get off the rock and explore space and peace together.
*  That would certainly be wonderful.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That would be certainly preferable to destroying ourselves.
*  What do you think is happening with all this UFO, UAP stuff?
*  Do you ever think about that?
*  Yeah, I've looked into, looked into the doc on that, like several times, could
*  never quite, you know, get beyond what's already publicly available.
*  I just think it's, I, the government's covering something up for sure.
*  For sure.
*  You know?
*  What do you, do you think they're covering up things that they've invented?
*  I think that's probably the most, again, I would like to believe that what they're
*  covering, what I want to believe in the same way that I want to believe in the
*  stoned ape theory, because I think it's fucking cool, is I want to believe that
*  they're covering up contact with, you know, species from outer space, other,
*  other intelligent life.
*  What I suspect is really going on is that they're covering up shit that they're
*  making that maybe has slipped the leash, you know, or, or that they, or that for
*  whatever reason, they're just trying to like keep completely secret the stuff
*  that has maneuverability that can't be explained.
*  Yeah.
*  That's my thought too.
*  I think both things though.
*  I think we're probably being visited as well.
*  And I think we might be being visited by something that is us from the future.
*  I think, and might not even be us from the future, but being what happens when a
*  species like us gets involved in digital intelligence and creates something that
*  transcends the biological limitations.
*  And then you have these things.
*  Like to me, one of the, one of the things that's very bizarre is the archetype,
*  the archetype gray alien, which is this big headed thing with no muscle, no
*  genitals, and it seems very humanoid in a way, which doesn't necessarily make sense.
*  If you, you're, you're dealing with different environments and we think about
*  it, the massive variety of species that exists on the planet that we're aware of.
*  There's only one human.
*  There's only one bipedal hominid.
*  That's it.
*  It's us.
*  Right.
*  Why is this thing so much like us?
*  This shitty design of walking around on two people.
*  Why can't it fly?
*  Like, why, why does, you know, why does it have these spindly bodies?
*  Well, human beings, as we're evolving, one of the things that's very clear is that
*  we're becoming less physical.
*  We're, we're weaker and softer than previous generations of humans that we can observe.
*  You look at our testosterone levels compared to men from the 1950s, we're far lower on
*  average.
*  And if you go way back and you look at Australia, Pythagoras and even Neanderthal, I
*  mean, there's, there's a super powerful physical specimens.
*  There, there were definitely, Neanderthal was like this five foot seven, 200 pound
*  behemoth of a creature that was, you know, if you have a Neanderthal competing in the
*  UFC, it would smash everybody.
*  There's their bones are bigger.
*  They're far more powerful.
*  If you keep going in that direction, what do you get to?
*  You get to this thing that has almost no muscle.
*  This thing that like it just has to need the ability to move around.
*  It's probably communicating telepathically.
*  It's probably using its telepathic energy to control those devices, those those ships.
*  That's one of the things that Bob Lazar said went and again, the Bob Lazar story is who
*  knows. Right.
*  I love to believe the Bob Lazar story.
*  I had him on the podcast.
*  I talked to him for three hours.
*  I had dinner with him.
*  He doesn't seem like a guy who's lying.
*  Right.
*  And one of the more bizarre aspects of his story is how many of the things that he talked
*  about now we know are true, you know, in terms of the technology, in terms of what people
*  have seen, 3D printing, there's all these different things like this, the ship that he
*  went into. There's no seams.
*  He's like, it's all like as if it's made out of one piece of something, which is 3D
*  printing. I mean, that's what we're doing now.
*  And that there's no instrumentation and that somehow or another these things are integrated
*  somehow with their minds or with something where it's allowing them to pilot these things
*  without digital instrumentation and buttons and switches.
*  They're using some other method to control these things.
*  And that's what he was supposedly brought in to try to back engineer.
*  So I say, what is this?
*  How does it work?
*  And he talked about the limitations of having science try to be practiced in a vacuum.
*  And he was like, the metallurgist did not have contact with propulsion's experts.
*  The propulsion's experts did not have contact with other groups that were studying these
*  things. Everybody was very secretive and everybody was very isolated.
*  And he's like, that's not how science works.
*  That's one of the reasons why they can never figure out how these things work.
*  That you need to open this up to the global scientific community and have everybody examine
*  these things and look at it.
*  But the problem is the military applications.
*  Like if you have something that can essentially use some new element and use this new element
*  that's bombarded with radiation that allows you to manipulate gravity and move at insane
*  speeds almost instantaneously to anywhere in the universe.
*  You can't give that to the Chinese.
*  You can't have someone else get a hold of it before us.
*  You can't have someone steal these techniques or these technologies.
*  So what do you do?
*  If you have this thing, if this thing has really been donated, which is like what a
*  lot of these people that work on them, they call them donations.
*  If you really have these things, what do you do?
*  How do you figure that out?
*  I don't know. But if we have been doing this since the 1980s, which is Lazar said it's
*  been around far longer than that.
*  But when he was working on that was the 1980s, you could imagine that by now we might have
*  figured out a way to get a drone going that uses these technologies and that these drones
*  can appear and disappear.
*  They can fly and in same rates of speed, they can hover stationary at 120 knot winds like
*  they've observed.
*  You can imagine that that's ours.
*  I saw the Phoenix lights.
*  Did you really?
*  Yeah.
*  You were there.
*  Yeah.
*  I saw.
*  Whoa.
*  Different people saw different things.
*  What I saw was something the size of like an Imperial Star Destroyer from Star Wars
*  that was like at a relatively low altitude moving over Phoenix.
*  My housemate was like this.
*  I mean, this is before we had phones, right?
*  Before we had cameras.
*  It was like we had a flip phone of anything.
*  And he was like, dude, you got to get out here.
*  And I came out the front yard of our house in Tempe and we just watched this thing move
*  across the sky.
*  It was like, what the fuck, man?
*  Like, I mean, I believe I believe in reincarnation because I came back from DMT thinking that
*  I had a firsthand experience.
*  I believe that there was something inexplicable in the sky over Phoenix that night because
*  I fucking saw it.
*  OK.
*  And it was massive and it was quiet.
*  And then it was just gone.
*  So what did it look like?
*  It looked like a massive craft, not shaped like an Imperial Star Destroyer, but of that
*  scale that was more sort of like tubular shaped and you could see.
*  Yeah. More like.
*  Yeah. More like.
*  Yeah. Like a tube.
*  And you. But you could see variations in it.
*  It wasn't like totally smooth.
*  You know, and you could see, by the way, that it was like blocking out the stars that you
*  could see that there were like apparatus on it of some kind.
*  And I always thought that it was just it was a military.
*  It was a military aircraft where they had they thought they had a cloaking device.
*  See, now that's what other people saw was these smaller things on the same night that
*  were explained away as being some sort of military flares or weather balloons or some
*  shit. That's that's not what I saw on the same night.
*  But I'm not the only one that saw this larger scale craft.
*  So I always thought like, man, that could be a military ship.
*  They thought they had some sort of cloaking device that fucked up.
*  It fritzed out because that's kind of what it looked like.
*  I could see it and then I couldn't.
*  You know. So.
*  So it looked like a tube.
*  And did well.
*  How big were you talking about?
*  Like several football fields?
*  Yes. Yes.
*  Yeah. And how many football fields?
*  I would say like the size of a battleship.
*  OK. Huge. Not an aircraft carrier, but the size of a battleship.
*  Like I would say three.
*  What's bigger? Aircraft carrier battleship.
*  Battleship, I think, is bigger as a destroyer, whatever smaller than aircraft carrier,
*  whatever the ship, whatever the ship is that's smaller than aircraft carrier.
*  So not as big as an aircraft, not as big as an aircraft carrier.
*  What is a battleship?
*  Yeah, it's either a battleship or destroyer, whatever that next one is.
*  I would say three football fields, at least.
*  It was huge. You could not miss it.
*  And how high do you think it was above you?
*  No more than a thousand feet.
*  Whoa. Yeah, no more as low altitude.
*  It was like right over right over Tempe.
*  I'm not the only one.
*  No, I'm not the only one.
*  I know. I know many, many people saw it. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I actually like went on the record with the newspaper I worked for,
*  you know, right away because they were like immediately dismissing those smaller
*  lights that we just saw as like, you know, whatever, whatever the explanation was.
*  Yeah. And I was like, there's something else, you know, in the sky that night, too.
*  So I, I, I love to gamble.
*  If I had to make a bet, I would still say it's human military technology
*  that fritzed out.
*  Wow. But many people said they saw something that looked like a triangle.
*  No, this is not a triangle.
*  Yeah. So maybe there was more than one of these things.
*  Totally possible. Yeah.
*  You remember when the governor did that press conference
*  and came out with a guy in an alien suit and made a mockery of the whole thing?
*  Which is what their tactic has been.
*  But then that same governor came back after he left office
*  and talked about it. Yeah.
*  And said that he saw something and admitted it. Yeah.
*  What was the governor's name?
*  Five Symington. Five Symington.
*  See if you could find an audio of a video of five
*  Symington saying what he actually saw on witnessing the Phoenix lights.
*  I think later he talked about it.
*  Well, unlike five Symington, I was stoned, but I still know what I saw.
*  I still know what I saw.
*  And you know, it's interesting is he's when he's trying to describe the shape
*  and he puts it at a bigger size than I than I have it in my memory.
*  I do remember talking with my friend.
*  Like it was hard to describe what we just saw.
*  It's like we didn't have a reference.
*  It's just like we're trying to see if I can articulate this.
*  We're trying to find reference points for something that really doesn't have one.
*  Right. I guess.
*  Like you kind of estimate the size, but it just it had it was
*  it was unlike anything I'd ever seen before.
*  Have you ever heard people describe what the Native Americans
*  must have seen when those boats started showing up? No.
*  They had never seen anything that large that it probably blew them away.
*  You know, you see the Pinta and the Santa Maria and these massive boats from Europe
*  that, you know, they were like, what the fuck is that?
*  Well, let's hope that
*  let's hope that the that the beings aboard the craft,
*  as that's what they are, have better intentions than the people aboard those boats.
*  Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah.
*  That's crazy that you actually saw it. Yeah.
*  Wow. And you said it just disappeared.
*  Yes. It wasn't like whoop or anything.
*  There was no noise. It was just it was there.
*  And there were some lights.
*  Like you said, I remember there was there were some lights
*  that were not stars that were part of this craft.
*  Can you describe what those lights looked like?
*  No, they were they were not colored.
*  They were, you know, white or off white.
*  Because I remember thinking like, are those stars?
*  I was trying to like actually see what is the shape and what is stars.
*  That's how I was gauging how big it was.
*  And I was like, no, those are attached to this thing.
*  And then it was just I just couldn't see anymore.
*  It was like, you know, it was like it was it was like the northern lights.
*  Some from Alaska, right?
*  So it's like the northern lights, they're there.
*  And then they're not there.
*  It was just like this ghostly thing.
*  And then then they're gone.
*  And it was like that.
*  It was there. It was moving at a slow speed, you know, from my left to right.
*  And then it was just I couldn't see it anymore.
*  And but it was like 20 seconds at least.
*  It wasn't like a glimpse of this thing.
*  It was. Yeah. And how many lights?
*  And half a dozen.
*  Yeah, somewhere around there.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  And I know people said that they that they that they saw a triangle.
*  So then for a while, they were saying that's why he was probably talking about
*  the, you know, the B-2 bomber, the stealth bomber, because they're kind of triangular.
*  It was way bigger than one of those.
*  And it was not it was it was not that shape at all.
*  I struggle to come up with what shape it was because it's a shape
*  that I've seen before.
*  Yeah. So wow.
*  And what was your initial thought?
*  That that's an alien spacecraft?
*  No, my initial thought was not an alien spacecraft.
*  It was basically initial thought was just like, what the fuck is that?
*  And then once I talked about it, it's that same sort of like
*  want to believe, actually believe thing we talked about several times today.
*  I want to believe it was an alien spacecraft.
*  I believe it was probably, you know, U.S. military technology gone awry.
*  Really? Yeah.
*  Do you think they have the capability to do that in the 1990s?
*  Because what was what was the Phoenix Lights?
*  That was 19, it was mid 1990s.
*  I think it was 96. I've been 97.
*  Not sure. As more time has gone on, though,
*  you're asking me what I thought in the moment.
*  Yeah. As more time has gone on, I've like the needles moved towards.
*  Maybe that was was actually an extraterrestrial craft. Yeah.
*  Because there's so much has come out, like especially in the last five years,
*  as you know, as you've talked about here. Yeah.
*  So it's just so strange that it all occurred in this one area.
*  It is one night. Right.
*  That has to be a real paradigm shifting moment for you.
*  It wasn't. Well, yeah. Well,
*  I think I was I got so caught up in the like the government's
*  trying to cover up its own fuck up, you know, like they're putting up.
*  And then there was the like there was the smaller lights thing and the weather
*  balloon, you know, but I did.
*  I went on the record with the Phoenix New Times.
*  There's a guy named Tony Ortega there that wrote a piece about it right away.
*  And I went on the record because I was like maybe one of the last, you know,
*  I wasn't that UFO enthusiast type. Right. Right. In the community.
*  I was a fairly well known writer in the greater Phoenix Metro at that time
*  and not someone that would be normally associated with like being a quote,
*  unquote UFO crazy.
*  So I went on the record with the article he's writing is like, yes,
*  I saw this no fucking way was a weather balloon or a flare or whatever they're
*  saying. It was massive. So. Hmm.
*  Man. What I would give to see something like that.
*  But, you know, to your point about like,
*  look at how people about the technology and maybe it's being kept quiet
*  because of the military applications, like look at how people freaked out
*  when it leaked about this new Russian space weapon. Right.
*  A couple of weeks back or three weeks back, whatever.
*  It's like an ability to disrupt like satellite communications in space,
*  like Russia somehow it leaked maybe deliberately out of Russia that they've got
*  this tech far more advanced technology than we thought they had to a weapon
*  that would be in space that could disrupt like communications and satellites
*  and really fuck us up. OK.
*  And like it was it was it leaked.
*  And then there was this one congressman that like went public with it.
*  It was like we have a real problem. Right.
*  This is like three as well as in Ukraine.
*  So it was maybe three weeks ago.
*  But imagine if it was something like on the scale of like a ship,
*  the weaponized ship that could be cloaked like that.
*  Or some of the technology or if we did have, as you said,
*  this donated technology that's from an extraterrestrial intelligence
*  that the US has been figuring out applications for,
*  you'd have to keep that on lock, because what if that leaked right now?
*  What do you think Putin would do?
*  You know, who the fuck knows what he would do if all of a sudden it leaked
*  that we had these, you know, military capabilities
*  that are far beyond what he thinks we have?
*  That's my thought about these these things that they keep seeing.
*  Because they always see them in areas where they do military tests.
*  Right. The Tic Tac was off the coast of San Diego,
*  which is where all the military bases are.
*  And the the things that Ryan Long had seen were all off the coast,
*  the East Coast, right. Restricted airspace, right.
*  In space where they run, you know, fighter just jet training.
*  And he said when they upgraded their technology in 2014,
*  they upgraded their sensors.
*  He said that's when we started seeing these things constantly.
*  All the time. And then they were getting visuals.
*  They were seeing visual versions of these things.
*  And that that was a square with this.
*  It was a sphere in a square or a square in a sphere.
*  Do you remember? Square in a sphere.
*  So there was like this circular sphere and this black square
*  that exists in this thing, and it's hovering and it's hovering
*  in very high speed winds and just station stationary motionless.
*  And that these things are able to move at just bizarre rates of speed
*  with no indication of a traditional propulsion system.
*  No heat signature that shows that, you know, you know, rocket
*  propulsion, nothing, nothing that we can explain.
*  And if they had a drone that could do that,
*  that's where they would test those things.
*  And what better way to test whether or not people could see them
*  than to run them out there when people are using new jets
*  with new capabilities. Right. Can you see them?
*  OK, they see them.
*  And the fact that, you know, the Tic Tac, when Commander David Fravor
*  brought this information and reported it and they showed the videos
*  to these admirals and they were nonplussed, they were like, Mm hmm.
*  OK. They just left the room. Right. Like.
*  Do they fucking know?
*  How are they not? Are they just like stone cold dudes
*  who could just keep it together in the face of some alien technology?
*  They know that we are being visited.
*  Or is this and the other thing is that when he when Fravor
*  communicated this stuff, these guys who are running these
*  these sensors, they were running the detection systems are saying,
*  we're seeing these things all the time.
*  Every couple of weeks, we're seeing them all over the place.
*  Well, what the fuck is that?
*  And this is also 2004.
*  Did they have the ability of 2004 or something to go from
*  above 50000 feet above sea level to 50 feet in less than a second?
*  What is that?
*  Like, what the fuck is that? And people try to.
*  You know, argue it away or explain it away by saying,
*  oh, it's a failure of the detection systems and it's a glitch in the.
*  Yeah, but the visuals, they have more than one fighter jet has seen it.
*  They have video of this thing moving at a speed that would turn human beings
*  into jelly.
*  Like there's a biological entity inside that thing and experiences that G force.
*  You're talking about some fucking insane G force, like 1300 times
*  what a human being can tolerate and just gone silent.
*  No visual means of propulsion.
*  No, no windows.
*  No. What is that? Is that a drone?
*  What is that? And the witnesses have been reliable to like I've often
*  suspected that like the last 20 years, especially in the last five,
*  it feels like the witnesses, the guys coming forward saying, look,
*  I know what I saw are more the ones that are associated with the government,
*  even commercial airline pilots will be on the FAA, but especially military pilots.
*  You know, they're being allowed to speak that it feels like the waters
*  are being tested by the government for some reason.
*  Like, yeah, let this out a little bit.
*  We're going to let the people that actually people may actually believe
*  like a test to what they saw and see how the public reacts.
*  That's right. Well, that would be what I would do if I was running the government.
*  If I wanted to hide the fact that we have these things,
*  I would say that these are off world crafts.
*  That's what I would say.
*  I would say, look, these things are behaving in a way that we can't explain.
*  Well, I guess we're being visited.
*  And then go right back to whatever black ops thing that you guys are doing.
*  Some Raytheon project.
*  I mean, I don't know what it is.
*  But I go back and forth all the time,
*  whether I think it's from another planet, another galaxy, another dimension,
*  or whether or not I think it's us.
*  Or many people think that they've always been here.
*  And, you know, when you talked about the Vedas in the Vedas,
*  they talk about these things.
*  They talk about that. I mean, it's in the Bhagavad Gita.
*  It's in there's it's in the ancient Hindu text.
*  They talk about these these Vimanas, these crafts
*  that whatever these beings operate.
*  So in that case, we're just getting better at detecting them,
*  or are they showing themselves more often?
*  Well, in unique circumstances, if someone sees something like this, like you.
*  So you see this in 1990, whatever it is in Phoenix.
*  If you lived 5000 years ago and you see this, like, what is that?
*  What does that sound like?
*  What does that sound like to everybody?
*  Sounds like you're out of your fucking mind.
*  And a small handful of people say it.
*  They tell stories.
*  People write it down. Just goes away.
*  Unique experiences are very difficult to classify.
*  You know, if you have an experience with a ghost,
*  the ghost shows up in this room and we all see it and it doesn't show up on camera.
*  And we swear we saw an apparition of fucking Forrest Gump standing there.
*  You're like, what the fuck is that?
*  Well, you're just left with a story.
*  You know, if you can't measure it, you can't write it down.
*  You can't even a video of it.
*  Like, what are you seeing?
*  You're seeing grainy footage of something.
*  You know, you see, I'm sure you've seen these supposedly leaked images
*  that fighter pilots have taken with cell phones from their aircrafts.
*  Like, what are they saying? What is that thing?
*  What is that weird, blurry looking, metallic looking thing?
*  Is that a Mylar balloon that they're mistaking for a spacecraft?
*  That doesn't seem likely.
*  Seems like they're a lot fucking smarter than that.
*  They're not going to think a child's birthday balloon
*  that's floating around at 20,000 feet is an aircraft.
*  They're probably going to realize it's a balloon.
*  They've probably seen balloons, you know? Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  In those videos, too, is the commentary that kind of sells it like,
*  look at that thing move or what?
*  Yeah, like the go fast video.
*  Look at it go. Jesus Christ.
*  And these guys are trained pilots.
*  They're used to seeing things and they're seeing something that rotates.
*  This is the other thing about the craft that coincides with what Bob Lazar said.
*  It's moving like this and it turns sideways.
*  And Lazar said that's what it did, that it would direct its generator,
*  whatever that gravity generator is.
*  It would direct that towards the way that it wanted to go.
*  So it would literally turn sideways to move forward.
*  I mean, Kenneth Arnold was talking about these things in the 1950s.
*  Right. So for sure, in the 1950s, we didn't have the capability
*  to make something like that, something with no visible means of propulsion
*  that's shaped like a saucer that flies silently through the air and, you know,
*  moves at a speed and has capabilities in terms of maneuverability
*  that far exceeds a jet that we had back then.
*  What does that mean? What is that?
*  I mean, they were seeing these things when we had propeller planes.
*  You know, what is that?
*  I don't know. But part of me feels stupid for even talking about it.
*  You know what I mean? It's like, why are you wasting all your energy?
*  You have so many things you have to do.
*  It is fascinating. It is fascinating.
*  But it's also it makes you feel like a fool.
*  And I think that's part of the strategy of all this stuff.
*  Well, ridiculing people that talked about UFOs
*  has been part of the government strategy from the jump.
*  For sure. That's the Project Blue Book.
*  That's been documented. Right.
*  So but the thing on the military installations, of course, the two theories
*  are one is that there's some sort of extraterrestrial intelligence
*  that's drawn to our military activity.
*  But what seems like the more rational explanation is, as you said,
*  that's where they test this ship. Sure.
*  Or, you know, if I was an intelligent species
*  that's willing to donate these crafts like they claim,
*  that they kind of let these things land or crash
*  and then they'll do it in a very strategic way
*  where they know that the military will be able to cordon off the area
*  and isolate and stop people from talking about it.
*  And the idea that people in the military aren't able to keep secrets.
*  So that's nonsense.
*  They're really good at keeping secrets.
*  You know, they're they can keep secrets, especially high level people.
*  Look, if I had access, like if if not Joe Biden, he's too far gone.
*  But if Obama called me in like during his administration,
*  you want to see some shit?
*  I'd be like, I want to see some shit.
*  And he said, don't tell anybody.
*  I'd be like, I won't tell anybody.
*  Maybe I'd tell my wife.
*  Maybe I'd tell one of my friends.
*  But I wouldn't fucking go public and tell everybody
*  if they're willing to show me this shit.
*  Like that. Look, no one's going to believe me anyway. Right.
*  And so I'm like, what good does it do if I make myself look like a moron?
*  A B, I now I can't have access to it anymore because I told them
*  because I told people about it, because now they can't trust me.
*  I'd shut the fuck up, especially if I was in the military.
*  I would shut the fuck up. Show me.
*  You know, you ever heard the story?
*  This is a it's a widely disputed story.
*  But that Jackie Gleason and Nixon were drinking one day
*  and Nixon was like, you want to see some shit?
*  And Nixon took Jackie Gleason to one of the Air Force bases
*  and showed him this UFO.
*  And Jackie Gleason was a UFO fanatic.
*  I don't know if you know this, but Jackie Gleason actually had a home
*  built in upstate New York that looked like a UFO.
*  And he had this home built after this supposed experience.
*  Yeah. Show the images of the home.
*  This is the home that Jackie Gleason had built.
*  I mean, what the fuck?
*  Look at the outside of it, though, not not that one.
*  That one's kind of just a cool circular one.
*  But that that image like what what the fuck are you doing, Jackie?
*  Why do you make it a UFO house in upstate New York?
*  It seems a little odd. Take that image. Look at that.
*  I mean, come on, man. What the fuck is that?
*  It looks kind of like a sci fi movie prop, though, you know.
*  Yes. Like a cliche of a UFO. Right.
*  But that's apparently this is the folklore.
*  Yeah. Is that that's what he saw.
*  And so he's like, I want to build a fucking house.
*  Look like that. You know, it's fun.
*  It's fun. But it also has this feeling of futility.
*  It's like futile thing.
*  Like, why are we even talking about it?
*  It's nonsense. It's fascinating.
*  But it just seems like it's almost seems like you're never going to know.
*  You know, I think we talk about it because it gives us hope, frankly.
*  Yeah, we want to believe it's true.
*  Well, we certainly want to believe the stories
*  that they hover over military bases and shut down nuclear weapons.
*  And, you know, my my comedy club is called the Comedy Mothership.
*  And you walk into the comedy club, there's a gigantic
*  artificial UFO that we had built.
*  So when you walk into it, like as you walk in the front door, there's this big
*  construction of a UFO that has a beam that comes down.
*  And we use it as a projector to show who's coming soon on the big screen.
*  But I named the the rooms Fat Man and Little Boy
*  because those are the bombs that we dropped.
*  And right after we dropped those bombs, that's when all the UFO activity happened.
*  That's like there's a giant uptick in UFO activity after 1945.
*  And in the UFO folklore, it's like they realize that we have the ability to drop nukes.
*  And so then they started visiting and then they started shutting down
*  nuclear weapons at bases and making their presence known
*  at these military bases to say, hey, keep it together, bitches.
*  Like we're watching.
*  We don't want you to nuke this whole planet and ruin our little program.
*  And then our program is an accelerated engineering program
*  that we've accelerated the evolution of human beings through some sort of intervention.
*  And that this is why we're so different.
*  This is it's not the stone tape theory.
*  It's the humans are engineered by some superior life form
*  to try to accelerate our evolution and bring us to this place.
*  And that they've helped us along the way.
*  But we're autonomous and we're allowed to do what we want to do.
*  And so we do disgusting, crazy shit like drop nuclear bombs
*  from propeller planes, by the way, right, propeller planes on cities.
*  And that once they did that, they're like, OK, slow the fuck down.
*  We're here.
*  Now, whether they've always been here, like in, you know, the Vedic texts
*  or even in the Bible, in Ezekiel's description of the wheel
*  within a wheel and have you read that description?
*  Pull up Ezekiel's description of what he saw.
*  This is one of the favorite descriptions from the Bible,
*  from the Old Testament about UFOs that people love to bring up,
*  because Ezekiel has this thing that he describes.
*  And it's it's the most bizarre depiction.
*  I looked, I saw an immense dust storm come from the north,
*  an immense cloud with lightning flashing from it, a huge ball of fire
*  glowing like bronze within the fire were what looked like four creatures
*  vibrant with life.
*  Each had the form of a human being, but each also had four faces and four wings.
*  Their legs were as sturdy and straight as columns,
*  but their feet were hove like those of a calf and sparkled with the fire
*  like burnished bronze on all four sides under their wings.
*  They had human hands.
*  All four had faces and wings and the wings touching one another.
*  They turned neither one way nor the other.
*  They went straight forward.
*  Their faces looked like this in front of a human face on the right side,
*  the face of a lion on the left, the face of an ox and in the back,
*  the face of an eagle. So much for the faces.
*  The wings were spread out with the tips of one pair touching the creature
*  on either side.
*  The other pair of wings covered its body.
*  Each creature went straight ahead.
*  Wherever the spirit went, they went.
*  They didn't turn as they want.
*  The four creatures looked like blazing fire or fiery torches.
*  Tongs of fire shot back and forth between the creatures and out of the fire,
*  bolts of lightning.
*  The creatures flashed back and forth like strikes of lightning.
*  As I watched the four creatures, I saw something that looked like a wheel
*  on the ground beside each of the four face creatures.
*  This is what the wheels looked like.
*  They were identical wheels sparkling like diamonds in the sun.
*  They looked like they were wheels within wheels, like a gyroscope.
*  They went in any of the four directions they faced, but straight, not veering off.
*  The rims were immense, circled with eyes.
*  When the living creatures went, the wheels went.
*  When the living creatures lifted off, the wheels lifted off.
*  Wherever the spirit went, they went.
*  The wheels sticking right with them.
*  For the spirit of the living creature, creatures was in the wheels.
*  When the creatures went, the wheels went.
*  When the creatures stopped, the wheels stopped.
*  When the creatures lifted off, the wheels lifted off because the spirit
*  of the living creatures was in the wheels.
*  Over the heads of the living creatures was something like a dome
*  shimmering like the light, like a sky full of cut glass vaulted over their heads.
*  Under the dome, one set of wings was extended towards the other
*  with another set of wings covering their bodies.
*  When they moved, I heard their wings.
*  It was like the roar of a great waterfall, like the voice of the strong God,
*  like the noise of a battlefield.
*  When they stopped, they folded their wings.
*  And then as they stood with folded wings, there was a voice
*  above the dome over their heads.
*  Above the dome, there was something that looked like a throne.
*  Sky blue, like a sapphire with a human-like figure towering above the throne.
*  From what I could see from the waist up, he looked like burnished bronze.
*  And from the waist down, like a blazing fire.
*  Brightness everywhere.
*  The way a rainbow springs out of a sky on a rainy day, that's what it was like.
*  It turned out to be the glory of God.
*  Like, what the fuck, man?
*  I mean, to anybody that's done DMT or ayahuasca
*  or really tripped on psychedelics, though, you read that and it feels sort of familiar.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  The glory of God.
*  Yeah, the glory of these visions of these.
*  Yeah.
*  Beings.
*  And the fact that these things are constantly changing their appearance.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, that's the thing about the DMT experience is like, it's not a stationary
*  static experience, it's like constantly changing and moving in front of you.
*  And to see something like that in the sky.
*  And the fact that it's so noteworthy that they wrote it down in the fucking Bible.
*  Maybe he found some of those mushrooms.
*  Yeah, maybe.
*  In the cow shit.
*  Well, you know, that's there's a
*  a university in Israel,
*  I think it's the University of Jerusalem that theorized that the Moses
*  experience of the burning bush was a DMT experience.
*  And that what this is like when you say Moses saw the burning bush.
*  Well, what what kind of bush would burn that would give you a psychedelic experience?
*  Well, the acacia tree, the acacia tree, which is very common to that area,
*  is rich with DMT.
*  And how do you how do you psychoactively acquire DMT?
*  You smoke it.
*  So you're smoking this tree, this burning bush, and you're seeing God.
*  And God has brought you ten commandments of how to live life,
*  which sounds like a lot of what you experience in the DMT experience.
*  When you have that and you have these contact with the entities,
*  they kind of give you guidelines of how to live.
*  Yeah. It felt to me like a massive amount of information being downloaded,
*  but that but that it was guiding in nature.
*  Yeah. But very difficult to to hold on to.
*  Like you're like, what is it?
*  So like it's probably something you'd want to write down.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Like the Ten Commandments.
*  Yeah. Well, again, back to the Christians and Prabhupada, that was his thing.
*  It was like you can't hold on to it with psychedelics alone.
*  And you don't need psychedelics to get a hold of it in the first place.
*  What he was preaching.
*  And he probably recognized that.
*  The thing that the problem with taking psychedelics is that it's so accessible.
*  You just take it means the beautiful thing about it.
*  But you also could say without that could be a problem,
*  because then a bunch of people with no discipline would just start
*  popping these things and having these experiences and having no sort of framework,
*  no moral framework, no ethical framework, no understanding of what
*  what are you experiencing and what to do with this stuff?
*  No discipline. Right. Yeah.
*  But if you acquire it biologically, if you acquire it endogenously
*  through discipline, then you you are on a path.
*  And through that path, you can achieve this thing.
*  And you realize this is a very difficult thing to achieve
*  and that you have to stay on this path in order to get this enlightenment.
*  I could see how someone would say, no, listen, that's not the way.
*  This is the way that you can do it with your own mind.
*  You don't need these things.
*  You know, Terrence McKenna's thought on that, though, very funny thought.
*  He said it reminds me of an ancient story of
*  a this monk had acquired a city of levitation and practiced this.
*  And it said to the Buddha when the Buddha came to town,
*  you know, I've spent 20 years acquiring the city of levitation.
*  And I can I could walk across the water.
*  And the Buddha said, yeah, but the fairies only a nickel.
*  So that was McKenna's take on it.
*  It's like, why would you do all that stuff when you could just take the mushrooms?
*  But McKenna was, you know, McKenna was a brilliant man.
*  He wasn't some stoned hippie in the middle of upstate New York.
*  Just tripping balls on mushrooms.
*  I think it has some, you know, it's helpful to have some sort of like processing
*  after the experience, right?
*  Not just keep like repeating it, trying to like, right.
*  Back to that space. Yeah.
*  Also, McKenna was, you know, he was a proponent of taking psychedelic drugs.
*  So he probably would want people to think that his way is the way.
*  You know, he's only human. Right. Yeah.
*  I don't know, man, but it's all look, just the fact that the psychedelic
*  experience is a real thing.
*  And when you do take that and you do have those experiences
*  and you realize that it's a real thing and like, how did I not know about this?
*  How is the most profound thing that's ever happened to me?
*  Something that is a schedule one drug that's illegal
*  for whatever reason that no one's explained to me accurately.
*  No, no one's ever explained it in a way that makes sense.
*  Why is a thing that doesn't kill anybody that exists in the human mind?
*  That was the other thing that McKenna said about DMT.
*  It's illegal, but everybody's holding.
*  No, right. Because everybody has it.
*  You know, if you want to test people for DMT, well, everybody's guilty.
*  Everybody. The most staunch conservative anti-drug person is right now
*  has DMT in their body. All of them do.
*  Everybody does.
*  It's literally like testing people for blood.
*  Yeah, you have blood. Of course, you're alive.
*  Yeah, you have DMT. You're alive.
*  Yeah, but it's illegal.
*  What? It doesn't make any sense.
*  It sounds so insane.
*  And also the fact that it's naturally occurring, not naturally,
*  just naturally occurring in the human mind, but naturally occurring in nature.
*  And that there seems to be some sort of mitigation strategy
*  by the human body in order to keep you from tripping balls
*  by consuming all the different plants that have DMT in it.
*  And that's monoamine oxidase.
*  So monoamine oxidase breaks it down in the gut.
*  So if you consume like grasses, like Filaris grass, it's very rich in DMT.
*  If a human being consumed that, you're not going to trip
*  because the monoamine oxidase in the gut breaks it down.
*  So the strategy that they came up with with ayahuasca
*  was to combine these psychedelic plants, these plants that contain dimethyltryptamine
*  with other plants that contain harminine, which is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor.
*  And that the two of these together will allow an orally active version
*  of dimethyltryptamine, which is what it is.
*  You know, with me, I really felt like once was enough.
*  I know you have a different approach, but.
*  Maybe everybody's different.
*  I mean, once was enough because it's so fucking scary.
*  You don't want to do it again. I get it.
*  But every time I've ever been troubled and I've done it, I feel way better.
*  I'm like, DMT specifically. Yeah, I'm talking about DMT specifically.
*  Yeah. Every time I've ever done it, I'm like,
*  God, the things I concentrate on are so stupid.
*  The things that worry me are so foolish.
*  I find that with MDMA.
*  I find MDMA to be very useful as a reset button.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, it also makes you realize like how insecure you are
*  and how insecure most people are with interactions with each other.
*  And when those barriers are down,
*  how wild the experience is of just not having any fear of human interaction.
*  Yeah, that's something I only did once.
*  And the problem that I had with it was after it was over, I felt so drained.
*  But I didn't have any strategy for like taking,
*  you know, some sort of a serotonin booster like five HDPE,
*  which is what people take that are like they really know what they're doing
*  with that stuff.
*  They take five HDPE to boost up their serotonin while they're doing it
*  so that after it's over, they're not just crashed.
*  Because the next day I was useless.
*  I remember I was in a coffee shop the next day and I was trying to read a magazine
*  and I couldn't read. I couldn't concentrate.
*  I literally couldn't read this magazine.
*  I was like, oh, my God, I'm so dumb.
*  My brain feels like I felt the way I described it
*  was like I had a dry sponge for a brain.
*  Normally it's wet and filled with water.
*  But now it's just like this.
*  Oh, this dopey dry sponge.
*  And was it worth it? Maybe.
*  But I had stuff to do that day. Right.
*  I had a show that night.
*  And this was after doing what? MDMA.
*  Yeah. You're an etard. Right.
*  He used to call it nice.
*  You're an etard.
*  Yeah, that's what the experience.
*  Yeah, you do need to do the serotonin booster.
*  That is the key move.
*  But I just think it's it's bordering.
*  You know, it's not bordering a criminal.
*  This fucking criminal that the government has kept MDMA therapy from like,
*  especially guys coming back from these fucking wars in the Middle East,
*  you know, they're all fucked up with PTSD because I'm somebody who has PTSD,
*  not from combat, but from childhood trauma.
*  MDMA is just it's just like a godsend, literally from the gods, the godsend.
*  And that that that shit has been kept from I mean, in maps,
*  that organization Maps has been doing fantastic research with it.
*  And it seems like that, you know, it's it's it's on the path to legalization now.
*  Finally, you know. Yeah.
*  But there are so many guys that needed that so badly.
*  And including the people that are making it illegal, unfortunately.
*  That's the problem.
*  It is it is it's it's an experience that's being kept from us
*  by people that haven't done it. Right. Right. Yeah.
*  That was that was another quote that was attributed to McKenna.
*  McKenna tried to attribute it to somebody else, but they said he didn't say it.
*  But it was that LSD is something that causes
*  severe psychotic experiences and people who haven't taken it.
*  Nice. I might have paraphrased that.
*  I think it did. But it's something along those lines that.
*  And, you know, we know for a fact that all that stuff was made
*  illegal during the sweeping psychedelics act of 1970
*  that was designed to subvert the war movement
*  and to subvert the civil rights movement and to go after the Black Panthers
*  and all these different people that were disrupting the government's
*  control over society.
*  And the best way to do that is to make all drugs illegal
*  and then go after those people and just throw water on the whole party.
*  It worked. It worked for decades.
*  And it like severely impacted art, specifically music.
*  If you look at the music from the 60s all the way up to 1970.
*  And then there's this confusion period of 1970.
*  And then you look at the music of the 80s, like, what the fuck happened, everybody?
*  What happened? How do you go?
*  How do you go from Hendrix?
*  Yeah. You know, to fucking whatever.
*  You know, I don't want to make fun of any 80s bands, but hair bands.
*  You know, like what happened there? What the fuck happened?
*  How did it get so dumb?
*  Everybody stopped tripping, started doing coke.
*  Yeah, exactly. That's exactly what happened.
*  Yeah. And they just lost the plot for a little while.
*  It seems like the plots come back.
*  I think the plot has come back.
*  And I think you could kind of credit Lorenzo from Psychedelic Salon
*  with the distribution of all those old recordings of Alan Watts and McKenna
*  and all those different psychedelic bards that were talking about these things.
*  It got people more curious and interested in them.
*  And then, you know, people realizing that we needed to do something
*  for these soldiers that are coming back with PTSD and psilocybin ceremonies
*  in Ayahuasca and MDMA, which is being used by MAPS.
*  MAPS has done an amazing job. They really have.
*  And they've done it the right way, where they're, you know,
*  really promoting legalization in a very structured way.
*  Yeah, it just feels like it's taken so long.
*  But that's like what the government, that's the only way that the government
*  is going to accept. Yeah.
*  It's like multiple research trials. Yeah.
*  You know, and even then, I mean, it really takes people leaving office and dying off.
*  It takes the old people going away, the corrupt politicians that are in charge
*  of deciding what is and is not legal.
*  They have to vanish and they slowly get phased out generation after generation.
*  And then the new people coming into play, some of them have military experience.
*  Some of them know people that have been really helped by MDMA therapy
*  or Ayahuasca or many of the Ibogaine people that have like severe
*  addictions to pills and all sorts of different opiates.
*  Ibogaine is like one of the greatest things that's ever been discovered
*  to help heal people from these problems. Yeah. Yeah.
*  We're in a so many weird competing factors are all happening all together.
*  And they're all in this wild chaos that is the age of information,
*  the age of information and technology that's allowing people to have access
*  to these things, but also realize how crazy the world we live in is.
*  And then, you know, you have TikTok where people are
*  just being distracted all day long and being confused.
*  And that is terrifying. Yeah. It's crack.
*  And I feel more hopeful now, Joe, once we started talking about psychedelics
*  again than it was when we were talking about war.
*  Well, psychedelics might be the only thing that prevents war.
*  It might be the only thing that helps people.
*  I mean, you can get large scale use of psychedelic sanctioned
*  and not just in America, but worldwide.
*  I think it will have a tremendous impact on the way people view this experience,
*  because this is a small, tiny,
*  finite experience that we're going through.
*  It seems like it takes forever, but I mean, you're 53, I'm 56.
*  It's like, Jesus, man, we're more than halfway to the finish line.
*  And it's like it just happened. It's like a blip.
*  And you're still we're all everyone, me included.
*  We're all just trying to figure it out as we go along.
*  And hopefully you're better than you were yesterday at it.
*  And sometimes you're not.
*  Sometimes you fall down.
*  Sometimes you get back up and you climb a little higher this time.
*  And now you're now you're better than you were a year ago.
*  But, boy, it's fucking confusing.
*  You know, I went to I went to college in University of California, Santa Cruz.
*  It's no secret that Santa Cruz for a long time has been a center for psychedelics.
*  And there's a guy there.
*  I think even if I could remember his name, I'm not going to drop it.
*  But he got busted for making acid.
*  And I think it was around 9 11.
*  He had this massive underground LSD lab out in the middle of the country.
*  And it was a story that never really got picked up because everyone was distracted.
*  That was the missile silo guy. Yeah, I think so.
*  Yeah. And his whole thing was like he was trying to make what he called a planetary dose.
*  That was his thing. I have to make enough acid for everyone on Earth to take acid.
*  It's the only thing that's going to save humanity.
*  And I kind of get it. Yeah.
*  At least I get the thinking.
*  I get the thinking, too, especially if you're really tripping.
*  Yeah, I know. Yeah.
*  Just get everybody fucked up.
*  Yeah. There is people that have this theory that if you just dose the water supply
*  in major cities, that people would be forced to trip.
*  But, you know, what dose?
*  I don't think that's probably a good idea.
*  No, it's a terrible idea.
*  No, the correct idea is legalization
*  and centers that are set up by ethical experts
*  who really have experience in these things that can provide both counseling
*  and medical services and allow people to do the correct dose safely under supervision.
*  And then counseling that gives them some sort of a framework as to what to do with this,
*  what what has happened, what this means and how you can apply this to your life.
*  And if we could figure out how to do that in a structured way,
*  we probably could help an enormous amount of people.
*  Absolutely. The integration after the trip. Right.
*  Yeah. And that's taking it back to Christian is right, because that's the series I have.
*  But but legitimately, there's a legitimate comment, which is that that's what Prabhupada
*  and that's what Krishna consciousness in a sense was offering, was integration
*  of the psychedelic experience.
*  Here's a framework for integrating everything you've been experiencing on acid and mescaline.
*  Right. You know, what are the hippie kids were into?
*  Yeah. And they they were.
*  I mean, I think Prabhupada and the people that were legit were really trying to do that.
*  And they were really trying to spread this message.
*  And if you think about what they were able to do during the 60s, you know, with the help
*  of George Harrison, I mean, they opened up a lot of people's minds to these ideas
*  and probably changed a lot of lives and the directions of a lot of people's lives.
*  Yeah. For the better. For the better. Yeah.
*  Listen, man, I really appreciate your work.
*  You know, Sasquatch is incredible in this Krishna documentary is incredible, too.
*  You're really awesome. Thanks, brother. Appreciate you.
*  And if you do this Ukraine thing or if you ever do a UFO thing, whatever you do, come back.
*  OK, I will. Thank you very much.
*  All right. Oh, so tell everybody it's available.
*  It's on Peacock.
*  Krishna's. Krishna's. Yeah.
*  On Peacock. It's awesome.
*  Thank you, brother. Appreciate it. Bye, everybody.
