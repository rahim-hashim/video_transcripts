# Joe Rogan Experience #1537 - Lex Fridman
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [September 16, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iOGfAAticY)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day!
*  Hello, Rex. Hey, Joe. Before we get started, how about that Colder Wall guy that I just played for you?
*  How crazy is it that he was 21 when he made that song? Is he close to 21 right now? He's 25 now.
*  Yeah, he sounds like Johnny, like later Johnny Cash. Like Johnny Cash when he did Hurt.
*  Yeah. You know? Like a pain, a depth, a richness in his voice, so badass.
*  It's weird. Like how do you get that at 21?
*  I want to see him at like 14. He probably developed early, probably went through some shit in his life.
*  Oh, he... There's gotta be some whiskey in that story somewhere.
*  Oh, yeah. He had to go through some real shit to have that voice and that...
*  Just the sensibility, just the mindset of those songs. You know, that Kate McKannon song? Jesus Christ.
*  You have to listen to the whole song. It's crazy.
*  Yeah, one of the things I hope, like with your Spotify thing, is that you'll be able to play songs.
*  We want to, but it's weird. It's like they've left open... They're trying to figure it out.
*  All this stuff is basically... There's a lot of work in progress. They're trying to figure it out.
*  Listen, my dream, here at Spotify if you're listening, my dream as a little boy is to play Stevie Ray Vaughan or Jimi Hendrix on the Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Oh, I'd love that.
*  And not be nervous about it being taken down or something because I don't have the rights to cover the song or whatever.
*  I wonder how that works for the artist. Well, for someone like Stevie Ray Vaughan or Jimi Hendrix, they're both dead, so it would be the estate of the artist, which oftentimes I believe probably makes it more slippery.
*  Yeah.
*  Because then you're dealing with people that kind of own it as a commodity rather than the actual artist itself.
*  But there's a difference between the Beatles and then the Stevie Ray Vaughan. Whoever owns Stevie Ray Vaughan you know is a bad mother effort.
*  You know it's not corporate.
*  You would hope so, but you never know, man. He might have had an ex-wife who sold it. Who knows?
*  Anyway, Spotify, please make it happen.
*  I almost had the opportunity to drive Stevie Ray Vaughan once when I was driving limos.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Yeah, man, but he wouldn't take limos. He would always take a cab.
*  So they'd have a limo and the limo would pick up everybody else.
*  Like all the other band members, all the other people, they would get in the limo and Stevie Ray Vaughan would get in a cab because he's that motherfucker.
*  Yeah, just for the first time actually. Yeah, he is. He's real. He's a genuine human being.
*  I just for the first time listened to an interview with him.
*  Like I've never heard Jimi Hendrix really talk or Stevie Ray Vaughan talk before this interview.
*  And he was really drunk in the interview.
*  And then I realized that there was a man behind the music.
*  There was some pain. There was some drinking and just, I don't know, demons that he was running from.
*  I think there's like a disconnect that you almost have to have from the normal mind to create that kind of sound.
*  There's sound like when you go to, there's some Hendrix songs like Voodoo Child is a great one.
*  Just the sound in that guitar is so, he's so out there. He's so wild.
*  You know, there's like a famous story where Eric Clapton first saw Stevie Ray Vaughan play.
*  And he was like, what in the fuck am I doing?
*  He matches as good as Eric Clapton is. Did I say Stevie Ray Vaughan or Jimi Hendrix?
*  Jimi Hendrix. I meant Jimi Hendrix. No, you said Jimi Hendrix.
*  Did I? Okay. But that Eric Clapton went and saw Jimi Hendrix play live.
*  And was, you know, he was such a talent that everybody else was like, what are we doing?
*  Yeah, the cool thing is, I mean, I don't know if you know, but Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix both play a Fender Strat.
*  It's the same guitar. So I can imagine. And then Eric Clapton has this like warm, smooth tone.
*  I could just imagine Eric Clapton seeing like, how the fuck did he get that sound out of that thing?
*  How did you pull that off?
*  Well, it's still Eric Clapton has some amazing fucking songs and amazing sound.
*  I mean, Layla, that song Layla, God damn, is that a good song?
*  Both acoustic and electric. He has an acoustic version.
*  Oh really? MTV used to do this thing. Unplugged.
*  So he played like Tears in Heaven, which is a harbour when he...
*  Lost his son, right? Yeah. His son fell off of a balcony.
*  Yeah, there's so much pain in that song. And then there's the badass songs. What is it?
*  Cocaine.
*  Yeah, I mean, the thing about his music versus Hendrix is it was brilliant.
*  I mean, Eric Clapton is, I shouldn't say was, because he's still alive, is a brilliant musician. Brilliant.
*  But the sound falls in line, meaning it all seems brilliant and purposeful and uniform.
*  And the songs are amazing, but it falls in line.
*  Whereas, you know, the shit that Hendrix would do...
*  He was out there. It was like this new thing, man. It was just, he was gone.
*  And he was fucking in his 20s. He died. He was 27 years old, which is so crazy.
*  And technique-wise, I mean, I know you don't play guitar, but technique-wise, he just didn't follow any conventions.
*  He was just like, he had this thumb, he put it over the top and just like, it was messy.
*  And the way he played rhythm wasn't how anyone played rhythm. It wasn't like three chords.
*  It was three chords, but every time he played those chords, they're always different. They always messed with it.
*  He always threw in a little chaos. And there's songs like Machine Gun. I hope you know that one.
*  Yes, yes. I love that song.
*  Just like, where did that come from?
*  There's so many of his songs. Like, if six was nine, that song. What is that? What is that?
*  A lot of it is drugs. That's the truth.
*  That's sad truth.
*  Yes and no. I mean, it's sad in that he's not here anymore.
*  But it's not sad in that what he accomplished in his 27 years on this planet still to this day haunts guitarists.
*  Like, if you ask professional guitarists, there was a million brilliant guitarists. I mean, there's so many.
*  Some people are big fans of Eddie Van Halen. I mean, I think to this day that Stevie Ray Vaughan's version of Voodoo Child is,
*  you always have to give the best credit to the original, which is Jimmy.
*  But Stevie Ray Vaughan's Voodoo Child is fucking amazing. And it's him. It's clearly him.
*  Yeah, he's playing it with his tongue. I mean, I've said it a million times. I named this podcast. I stole the name from Jimi Hendrix.
*  The Joe Rogan experience came from the Jimi Hendrix experience. Yeah, nothing like him.
*  I just always been oddly attracted to him. You know, that's a weird word to use.
*  But that's what it is, like attracted to his music and attract like him. There's something about him that just always resonated with me.
*  You know, the old studio, I had the Hendrix mug shot up and he also represents the 60s.
*  And also this psychedelic thing, experience, like not in this like cheesy way, but like in a really out there way.
*  For the genuine. Genuine. Yeah, authentic.
*  I mean, the fun tension, because you're a health guy. You talk about like how to be healthy, how to almost like have a balance.
*  But then at the same time, you say that you celebrate the self destruction that led to the genius of Jimi Hendrix.
*  It's not that I celebrate the self destruction. The self destruction is an unfortunate aspect of that path.
*  Right. And there's a lot of weirdness to Jimi Hendrix death.
*  I don't know if you know, like he had a gangster manager who apparently had him kidnapped just so that he could rescue him and convince Jimmy that, you know, he was a savior.
*  There's a book that was written on it that accuses this manager of killing Jimi Hendrix and saying that they also threw his girlfriend off a roof.
*  And she did either jump off a roof or was thrown off a roof and died shortly afterwards because she knew too much or whatever.
*  Who the fuck knows? It was one of Hendrix bodyguards or someone who worked for the manager that wrote the story.
*  But the thing about that path, the path of drugs and destruction, it's been it's been a path of many of my idols, whether it's Kinnison or Richard Pryor or even Hicks.
*  You know, Hicks died from cancer. But a lot of that is probably attributable to him.
*  Chain smoking and just a lot of drugs and stuff when he was younger and just destroyed his life.
*  And then it's also like pancreatic cancer is a genetic thing as well. You never really know what's causing pancreatic cancer.
*  But the your conversation with Mike Tyson actually symbolizes this in a really interesting way for me, because here you have like one of the greatest fighters ever who somehow found inner peace through the whole like marijuana.
*  Marijuana thing. But just the way he was behaving just was positivity and just this good vibes putting him out there.
*  And yet he now for at least brief moment in his life rediscovered the darkness.
*  I was watching your podcast with him in the moment when you said like you were like having another level chat.
*  He just took you like a few levels up by saying like that, you know, when he thinks about hurting people, sometimes it's orgasmic.
*  Yeah. And you you try to laugh it off. But there's like memes of he's like, no, I'm serious.
*  Well, I mean, I was laughing. I mean, I wasn't really trying to laugh it off. I was laughing at the madness of it.
*  What did that make you by the way, Donald Trump retweeted a clip of that? I don't know what to make.
*  Politically, I don't know what the context is. You retweeted Mike Tyson saying it was erotic.
*  Trump's like an old comedian who just happens to be president.
*  Really? I mean, the same kind of behavior that a comedian has the timing like his timing, like when the thing about Hillary Clinton, you'd be in jail.
*  Remember that? The timing of that when they were doing a debate and she said something about him being.
*  It's painful. I went back and watched those debates. It's painful to watch.
*  It makes me as somebody who wants to see truth and positivity went out in the world, it pains me to think about the debates between Biden and Trump.
*  I don't think they're going to happen. You don't think so?
*  No, I think the people in the Democratic Party are too wise. I think it's possible that Kamala Harris might debate Pence.
*  I think that's probably and I think she'll do really well against Pence.
*  Pence is a bit robotic and careful and evangelical and super Christian. I think she'll probably do very well in those debates.
*  Especially. Well, there's no audience. See, that's the thing, man. Those debates. A lot of it was like getting them zingers in.
*  Yeah, I think Trump needs an audience like a comedian. You said I think he needs the crowd to work off.
*  How do you say Donald Trump Jr.'s girlfriend's name? Kimberly? How do you say it?
*  Like Guilfoyle, I think.
*  Is that Guilfoyle?
*  The way it's written is like, why are we pretending that this is like the correct use of these letters?
*  Because you shouldn't put all those letters together like that. Like fix that.
*  But there's a great video that someone put together and I retweeted it or reposted it of her screaming this message to an empty room.
*  And then there's a beaver on the top of a mountain.
*  This is the thing that happens.
*  The Internet is amazing.
*  The Internet's the best. It's undefeated. There's a thing about doing stuff in like audiences.
*  Like here it is. Play this. Play this. It's so good.
*  Your destiny. You are capable.
*  Oh, this isn't the right one.
*  It's still just... find it on my Instagram. It's on my Instagram.
*  But it's so funny because it's like people are doing stand up these days on Zoom and it's bad.
*  Like really good comics look terrible doing stand up to no audience.
*  Yeah, it's just not how comedy is supposed to be.
*  It's like you know how you have a battery and you're charging a battery. You have to put something on the air to play it real quick.
*  It's so good.
*  There's something about a beaver screaming at the top of his life. On the top of a mountain.
*  It's so perfect. Yeah, it's so perfect.
*  It's 2020 and not sure right there.
*  But it's so perfect. That beaver by himself on the top of that mountain just screaming.
*  But timing is genius.
*  It's amazing. Whoever made that. Thank you. Thank you. Whoever you are.
*  But you know there's comics that are doing stand up in these Zoom things and it's like you know how you charge a battery.
*  You have to connect the positive and then you have to connect the negative.
*  You know you have to... there's two cables that you have to connect the two of them together.
*  If you only connect one it doesn't work. Well that's how it is with stand up.
*  You have to have an audience. It's one of those art forms that you need to have a reaction.
*  The people have to be there. You feed off of them. You create comedy with them.
*  And in a lot of ways one of the things that Trump does outside of these speeches and get everybody excited about things.
*  He's doing stand up. He tells jokes. He talks shit. He gets laughs.
*  Like they were saying like there was an interview with one of the debates.
*  You've said terrible things about women. You've called women pigs. You've called them this.
*  And he goes wait wait wait only Rosie O'Donnell. He says this and the audience goes crazy and laughs.
*  They're told to not respond. They're told to not respond. The audience are told not to laugh. They can't help it.
*  He just nailed it. He fucking nailed it and it's like a comic. Old comic.
*  And I don't know if he's the same guy as he was back then. Just honestly. Just being honest.
*  Same way I would talk about a fighter. Father time wins. Every time.
*  If you listen to interviews with Donald Trump maybe from the 90s. He's a different guy.
*  He's sharper. I don't want to be agist.
*  It's not agist. It's just reality. I mean no one gets better when they're 100.
*  It's not like the guy's 100 and all of a sudden he runs faster. He talks better. He's reading more and writing more. He sees better.
*  No we're dying. We're all dying slowly.
*  And I don't know what kind of pressure being the president is. But I can only imagine.
*  It's almost unmanageable. And he's managed it better than anybody I've ever seen.
*  But the reality is it's still pressure. Father time wears on you.
*  The river beats down the rocks and smooths them out. There's no way around it.
*  It's not agist. It's just reality.
*  So whether or not he's still got that kind of timing, that's a real question.
*  But if him and Biden get into a debate situation and he hits Biden with a couple of zingers like that.
*  I mean I don't.
*  So how do you think Biden might get out of the debates?
*  We're winning because it's the only reason why people are winning. The only reason is because they want Trump out of office.
*  If Pete Buttigieg was in the position that Biden was in.
*  He would have a much stronger response from people.
*  Young person speaks well.
*  If Tulsi Gabbard was in that position.
*  If she was in that position.
*  If she was debating with Trump and people saw her record.
*  Saw the fact that she served overseas twice.
*  Saw the fact that she's been a congresswoman for six years.
*  Saw how well she speaks.
*  The Democratic nomination process happened before coronavirus.
*  So we were in a kind of relaxed economy.
*  Things are going just regular.
*  The boring, generic candidate won out.
*  What we need now is a great, inspiring leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  Andrew Yang.
*  Andrew is teaming with ideas, with energy, with excitement, with a passion.
*  That's what we need now.
*  An inspiring leader that unites.
*  Brad Weinstein is on his big podcast.
*  I'm sending this to you right now, Jamie.
*  I love Andrew Yang.
*  Andrew is a really interesting guy.
*  He's not the standard.
*  What you're looking for from a guy who's running for president.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  He's a great leader.
*  What we're seeing is the videos that go viral are almost always bad.
*  There's one really good video from the beginning of the George Floyd protest
*  where this one cop in Flint gets together and says to this group of people that's protesting,
*  We're with you. We will march with you.
*  We're not in opposition. We're in this community and I'm here to be your friend.
*  We're here to help out.
*  That's what we're here doing as police officers. They hug this guy and they're all hugging each other and then they walk together.
*  It's beautiful. It brings a tear to your eye.
*  That's what we want. We want people that are police officers that have strong characters.
*  Someone who's an exceptional human being. I think that's who you have to be to have that job.
*  I think most people probably don't realize
*  it takes an exceptional human being to be a police officer
*  in the sense that you have to be, especially in these times, you have to be patient
*  because basically a large percentage of the population is at best skeptical
*  at worst hate you. Especially now.
*  During all that you have to still maintain calm.
*  You have to establish control. You have to help people. You have to serve the community.
*  It takes an exceptional man or woman to do that.
*  It's depressing to think because the exceptional humans in our society, who would want to join the police force now?
*  I talked about this with Edward Snowden recently.
*  What I wanted to say was that what really needs to be done is we need to do something at the root cause of it.
*  Why are there still these deeply impoverished communities in this country
*  that haven't changed since the 60s and there's been no work done to try to improve them?
*  Or whatever work has been done has been ineffective. They're still crime ridden.
*  They're still gang ridden. They're still filled with violence.
*  There's so much crime because there's so many communities that it's deeply entrenched in what they are.
*  Whether it's South Side of Chicago or parts of Detroit.
*  If you want to lower crime, you have to increase economic opportunity.
*  You have to increase education. You have to make people feel like they're in a safer environment.
*  You have to do something to make these neighborhoods better.
*  I'm not the person to figure that out. I don't know how you make a neighborhood better.
*  But it's not impossible. When you look at the amount of money they spent on stimulus
*  to try to help these businesses during the pandemic that were suffering,
*  why couldn't they do the exact same thing in the past to these cities?
*  Why couldn't they treat that like a pandemic? A pandemic of violence and crime that needs to be remedied?
*  The sad thing about the way the stimulus is being distributed,
*  at least my worry is that it creates a greater gap in wealth disparity versus a lesser one.
*  So all the problems you're mentioning, it's only going to make them worse.
*  So people who are not well off are going to become worse.
*  The opportunity for jobs is going to be lesser. The opportunities for people who are going to lose their businesses,
*  that means their dreams are broken essentially and the people who worked for the people who ran the businesses
*  are going to not have a job. And all of that creates a greater disparity within those communities,
*  greater desperation. And then desperation, I've been reading the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,
*  a great book I recommend it highly. It talks about the 30s and the rise of Hitler in Germany.
*  And the pain, both economic and psychological, turns into this dark energy that can be
*  combined with a charismatic leader to go into a direction of hatred versus love and progress.
*  And that's terrifying. I don't think we have a competent, charismatic leader that would do that
*  in the positive or negative direction, but I do hope a leader arises that uses that energy of pain
*  to do something good in a positive way. And we need that.
*  I think people don't realize how much pain there is being experienced right now.
*  Most people in real pain don't have a podcast, don't have a voice. And they don't have a job.
*  And everyone's kind of in this holding position. But the reality is, once the economy opens up slowly and slowly,
*  there's going to be that the remnants of the pain experienced in this year is going to be there.
*  People have lost their savings. People have lost their dreams. That materializes itself,
*  just like it did in Germany, in bitterness and hatred. And that can create revolutions.
*  That can create unstoppable destructive forces, especially when combined with an ideologue.
*  That's terrifying to me. People should definitely study... There's this discussion of Hitler recently.
*  Everyone says either Obama is Hitler or Trump is Hitler.
*  Who said Obama is Hitler?
*  When Obama was president.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. Because...
*  What the fuck?
*  This is what people do. Using the military industrial complex to control the population, that kind of idea.
*  The thing is, you have to separate Hitler, the evil person that created the Holocaust,
*  from the general, evil, charismatic leader that took the country into...
*  used nationalism to take the country into a dark place in the 30s. Those are two different stories.
*  I don't think we're going to have ever something, hopefully, any atrocity like the Holocaust.
*  But it's possible that the pain that people feel will be taken advantage of by a charismatic leader
*  to take steps back, not forward. That's a real worry.
*  Yeah, I don't see that leader on the horizon, but the other problem is, even a positive leader.
*  The way politics work in America, everyone is so accustomed to people chopping people down.
*  So much so that one of the things that's weird about Kamala Harris being with Joe Biden
*  is that she was talking terrible things about him during the primaries.
*  When she was running against him in the primaries, she said horrible things about him.
*  And then when they brought it up on the Colbert show, she was like, it was a debate.
*  It was a debate. Is that what a debate is?
*  It's like, by any means necessary, you'll distort your own views of a person
*  in order to diminish that person so that you can succeed and they fail.
*  Or do you really mean that, and that's why you said it in the debate,
*  and you're willing to compromise whatever your ethics or your morals or whatever your perceptions as persons are,
*  because you want to be vice president. It's one or the other. Either one's not good.
*  And I think it speaks to just the standard way that people debate and that people run for president in this country.
*  It's about tearing the other people down. It's not about what you can do, what you want to do.
*  What's your vision? It's about how bad that other person's going to do at the job.
*  How bad that other person has done at the job. What a terrible person they are.
*  What will distort their character?
*  Yeah, so turning into a game, a rap battle.
*  My worry is that we're going to get in 2024 or 2028 Donald Trump Jr. versus AOC.
*  So you basically take the most entertaining Instagram accounts or whatever,
*  and the most divisive ones, who's going to have the best memes of tearing each other down?
*  It'll become a reality show. And of course the media would love that because it makes,
*  it draws more eyes because we generally are drawn to controversy, to drama and funny drama.
*  This kind of shallow, derisive kind of conversation basically trolls on both sides.
*  We're drawn to that. As opposed to the Andrew Yang type folks who are like,
*  let's all get along and let's hear some ideas.
*  That's why he's so refreshing, right?
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And also, he's an entrepreneur. It's a different kind of human being that is running into the race.
*  He's not a career politician. He's a guy who genuinely thinks he can help.
*  And young. There's something to that, just that fresh energy.
*  100%. Not compromised too. Not compromised by that fucked up system.
*  When you deal with someone like Joe Biden who's a 50-year politician,
*  my God, it's so entangled. You're so encrusted into that.
*  He probably doesn't even, he's almost unable to think original thoughts at this time
*  because you've been in the system for so long.
*  You can't sit back, Elon Musk style, think from first principles.
*  Like, okay, here's a new problem. What are the ways we've been doing it previously?
*  It hasn't worked. How can we do it differently?
*  Let's all cut the bullshit.
*  I know there's a bunch of ties, lobbyists, money interests.
*  Let's put all that aside. What are we supposed to do?
*  We're supposed to represent the people. We're supposed to do something great for this country.
*  How do we do that?
*  And fire, again, this is a destructive creative destruction.
*  Fire everybody who has the entrenched old school assumptions that haven't worked.
*  Fire everybody and hire new energy.
*  Well, you'd have to revamp the system too. There's so much to do.
*  Well, this is the time to do it. And there's a hunger for that.
*  I think there's a hunger for a populist that wants to revamp the system.
*  It doesn't matter whether or not they'd actually be able to do it.
*  I mean, there's so many checks and balances in place to sort of prevent that from happening
*  because they're worried about someone doing it for the wrong reasons.
*  Well, if there's a positive view on our current president, Donald Trump,
*  is he showed that you don't have to follow the rules.
*  You don't have to follow the rules of the system. You can just fire everybody.
*  The checks and balances, you just need to ignore them.
*  I mean, that should be inspiring to positive leaders.
*  Say, you know what? Even if I'm young, even if I'm an AOC type character or whatever,
*  on the right, even Donald J. Trump, Jr., sorry, Donald Trump, is he also a J?
*  Well, he's Jr., so he must be a J.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah, the way Jr. works, you have to have the same middle name as well.
*  It has to be a perfect match.
*  I believe so. Isn't that correct?
*  Well, yeah.
*  So, yeah, that should be inspiring to young leaders to say,
*  you can revamp the whole system.
*  That was one of the criticisms of Barack Obama is that he talked about change,
*  and he hasn't really changed much.
*  And I think it's possible to change.
*  I think there's something gross about Juniors.
*  Just the name, Jr.
*  Like, how can you be your own fucking person?
*  The third, the fourth.
*  Oh, God, Thurston Howell, the third.
*  It's like the queen.
*  Like from Gilligan's Island.
*  Yeah, it's weird.
*  Like, come on, Dad.
*  Can you come up with another fucking name, you unoriginal twat?
*  How about give me a different name?
*  Yeah.
*  I got to walk around with Jr.
*  Donald the fourth.
*  Lex Friedman Jr.
*  Yeah.
*  This little Lex.
*  Yeah, and then like multiples.
*  That's the sound of that.
*  He has a Lex.
*  It's a tradition.
*  How about George Foreman?
*  You know, he names all his kids George?
*  All of them.
*  That's I think even his daughters.
*  Really?
*  That can't be true.
*  That cannot be true.
*  It's true.
*  And then you have on the opposite side,
*  Elon Musk, who names his fucking random letters of the alphabet.
*  Yeah, he named his kid after a jet and all kinds of the weird shit.
*  Not all.
*  He's named a few daughters.
*  Other things, apparently.
*  Oh, George has?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, he's got a lot of kids, right?
*  There's also there's a Georgetta.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's that's a weird move.
*  Miss Pat had something on Instagram about NFL players yesterday about like seven NFL players
*  have fathered 52 children from 48.
*  There was one guy had like 26 kids a couple years ago or something like that.
*  So crazy.
*  Teach that man about condoms.
*  Good Lord, sir.
*  Yeah.
*  There's no way you're taking care of all those kids.
*  This one has 14.
*  Someone has 14 kids.
*  He has 350 grand or so a month, a year to support eight of them.
*  He has to pay.
*  Only eight of them?
*  Why, man?
*  What about the other ones?
*  Hey, they all got different deals, I guess.
*  Oh, boy.
*  It's too easy to make people, you know, the problem is it's pleasurable.
*  And it's we're all like super drawn to it because it's part of our DNA to be sexually
*  attracted to whoever.
*  And that's how you make people.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's like like hunger making people, you know, it's because people used to die so easily
*  because we don't run fast.
*  And, you know, we're basically like water balloons and died birth like close to at a
*  young age often because just medicine advanced so much that we were able to save kids.
*  Sure.
*  Nutrition, infections, all that kind of stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't I can't I haven't looked into this carefully, but there's a there seems to be
*  a lot of debate about whether to worry about overpopulation or not.
*  Like I've posted these like projections of the population when we're going to reach 10
*  trillion people, billion people.
*  And there's a lot of debate of whether that is like we should be worried about or not.
*  On the one side, the natural carrying capacity of Earth, people say that we have way more
*  resources that we need is not to worry about.
*  It's nothing to worry about.
*  But it's about how those resources are allocated, right?
*  Some places are very resource poor, but they have high populations.
*  And that's a gigantic problem.
*  And most of the population growth in the 21st century will be in Africa.
*  If you look at the models in Africa will have, I believe, more people than the rest of the
*  world by like the end of the century.
*  If the population continues like this, if you talk about large families, they're happening
*  in Africa.
*  The thing about Africa, though, is it actually can fit most of the world in it when you
*  realize how big Africa is.
*  I had no idea until we started doing this podcast.
*  And Jamie pulled up this image of like Europe and Asia and the United States and all these
*  other countries stuffed into the continent of Africa.
*  It's only then you realize how big Africa actually is.
*  So it kind of makes sense.
*  Yeah, space wise.
*  But also resource wise, there's a lot of people suffering in Africa.
*  That's something that we keep a blind eye to.
*  But there's real suffering, poverty.
*  It's interesting that some animals have mating seasons, you know, like deer have mating
*  seasons.
*  They go into the rut in the fall and then the does are in estrus and they give out the
*  scent and the bucks go crazy and they're chasing them all around.
*  But they only do it once a year.
*  And then in the spring they give birth to the new fawns.
*  And this is like it's really common in the wild for animals to have a season.
*  Do chimps do?
*  No, no, no, no.
*  I wonder if there's ups and downs.
*  So humans have like a mating season around like Christmas, the holidays, and then it
*  goes down in the January month.
*  I think it's only game animals, meaning animals that are prey.
*  And I think predators just go buck wild.
*  I think predators breed whenever the fuck they want to.
*  You know, I don't know if that's true, though.
*  I mean, I don't know if like lions and tigers, for instance.
*  I know I had a bit that I used to do about tigers because I watched this Discovery Channel
*  show where they said when the female tiger is in season, the male can mate with her as
*  many times as 52 in a day.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, so they just get after it.
*  But I don't know how long that lasts, like when they're in heat.
*  Jamie, could you look up the mating seasons for lions, please?
*  Yes, please.
*  Here it goes.
*  In captivity, lions often breed every year, but in the wild they usually breed no more
*  than once in two years.
*  Females are receptive to mating for three or four days within a widely variable reproductive
*  cycle.
*  During this time, a pair generally mates every 20 to 30 minutes with up to 50 copulations
*  for 24 hours.
*  Whoa.
*  That sounds weirdly like my life, actually.
*  Once in two years.
*  It's good.
*  Maybe you're a predator, sir.
*  Yeah, but it's interesting the wildly, the reproductive cycles.
*  It's like it's not predictable, like like like a prey animal.
*  But I would also think that nature probably over the course of millions of years balances
*  that out with overpopulation.
*  They realize like, hey, if there's too many lions, like what eats lions?
*  Very few things eat lions, right?
*  Occasionally a hyena will get one with a broken leg and they'll take it out.
*  But the reality is mostly it's lions doing the eating.
*  So you can't have too many of them.
*  But like deer and things like that?
*  Well, fuck man.
*  They make babies and then they can like literally overwhelm a resource area if there's no predators.
*  So you have to have predators.
*  So there's like some sort of a balance like nature sort of figured out the best way to
*  keep the animals healthy is to only have them breed once a year.
*  Yeah, it's amazing how evolution finds a balance for all kinds of them.
*  I think you mean God, but that's OK.
*  I'll let you get away with that.
*  God and Jesus, yeah.
*  Don't you know we're in Texas, bro?
*  Yeah.
*  Guns, God, America.
*  Yeah.
*  Whiskey, Scotch.
*  It is amazing.
*  I mean, natural selection and just evolution in general is so fascinating.
*  You know what's amazing is I talked to Sarah Seeger.
*  There's this whole group of people that look for life.
*  I don't know if you know what exoplanets are.
*  Yeah.
*  Like they look for life out there.
*  You know, some people think that there's Jupiter, Moon of Jupiter.
*  Europa has as well.
*  I mean, it's fascinating to think that there's life currently or at least recently on Mars.
*  You know, and it's fascinating to think what the evolutionary process on those planets
*  has resulted in.
*  Yeah.
*  And when we show up, I talked to somebody I forget who.
*  Oh, I think a biologist, the colleague faculty at MIT.
*  He mentioned that because my worry would be if we encounter life on another planet,
*  it would be destructive to us humans or we to them, one or the other.
*  Because it's an entire, I mean, they can, you know, with this virus we're experiencing now,
*  my natural thought, I don't know what I'm talking about with biology,
*  but my natural thought would be like when you touch that life,
*  it might basically be a parasite, take advantage of you somehow.
*  Sure.
*  But he said that likely it would be there's a certain kind of distance that happens
*  if it's far enough away in terms of the kind of energy it uses,
*  the kind of environment it's adapted to that it basically won't even notice humans.
*  Like you won't know how to take advantage of the resources we provide.
*  So like that's a hopeful message that we basically could study it safely.
*  But isn't that just like purely speculative?
*  Because if it's in the Goldilocks zone and you have something that is also carbon based biological life
*  that is a similar temperature range that it exists in, it easily could eat us.
*  Yeah, from inside.
*  Pandorum in Avatar, that planet.
*  I always felt like that movie was so interesting because it's close, right?
*  It's close.
*  Whatever it is, is like not Earth, but it's close.
*  And the things that live there are not they're not human, but they're close.
*  Like you could kind of see that it's good enough.
*  It's close enough like the animals and all the weird creatures in the jungle and in the Avatar movie.
*  But the thing is, most likely life will be not close.
*  Right.
*  It'll be.
*  That's the I told you about David Fravor.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's talk to recently.
*  By the way, thank you for I renamed my podcast.
*  Just my name.
*  Yeah.
*  Lex Friedman.
*  When I heard you tell that to Joey, Joey Diaz.
*  Yeah.
*  Sadly, people should go listen to Joey's last.
*  He did.
*  He recorded his last Church of What's Happening Now episode.
*  So you suggested to him that he should do some new thing totally and just name it after himself.
*  And I was like, why the fuck am I have some silly name like artificial intelligence?
*  Just just name it like the Joe Rogan experience.
*  Just like the Lex Friedman podcast.
*  Anyway, I talked to David for four hours.
*  Yeah.
*  Why did I bring that up?
*  Because David Fravor, you're talking.
*  Let's explain who David Fravor was.
*  Yeah.
*  He's a fighter jet pilot for the Navy.
*  And he discovered a UFO off the coast of San Diego that when they tracked it, went from 60,000 feet to one feet in a second.
*  Or less.
*  They don't know how fast it went because it's, you know, the blip of a radar.
*  But the thing traveled in an insane way that defies all of our understanding of propulsion, all of our understanding of physics.
*  And this thing also actively was blocking their tracking systems, which is an act of war.
*  If it's, you know, the Soviet Union or China was doing that, that's technically an act of war.
*  So this thing was doing something that showed that it was intelligently aware of the fact that they are using tracking devices to try to lock in on it.
*  And it behaved and moved in a way that defies all of our understandings of propulsion systems.
*  It didn't give off any heat signature.
*  And the people from the Navy that he was communicating with saying, yeah, we see these every now and again.
*  We don't know what the fuck they are.
*  So the thing I was going to say, this is a lot of interesting things to say about this, but so just this, I just remembered that it felt like from that entire experience that because it didn't have a Chinese or Russian flag on it, whatever he saw, is we tend to just the entire system is doesn't want to acknowledge it.
*  Like you just you don't know what to do with it.
*  So they actually most of like when you return back to the ship and there's a bunch of pilots that put you know that saw it.
*  There's a lot of people that witnessed it.
*  And there's also the video, you know, the majority of the people didn't know what to do with it.
*  They just went on with their day like nothing happened.
*  You know, they kind of made fun of each other or whatever for, you know, yeah, yeah, sure, bro.
*  You saw aliens, but like they didn't they didn't know how to comprehend it.
*  That's what I meant. Like if we encounter life from elsewhere in the universe, we think we would be as a population excited.
*  But it feels like just like with Book Bigfoot, we want we're excited by the mystery when they're like when they're just out of reach.
*  When they're like among us, there's so many mysteries and incredible things among us that we just kind of take them for granted.
*  Yeah, we don't even or ignore them. Actually, even worse, we ignore them.
*  We get used to things. And that was the weird thing.
*  The biggest mystery to me about what David Fever saw and a lot.
*  And then also with the other videos in 2014, something like that, the go fast is like it wasn't a bigger deal than I thought it would be.
*  Well, the big deal was when the Pentagon came out and said that they have recovered some vehicles that are not of this world.
*  Now, they didn't expand on that. There hasn't been more conversation about that.
*  But my this is a purely speculation.
*  My speculation is they are slowly spoon feeding us information to allow people to be more comfortable with the inevitable arrival of something.
*  If they believe that something's coming, they don't want it to happen all at once.
*  You see what happens just with the pandemic.
*  You see what happens with George Floyd.
*  You see what happens with any way anytime there's a big shock to our system and there's chaos in the streets.
*  It's unmanageable. And if the UFOs came in the middle of something like that, like Jesus Christ, like who the fuck knows what would go down if I was someone who was in a position of power?
*  I would say, listen, this information is going to get out.
*  It's inevitable. So why don't we let people know now?
*  Just give them just in words, say we have recovered crafts that are not of this world.
*  Say something crazy like that.
*  Let print in the New York Times, get it out there and then slowly drip out more information.
*  When they see these videos, they'll get more and more accustomed to it.
*  And then eventually to be like masks.
*  Like you walk down the street, everybody has a mask on.
*  You don't even think about it.
*  Yeah, but OK, so let me be.
*  I'm saying I totally.
*  And this is such a fascinating question.
*  If the government is in possession of an alien spacecraft, what is the right way to release that information?
*  The real problem is if it's more potent than any weapon that any any civilization has currently on this planet.
*  So if the United States is in control of this vehicle that is more potent and can do things that like if you really do have something that can go from 60,000 feet to one foot in under a second, that I mean, that's that defies all of our understandings of speed.
*  Right. I mean, that's so fast.
*  If you could do that.
*  Well, there's arguments against because it could be human created technology to that's just 15, 20, 30 years out like the stealth bomber was developed secretly.
*  So what defies it's our perception of its movement capabilities is what defies.
*  But there could be some tricks on perception that I mean, that's the whole point with a stealth bomber is it's difficult to detect.
*  Sure.
*  And so there could be same kind of tricks on perception that you could just be playing different kinds of amazing secret human created technology that is able to deceive the human eye.
*  That's a good point.
*  I mean, but the the thing about it is they tracked it.
*  It wasn't just that it was the human eye that saw this and it's deceptive, but also like the stealth bomber, you know, the way it's designed, it blocks radar or radar doesn't catch on to it.
*  I think it is possible that some human created technology that's so far advanced from anything that we're currently that we currently understand, like in terms of like mainstream propulsion experts and fighter pilots like David Fravor and military people.
*  It is possible that some civilization, one of the one of the big civilizations on this planet, whether it's China or Russia, has come up with something that's above and beyond what everybody knows.
*  But it's not likely.
*  It's not likely that they've made that much of a leap.
*  And your sense on the other side, if it's alien technology, see, I'm more optimistic to me as a scientist and engineer.
*  And actually, David Favreau says says this, too, in this time of pandemic, in this time of like just just hard negative news everywhere, there will be nothing more inspiring than the government in an inspiring like Neil deGrasse Tyson way coming out and saying we have not releasing the videos like they did, which is I don't know if you know, but they just put the videos on the website like there's not there's nothing.
*  It's just videos. It's just like with like some boring documents that describe like nothing. They're not inspiring.
*  We're not talking about like Neil deGrasse Tyson or like Carl Sagan Cosmos style, like a beautiful, inspiring.
*  What is more inspiring than an alien spacecraft?
*  Look, here's a there's a fascinating mystery here.
*  There's nothing more inspiring to us humans than that.
*  There is life out there, intelligent life out there.
*  But how would you handle it?
*  Let's imagine let's imagine you are the leader of the United States and you find out or the you know, whatever the head of the Navy Military Intelligence Program, whatever, whoever you are.
*  You're a person that's in a position where you realize that this thing is from another world and you have this responsibility to try to somehow or another publicize this.
*  Yeah, I would.
*  I would I would I would I would approach it 100% from the perspective of science.
*  Here's a mystery.
*  So forget weapon like you mentioned there's this inclination to think like how can I figure out a way to use this as a weapon to destroy Russia or China as opposed to seeing it like like going to Mars, colonizing Mars or going to the moon.
*  Originally, there is some competitive element, but mostly it's a human pursuit of understanding and human pursuit of overcoming our limited knowledge to sort of unlock mysteries of this universe from a physics perspective, from an engineering perspective.
*  I would release all the information I have and release it in a way that gets the Neil deGrasse Tyson folks in the loop.
*  So it's it's almost like an inspiring effort for us as a humanity to understand what the hell this thing is versus let's keep it secret and see if we can use it as a weapon.
*  Well, I appreciate that you think that way because you're a scientist and you're thinking about it in a very positive way to try to expand our education and our understanding of this this thing.
*  And maybe we could, you know, use it for good.
*  But you got to realize that anything that surpasses any and all technologies that we currently enjoy in terms of fighter pilots and jets and military superiority, if there's something that just is above and beyond all, if everybody has a Model T and you have a Ferrari or better yet, you have a Tesla, you have a Model S and everybody's got a Model T.
*  You are this is in that you're in a race like you have something that is so far above and beyond what everybody else has.
*  It's not really a fair race. It's a joke. You'll dominate if that if you were in a you have a Model T and the other person has a Tesla and you're racing and the winner gets to decide who has all the food, who gets all the women, who lives in the nice house like you're going to win every fucking time.
*  Right now, if you have a UFO, if you have a spaceship that comes from another planet where there are a million years more advanced than us, they've had a million years of evolution and technological evolution, dealing with elements that are common on their planet that have to be created on a particle collider here.
*  And they only exist for a brief amount of time. If they have something like that, that's powered by something that we can't even imagine.
*  And you figure out how to use that here on Earth, you'll have technical superiority, technological superiority over every other civilization, every other country.
*  In that technological superior, it's so funny us chimps are like still talking about our village. We want our village to be better than the next village.
*  When there's an alien civilization that's a million years more advanced, that would easily destroy us if it wanted to, or actually understands the nature of existence in this universe on levels that are like we we chimps talk about like meditation and finding inner peace.
*  It understands on such a deeper level like the nature of consciousness, the nature of intelligence, the meaning of life, all that weird stuff that we're so obsessed with. It understands on another level.
*  And here we are thinking about what the Russians are doing versus like understanding that mystery. I think in the face of that mystery, something that's far more intelligent than us, I think we can't, it's a ridiculous notion to think we're anything but one human village.
*  And in terms of weapons, because you said like get all the girls or whatever, I think the weapons thing is the key thing. And we already, at least the major nations, have all the weapons we need to destroy each other.
*  It's like we don't need extra weapons. Well, I mean, it feels like your hypothesis would be like if an alien technology was here and we'd figure it out, we'd be able to have something that destroys other chimp villages on order of magnitude more efficiently than nuclear weapons, thereby having an asymmetrical
*  sort of from a game theory perspective, power over other nations. And we can tell China what to do, we can tell Russia what to do. That's the perspective from which they're thinking. I just...
*  I'm not even saying that they're thinking that way. I'm thinking a human would think that if they had control of this vehicle. I'm not saying that the aliens would think this way. I'm thinking also that we are constantly innovating. When you talk to people that are designing jets and planes and fighter pilots and they're talking about new systems that they've created and new weapons, they don't just sit back and say we have enough weapons to destroy Russia and China and the Russians.
*  We're going to suppress the world combined, so we're just going to stop. This is not how human beings innovate. Human beings are in this constant state of wanting the newest, greatest innovations. We want to improve upon every single existing invention until we hit some sort of singularity point or whatever the fuck we're striving for as a culture.
*  And that would be that propulsion system. If you do really have something that can go from 60,000 feet to one feet in less than a second, you're dealing with something that we don't understand. We can't do that right now. And if you could figure out how to do that and propel people that quickly, it would be a game changer.
*  Now, how much of a game changer? What does that mean? We're in this weird place where we kind of agree to not use our best weapons. When there's a face-off between the United States jets and a Russian jet and they come close to each other, like over China or something like that, it's weird because we're not shooting at each other, but we're real close.
*  And even the missiles that we have, they're not nuclear. But we're involved in a skirmish with another country, but we don't use all our weapons. If we approached war the way people approached war in the Middle Ages, we would just nuke the fuck out of everybody that talks shit.
*  Right? Anybody? What did China just say? Would they just say, fucking launch those missiles? Fuck those people. Instead of Twitter, it'd be nukes. Yeah. Exactly. So we're already in this place where we don't use our best stuff. So if we had something that made us fly better and fly faster, the real question is, yeah, how much would that change the world? I don't know how much it would. If we got in control of some UFO and we were able to get to China quicker, how much of a difference would that make?
*  In terms of like the way they responded to our military, we're in this position now where there's multiple countries that have the ability to destroy other countries. There's Iran has some sort of a nuclear program. Pakistan has a nuclear program. India has nuclear program. You know, of course, the United States, Russia, China, there's many countries that have the ability to fucking wipe out huge numbers of the population like that.
*  So we're gonna launch just one crazy psychotic leader who just decides to just listen, we're gonna fucking make our mark here. Everybody together on one, two, three, go. Boom.
*  I mean, that's such a difficult, you talked to Snowden, such a difficult ethical question. Like if I actually had that information, I tend to lean a little bit on the side of it's the duty of every American to leak that information, to take it and make it public. But I understand that it takes a huge risk of destroying the world because evil people can get their hands on that information. That's the quite that's the Bob Lazar question, right?
*  Wasn't that Oppenheimer's dilemma? I mean, when Oppenheimer, who's a, you know, a very peaceful man, created the most destructive or helped create the most destructive invention the world's ever known. It's a conundrum, right? Like, but doing so, did he prevent a lot of other death because Germany would have gotten it or Japan would have gotten it? And they would have used it on Europe, they would have used it on the United States. Is that possible?
*  That's the argument, right? That there's a race going on that people understand that splitting the atom and is possible that nuclear weapons are feasible. And whoever gets them first is going to have a massive advantage. We got them first. And therefore, you know, we became the preeminent superpower. But what if we didn't? What if Oppenheimer was a dummy? You know, what if there was a bunch of knuckleheads working for the United States and the Russians and the Germans and the Japanese were all working together and they came up with something far better? Obviously, the Russians were better.
*  The Russians were against the Germans in that war. But I mean, fit together any superpowers at the time. If they got together with their scientists and they figured out a nuclear bomb first, just dropped it on San Francisco. Well, how much would the world be different now?
*  Yeah, I mean, and Russia, I mean, Stalin is a complicated figure. So he was on the side of the United States at the time. But evil is fucked. But evil, evil. And if he had nuclear weapons, it's a whole nother discussion. Yes.
*  And it's actually quite surprising to me that we got out of the 20th century alive. Yeah, from a perspective of Oppenheimer. You know, I think he probably wondered if we're going to destroy ourselves within the next decade, no matter what happens when you have when you have weapons that can destroy all of civilization, especially now with hydrogen bombs.
*  It's complicated to talk about anything like alien technology. Yeah, well, I think that's probably I mean, if I was an alien, and I was paying attention to Earth, it's probably why I would visit and be like these chimps are in this weird stage of evolution, where they're still chimps.
*  They're still behaving like territorial apes. But now they have nuclear technology. They have this very crude version of the literally the power of the sun.
*  Well, that's what Okay, so here's another hypothesis. They saw these destructive weapons. And so they actually, in Roswell plant or whatever it is, planted a piece of technology that we should figure out there'll be an infinitely powerful generator of love versus destruction. So they're like, okay, these chimps are not going down the wrong path, let us plant some stuff where they figure out like how to be enlightened.
*  Mushrooms. Yeah, mushrooms. That's what they did. I mean, we tried that. Because they kind of it's where you know, from their perspective, the chimps are like a nice video game, like they're like a chia pet where you watch them like grow. And they probably, I mean, that's what we would do if we encounter maybe like an ant colony.
*  And we saw that the ant colony is destroying itself. You know, us from a scientific perspective, we'd want them to not become extinct. So probably interfere in some way to try to prevent the ant colony from destroying itself.
*  So that, you know, as a curiosity, as a cosmic cure, it feels like Earth is a cosmic curiosity from a perspective of an intelligent alien species like that's really interesting what's going on there. Let's let's see what's happening.
*  A friend of mine told me the story that he saw two mounds of fire ants. And that he did this experiment where he took a bucket, and he scooped up ants from one fire ant colony and scooped up ants from the other and then dumped them on the opposite colonies and watched them fight to the death.
*  And I was like, fuck, really? He goes, yeah, they instantaneously knew that those ants were from the wrong colony and they just went to war.
*  And there's a I don't know if you there's a few good books on ants. They have like a collective intelligence. Yeah, because we tend to think of the individual ants, but somehow as an organism to get together in the thousands of vans, millions of vans, there's somehow a collective emergence that collective intelligence that emerges.
*  Like there's this whole field of computer science called ant colony optimization. Like if we just simulate nature inspired optimization algorithms, they somehow figure out how to do stuff in an emergent way.
*  Don't really understand it. We don't have mathematics to deal with. Like when you have a bunch of distributed organisms doing dumb stuff, just looking at their neighbors, when you look at the system as a whole, intelligence stuff emerges.
*  That's that. There's a do you know who Stephen Wolfram is? No, by any chance. Well, you know who Eric Weinstein is. Yeah. So there Eric Weinstein is out of the million intelligent thing he does. He's also a mathematical physicist. So he has like that theory of everything that you've talked to him about.
*  Or he blew your mind with geometric unity. There's another guy, really brilliant guy, Stephen Wolfram. He's a physicist. He created Wolfram Alpha that like everybody uses in high school for to do their homework in calculus.
*  It is. It's a you can ask it a bunch of questions like how much does Joe Rogan weigh or something like that. Like it has this I don't know. I don't know if he can. I don't know if he knows about Joe Rogan, but it might be interesting. I see.
*  It has like this huge knowledge base. Yeah, maybe it doesn't know individual people.
*  What does it say? It has like Google information. But it's able to integrate it really well. So like you can do math on this information. That's a really important thing. So you can do like you know can calculate the you know the average population of Austin because it has the information of the number of people, the number of the area, all that.
*  Whatever. It's a really useful tool. But he also came out with this Wolfram Physics project recently where he describes it's another theory of everything. Do you know what a theory of everything is? It's a sort of it's a unification of all the different laws of physics so that with one theory you can describe everything that's happening around us.
*  And the reason I bring that up because you're talking about ants. Stephen Wolfram's idea. He has this like.
*  Infant like he has this model of the universe. That's this what's called the hyper graph is this really simple system that grows with a single rule like it expands. It starts from just a couple of points that are connected with a line and then it grows with a single simple rule.
*  Just like ants interact really simply. This system grows and his theory is that it can grow into create our entire universe. Like from it it doesn't have a concept of space or time like we perceive it the four dimensional the three dimensional space and the fourth dimension of time.
*  But all of that emerges within the system. We chimps are one in 10 to 120 part of that that incredible infrastructure that grows and he like mathematically describes the way this thing grows.
*  We don't currently have good mathematics for modeling the way systems grow. There's something called cellular automata where it's a really a called game of life. Unfortunately, John Conway that created the game of life from died recently from covid.
*  It describes a very simple system where from simple rules you can have incredible complexity and it's a really cool idea that our universe started from like basically like one ant.
*  And then or actually two ants and then their interaction creates a system that's so incredibly complex even though the underlying rules are simple.
*  That's we don't understand why the hell that happens. We humans from the scientific perspective. We know how to describe like a single system the way an object moves.
*  We don't have a math or even a science of describing how trillions of objects move when they interact simply with each other. We don't know how to do that.
*  But that's what seems to happen when you look at we know how to you know psychology can describe the behavior of a single human.
*  Well, we don't have a science of is to describe what happens when a billion humans interact. I don't know if that kind of makes sense. But like the it's called a complexity.
*  A study of complexity. What is this Jamie? This is sort of this is a hyper graph. He started explanations of all this sort of stuff.
*  So if you look at any of those if you zoom in on any of those graphs, I mean, when the previous page was the previous one was really good.
*  So if you zoom in on any of those below you see all these beautiful little graphy things below it.
*  There is like two boxes and that describes a rule of if you see a pattern on the left expanded to the pattern on the right and the entirety.
*  So his hypothesis is one of these rules created the universe where this little rule of if you see a pattern on the left create a pattern on the right.
*  It creates these incredibly rich graphs from which emerge this the he's modeling all of quantum mechanics of general activity.
*  So theory of everything needs to unify the physics of the big which is general relativity special relativity and then the physics of the really small which is quantum mechanics.
*  And he within those grass is able to find the emergence of these theories. First the emergence of space and time.
*  Then the I mean everything you need to describe for quantum field theory all that kind of stuff. It's trippy.
*  Go back to those images. That is a bunch of really cool ones. Is that him right there? No. Who's that guy?
*  That's a guy. Those those images that you showed in that graph like you know what that reminds me of. Do you remember the movie Arrival?
*  Yeah. He was a wolf. OK. He was the designer of the language. Well that makes sense.
*  He was tasked such a cool task as a physicist. Oh my God. Like can you design a method by which the aliens might be communicating with us.
*  That looks like it. And it were similar to but there was a math behind it. So the the the language he developed there was a mathematical richness to the language.
*  Him and his son. You know when when you get this far down the intellectual rabbit hole when you go to mean that to the like how many people actually understand this to the point where they can they could read it describe it accurately.
*  This is that's the that's the problem with the theory of everything is very few physicists really understand like the details involved.
*  We're talking about to be it's the same as the order of magnitude of professional comedians I would say. It's like thousands maybe maybe less than on the whole planet on the whole planet.
*  But the cool thing about the Wolfram thing is set physics aside. It's just the the part that a lot of people can understand and I highly recommend like curious undergrads and really you don't need to know how to program.
*  They understand how those beautiful things and the language in the movie arrival can grow from simple rules. You can play with it like it's a it's one of the most beautiful in terms of maybe take some mushrooms and like if you want to see a beautiful concept is have a system that's really simple like a few dots like a tic tac toe board.
*  And have rules that apply to that board that are really simple one simple rule and like the beautiful patterns that emerge.
*  Give me an example of a rule like that.
*  So the rule for the game of life is for like something like a tic tac toe board is a cell that's white is dead so that's black is alive let's say and when three of the cells neighbors are also alive then you live on otherwise you die meaning you flip.
*  You know okay so you when you have three neighbors I might be getting the exact rule wrong for the game of life but when you when you only each cell only looks at its neighbors and when a certain number of neighbors is alive I think it's three then you continue being black you continue being alive otherwise you die.
*  It's a live die and you're just a single cell sitting there and you live and die based on your neighbors. Okay that's dumb I mean it's very simple you think what can be created from that and you can create everything in the known universe from that so like people have created computers from that from a touring machine like the patterns that emerge you can create all these kinds of fractals.
*  You think like it would create some kind of repeatable regular pattern or something like that it would be something dumb but it can create these like like the one one really important thing is the cell just knows about itself it doesn't move it just knows about itself but when you zoom out and you look at the result from the system it looks like there's objects running around like the individual cells aren't running around but it looks like the objects are running around you can have messengers you can have the
*  what are called spaceships which are these mechanisms that use the cells and and move around like if you have any gifts or videos of it like there's stuff that moves and it seems like it's intelligent objects that communicate with each other and all of that emerges and you can see like if you just think about it a little bit like you have to remind yourself that see like this animation right there it looks like there's a moving object like it looks so I think these are called glider guns or something like that where they shoot off objects
*  of different kinds and like you think but the individual cell knows nothing about anything except itself and its nearest neighbors and as a result you can nevertheless have arbitrary complexity objects of arbitrary size that move around that live and die like that like I said do any kind of computation in the world it makes you realize that it's possible that this universe is just some simple
*  dumb rules on a scale of 10 to the 120 like an ant colony just that just scaled are like an insanely to an arbitrary degree and then we're just there was we're like this clueless apes they're just the result of that we're not able to perceive at all the that you know much much smaller level the simplicity that's happening to us all of this seems
*  like it all does it seems complicated to us like this table seems like it's wood in it we don't perceive the atoms we don't perceive the quantum mechanics we don't perceive whether strength theory or something like wolfram is saying like these objects that are interacting at a microscope far smaller than the microscopic level but it might be that they're really simple rules they just create all of this it seems complicated to us but the it's something that's I think is nice
*  to appreciate for people from all walks of life how much complexity be created from simplicity from simple rules how much richness beauty just could be created from simple rules isn't it also really interesting that everything tends to move towards greater and greater complexity well so this is I think really important and it's surprising in general the second author
*  thermodynamics says that everything becomes more chaotic so it's not complex it becomes more boring the heat death in the universe that everything moves apart everything becomes ran eventually eventually but the thing is that there's pockets of complexity and that these pockets keep getting created of some interesting stuff that's a little like chimps like interesting stuff keeps getting created it's not obvious that that should be the case but just life in in general if you go from single-celled organisms you go from
*  bacteria to what we know now as human beings just think of all the different steps that had to take place and it moves towards greater and greater complexity greater and greater ability to manipulate their environment greater and greater ability to understand tools and 3d space and and how to manipulate things one of the things that I've always been fascinated about with the concept of aliens is what if what if the general direction that we're leading
*  in as a society like if you think about human beings today we're we're so much more civilized than human beings were 5,000 years ago we're a different thing you know we're we're less murderous we're less less inclined to be physical we have much more access to inventions much more access to technology technology was not existent back then we have electricity we have computers we have all these different things but it's moving in this direction more rapidly now than ever
*  before in terms of the innovation of objects and ideas if you go back to a computer like I remember I got a flat screen computer for the first I don't remember when it was but I remember I looked at one in 1995 I think it was it was like $20,000 in 95 and it was basically the size of that panel and it was like a flat I forget what the technology was the time it wasn't LCD plasma that's what it was
*  it was a plasma television and it looked like dark shit but it was thin fairly thin but today it would look like a brick like a crude mud brick that someone made in the jungle it looked like terrible and I was like that's ridiculous I'm not spending that much money on that fucking thing that's crazy so I got a regular TV but now you can get a TV like that for nothing you like you get a TV that size that's far better like an LCD screen beautiful 4k for like a hundred bucks or something like that it's amazing how
*  much the technology has changed how much better it's gotten years yes that's a blink of an eye in terms of the history of the world right and then you stop and think about iPhone one iPhone one was 10 years ago 13 now 2007 and it looks terrible you ever pick one up I still have one I found one when I was moving out here I found an old phone of mine I'm like look at this shit it's crazy it's small it's clunky the screen looks terrible the cameras dog shit it's just everything about it
*  slow awkward now you go to what I have now I have iPhone 11 and it's 11 years or 13 years later it's infinitely better it's so much better the camera the zoom capability and then there's this giant technological race for Samsung's coming out with a new note 20 ultra with fucking 100x zoom or all these different things that are happening it's we're in this weird technology race if you looked at us from afar you said well what is this
*  organism do what is this human organism do well it does a lot of things it creates culture it has you know different rules and religions and this thing okay okay okay but what does it do what's the end results bees make honey what do people do they make technology and one of the things that we do in terms of like keeping up with the Jones's materialism all these different weird traits that human beings have what they lend themselves to is technological innovation because if you're a materialist you want the newest latest greatest thing like what year is that
*  car 2018 you haven't seen the 2021 so much better like in 2018 cars fucking fine and it'll get you around but if you want to impress people you got to have the 2021 well one of the things that's weird about people is how materialistic we are so materialistic there's so many Instagram pages that are just filled with people with nice houses and let me clear my shit look at all my watches looking on my this looking on my that I mean this is a the thing that drives in it drives consumers it
*  drives commerce and commerce drives innovation innovation drives technology technology is what we create we just do it in a weird way we do it through sex we do it through social status we do it through the need for respect for envy all these different things but all of that really does do is drive technology because that's ultimately the end of the line and if you look at the big history one of the quotes that Elon tweeted is
*  from Andre Karpathy the head of Tesla autopilot shout out to Andre one of the great machine learning engineers of our time but his quote was if you bombard earth with photons long enough eventually will emit a Tesla so like you basically if you look from the very origins it's like you just the sun just needed to provide some energy to this thing like here up a little bit and eventually they'll start creating Teslas and then emit them into space look you'll start to have like rockets
*  it's true yeah it's true I mean it has happened so and but it's accelerating yes is why I mean again the Elon sort of exponential growth idea I mean it just seems to be getting faster and faster and faster which is us humans aren't able to reason that way like most of the technology we see around us is about a hundred years worth 150 electricity radio TV most of the medical innovations from antibiotics to to I mean
*  just everything it's just surgery for all the kinds of to most of the innovations in biology and chemistry modern physics even so obviously computers internet all of that so there's a hundred years 150 years maybe and it's accelerating and so our ability to think like what is possible in the next 10 20 years is is flawed I mean that's one like we talked about neural link
*  that's why there's a lot of people kind of you know unable to reason like where how quickly people in the scientific community are aware of how little or how limited our understanding of the human brain is on the neuro biological level just neuroscience just the basic functional at the functional level like how the brain functions and so they think like well many of the
*  possibilities that are especially exciting with the technology like brain computer interfaces like with neural link is must be hundred twenty hundred two hundred three hundred years away but the way things are accelerating is very possible that it's 50 years away 30 years away like the the ability to to digitize memories you know to be able to replay memories to digitize like Ray Kurzweil dreams about digitize the minds of humans so
*  immortality you know like I mentioned Sarah Seeger people should check out her new book some more but she searches for exoplanets planets she was one of the key people in discovering new exoplanets and Proxima Centauri is the closest that we think of Earth like planet or at least habitable planet out there and that seems to be too far away unless you're able to digitize humans so
*  as she said the easiest way to travel to that to that planet to see if there's extra terrestrial life out there is to digitize a human and send them on a ship because you can then travel much much faster than we could otherwise it's and you can have multi-generational obviously travel because a digital form of a human mind of consciousness intelligence all that kind of stuff you know it could travel for for me
*  millennia right and so that's that's an exciting possibility and most people would say that you know we don't really understand much about the mind and in order to understand enough about the mind to be able to digitally convert it to digitally store it and be able to ship it to Proxima Centauri would be centuries one of the exciting things about Neuralink to me in the long term is that they're really pushing
*  instead of making it centuries making it decades just like the bringing together the best engineers and scientists in the world and saying this is ripe with innovation there's a possibility here to do something truly special not only to understand the not only to help people with neurological disorders which is a huge obviously
*  goal mission a dream to
*  alleviate suffering right that's a that's as good of a mission for a group of scientists as any but also that we can understand the mind
*  we can expand different capacities of the mind like expand intelligence expand consciousness expand all the different kinds of capabilities of the mind and be able to digitally store that mind
*  so understand it to a degree to where we can copy it to we can store it to we can transmit it out to distant stars and to meet our alien friends in digital form that you know that's a mind blowing mission for for us chimps
*  yeah that's what I wonder when when I think about alien life and that tic tac ufo that David Fravor saw yeah like the idea that that would be biological that there would be some sort of biological life inside of it seems a little retro
*  right so everything about that seems retro about our interpretation of it like one thing is David's general inclination as I think he said on your podcast with him is like he wants to fly that thing his first thought was like I want to fly that thing
*  that's like finding an animal on another planet I want to fuck it is that a drama I want to fuck that space giraffe
*  like my question to him was like why did you think that's something you could fly like that to me seems preposterous that it could be a thing that could be uh flied to it's preposterous to me that there's an alien on board it could be just a reconnaissance
*  I mean what could be what what life becomes one of the things that I've been thinking about when it comes to neural link and and all all sorts of medical innovations in terms of artificial limbs and different prosthetics that people are able to concoct today
*  how close are we to those being better than the biological alternatives right like how how close are we to that like if you lose your arm they actually give you a six million dollar man arm that's better you remember that movie that TV show Steve Austin the man barely alive remember that
*  do you you're not old enough
*  well and I was born in the Soviet Union
*  we didn't have any of that those propaganda films
*  there was a movie it was a TV show it was about it was an awesome TV show
*  for me when I was a kid about a guy who was I think he was a fighter pilot and he was in a crash
*  and they rebuilt him with uh artificial parts
*  but the artificial parts he had like legs he could run 60 miles an hour he had a hand he could fucking just crush you with his hand
*  it was wild stuff man it was fun but it was just science fiction television but if they do get to a point where they have legs that work better than your legs and they feel like your legs
*  like I have friends that have fake hips I have friends that have resurfaced hips and resurfaced knees where they've they've you know terrible arthritis or cartilage damage and they've just replaced the part
*  and now they work now it works great they can they can do things like my friend with his bad hip he runs with a bat with this fake hip
*  um John Wayne Parr the Muay Thai kickboxer he he's throwing kicks now with his fake hip he just got his his leg was fixed two months ago I think
*  and his uh on his Instagram has got him throwing high kicks with with this uh resurfaced left leg it's crazy
*  when when is it going to come to a point in time where they can replace your eyes with better versions of what you have now
*  and they work better like it's not I know you're scared but it's no big deal it's like glasses but it's way better
*  we're going to put these things in you in where your eyes used to be they're magnetic women love them if you don't have them you're going to look like a loser
*  biological eyes what if these things that we're seeing are the ultimate symbiotic interaction of biology or the initial biology and technology
*  what if Neuralink is just one step into us essentially giving up our biological heritage and becoming a part of of the future
*  this idea of artificial life is a weird word right because it's not artificial it's right there it's real it's it's maybe it's made with things that are different than cells
*  but it's it's still life it's a thing like if you can create um you know like the Turing test right like you create something that seems so real and interacts with you
*  and it can trick you and it can trick someone who thinks like um the movie Ex Machina you're you're like I fell in love with that robot lady
*  and you would too she was hot and she seemed like really nice you know like like why am I so hung up on biology what's the big deal
*  you know like if that becomes what people are if you can download your consciousness into some thing that looks like a human being
*  and your consciousness rides around in this creation this technological creation maybe that's what aliens are and maybe that's what we need to do
*  to get past these territorial ape instincts that we have to like look at a spaceship and go I want to fly that let's look at an animal I want to fuck it
*  you know like to the idea of wanting to go over to a place and dominate it you know like
*  I think the one of the key things we need to we might be able to get past is the eye in that sentence the concept of individuality
*  the concept that like I'm a there's an identity like I am this meat bucket that that's like that somehow is special and unique and so on
*  the ego the ego the consciousness like it feels like something to be me as opposed to like maybe I'm just like a little fingertip of a much larger organism
*  and being able to see it like you know it's very possible that what intelligent life forms look like is something much less individualistic
*  like if we look at ant colonies and if we think of the individual ants it's a very different way to think about life on earth
*  than the collection of the ants together or if we look at the collection of the humans together as an intelligent organism
*  combined with the technology that we're creating all that becomes almost a single organism that's becoming more and more intelligent
*  that the idea that there is a hard line between biology and digital technology that we're developing it really from an outsider's perspective
*  we're all an interesting complicated mush that doesn't have a concept of individuals doesn't have a concept of ego or individual consciousnesses
*  it's all one thing and we're just adding more to it and you know with Neuralink it's not you know people kind of think that
*  there's going to be some kind of leap into the totally transformative you know a thing that totally changes the very nature of our civilization
*  I think it'll just all be gradual just like from iPhone 1 and 2 and 3 all this technology will slowly expand our capabilities
*  it won't just like the human eye developed the revolution the eye developed the revolution it was gradual it wasn't like it just appeared
*  it just something that slowly allowed you to sense the environment better and better and better and better and eventually something as nice and crisp
*  and sexy as the human eye emerged and you know the other concern people have is with like surgery and so on
*  that's also really you know it's a difficult thing like I got LASIK surgery for example you mentioned eyes
*  that was a scary thing to get
*  yeah I imagine when did you get it?
*  five years ago maybe
*  how'd it go?
*  like a lot of people talk about it is you know when I woke up next morning I could see
*  I could see for the first time
*  it was beautiful and it was like I was kind of angry that I didn't do it earlier
*  that's what a lot of people describe as their experience
*  now what happened a week later is I forgot what it's like to not be there
*  I took it for granted basically a day later but like a week later it was like I wasn't
*  I already forgot the entire magic of the experience and that's what I think will just keep happening
*  is there's this gradual little step this little leap into a future that everyone will go and say wow it's kind of cool
*  and then they'll forget it was cool and then they'll go back on Twitter to complain about some divisiveness that's happening in politics today
*  they'll just constantly
*  will all of a sudden have capability to have some extra level of telepathic communication for example in 40 years
*  and then people will just be like just like we got used to swipe writing on the phone
*  at first people will be like I don't know I'm not sure I want the government to know what I'm thinking
*  next they'll just like try it out and be like oh it's kind of cool much easier to type on Twitter
*  and then next they'll just be like that's it we're all just communicating telepathically
*  and all that will happen
*  well there will still be so many pros to it
*  to not ever being able to lie
*  I mean if we're forced out
*  I mean one of the biggest problems with people
*  being deceptive
*  like we have this ability to communicate
*  we use sounds that relay intent
*  and then you listen
*  you go into your own dictionary
*  and your own concept of what these words mean
*  and then you convey what you think I'm saying
*  you interpret what you think I'm saying
*  but I can be a bullshit artist
*  like a lot of people are
*  like when you talk to someone who's a psychic
*  and they say you have a relationship with
*  there's a woman
*  there's a woman
*  keep talking
*  you're not close
*  but you're not close
*  you're not close
*  you're not close
*  but you should be
*  yes yes we should be
*  who's this person in your life
*  it's my mother
*  yeah
*  you know what I'm saying
*  if you could really look into their head
*  and go hey fuckface
*  you don't see anything
*  you're lying to me
*  you're pulling on my heartstrings
*  you know I'm lonely
*  you're trying to manipulate me so you can make money
*  or you're talking to my dead mom
*  she wants you to donate your money to charity
*  like this person's not really talking to your mom
*  they're liars
*  and there's a lot of those people out there
*  all that would go away
*  all the bank fraud
*  and manipulation
*  politics all that will go away
*  a politician won't be able to lie because you'll be able to look
*  right into their fucking head
*  you'll be able to be like oh they don't care at all
*  about America
*  or hey he's a really good person
*  that really does think that we can get along
*  we can work together we have enough resources
*  we should behave as a community
*  as a giant
*  300 million people community
*  and that's possible it can be done
*  and like look at this that guy's a murderer
*  we didn't even know this guy's walking around he murdered three people
*  you'll be able to see
*  you'll be able to see into people's minds
*  you'll be able to know
*  all this stuff is incredibly tempting
*  when you think of something like Neuralink
*  or you know once there's something like that
*  there'll be multiple different versions of it
*  after a while
*  when those innovations start to roll out
*  what will give up
*  it'll be just like all the other
*  aspects of technology
*  we will give some things up and there'll be a bunch of people that do
*  reminisce for the retro days
*  like oh the good old days when you wanted to
*  send a letter you had to write it down on paper
*  and a dude and a horse like a fucking
*  like who's that dude
*  Kevin Costner movie the postman remember that
*  a terrible fucking movie
*  but post apocalyptic
*  postman was like the most important guy
*  because he can get your letters
*  but that kind of shit
*  like we
*  give up something
*  to get this new thing
*  and then we decide this new thing like
*  very few people are giving up their cell phones
*  and going to flip phones very few people are
*  going no phone at all very few
*  right there's what's the matter
*  Jamie
*  just read the poster real quick I put it up on the screen
*  the year
*  2013
*  one man walked off the horizon
*  and hope came with him
*  I love Kevin Costner
*  you know what the greatest movie of all time is
*  water world
*  no it's not it's a terrible
*  movie but you know what's good the water
*  world show at universal
*  in Hollywood but I don't think they can do
*  it anymore I think California is so
*  god damn draconian in their restrictions I think they've
*  got it locked down but that's it that
*  water world movie is
*  that is citizen
*  Kane compared to the postman
*  postman is a steaming
*  pile of shit it's
*  so bad it is a really
*  bad movie
*  but somehow actually
*  Kevin Costner can make
*  really bad movies and make them somehow
*  watchable he makes really great movies
*  too dances with bulls fucking incredible
*  and that's all him you know he's
*  made some awesome stuff no doubt about it
*  I like I mean
*  you might the pros and cons I
*  really like the replay of memory I don't know if that
*  connects with you but
*  I remember that the idea of that
*  like I remember
*  it sounds weird but
*  so this what I got a chance to talk
*  to Elon afterwards and
*  he had this funny comment
*  I mean he thinks in weird
*  ways right but
*  his comment was that
*  if we one day will be able to
*  replay memories I
*  wonder if this is a memory that you
*  and I would choose and it
*  made me think like I certainly
*  would because you know
*  there's there's there's momentous
*  like I'll probably replay this very
*  podcast in my in my mind
*  this experience I remember
*  that you know you do
*  this a lot but for me it was a special experience
*  I was
*  sitting with you and Eric Weinstein
*  at the back of the comedy store
*  I remember during that moment
*  I was feeling somewhat awkward and scared and nervous
*  I remember thinking like
*  like I didn't have I didn't want to
*  take pictures but I wanted to like store
*  this because it felt
*  like a historic moment just that
*  line up it was like the
*  who's who of comedy
*  doing just short little bits of comedy
*  that entire night
*  it just felt like
*  it felt like history like
*  I was I stepped into the Coliseum
*  like and got to hang out with the gladiators
*  and it I mean
*  not to be sort of
*  it felt like that had to end at some point
*  I get Russian I start to like
*  think about how is this going to end
*  but it felt like this is going to have
*  to end eventually
*  well you were right
*  it ended
*  with a virus
*  and it's an end of an era but that was a special
*  moment and I would want to replay that
*  it's hard
*  I have similar feelings about how
*  special it was but it was hard
*  for me in the moment to think about
*  it because
*  although I did appreciate it as much as I could
*  in the moment you can't dwell on it too much
*  because you're in the middle
*  of the creative process like stand
*  up comedy is an ever
*  changing constantly evolving
*  process when I have an act
*  I get it to a point where I
*  can imagine
*  recording it and then I record
*  it and then I start over but
*  during the whole time of making it
*  I'm always tweaking it
*  it's never done it's just
*  it's constantly being fucked with I'm
*  constantly putting this first
*  and that second and switching the order
*  and doing this part of the bit
*  in the beginning and then switching it to the
*  end and then adding something and maybe
*  maybe being more sneaky with how
*  I reveal the punch line or how
*  I do this and that and so there's
*  this process that's constantly
*  going on you can't go
*  I mean I know and I knew during
*  the time like this really is the golden age
*  of comedy it's a very
*  special time in this very special place
*  I knew that but
*  I also
*  knew that I couldn't think of that
*  I just had to keep moving
*  that's the comedy side but what about the
*  the back of the comedy store
*  is the camaraderie of it
*  like how
*  when is the next time say
*  we reopen the economy when is the next time
*  there's going to be all of those comedians
*  showing up regularly to one place
*  a lot of us have moved unfortunately
*  Joey Diaz moved to New Jersey
*  for now what is that about
*  thank you thank you
*  he's slowly
*  becoming the soprano show
*  once the winter kicks in
*  and he understands that he fucked
*  up I'm gonna call him
*  I'm gonna present Texas as
*  a viable opportunity hopefully by then
*  I'll have a club here
*  the number one goal
*  see the goal was to get here set up shop
*  put together this studio
*  okay we got that going we're up and running
*  now goal number two
*  is a comedy club goal number three
*  is a ranch goal number three is
*  we have a podcast ranch and we
*  do all kinds of wacky shit there you gotta come back
*  to the ranch we're gonna
*  we're gonna have
*  is Duncan Trost gonna live on the ranch
*  oh fuck yeah I guarantee Duncan
*  will come by the way greatest
*  I mean
*  as just a fan Duncan is
*  I heard you try to talk him into moving
*  to Austin
*  yeah he wants to move to North Carolina though
*  that's where he's from you know he's
*  from Asheville and I think
*  he has designs on that
*  but if I could talk him into moving here
*  one thing I'd tell we were both talking
*  about doing a television show or doing
*  a podcast rather doing
*  a show together I don't know why I said television show
*  but he and I doing
*  a show together like a regular show
*  like maybe once a week just
*  me and him sitting down and shooting the shit
*  talking about life once a week
*  I think we have a weird connection he
*  and I we've known each other for so long
*  he used to be my roommate he lived in my house for a
*  little bit and you know
*  I've known him since he was the guy who answered
*  the phones the comedy store
*  I've known him forever since the beginning
*  of his comedy career and
*  you know we've always been real close
*  and we're weird together
*  we bring out something weird in each other
*  yeah I mean the positivity
*  that he brings he just has this
*  weirdly positive view of
*  the world and yet like
*  the open like just like
*  the crazy theories he has
*  about the way the world is
*  I mean he's a special
*  human being I thought that guy exists
*  and Joey Diaz is the other side of that
*  yeah he's chaos
*  Joey Diaz is chaos
*  if there was you know like
*  an element called chaos
*  and it had like a physical manifestation
*  where you could like see like an
*  like an avatar of chaos
*  it's Joey Diaz he would always
*  bring the party I always said whenever we'd go
*  on the road Joey Diaz brings the party
*  he was always the guy that was
*  just like like if we were out at dinner
*  Joey was always stealing the show he was
*  always the funniest guy in the room
*  he's always the madman and
*  he also Joey Diaz
*  works best when people love him
*  like when he's around people who love him
*  when he knows he can just be himself
*  and so you know all of his crazy
*  stories and preposterous
*  exaggerations over the top
*  exaggerations about things all done
*  for comedy that's him
*  I think you know when you watch great
*  chess champions play against each other
*  or like great like
*  Muhammad Ali versus Frazier
*  was the moment when I saw Joey
*  go against Alex Jones
*  I thought cause
*  cause he's like crazy I thought like
*  I thought like Alex Jones is
*  the what is it the Frazier
*  like there's you know there's no way
*  you can take that guy down with
*  the art of conversation but Joey just
*  took him apart
*  well it was back when Alex was on the radio
*  too so Joey was talking about storing weed
*  under his balls and sneaking it in on a flight
*  to Texas and Alex
*  funny enough was censoring himself
*  I know he was like
*  well this isn't real hang on
*  he's just joking around ladies and gentlemen
*  yeah
*  you know and there's a lot of those characters
*  out of the comedy store it's a special
*  place you miss it oh yeah
*  yeah I do but it doesn't exist right now
*  and I'm a realist you know
*  and also
*  the place that existed
*  in Los Angeles is
*  not the same Los Angeles that place
*  is fucked right now it's
*  fucked and the mayor's fucked and the
*  governor's fucked and they've done a terrible
*  job of managing the pandemic
*  and the place is in ruins
*  it's a mess
*  LA is a mess
*  how does it get unfucked
*  it's gonna take years
*  so here's my worry so you have a different
*  you know LA you know the comedy store
*  my worry I got
*  not to brag
*  it's very weird but I got
*  recognized on the way to hear four times
*  it was weird
*  congratulations it's very weird listen I'm
*  you're a celebrity fuck you but I've never
*  been recognized like that
*  been on this podcast how many times now
*  five times
*  so do you know how many millions
*  of people have seen you yeah and
*  I have the podcast I mean the
*  podcast I do is a little more technical so
*  like the kind of people that they don't
*  it's I can
*  see the difference between the people who recognize
*  me from Rogan
*  and the people who recognize me from the podcast I do
*  it's a
*  different like they're usually just like you
*  say shaved head tattoos versus
*  or like Jiu Jitsu like cauliflower ears
*  bro and actually women
*  too but then
*  for guys if you could tell like
*  okay this guy's a CEO
*  of some company or like it's a programmer
*  that's more do you wear that
*  suit and tie everywhere
*  when you travel suit yeah oh
*  travel usually because I hate traveling
*  I'll go jeans and shirt because
*  that's my pajamas
*  yeah that's how you sneak by
*  because with the this suit is your uniform
*  they recognize me through the with the mask
*  too that's weird that was weird
*  what makes you think like
*  I recognize you from the eyes and the haircut
*  anyway but the
*  reason I bring that up
*  I apologize
*  they mention
*  two of the people actually
*  mentioned that they're leaving San Francisco
*  because they're tech people and
*  they're said one of them moved to Austin
*  and they said that
*  the people are fleeing San Francisco too
*  fleeing fleeing
*  that's the term fleeing yeah and that's the right term
*  because San Francisco is insane
*  you know San Francisco is an app where you can find
*  the human shit in the city because it's so
*  numerous
*  it's so prevalent you know so many bums
*  are shitting in the streets that they
*  have apps I like how you went to that
*  I was referring to some another aspect
*  of it which is it's not even San Francisco
*  it's the entirety of Silicon Valley which
*  is there's a very much a group think
*  yes that moved away from
*  a meritocracy of where
*  we want to innovate and change
*  the world with our ideas to a little
*  bit more like
*  you know I don't know how to put it but
*  a kind of a group
*  think that pushes against
*  that and so people are trying to
*  push against that how so
*  well it
*  I mean that's what
*  Jordan Peterson talks about it's the
*  identity politics
*  tends to
*  try to silence
*  the desire within people
*  to judge
*  based on meritocracy based on
*  skill based on hard work
*  based on passion and so on it changes
*  the topic of the conversation in a way
*  that moves like if you're
*  a kid guy or girl
*  who dreams of changing the world you start
*  a startup like the last thing you want to be
*  talking about is
*  the last thing you want to be doing is playing identity politics
*  what you want is hire the best
*  people for the job men or women
*  and you want to change the world
*  you don't want to be playing
*  discussions that are like
*  that are going on
*  in gender studies parts of
*  academia and so
*  there's a kind of
*  group think that I think holds
*  you back within places
*  like Silicon Valley within certain parts of
*  academia I think these are important
*  conversations to be had but they need to be
*  had by nuance
*  without being a bully
*  so most of the people that play identity politics
*  twitter
*  they talk about you know all
*  really good things
*  they carry the flag of justice of fairness
*  of equality
*  of respect and love
*  that's like the flag but what
*  they do is they bully
*  there's a toxic nature to it and they attack
*  I get attacked actually
*  for
*  not having equal
*  distribution of women on the podcast
*  where I interview that's something I
*  work very much on who attacks you
*  for this
*  a small percentage of people
*  on twitter but they
*  and I ignore I never respond
*  and I always send telepathically
*  love
*  that's all I can do
*  there's two things one there's
*  probably been pain in their past
*  because they're hurting and two
*  it's probably from their
*  perspective enjoyable
*  that social game to say
*  I want the
*  world to be more fair
*  and saying that and then everybody like
*  congratulates
*  themselves and each other
*  for saying I want the world to be more fair
*  what they don't realize is by
*  saying by calling somebody like
*  me a fraud
*  or a sexist
*  is absurd
*  you're putting hate out there
*  as opposed to love like I'm
*  annoyingly
*  tweeting about love all the time
*  like I even
*  annoy myself sometimes because I'll
*  have a mood where I'm like I've tweeted
*  before like life is beautiful I
*  legitimately I was sitting like three
*  at night and like with a stupid
*  smile on my face and just like
*  this is awesome life is awesome
*  life is awesome
*  and then and you call me a fraud
*  like that's not the right
*  place for the movement they do that
*  because I'm probably an easy target
*  because I'm like
*  look there's a nice guy he looks weak
*  like they think I'm weak
*  and I'm in a space of social justice
*  warriors on Twitter I am weak
*  I wish we lived in a land
*  in a place of like where
*  with equality and fairness I could
*  fight people to the death based on the things
*  of believe it like in gladiators
*  like stand in front of each other as long as it's
*  consensual I would love
*  to fight to the death for the ideas
*  I believe in but on Twitter
*  it's not that's not the battle
*  ground of ideas it's a it's a
*  weird weird place so you're disconnected
*  from actual real
*  human interaction it's not it's
*  it's an unnatural way to communicate
*  it's one of the things we were talking about about Neuralink
*  or something along those lines
*  that we could get to a place
*  where you can actually read someone's
*  thoughts I mean do you know how gross
*  it would look if you could actually see
*  virtue signaling and it's
*  in an actual like
*  clear manifestation like oh I see
*  what you're doing I read your mind
*  you're hoping someone's going to love you by
*  saying mean things you're hoping
*  that women are going to say thank you for
*  being a champion of women Mike
*  you know like for standing up
*  that Lex doesn't have enough of us on his
*  podcast we need equal representation
*  we need equality of outcome
*  you know and this is
*  this is what identity politics
*  is all about it's all about calling people
*  out but really what it's about is
*  finding targets and attacking
*  and very little gets done in a positive
*  way if you look at like what's the
*  positive aspect of identity politics
*  like what's over the course of the last
*  five years what what good has been done
*  well people are terrified
*  you know a lot of people have attacked people on Twitter
*  but how much good has been done
*  well it's it's complicated like I think
*  about the reason
*  okay I always try to find the silver lining
*  and things and the way
*  I think about it first
*  of all I've become more conscious of
*  the fact that there's douchebags in this
*  world in terms of there was
*  a lot of sexism in academia for
*  example just like boys club
*  stuff that
*  it's it's
*  fundamentally disrespectful towards women
*  that's out there there's
*  douchebags and they're often
*  you know how like Joe Biden touches
*  like
*  people's hair yeah yeah there's a creepiness
*  to the way people behaved and I think
*  well they have power
*  power right whenever people have power
*  they behave in a weird
*  way if you're a guy and you're a
*  professor like
*  traditionally
*  professors fuck their students right
*  I mean it's the most
*  one of the most common
*  things was like the professor
*  and the graduate student
*  let's like rephrase
*  that in the 60s and the 70s
*  I don't know if that's traditional but I do I have
*  seen okay but we know it's
*  it's common it was very very
*  very common now
*  it can get you in deep shit yeah
*  now it can get you deplatformed it can get you
*  fired by the university it has a lot of
*  downsides because you're getting in the way of love
*  but it has an upside that you're
*  getting in the way of douchebags so yes
*  cancel culture at
*  you know you have Jordan
*  Peterson getting millions of views
*  highlighting the ridiculousness
*  of cancel culture but at the same time
*  cancel culture also
*  helps highlight the real douchebags
*  out there the real the you know
*  the
*  the ridiculous aspects the overtaught
*  the over extension
*  of the Me Too movement
*  is arguably
*  worth the positives
*  created ultimately
*  ultimately so maybe not in the moment
*  not to the people that were wrongly accused
*  but if you look 20 years from now
*  it would probably lead
*  to progress yeah it's like saying Genghis Khan
*  was good for trade
*  he opened up the path of trade to the east
*  well I mean people and people make
*  the same argument for Hitler
*  yeah he re
*  he rebuilt the German economy
*  and so
*  that argument nobody
*  makes the argument that like hmm
*  no overall Hitler was good for the
*  so I don't think
*  but you know
*  yeah I think I think you're right I think
*  overall it's good it's good that
*  listen I'm not a woman working
*  in an office with a boss
*  that is treating me like shit and wants
*  to fuck me and sexually harassing me
*  and I would imagine that would make your life hell
*  I can't imagine
*  if I was a woman
*  and I had to
*  kiss some guy's ass in order to get a promotion
*  and this guy would make disgusting remarks
*  about me and try to fuck me
*  it would or worse
*  or actually physically do something
*  to you I would imagine it would be terrible
*  so that
*  look I'm fully in support of that I have daughters
*  man I don't want them to ever have to experience
*  that kind of shit again I'm glad that people
*  they have to be accountable
*  for things like that that we do make
*  I think workplaces in general
*  right
*  first of all everybody it sucks no one wants to be
*  stuck in some place all day but also
*  you have this weird culture
*  in these workplaces where you're around
*  all these other people and these people you see
*  sometimes more than you see your own family
*  you're around them eight hours a day and you don't even
*  get to pick them right they're just the people
*  that you automatically work with
*  and if you're a woman and you're in a
*  situation where you have to work with some man
*  who has power over you and
*  is abusive it would be
*  hell
*  the workplace is kind of interesting because
*  I don't know what to do with it because a lot of people
*  find love in the workplace
*  I as a rule
*  like
*  never like I turn that part of my
*  brain off at the workplace because I
*  feel it's such a
*  difficult game to play but I've been
*  hit on by co-workers
*  like in a positive
*  not a power thing but
*  like you're close
*  and then I was always running away
*  from that because like what I imagine
*  in my head is
*  what happens when we break up
*  what happens
*  like if we have a fight
*  which is human relations
*  the drama
*  of that it's hard to get right and
*  I think the
*  I mean from an individual perspective
*  I think you shouldn't
*  you shouldn't play
*  victim you should take
*  the situation as it is
*  and make
*  sort of rise above it
*  whatever it is whatever the challenge
*  whatever the difficulties whatever
*  of the situation you're in you rise above
*  it that from
*  the individual perspective because
*  life is hard
*  succeeding in a
*  career is hard and to
*  be stuck in
*  the local optima
*  of just like
*  of playing victim and the victimhood
*  I think for the individual
*  is not productive but as a society
*  that's a conversation we need to have like
*  what who are the victims in our world
*  and how can we create
*  a world that has fewer
*  victims and one of the things that Jordan Peterson
*  points out that I think is really important
*  to mention is that we haven't been
*  doing this office thing that long
*  and
*  meanwhile I should like
*  clarify I
*  don't know jack shit about working in an office
*  I never worked in an office in my life but I
*  couldn't imagine what it would be like
*  I understand people but that's a weird
*  thing man when men and women are
*  sexually attracted to each other and they see each other every
*  day like that very weird
*  it's very weird and to
*  say that you have to turn that off and
*  it's admirable that you do but some people don't
*  you know some people don't some people have
*  like weird fucking fetishes towards
*  people they work with
*  and okay so I'm a romantic in general
*  aww
*  but I'm also a guy
*  like people who
*  hear me
*  especially your fans
*  who think I'm beta
*  fuck you
*  hold on a second
*  I welcome you
*  message me let's take it out on the
*  mat okay so
*  I won't read the comments but I'm just saying I'm not
*  but you're actually telling
*  them to jiu jitsu with you
*  it's a joke unless you
*  want to okay but if you're gonna read those comments
*  someone's gonna go alright motherfucker where you go
*  where you go
*  Broadway jiu jitsu in Boston
*  don't say that
*  you made a mistake right there
*  but also
*  if you're interested in learning jiu jitsu go to
*  Broadway jiu jitsu in Boston
*  which every gym
*  is struggling but are they open
*  they're doing
*  the dance that everybody is doing
*  which is like they're doing like socially
*  distant training like
*  so in Massachusetts
*  is different but you could do
*  private training
*  which means they have these slots
*  of one hour where people show up
*  and train it's like I think three
*  people or like two people they train
*  and they keep
*  what do you call it every hour they do different
*  different sets of people
*  do they test everybody
*  temperature check so they're doing
*  everything the laws requires so
*  every everybody every state is doing different things
*  but how effective is a temperature check
*  I mean there's people that are asymptomatic do they
*  have a high temperature it's not about
*  what works and doesn't I mean
*  it's about what
*  I mean from my perspective
*  healthy people should do
*  whatever the hell they want like
*  to me I mean that
*  let me rephrase that whoever
*  is comfortable like the level
*  I believe in freedom we're in Texas
*  yes these water bottles are made
*  in Texas are they good crazy
*  the you should be able to choose
*  to choose your actions
*  and then people who are who
*  are either have symptoms or
*  people who are have
*  are in a high risk category
*  they should they should stay home they should be
*  isolating themselves but there should be a little bit more
*  freedom to
*  to define how you interact with this world
*  especially at this time especially where the curve
*  is but you know
*  there's rules in Massachusetts that you're supposed to follow
*  and Jiu Jitsu
*  they don't they don't understand
*  they don't understand
*  obviously combat sports
*  or like you know
*  Jiu Jitsu is a central
*  for like a lot of people
*  like for their psychology
*  there's people going nuts right now
*  yes part of their who they are as a
*  human part of their religion
*  and it was also
*  part of the way of
*  exercising out their demons yes
*  and now you have a lot
*  of people sitting alone at home with their
*  demons yeah and it's
*  also a big part of their social life
*  social life huge part of their social life
*  and also physical
*  touch there's something about Jiu Jitsu
*  like the physical touch of Jiu Jitsu it's very
*  it's very good for people even
*  though you would think of it as like a violent interaction
*  there's actually so
*  much camaraderie that's involved
*  in Jiu Jitsu there's so much
*  community there's so much friendship
*  and love in Jiu Jitsu
*  you know yeah you're practicing killing
*  each other but you're doing
*  so with good friends who are equally skilled
*  iron sharpens iron and
*  it's very important that you do
*  like you want to roll with people
*  that are challenging to you you want them to be
*  good you want them to try really hard it's
*  a part of the whole thing and you feel
*  very blessed like you know what happens
*  after you're done rolling you always thank each other
*  and hug each other I mean that's part of
*  the culture and Jiu Jitsu is a very
*  friendly culture you know it's one
*  of the things that I love about Brazil
*  and the Brazilians is that they're
*  they're so friendly it's like a big part
*  of their culture it's like a big part
*  of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
*  it's like the way the
*  instructor interacts with the students
*  it's very friendly very friendly
*  yeah and now that that's gone
*  what do you do I know for a lot of people
*  they're going nuts you know maybe you should go
*  run I recommend that's why I went to the whole
*  Goggins thing I've been doing just I'm
*  going nuts by myself well explain what you did
*  because it's pretty funny yeah it's ridiculous
*  so first
*  I follow two people on Instagram you and
*  David Goggins which is
*  you for the
*  for the for the lulls for the laughs and
*  Goggins for like just to feel
*  like a weak bitch
*  and at one point
*  in the spring I forget when it was
*  he posted something about
*  a 48 hour challenge
*  so where you run
*  four miles every four hours
*  so I did that I never ran
*  more than 22 miles before then
*  I just did it
*  now my whole methodology for doing
*  these things is I announce it on Twitter
*  so that
*  like in the moment
*  you can't get out of it I can't get out of it
*  so like I saw
*  the post on Instagram
*  I went to Twitter I said it
*  I'm excited you know in my head
*  I'm not thinking I'm not allowing myself to think I said
*  I'm just gonna do it and I'll figure out how to do it
*  and so I figured out how to do it that was the worst
*  idea ever I don't recommend that
*  four miles every four hours so how long
*  does it take you to run four miles?
*  40 minutes
*  let's say so you have a three hour
*  plus 20 minute rest
*  in between each four mile run
*  and you're sleeping for three hours
*  at a time so you could get up and run
*  yeah so it's a
*  mental test of your ability to do
*  something really stupid for prolonged
*  periods of time
*  because it's not like running 48
*  miles in one take that's actually probably easier
*  the
*  the hard thing is
*  run a little bit you know four miles
*  is pretty easy especially at a slow pace
*  and then like
*  shower
*  it depends I showered almost every
*  time which is another
*  thing that's hard to do cause you're like
*  constantly showering and you're like
*  here we go I almost didn't sleep at all
*  you slept like one hour at a time really
*  and then I over ate
*  so I was eating carnivore still
*  mostly eating carnivore at that time so I was eating like
*  I eat a giant
*  rotisserie chicken
*  like your brain starts
*  convincing you that you need like the energy
*  for the fuel so I felt
*  like really bloated and like
*  you're running with a chicken in your stomach
*  and then just like
*  and then all these
*  demons come out I mean at least for me just
*  like
*  you start like I start
*  thinking I need to delete the comment I did on
*  Twitter I need to or like the
*  like this is stupid I'm a scientist
*  like who why are you like your mind
*  starts making up stuff like why are you doing this
*  you know all of those demons
*  and then it starts saying things like
*  you know
*  you have like all the papers
*  you wrote are shit everything you ever done
*  is shit like you need to
*  work hard like if you why are you
*  working so hard at this stupid running thing
*  you should be focused and doing
*  the thing that you like your career
*  you should be like all of those things
*  and my parents come into place like you should
*  find a wife right you should have kids
*  like all the all you talk about love all the time
*  why are you fucking single you fucking
*  you know like that's the that's what
*  it doesn't actually speak in those
*  words but that's you feel it
*  and then you just
*  and then you feel the age thing I mean
*  but like you know you used to be
*  able to wrestle like you've never
*  you've never beat anyone good at wrestling
*  you've never like you're jujitsu
*  blackball you don't deserve that blackball
*  like all those thoughts are coming in
*  and so but anyway that was the
*  48 hour challenge
*  and then on one day I think in June
*  yeah June maybe at the end of May
*  I woke up and I had this
*  idea it was
*  the brain is stupid
*  to say that
*  to tweet and say that I'll do
*  as many push ups and pull ups as this tweet
*  gets likes
*  I don't know why I thought that I thought
*  in my head because I usually
*  you know I
*  talk about love all the time and you know I get
*  like I don't know a hundred likes five hundred
*  I don't know whatever I get but it's not
*  I thought like hmm
*  I need to get harder and need to start exercising
*  every day again and I thought
*  I would get about maybe a thousand
*  so I end up getting
*  20,000
*  yeah so
*  I said in 30 days
*  and
*  that's too much for me that's too
*  hard so I in my
*  mind I thought that so I said okay
*  let me distribute that across other exercise
*  I'll do it every day but I'll distribute
*  across bodyweight squats too so the idea
*  is you know coronavirus
*  I want to do stuff like I have a kettlebell
*  too maybe exercise I can do at home
*  every single day
*  but the tweet said push up some pull ups
*  only
*  so I
*  I've and before then I've interacted
*  with David quite a bit
*  so I sent him
*  yeah
*  so I sent him this thing
*  and just saying like here
*  I figured what I said it was a basic
*  message do you have any advice
*  and he sent me back a video of him
*  oh I asked him a few questions and he sent
*  back a video of him answering the questions
*  calling me out of my bullshit
*  because he said you said
*  in your tweet push up some pull ups
*  motherfucker however he talks like
*  he's like if I were you
*  so he did the worst thing which is like
*  if I were you I would
*  I would do what I promised
*  but I understand how things
*  are so if you like
*  so he went on to give me advice if I
*  bitch out so I end up
*  well what else can you do
*  so I started doing push ups and pulls
*  so it's
*  about
*  500 push ups
*  a day and 170
*  pull ups a day
*  plus 6 miles running
*  and I just
*  started well I get
*  every single day for a month
*  yeah
*  this is
*  the Instagram days man this is when
*  I was like so proud of myself
*  I was proud of myself that I'm actually doing this
*  and I think
*  day 3 is when it all just
*  went to shit that's when it went to shit
*  so I started getting a shoulder
*  so I stopped on
*  day 7 I believe
*  and took 10 days off so
*  my shoulder started just overwhelmed with pain
*  and did you get an MRI?
*  no no I know the
*  shoulder like I've gotten this it's over use
*  it wasn't sorry it wasn't hurt
*  it was like I know this pain well
*  where is it? part of your shoulder?
*  it's like slightly in the back
*  I know the pain
*  well from like I know it's an over
*  use thing like I did
*  when I trained judo twice a day
*  I know like
*  I know the pain I know how to treat it which is
*  like ice
*  but like the reps are insane
*  for people
*  people have done this kind of thing
*  so I gave myself 2 weeks to actually ramp up
*  to it too so like I was already
*  I have a good base on push ups and pull ups
*  but that was way too much for me
*  the whole time
*  David motherfucking Goggins
*  is with me either on the phone
*  or email every single day
*  and he's doubling everything I'm doing
*  so well he's not doing
*  the squats because he's
*  just had knee surgery
*  so he's with surgery doing the push ups and pull ups
*  what did he have done to his knee?
*  he doesn't like to talk about
*  stuff like I couldn't get it
*  he because
*  I think he probably just hurt his knee just for the haters to think he'll quit
*  I know he had his knee drained
*  yeah there was some problem
*  he's one of those
*  ignorer guys
*  he just ignores it
*  what you got?
*  oh this is them pulling
*  what does it say here?
*  a lot of us think that just because there's knobs to go in the middle of the road
*  oh look at this
*  they're pulling all that fluid out of his knee
*  what does it say?
*  this is just talking about set backs
*  ok here's more often than not
*  I've had bad knees, bad hips, etc. for 20 plus years
*  not letting that stop me and I won't now
*  I find we must exhaust all options
*  find a way
*  Jesus Christ
*  so he's draining multiple syringes
*  of fluid out of his
*  look at that nasty shit
*  that's coming out of his fucking knee man
*  how much fluid is in his knee?
*  so the thing is like
*  your knee is a physical structure
*  and I appreciate his mindset
*  but ultimately
*  if you're draining that much fluid out of your knee
*  you've got real internal problems
*  and you could fucking man through that shit
*  but you're still diminishing the physical structure of your knee
*  well that's his whole philosophy
*  which is the point
*  yeah there's a video I think
*  one or two
*  one after this he's like I'm back motherfuckers or something
*  whatever he's doing
*  he's running like you scroll up a little bit
*  scroll up I'll show you what it is
*  right there, that one
*  play that
*  who are you?
*  you're a computer warrior
*  you're a troll
*  you're a hater
*  I read your fucking messages
*  on those videos I put up
*  with me and my crutches
*  me getting my knees drained
*  you were happy I was fucking injured
*  you're also happy because you thought I'd never run again
*  all that see I told you
*  tagging your friends shit
*  bitch you don't fucking know me
*  you see a one minute video about me
*  you know how hard I train
*  how I live
*  the fucking dedication I put into my fucking life
*  so why do you troll?
*  maybe it's the fat motherfucker at home
*  lazy
*  with no discipline or dedication
*  maybe you're jealous
*  who knows
*  but guarantee this
*  I'll be back better than ever
*  haha fuck you
*  stay hard
*  fuck you stay hard
*  he's the best
*  he's the best
*  god damn I love that dude
*  he's a treasure
*  but like in this world where
*  the reason I stopped actually posting about the thing I'm doing
*  is what I realized especially probably the community I'm in
*  so many people were telling me
*  like
*  that's too much
*  they were encouraging me to be healthy
*  they weren't understanding the whole point
*  the philosophy of David Goggins
*  which is the point is to push the limits
*  of what is healthy
*  this isn't to get
*  like doing those kinds of reps
*  is not for some kind of
*  like to get back in shape
*  the moment I agree to answer David Goggins
*  is like email
*  and then phone call and then
*  you're accepting not a nice way
*  for like
*  trying to up my cardiovascular
*  getting it was to go through
*  hell so this is the first time
*  David
*  Dan Gable
*  famous wrestler famous wrestling coach
*  talked about that he always tried to
*  train so hard that he wouldn't be able to get off the mat
*  that he would have to be carried off the mat
*  and he said he never succeeded at that
*  but he always really tried to push so hard
*  that he literally couldn't get off the mat
*  and then the results of that
*  we're talking about the physical structure
*  he has replaced hips, replaced knees
*  his body fell apart
*  the internet is very nice and helpful
*  the internet is very nice and helpful
*  to tell you exactly that
*  which is your body will fall apart
*  it's not the right way to do it
*  when I got injured people were like
*  just like you said ah ha
*  obviously you shouldn't be doing this
*  but that's not the point
*  that's not the point of this
*  like this is the first time
*  I'm not a crier
*  I cried
*  three times
*  faced down on my carpet in this whole challenge
*  so I was doing all this at home
*  just
*  there's all different kinds of demons
*  that came out and just
*  so for people who know pushups
*  and pull ups
*  and done this kind of exercise
*  what happens is it's kind of
*  your muscle get used to it
*  it's not physically that
*  challenging, they're in the state of
*  just complete exhaustion
*  and what it is, it's almost
*  boring, so it's a task
*  of your mind pushing through a thing
*  that's really boring
*  your muscles are exceptionally sore
*  they're exhausted
*  and again all those demons of like why are you doing this
*  it's like nobody will care if you just quit
*  all that kind of stuff
*  and dealing with all of that
*  that's why, because it's about
*  depending on the day
*  but it's at least two hours
*  of pushups and pull ups
*  spread throughout the day
*  and it's just a grind
*  on me about it, always doubling stuff
*  so after
*  10 days I returned
*  and at that point
*  I did it without
*  announcing it, I did it for
*  4 or 5 days to make sure I could do it
*  and at that point I knew I'm going to have to finish
*  even with injury, so I knew
*  after 10 days, the shoulder was back to normal
*  I figured out
*  a whole, like I figured out
*  the eating that I'm doing
*  I figured out the whole recovery
*  What did you change in eating?
*  It sounds
*  weird but I
*  I switched to one meal a day
*  which is
*  before I sleep, which felt good
*  it's mostly keto
*  in terms of supplement, they're your sponsor
*  actually, that's how I found them
*  Athletic Greens
*  I don't know why, it makes me feel good
*  Great stuff
*  Because the worry you have with keto
*  I'm not
*  I'm not into nutrition science
*  I don't follow it, I just listen to my body
*  The worry you have is you don't get the nutrients
*  Like you don't get
*  the phytonutrients
*  plant based nutrients, and also importantly
*  electrolytes, because I'm running
*  there's a
*  you know, there's a, because you get
*  the headaches thing
*  You ever take liquid IV?
*  You ever try that stuff? No
*  I swear by that shit, I drink that every day
*  Is that the actual name?
*  Yeah, electrolytes supplement
*  It's a sponsor too, but even if it wasn't
*  If they stop being a sponsor I'll still tell people to take it
*  What is it supposed to
*  So they have like salt, sodium, magnesium
*  Sodium, glucose
*  Optimum ratio of sodium to glucose
*  Like very
*  scientifically researched, it's fantastic shit
*  Man, changed the way
*  I would always get cramps
*  And once I started using it I stopped getting cramps
*  You think hard kickboxing workouts
*  Hard martial arts workouts, you know
*  I'm still running that kind of shit
*  You beat your body up man, if you're not getting enough electrolytes
*  You're certainly draining them out of your system
*  And
*  Taking them in the form of liquid IV
*  Just made a big difference
*  Are you still
*  Sorry, are you still sticking to keto?
*  No, I don't eat keto
*  But I'm mostly carnivore
*  You know, I mean I eat some salads
*  And
*  I eat some fruit
*  But the vast majority of what I eat is meat
*  The vast majority
*  Maybe 80 plus percent
*  Of everything I eat is meat
*  I don't know about you, but
*  That's one of the things
*  I just stopped wanting to post about it
*  Because one, the exercise is insane
*  And two, my eating
*  I like positive vibes
*  People get angry
*  And not only just angry
*  They keep telling me
*  It's unhealthy
*  I've experimented, I've wrestled my whole life
*  I understand what peak performance is
*  On different diets
*  Like I know my body
*  I've explored and like learned
*  About what feels good for me
*  I'm not saying it's good for others
*  I've experimented with eating like seven times a day
*  When I was more doing like powerlifting
*  Stuff
*  I've experimented, like for me
*  Eating once a day
*  Or eating twice a day in a small window
*  Like intermittent fasting
*  Very low carb
*  I do two things in my life
*  Which is Goggins type challenges
*  Which is doing like physical
*  Challenges
*  And then long periods of deep thinking
*  Deep work, so intellectual work
*  For me
*  Keto and once a day
*  Focuses the mind like nothing else
*  It allows me to sit
*  For eight hours at a time
*  So I usually do two four hour periods of deep work
*  You shut off every distraction
*  And completely
*  You focus yourself on a single task
*  Nothing like keto for me
*  The interesting thing
*  I know that about myself
*  What I didn't, wasn't really sure
*  Is with the push up and pull up thing
*  What is the right
*  Like
*  Supplementation for that
*  And I wasn't sure, but I stuck to it
*  I stuck to basically entirely
*  Carnivore
*  I would say under 20 grams of carbs
*  Maybe even under 10 grams of carbs on
*  Some days
*  Mostly just a lot of meat
*  I wasn't a calorie deficit
*  I actually got a little fatter
*  Really?
*  That's crazy
*  I was starving
*  Please don't clip this out
*  I was starving for meat
*  I would remember waking up
*  Wanting like a bloody steak
*  In the middle of the night
*  But your tissue must be so
*  Everything must need
*  So much nutrients, so badly
*  So much protein, you're breaking everything down
*  That's such an extreme requirement
*  Of your body to do something like that
*  It's not like crazy
*  David Gaugans took it to the extreme
*  Of course
*  Doubling everything you do
*  A thousand push ups is different
*  Than 500 push ups
*  500 is doable
*  A thousand is insane
*  And also I didn't
*  There's certain things on form
*  I didn't go all the way down on the pull ups
*  I did a form
*  Of pull up with my
*  With my hands closer together
*  Just
*  To save your shoulder?
*  To save the shoulder
*  That's the other thing
*  When I post the videos of myself doing push ups and pull ups
*  That's why I stopped
*  People would tell me
*  Stop reading
*  The comments
*  How many times during this podcast
*  Have you talked about people
*  Saying things to you in the comments
*  And it's upsetting you
*  It's been like 10
*  Help me out with something then
*  The reality is
*  That a lot of other really intelligent people
*  Read the comments
*  You mean like Eric?
*  Eric Weinstein?
*  I told him to stop reading them too
*  That mother fucker complains constantly about comments
*  Yes, that's a good
*  But I'm
*  I think the difference between you and I is
*  One important thing is I do hope
*  To be one of the technologists
*  That either creates a competitive Twitter
*  Or helps Twitter become a better
*  Version of itself
*  So I want to create the systems that
*  That create
*  That community and the comments that's positive
*  So for me it's important to understand that
*  The demons in there
*  You're going to have to fundamentally change the way
*  Human beings interact with each other with no repercussions
*  When people have no repercussions
*  When they interact anonymously
*  There's just a fundamental aspect
*  Of cruelty that emerges
*  There's no getting around it
*  I disagree I think
*  I don't disagree
*  I think the fundamental thing that happens
*  Is some small percentage
*  Of humans start becoming
*  Toxic
*  And that drives away what I believe is
*  The majority of the population core
*  Therefore friendly
*  Like the kind of conversations you have of parties in person
*  No listen I agree with you
*  100%
*  Most of the interactions that I have on
*  Online even when I stop reading comments
*  Were positive
*  The vast majority
*  When you cultivate like one of the things that I've tried to do with this podcast
*  Is talk to people the way
*  I talk to people in real life
*  You know warts and all
*  The vast majority
*  Of my interactions in real life are positive
*  The vast majority
*  The vast majority are happy
*  Occasionally someone's a fucking dick
*  You know and that's just what you run into
*  Dickheads sometimes it sucks and it's
*  Annoying but it's a part of life
*  My
*  Internet feed based on this
*  Podcast based on how people
*  Get to know me reflected that it's
*  Mostly positive it's mostly
*  People recognizing what my
*  Intentions are my intentions
*  Are to try to get out of the way as much as
*  Possible put together the best podcast
*  I can do my best try
*  To be curious try to feed my curiosity
*  Just do my best
*  Kind loving that's that really
*  Okay and help people and promote people
*  Those that's that's another
*  Really big part for me is
*  Promote people like let
*  Let them help them succeed because
*  I feel good about that makes me feel good
*  Yeah like who the hell am I like for some
*  Reason you saw you see stuff in people
*  And then you share like
*  Selflessly you promote them like
*  You do that with comedians you do that with a lot of even
*  Eric Weinstein of one of the you know incredibly
*  Brilliant Jordan Peterson could be
*  Argued that he was really propelled
*  Forward by a conversation on your podcast
*  I mean I'm happy to do that
*  It makes me feel good it's one of the most
*  Important parts of this podcast
*  I think that that I can introduce and
*  In doing so it also enriches
*  Other people because they get to
*  Hear these interesting conversations and
*  And it stimulates their mind and it changes
*  The way they think about certain things so
*  The vast majority of interactions that I had
*  Online even before I stopped reading comments
*  Were positive the problem is you'd
*  Start dwelling on the ones that aren't like you're doing
*  In this podcast you are you're literally
*  Telling me everything that's wrong with
*  Reading comments by by
*  Telling me you reading comments and then complaining
*  About the things that people say about your form
*  Or the things say about you not having enough women on your
*  Podcast or the people say you're a beta
*  You're you're going over and over and
*  Over again for no reason
*  That's interesting but all of those things are completely
*  Unnecessary and you're going to fight me on it right now because I see
*  You're gearing up. Yeah I'm gearing up. You're gearing up
*  For some sort of a response. Yeah
*  It's yeah I'm I've been gearing
*  Up okay okay okay okay
*  First of all let me put it because it's more
*  Fun to talk about the the negative stuff
*  Most of my life the reason
*  I read comments is I've met
*  Incredible people I'm in a I'm in
*  Currently with a very small
*  Level of celebrity I'm fortunate
*  Enough to have people that are just full of
*  Love two things love
*  And intelligence like that
*  That they make me think they inspire
*  Me there's incredible people and that's
*  Why I read the comments still for now at least
*  I do I did hire
*  Somebody to help me like
*  Fight the trolls but
*  Like to because you can remove comments and so on
*  I don't
*  Think that's a long form
*  Long-term solution
*  I think the long-term solution is technology
*  Here's the fundamental problem
*  I think that 99 percent
*  Of Joe Rogan fans you can
*  Say any kind of percentage
*  Are people I would want to hang out
*  With at a party and talk
*  With I think so too and I think
*  The comment section should reflect that
*  I think it's a technology problem
*  I think what happens is the one percent that
*  Don't really want to hang out with
*  Dominate the
*  Conversation in the comment section and don't
*  I don't think they're more inclined to
*  Comment it's
*  A bunch of things they
*  They're better at commenting
*  The kind of derisive funny
*  Thing like there's a mix of humor
*  And derision which
*  Somehow attracts a certain
*  Part in us as like
*  People who click like
*  Like somebody
*  You know this is a new studio or
*  I was saying how this studio is kind of like the
*  Cybertruck release there's
*  Something in people where they
*  Want to like
*  The funny derisive comment
*  About the way the new studio looks
*  For example when you look at comments about
*  Your new studio there's a
*  Humongous amount of really positive
*  Comments but like the
*  Ones like the negative ones and they're not even
*  Negative they're more like just like shitty
*  In a funny way
*  They rise to the top that's a technology
*  Problem because like that
*  Shitty comment drives away
*  People like me from commenting
*  I want to comment I still
*  I still comment
*  I'm telling you you're wasting so much time thinking
*  About this. No I disagree
*  I think there's a place
*  For community on the internet
*  Yeah there is and
*  If commenting is I mean what
*  Call it something else call it social media interactions
*  Like most people
*  At some level of celebrities stop checking
*  Their twitter like
*  Mentions twitter comments and so on
*  Because of the toxicity
*  The top comments on Donald
*  Trump or the top comments on
*  Bill Gates the top comments
*  On Obama accounts if you look at them
*  Pedophilia is usually involved
*  And it's like
*  How is if I'm Barack Obama
*  Why would I want to interact
*  In the comments with a community
*  That were like
*  Well you can turn your comments off
*  Yeah but that what I'm telling you is okay
*  You're telling me that's death though right
*  You're accepting yeah you're censoring people
*  Now that's they get insane
*  Well they just become accustomed
*  To being able to speak as well
*  So that's part of the thing like in Instagram
*  It's not just that you post something
*  It's that other people get to post things as well
*  Yeah and it's a
*  Like I try to fight
*  Like I comment you're the only person
*  On Instagram who I comment on
*  Oh boy
*  Okay they're fun
*  There's a fun community
*  There and I ignore
*  Like I actually train my brain to ignore any
*  Of the haters like I just
*  There's fun really loving
*  Intelligent people that should be the community
*  Yes I agree
*  But you don't agree because
*  No that should be the community
*  But it isn't currently and I think that could be
*  But it is
*  The vast majority it's just
*  The kind of people that comment in the first
*  Place okay let's just do
*  A thought experiment if you have
*  If you have a million people
*  On your Twitter
*  And they're all fans
*  Of your podcast you have a
*  Million podcast fans how many of them are going to comment
*  How many
*  How often do you you only you said you only comment
*  On my page how many people
*  Comment on people's
*  Pages how many people that have enriched
*  Important enriching
*  Important difficult lives
*  Where they're filled with challenges take the time
*  To comment shitty things on
*  Internet not a large number very
*  Very few most of the
*  People are they have unrealized
*  Potential and they're
*  They're not doing well okay let me can I can I propose
*  A different thought experiment sure how
*  Many people out of those million that listen
*  To the podcast mine are yours
*  That have an intelligent
*  Interesting thought that occurs when they listen
*  And they would share it with me if
*  It was one on one they
*  If I was quite a few yeah that's
*  My problem like I think right
*  Like I would like them
*  To feel safe to say something
*  Yeah then they should be it's just
*  They're gonna have to deal with trolls but
*  No but you're accepting the way things are now
*  And I'm saying I think there's a technological
*  Solution that I'm constantly
*  I mean that's what Neuralink is
*  Neuralink is the tech well the
*  Future versions of it that actually allow you to read
*  Minds I mean that's the technological solution
*  To realize that this person's flawed
*  Because you know they're
*  They were abused by their uncle or you know they got
*  Bullied throughout childhood
*  Or they have a disease or they
*  They're impaired mentally there's something wrong
*  With them I mean that's that's what you're
*  Dealing with when you're dealing with a lot of these people
*  That are online that are angry their lives
*  Are not good you know
*  You're not getting people
*  That live amazing lives that spend
*  The vast majority of the day shitting on people
*  On the internet but I go to some
*  People's twitter pages and I
*  See them all day long
*  Saying mean shit all day long
*  Arguing about things all day long
*  Complaining about things and it's
*  The vast majority of their social
*  Interaction it has to be just
*  Based on volume
*  It's super unhealthy but I feel
*  It might be optimistic but I
*  Think those people if
*  You put a mirror to them meaning
*  You make them realize
*  That they're being
*  Toxic that
*  They could be incentivized they could be
*  Encouraged to find the
*  Better angels of their nature they could be
*  But a lot of times that toxicity is coming
*  Out of a lot of other flaws
*  In their life and their personality
*  Like you're talking about
*  You're thinking in terms of your own
*  Self you're a guy who did this fucking
*  Ridiculous 30 day challenge
*  You're a guy who's running four miles
*  Every four hours like that's not a
*  Normal human being you're a guy who's constantly
*  Trying to improve you're a guy who's sitting
*  Down every day turning off all your distractions
*  And doing deep intellectual
*  Work that is not most people
*  Now if you could acquire
*  A group of people that are
*  Your fans that have
*  Similar goals and similar discipline
*  That would be amazing
*  But they would be your friends you know
*  That's what ultimately we would
*  Like we would like all our interactions with
*  People online to be people that we love and care about
*  People that share like-minded
*  Goals people that you can
*  You actually can learn from them
*  You can listen to their words
*  And see their deeds and see
*  How they react to certain things and see how they
*  Grow and change and you actually
*  Benefit from this interaction
*  There's a lot of people that are online that are not
*  They're not capable of that
*  For whatever reason whether it's programming
*  Meaning like what's happened to them
*  In their life that's led them to this point
*  Whatever failures or
*  Insurmountable
*  Obstacles that have shown up in their
*  Life that have caused them to fall
*  Into this rut that's
*  That's what you get you just get
*  The numbers of humans
*  You're interacting with online there's so many
*  People and then also you get
*  No social cues
*  You don't feel bad when you say mean
*  Things to people you can say
*  Hey man you sucked on that show
*  And you're like oh I thought it was a good episode
*  Fuck did I suck on your show
*  You know and that
*  Hurts people it bothers people
*  But that's what they're trying to do they're trying to bother you
*  They're trying to lash out at you and the type
*  Of people that try to do that are overwhelmingly
*  Losers
*  But
*  This is I have a dream
*  There's 10 million
*  Plus people
*  That like the Joe Rogan
*  Experience and are really
*  Cool people I meet them all
*  The time sure and I
*  Would love to go to the comment section
*  And be inspired by the
*  Positive thoughtful energies or even disagreement
*  That are come
*  From a place of respect and love like
*  I go to books
*  For that for example I read books they're
*  Full of thoughtful disagreement
*  Or just like respectful deep
*  Thinking and I
*  Go to comments too because they
*  Currently for me have 99
*  Percent of them are that okay but
*  Let me stop you there this is really important
*  That's not what you're talking about
*  What you're talking about is the negative ones
*  All you've talked about is the negative ones you haven't
*  Said anything about the positive ones you haven't said
*  Anything about going to the comment section reading
*  Inspiring things you haven't said anything
*  About going to the comment section reading helpful
*  Thoughts and strategies
*  And different things that people have
*  Said in the comments that have really inspired you
*  You haven't said anything about that but you said at least
*  Three or four different things about
*  Negative comments that people said
*  To the point where you're challenging people to fight
*  You're giving out the address of your
*  Jiu-Jitsu school
*  Don't listen you're doing what you're doing
*  Whether it's for fun or not you're doing
*  What you're doing you're dwelling on the negative
*  So much that you're literally telling
*  People where you train
*  Understand that? Yeah I understand I mean
*  Part of that so you're
*  You're doing a good job
*  From a psychoanalyst perspective
*  But part of that is for fun
*  I understand it's for fun They definitely
*  Have a disproportionate effect
*  Especially for a person who's not like
*  I'm genetically full of self doubt
*  I think of myself often as a
*  Fraud like there's a kind of No that's not
*  Full of self doubt you know what that is you just have high
*  Expectations of your own performance
*  I do too listen I'm not a fan of anything
*  I do I'm the biggest
*  Critic of everything I do ever
*  That's just how it goes I'm never satisfied
*  But that's also why I continue
*  To do things And the
*  Toxic negative comments connect to that little
*  Part of you or part of me
*  And I'm just
*  I'm bringing up the fact that I feel
*  Like the
*  It's the
*  The only solution cannot be not to read
*  Comments it's
*  For now that is the wise advice you're giving
*  Wise advice but you have to deal with the landscape
*  This is the landscape as it's presented to you
*  You can't imagine a better
*  World where there's no real solution
*  Because there's no technological solution
*  To avoid the trolls
*  But here's the thing so
*  I'm trying to build it
*  How are you going to build it?
*  Well I mean
*  Without giving away any intellectual secrets
*  Well I
*  I think systems that
*  Know more about you
*  As a human
*  In order to be able to incentivize
*  Better
*  How to be a better human are needed
*  So currently the AI systems the
*  Recommender systems that feed
*  Most of the social networks YouTube Netflix
*  And so on they know very little
*  About you they have a very primitive
*  Capture
*  Of who you are as a human that ultimately
*  Leads to your purchasing behavior
*  They don't understand
*  About your set of beliefs the source
*  Of toxicity the source of pain
*  And how to
*  Put you on a trajectory that improves you as a human
*  I think that's an AI problem
*  I think that's a recommender system
*  What's called problem
*  And that's where
*  I've been working on
*  Failing at it I've been
*  At a pretty low point actually psychologically
*  But that's a dream for me
*  So the thing that I've talked about
*  Before which is like
*  Building an AI girlfriend
*  Is not a
*  Correct way to phrase it it's more
*  About AI systems being
*  Able to know you well
*  And be an assistant
*  To form a connection
*  With you in order to help
*  You become the best version of yourself
*  That's what friends do that's what
*  Girlfriends partners do that's what
*  I think AI systems can do
*  I think it's possible
*  And I also think that
*  When we get to the next generation
*  Of technologies and this is
*  We're already at three hours here
*  I want to talk to you about
*  You were there for the Neuralink
*  Experiment the most recent
*  Demonstration
*  Where they used it on a pig
*  Tell me
*  What was that like and there's
*  The pig
*  First of all the pigs were very happy
*  Like what
*  They said in that presentation was pretty
*  Pretty accurate they love food
*  And they just they seemed happy
*  And the people the carry takers there
*  Seemed like really good people
*  And where is the where's the
*  Implant on the pig
*  Can you see it physically
*  Yeah it depends on which one we're looking at
*  I think one of them they should
*  Three one I think didn't have it one
*  Had it and now we had it removed and the other
*  One I think it was still actively in it
*  So I don't remember them actually showing like
*  Here it is and what was the demonstration like
*  What how did they demonstrate how
*  It worked
*  Well they
*  So first of all I should say that I have
*  No insider information
*  Like this is
*  Very much they're a company
*  Okay I'm just some random dude that showed
*  Up
*  Well you've interviewed Elon before you know him
*  But I'm not I don't have any insider information
*  And more importantly
*  I'm
*  An AI person so I'm not
*  A neurobiologist like
*  This is this was really exciting to me
*  As a spectator to see biological
*  Systems pigs
*  Right that that are interacting
*  With computational systems
*  But what I'm asking is what was the demonstration
*  The actual demonstration was
*  At the first
*  Level was that they
*  Successfully implanted neuro link
*  In a pig the pig
*  Seemed to be doing great
*  And then they also showed the pig that had
*  It taken out that's one
*  What was going on with the pig that
*  Had neuro link did was there any demonstration
*  Of what was doing for the pig
*  They were doing playback of the
*  124 so there's a hundred
*  Channels like
*  The electrodes that connect to the brain
*  That are firing they're measuring the
*  Signals from neurons and that's
*  Time on the x-axis so from
*  Left to right that's time and then
*  Vertically that's the hundred twenty
*  Four points that are lighting up when
*  A neuron is firing and they were playing
*  That back and they played it back in such a
*  Way where they convert the signal to like musical
*  Notes so you can hear the
*  Signal it's in another way to
*  Visualize it but you know
*  It's it's showing
*  That it's effectively being able to read
*  The signal from a hundred
*  Sorry I'm not sure if I was saying
*  A hundred I meant a thousand
*  Neurons or a thousand
*  Like
*  Collection of neurons from the brain so
*  It's that's
*  Two orders of magnitude that's a lot more than
*  Any other devices ever done so like being
*  Able to you know get signals from the
*  Brain and a high resolution
*  I mean one day
*  The I think the vision is
*  That a thousand just like
*  You mentioned with the tvs a resolution
*  Of a thousand is
*  Very low it would be millions or billions
*  Or trillions like it is for LCD
*  Displays but this
*  Is already a really effective
*  Yeah eventually your brain is going to
*  Be filled with wires yeah and then they're
*  Going to go what do we need this brain for
*  We can just come up with an artificial brain
*  You're not even going to notice we're going to
*  Go to sleep it'll be gradual it'll be all
*  Gradual it'll be
*  Same with I mean it's a chase of technologies
*  This might be obsolete and useless
*  By the time we live all live in a virtual reality
*  World but this is what I was thinking
*  When it comes to aliens when you look
*  At the alien the archetypal alien
*  What do you see you see something with a big
*  Head big eyes
*  No genitals you know
*  You see no muscles
*  You see just like a frame just this
*  Weird structure
*  And I wonder if we're going to get to a point
*  Where we start replacing things
*  And improving things and we realize well
*  There's some problems
*  With our system and one of the problems is
*  Mating one of the problems is
*  Testosterone and estrogen and
*  Emotions and all these different things
*  That you know the desire to
*  Control property and
*  Boundaries and all the different
*  Things the territories all the different things that make
*  People tribal all the different
*  Things that make people angry
*  And maybe that's what's going to get in the way
*  Of innovation maybe we're going to
*  Get to a point where
*  There's going to be some sort of
*  Mind sharing technology that's
*  Why they have big fucking heads right
*  Maybe there's going to be some sort of
*  Interaction technology some
*  Vastly improved
*  Thing that's going to make regular
*  Biological
*  Functions seem so obsolete
*  That we're going to be readily cast
*  On the side or maybe we'll cast
*  On the side slowly and gradually like
*  The evolution of the eyeball
*  Yeah absolutely I mean
*  On the flip side
*  In the Neuralink presentation
*  They talked about alleviating human suffering
*  For example there to me
*  One concern is
*  You know all the things that tribalism
*  All the what is it toxic
*  Masculinity or all the things
*  All the things we see as negative
*  They could be features
*  Like there is a need
*  For suffering there is a need of tension
*  There's a need of violence and war
*  For us to figure
*  Ourselves out
*  That sort of removing all the suffering
*  It may not be
*  As productive as we think
*  Well it certainly creates competition and competition
*  Creates improvement I mean this is
*  That's the thing about
*  If everyone just got along
*  And everything was fine and perfect
*  Would there be as much innovation
*  And if ultimately this human being
*  This creature this when you look at
*  The overall the goal
*  Of this thing as I was saying before
*  It seems that the goal of this thing
*  Is to make better stuff
*  Well the best way to make better stuff is to have
*  Some motivation to do that
*  And that's where materialism
*  Comes in that's where sex comes in
*  That's where greed and envy
*  All these different emotions that we think are very bad
*  But generally speaking if you talked about
*  Those emotions to people they would say
*  They're negative they would put them in a negative
*  Connotation but they might be
*  What's powering people
*  To move into this direction
*  With more speed
*  Yeah and we all
*  Need to be trying to figure that out
*  And mortality is a big part of the picture
*  People that talk about immortality
*  It feels like imagine if Joe Biden
*  Donald Trump like lived forever
*  We would have Clinton Trump
*  Like we have these families just like
*  Forever running our world
*  One of the
*  Things that makes this world run
*  Is the passing away of previous generations
*  Of previous
*  Systems of thought and
*  You know
*  You have to always consider like the things
*  We see as negative that
*  Make up our psychology make up
*  Different characteristics of human civilizations
*  Are
*  Positive in some sense
*  That wars create progress
*  They create suffering but they also
*  Create progress they create beautiful music and art
*  They create the bonds
*  Of love and friendship like nothing
*  Like nothing else
*  In this world conflict and
*  Suffering
*  The finiteness of life kind of makes life
*  Worth living for many people
*  That is part of the problem right like
*  In order to really appreciate the light
*  You got to experience the darkness
*  You have to know the darkness is real
*  And one of the exciting things about
*  Like Neuralink understanding our mind
*  Is not alleviating suffering
*  But enriching the way we
*  Experience the world so like
*  Enriching the way
*  We experience suffering the expanding
*  The way we can experience the highs
*  And the lows it's expanding
*  Our consciousness it's doing the thing
*  That jokingly said with mushrooms
*  But basically doing what mushrooms
*  Do but in a
*  Controlled and you know
*  Much more powerful way
*  Well maybe something can transcend
*  This biological limitation that
*  We're discussing of being a
*  Human and that through
*  This innovation we can reach some
*  Point where there's a different motivation
*  And this other motivation might
*  Be all peace and love it might
*  Be it might be that this motivation
*  Through this thing if we can somehow and
*  Other suppress all the negative aspects
*  Of our biology and enhance
*  All the positive aspects of camaraderie
*  And love and friendship and
*  Do so in a way that's tangible
*  For everybody that's another problem
*  With things like Neuralink like how much is this
*  Going to cost and how much is this going to separate
*  The haves from the have nots
*  You know Elon was telling me when he
*  Was discussing on the podcast he said
*  It's going to have
*  You're going to be so much more productive
*  If you have it well people who are more productive
*  Are more successful and if you
*  Need a lot of money in order to get it
*  Done and then you get it done and you're more productive
*  And then more successful ultimately it's going to
*  Create a wider and wider gap
*  Between people who have
*  Everything and people who have nothing
*  If that individual productivity
*  Results in the increase of the gap
*  But it can also potentially
*  Just like the individuals who have
*  Created some incredible technology in this world
*  You think about Ford
*  You think about
*  Steve Jobs and Elon Musk
*  Is
*  They're individuals
*  They're super weird
*  Intelligent and productive
*  But they ultimately created a better world
*  With the inventions they made
*  So you know it's
*  It's possible that the productivity
*  Of those individuals actually creates
*  Lifts all boats
*  That it creates ultimately a better world
*  And as that process goes on
*  More people will be able to afford
*  These technologies
*  So like the
*  Lead adopters the people that get it
*  In the beginning might have a disproportionate advantage
*  But
*  That disproportionate advantage
*  Doesn't necessarily create
*  A negative outcome for the world
*  If there is
*  If David
*  Fravor what he saw
*  Was actually a thing trying to communicate
*  That like
*  Elon said love is the answer
*  Say the aliens were trying to communicate
*  Love is the answer and here's this badass
*  Pilot top gun like Tom Cruise
*  Character who just like
*  Wasn't sure if he was going to shoot it or not kind of thing
*  And wanted to fly it
*  But he was just saying like love is the answer
*  Maybe when you expand the mind
*  Maybe feels on shrooms or with Neuralink
*  You'll be able to see that communication
*  And ultimately the thing you'll be able to see
*  Will be good for
*  Society
*  It's not you won't just because
*  You'll be more productive won't
*  You won't try to get a bigger yacht
*  Bigger house
*  Better cars but you'll see
*  That we're like
*  All connected
*  Being connected consciousness
*  And that extra productivity you get
*  Will result in you helping
*  Others more effectively
*  That's a real possibility too
*  And I have faith in the
*  Smart people working on technology
*  People kind of tend to be
*  Negative about technology
*  But I
*  I'm one of them and I work with a lot
*  Of them the people who are best
*  At creating new ideas
*  Have
*  They almost
*  They almost always have good intentions
*  But that's not enough
*  They very often
*  Are good at doing
*  Good for the world
*  So I have hope that the best
*  People creating this technology
*  At Neuralink certainly the people I've interacted with
*  Are
*  Going to be aware of the
*  Negatives and are going to work
*  Their ass off
*  To make a better world
*  One of the most impressive things to me about
*  People say like negative stuff about Eon
*  And so on
*  One of the most impressive things about Neuralink
*  And the people I've interacted with at Tesla
*  And all those companies
*  Is like there's a passion in their eyes
*  These are some of the best people in the world
*  At just being kids
*  And loving what they do
*  Like it's hard to put into words
*  When you see that
*  That's what I see with you with comedy
*  I don't know
*  I don't know anything about comedy
*  I'm just a spectator
*  But there's a joy that
*  I love seeing people who are good at what they do
*  And love what they do
*  And just losing themselves in it
*  I have faith that when you give those people the power
*  To do what they want to do
*  That it will create a better world
*  And that's what Eon is doing
*  And that's what I wish more
*  Companies and groups were doing
*  I wish the US government would do that more
*  Of like have leaders
*  That attract
*  Those weird passionate
*  People that are like
*  Just have this fire in their eyes
*  I remember
*  Like the early days of Tesla
*  With the first gigafactory
*  Opening
*  I happened to be there
*  Because I'd give a talk
*  It was like 3 at night
*  And the people working there
*  At that factory in the middle of the desert
*  The excitement in their eyes
*  Was like
*  Like you know
*  These ladies that like
*  They look like they haven't slept for days
*  But there was just this like glimmer
*  Of just love for what they do
*  And I was like that gives me faith
*  That these people
*  If these people are building our future
*  They're going to do a pretty good job
*  Beautiful
*  Thanks
*  A poem thing
*  A lot of people asked me to
*  Sing again because of my sexy voice
*  No they didn't
*  Nobody, nobody
*  My mom was like
*  Even my mom didn't say
*  Maybe that second song
*  Maybe play piano or something
*  No
*  I just want to say
*  Because we're talking about love
*  I
*  My
*  Grandmother passed away
*  Just several days ago
*  And for me
*  Everybody's different
*  But for me she basically
*  She was one of the key people in my life
*  That raised me
*  She is responsible for much
*  Of the good that I am
*  So she lived through
*  In the early 30s
*  I'm not sure if you're familiar
*  With it
*  Most people think about the Holocaust
*  Or the atrocity of the 20th century
*  But Galdomor in Ukraine
*  Was when
*  Basically because of the decisions that
*  Stalin made millions of people starved
*  There are stories
*  That's from another time if you want to really hear about it
*  Ask Jordan Pearson about it
*  I have, we've talked about it
*  And he
*  There are stories where it's
*  Thousands of people
*  Practiced cannibalism
*  They ate their children
*  So this is what this
*  Just to give you a context of what starvation does
*  To the human
*  Human beings
*  So she lived through that
*  She lived through World War II
*  This beautiful teenage
*  Girl, woman
*  In Nazi occupied
*  City, so all of that
*  And she never talked about it
*  She was a bad
*  Fucker
*  She was the person
*  That inspired me to be strong
*  And a person that also
*  To
*  To put love out there
*  She loved her husband
*  That passed away in the 80s
*  But it was always radiated this
*  Deep love for other human beings
*  That was forever
*  The thing
*  The reason I talk about love a lot
*  Is she made it okay for me
*  My dad
*  Sorry to go on tangents, but my dad is this witty Jew
*  Who never
*  Who's afraid to say
*  Anything
*  He's kind of like Eric Weinstein, he's brilliant
*  He says stuff that's really interesting and clever
*  My grandmother taught me that
*  Sometimes it's okay to say the cliche
*  Simple thing
*  You don't always have to be super intelligent, super interesting
*  Super complicated and eloquent
*  You can just say, you can just talk about love
*  And talk simply even if it's a
*  Cliche thing, so
*  She was 91
*  I just wanted to say in this podcast that
*  She's
*  I miss her and she's the reason
*  For any good that I am
*  She's highly responsible for that
*  So
*  I miss you, I love you
*  Not you, Joe, my grandma
*  I don't know if there's a poem I want to do, but
*  Do you not want to do it, or do it?
*  I'll do
*  So there's a bunch of Russian poems that I think I shouldn't
*  But
*  The poem, If
*  By Kipling
*  I'd love to read it, it's okay
*  It's a minute
*  Stop fucking with that
*  Alright, fuck you
*  I'm nervous, man
*  You should be, you're about to read a poem
*  In front of millions of people
*  And I'm speaking for the woman that probably is looking down
*  Shaking her head like, what are you doing?
*  Drink vodka, shut the hell up
*  If you can fill the unforgiving minute
*  With sixty seconds worth of distance run
*  Yours is the earth
*  And everything that's in it
*  And which is more
*  You'll be a man
*  My grandson
*  Thanks, Joe
*  Thank you
*  Goodbye, everybody
