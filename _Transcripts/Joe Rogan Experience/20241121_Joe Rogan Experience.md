# Joe Rogan Experience #2232 - Josh Brolin
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzPlfjTtxlc)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  Hey!
*  Oh!
*  Little Bo Peep.
*  She needed the money.
*  Oh!
*  Oh!
*  Remember how great that was?
*  Oh yeah.
*  When I first met him, it was like one of those weird things where, you know, I mean, you've
*  met a lot of famous people.
*  Some of them you meet and you're like, oh, fucking really?
*  Bummer.
*  It's weird.
*  Oh, there's bummer too.
*  Yeah.
*  The bummer ones, that sucks.
*  When you meet someone, they suck.
*  You're like, oh no, you suck.
*  Some people just not talk.
*  They should only do what they do, act and sing.
*  But then you get to know them.
*  Like I don't know, like I'm pretty good at this now where you don't, where you see people
*  that you like looked up to.
*  Like Eddie Vedder, I had a pretty close relationship with him.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah, but I was drinking and then I would grab his balls and do shit like that.
*  And then it was like, I don't want him around.
*  I don't want Josh around.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't like that anymore.
*  I don't want my, you know, and I think Sean Penn appreciated shit like that.
*  Like, wow, somebody has the balls.
*  It's not even a little chaos.
*  It's like somebody has the balls to like call me on my shit.
*  Like not everybody's afraid of me.
*  Oh right.
*  Yeah.
*  He's probably used to people constantly being afraid of him.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, oh, I can't fuck with him.
*  Right.
*  Well, he does wild shit.
*  I mean, I went down to fucking Mexico and met with El Chapo.
*  Like Jesus Christ, dude.
*  That's a fucking wild, reckless thing to do.
*  And I just think that that's organic, but I think that that's also, you just have that
*  thing where you just go, you know what?
*  Shit's getting boring.
*  Right.
*  The weather's just too fucking nice here.
*  Weather's too nice.
*  I'm too famous.
*  Let's go meet a monster.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's go fuck some shit up.
*  Let's do something.
*  Let's do something big.
*  Let's do something really reckless.
*  Let's do something that's going to resonate for at least a year.
*  Yeah.
*  The El Chapo thing was so crazy though, because that kind of is one of the things that got
*  him caught.
*  It was, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Because they track your cell phone data.
*  Yeah.
*  They know where you go.
*  And if you're bringing your fucking cell phone, you're basically bringing a tracking device
*  to go find one of the most notorious gangsters alive today.
*  The most notorious.
*  I mean, who was the guy with the football team back in the day?
*  Like the...
*  Pablo Escobar?
*  Think about it.
*  It's our days.
*  This time's Pablo Escobar.
*  Yeah.
*  Sean Penn.
*  Clothes and hangs out with him.
*  Spicoli.
*  Because, you know what man?
*  Hey, who wants to come with me and find this motherfucker?
*  Did he go solo?
*  I don't know.
*  I think so.
*  I think he went solo.
*  Well, he knew that lady who was like a reporter.
*  There was like this really hot Mexican reporter.
*  Oh yeah, the Mexican girl.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  He knew her.
*  Was he dating her?
*  I don't know.
*  But I think she had a thing with El Chapo.
*  After that?
*  No.
*  Did he introduce them properly?
*  I don't know.
*  I think he knew her and she knew him.
*  She knew El Chapo.
*  Oh right.
*  That's how he got...
*  That was the connect.
*  And El Chapo's like, I like the meat.
*  It's spicoli.
*  Yeah.
*  I like the meat.
*  I love you.
*  Yeah.
*  I really enjoyed you in colors.
*  And then the next thing you know...
*  What's the most dangerous thing that you do now?
*  What do you think?
*  Dangerous thing?
*  Yeah.
*  Like we're talking about Sean going out on a limb.
*  Do you find it necessary to go out and do things that challenge you in a way?
*  Yes.
*  Challenge your psyche?
*  Yes.
*  In what way?
*  Elk hunting's probably the most exciting.
*  What is?
*  Elk hunting.
*  Elk hunting.
*  Why?
*  Because it puts you in danger?
*  Well, no.
*  It's just really difficult.
*  You're bow hunting in the mountains.
*  Right.
*  It's just you in the mountains and just fucking mountain lions.
*  Do you stay up there for days and days and days and do you quarter your kill?
*  Oh yeah, we pack it out.
*  See, that's a different thing.
*  People say I don't like hunting.
*  Personally, I grew up in a very red part of California.
*  Everybody hunts that I grew up with.
*  And I would shoot and I would hunt with my dad and I would fucking think about it and
*  dream about it for three weeks.
*  Oh yeah, I love it.
*  I love it.
*  I love eating.
*  No, no, no.
*  I'm saying that I would like...
*  Oh, in a bathroom?
*  I would spiral.
*  Oh, you would get negative with it.
*  Not even...
*  It was negative.
*  Yeah, I guess it would be negative, but it made me think of the kids that were going
*  Mom?
*  Mom, are you there?
*  And I just killed the mother.
*  Oh, because you killed the mother?
*  It's like the Bambi kind of thing.
*  Right.
*  But I eat meat.
*  So that hypocritical thing of like, I don't want to kill anything, but I want you to kill
*  it for me so I can eat it because I really like the way it tastes.
*  Well, that's the anthropomorphization of animals that Disney has kind of done a number on people
*  with, you know, like Bambi and Yogi Bear and all that kind of shit.
*  And there's cartoons and teddy bears and we have a very, you know, living in... when
*  you live in urban areas and cities and people, you know, streets and concrete, and people
*  just get a very distorted idea of nature and our relationship with nature.
*  And when you're a kid and you're just, these are sweet, cute things, and then all of a
*  sudden you're supposed to go murder one.
*  Like, it's all fucked up.
*  But what's fucked up is the cartoons.
*  I mean, they're cute and everything.
*  Because they depict it in a way how?
*  Well, it's just completely distorted.
*  You have these animals that are talking to each other and the hunters are always assholes
*  and they're like...
*  If it wasn't for hunters, there would be no humans.
*  We'd have never made it this far.
*  If we were all just eating fucking tubers and grapes and shit, we would have never made
*  it.
*  Do you like garbanzo beans?
*  Not bad.
*  I don't prefer that.
*  Have you ever hunted one?
*  No.
*  It's fucking wild, man.
*  How do you do that?
*  You take a bunch of acid.
*  You gotta go to Italian restaurants.
*  You take a bunch of acid.
*  It's possible.
*  Yeah.
*  What about the sexual connotations of Disney?
*  Did you ever hear that thing that Walt Disney had the biggest porn collection of all time?
*  Really?
*  That's what I heard.
*  I don't know how much of it is true.
*  Have you ever seen how...
*  There's the Rod Stewart thing and there's...
*  You know what I mean?
*  I don't know if it's...
*  Right.
*  Go over it, Jamie.
*  Did Walt Disney have a gigantic porn collection?
*  I wouldn't be surprised.
*  There's a lot of people that are really into kid stuff and sweet, wholesome stuff.
*  They need...
*  Have that other kind of slant?
*  Yeah.
*  Or eventually flip?
*  Maybe.
*  Maybe it's a cover or maybe it's like they're so cutesy with the fucking completely wholesome
*  stuff that they have to balance it out with some bonded shit.
*  Some fucked up shit.
*  Some guys getting kicked in the nuts and bald ass.
*  Why is it that people feel that people in Hollywood and Texans are like that?
*  I know people that have moved to Texas and they've called me.
*  There was one guy that I used to work out with in Venice.
*  He moved here and he called me and he'd be like, hey man, the list is coming out.
*  And I'd go, what list?
*  And he goes, you know, the list.
*  The list.
*  And I go, am I on the list?
*  Oh no.
*  And he goes, no.
*  You're clean.
*  You're good.
*  But I know you know who's on the list.
*  I'm glad I know I didn't do anything wrong even though I didn't do anything wrong.
*  And I said, but why are you, like a twofold thing, why are you under the impression that
*  everybody in Hollywood lives under the same roof?
*  Like we all live in the same apartment complex.
*  It's they.
*  It's they.
*  Yeah, they.
*  They are out there.
*  They are out there doing that thing.
*  And then how could you possibly think that a guy who's a trainer at Gold's in Venice
*  would have the list?
*  Why was he chosen?
*  Well, he goes on Reddit.
*  And that's how you get the list.
*  That's how you get the list.
*  I still am waiting for the list.
*  Yeah.
*  I think I'm going to see him when I'm here.
*  We started communicating again.
*  Well, when you have things like the Epstein client list that doesn't get released, then
*  it fuels these kind of conspiracy theories about there being a list.
*  So why is that list not released?
*  That's a very good question.
*  Who has that list?
*  Powerful people.
*  Well, for sure someone has the list.
*  Colleen Maxwell's in jail, right?
*  So she must have talked.
*  Like there must have been conversations.
*  And there must be a bunch of very powerful people that are on that list.
*  And you know,
*  Are all the powerful people in cahoots?
*  It was something that I learned.
*  Like when I played W, I played a senator.
*  What was that like?
*  What is it like playing a guy who's still alive?
*  Did you meet with him?
*  Scary.
*  Did you hang out with him at all?
*  Scary.
*  I mean, I wanted to.
*  Did you ever meet him?
*  No.
*  That's weird, right?
*  I had the opportunity to meet him afterwards.
*  And there was something about him that was more, remember when he was like giving candy
*  to Michelle Obama and all that.
*  And it was like a really friendly kind of a mischievous thing.
*  And I was like, I would like to meet him.
*  And then I saw his paintings of his dogs and I said, I don't want to meet him.
*  I just don't.
*  Like it was something attractive for a moment.
*  What's about the paintings?
*  I don't know.
*  And I love paintings.
*  I don't know what it was, but
*  You didn't like the paintings?
*  No, it's not that I didn't like the paintings.
*  There's something in the paintings.
*  There was, I don't know what it was, man.
*  You know what's something in the paintings is I killed a million people with fake weapons
*  of mass destruction.
*  You know, there was, we had a fake story and I used that story to justify an invasion of
*  a country and now a million people are dead.
*  So that's the question.
*  And I'm haunted every night.
*  Totally.
*  I just paint dogs.
*  That are staring like that.

*  Like your face right now is exactly how every eye is in his dog's paintings.
*  It's so funny.
*  That guy must be medicated.
*  They must put him on some things so he can sleep.
*  Is that that look?
*  I think-
*  Does he put into his dog's eyes the look that he has always, or at least that he feels that
*  he has?
*  Right.
*  Like there's a haunted-
*  It's his lens.
*  His real look behind his eyes.
*  It's his lens.
*  Yeah.
*  How he sees the world, how he's experiencing the world.
*  What is it like running around knowing that you did that?
*  Not just that you did that, but that there's no culpability.
*  No one went to jail for that.
*  No one even got brought up on charges for that.
*  That's what I was bringing up because when I would meet these people, I went to the Senate
*  floor and I met a lot of these people.
*  Then I met a lot of rich people, which is when I met Trump actually, the 21 Club.
*  Back when I knew a lot about him, I was fascinated by the whole-
*  What's the 21 Club?
*  The 21 Club is a place that he used to go a lot.
*  It was like, yeah, you have a chance to meet this billionaire, this billionaire.
*  One of them faces-
*  Then Trump, you end up trying to get-
*  Eyes wide shut type shit.
*  So he, what was I going to say?
*  Is he, oh, meeting these people, especially getting them drunk, where people get super
*  honest.
*  Where they go, you know what, man?
*  I trust you.
*  I trust you.
*  And you're like, here it comes.
*  Here it comes.
*  Whereas before that, they were like, I'm not sure.
*  What I think is- and then they finally go, I just fucked her.
*  I fucked her.
*  And you're like, oh, or they tell you what's going on.
*  But the thing that I learned and I'm really curious about, like what we were talking about
*  Hollywood and the perception of them all being in it together, is don't you think the rival
*  reason all that, not entirely, but that all politicians are basically under the same roof.
*  They all know what each other's doing and that there's more of an agenda of power to
*  keep the public thinking a certain way.
*  Well, there's-
*  Not brainwashed.
*  There's certainly a benefit to that.
*  Of course there is.
*  Yeah, there's a benefit to that.
*  And then there's also the underlying factor is money, of course.
*  Like, there's so much money and influence.
*  There's so many special interest groups.
*  There's so many lobbyists.
*  That's what I mean.
*  So many massive corporations that are donating to campaigns.
*  Yeah, so there's always going to be this desire to sort of color things in a certain life.
*  Passify.
*  Yeah, yeah, for sure.
*  And then treat you like you're a baby so they can continue making insane amounts of money.
*  Like, if you're someone like Nancy Pelosi and you're worth hundreds of millions of dollars
*  and you make $170,000 a year and there's no fucking explanation.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, just that alone.
*  Like, you have to kind of keep people in the dark.
*  You have to kind of like keep dancing.
*  Otherwise you're going to jail.
*  Like, someone's going to start investigating and they've got to go, hey, what you did is
*  not legal and you're going to be in real trouble.
*  What's your relationship like with money?
*  In what way?
*  Just in what, you've made a certain amount of money for a long time.
*  I don't think about it.
*  You don't think about it?
*  No, no.
*  What I like about money is to not think about it.
*  That's what I like.
*  Do you like spending it?
*  I like buying stuff.
*  Me too.
*  I have a nice car.
*  Drove here.
*  Drove a 69 Camaro.
*  I like that.
*  That's different.
*  That's fucking different.
*  That's character.
*  I like fun stuff.
*  Fun stuff.
*  But for the most part, I'm not interested in it as a goal.
*  What I like about money is not having to think about it.
*  My friend Brian Cowen said this to me once.
*  He said, he goes, real freedom is when you can go to a restaurant and not worry about
*  what anything costs.
*  He's like, everything else is bullshit.
*  It is.
*  And it really is.
*  Everything else is bullshit.
*  When you just go to a restaurant, get a nice steak, order a bottle of wine, have a good
*  time, and not think about the bill.
*  What I think happens is, and be grateful for it.
*  And to remind yourself that that exists to be grateful for and not be taken advantage
*  of.
*  And I think that's one of the hardest things about money slash power, is you start treating
*  things as if they're underneath you.
*  Ooh.
*  Yeah.
*  Where you go, God, I'm so glad I can go anywhere in the world right now and get a meal.
*  And I don't have to think about how am I going to pay for this?
*  Yeah.
*  Am I going to be in debt on my credit card?
*  When you start saying, excuse me, I said 204 degrees, not 190.
*  Read my list.
*  And you're like, oh man.
*  That's just gross.
*  It is gross, but it happens.
*  That's just taking advantage of this relationship that everyone knows, where service people
*  have to be nicer than they really would be normally, like a regular person.
*  So people that-
*  Hoping for a tip.
*  Yeah.
*  Hoping for one of your many hundreds of thousands or hundreds of millions of dollars.
*  It's disgusting.
*  It's a gross way to treat people.
*  But some people want to get rich so they could do that to people.
*  Maybe someone did it to them when they were younger and they were like, I can't wait to
*  do this to other people.
*  I mean, when you said nice car and you were like, I thought you were going to say, I was
*  like, oh please no, like Lamborghini or-
*  No, I don't have any of those.
*  And then-
*  No, I like muscle cars.
*  I like old muscle cars.
*  That's my favorite.
*  That's like me at 37 Knucklehead.
*  And people say, oh is that an affectation?
*  I know you're friends with Momoa or whatever.
*  I go, no man, I've been riding motorcycles since I was three and a half years old.
*  They're fun.
*  They're not only fun.
*  There's something on a- if you read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, which is
*  the only book that's ever been written that kind of gets close to the kind of spiritual
*  place.
*  If you're a true motorcyclist, whether you're riding with your son or whether you're riding
*  with a grid of guys or whatever, that beautiful thunderous hum when you're in a group of guys
*  who really know what they're doing and you're in absolute fucking sync.
*  Yes.
*  Yes, your arms are up here and your arms are pretty numb at that point, but you're fucking
*  soaring.
*  You're an eagle on a fucking jet stream.
*  You ever heard of Hunter S. Thompson?
*  You know that documentary they did, Gonzo?
*  In the documentary, the very beginning, he talks about riding a motorcycle on the Pacific
*  Coast Highway.
*  Oh, I don't remember that.
*  I don't remember that.
*  Oh, it's fucking great.
*  See if you can find that.
*  He talks about riding a motorcycle, how about that the lines begin to blur and you're just
*  on the edge and how alive you are.
*  It's a fucking fantastic speech.
*  We don't have to get into this book right away, but there was- I wrote- they came to
*  me.
*  It's the only story that I wrote that somebody asked me to write for the book.
*  They were like, well, you're really into motorcycles.
*  Why don't you write a story about motorcycles?
*  I tried and it was just bad and bad and everything I wrote was so forced and bullshit.
*  Finally, I said, I can't do it.
*  I'm not going to write it.
*  In the minute I said, I'm not going to do this, I started writing.
*  It just started to come out and it's good.
*  Do you write by hand?
*  I do.
*  Mostly.
*  Do you feel more of a connection when you write by hand?
*  No, that's not why I do it.
*  You don't like to type?
*  I write any which way, whether it's on the phone, whether- I remember people saying I
*  write by hand, I hand write because it's the way it used to be.
*  I was like, yeah, it also used to be under candlelight, which fucked your eyes out.
*  It also used to be people had slaves.
*  Yeah.
*  You can only get around by horse.
*  Also, you do paint on caves and shit.
*  Why don't you go paint on a cave?
*  Tell me a story.
*  Try to get it published.
*  Yeah, get a witch doctor to take care of your broken leg.
*  I don't care how it comes out.
*  I think real writing is anywhere, anytime, however you can get it out.
*  I don't think there's a muse that's needed.
*  I think it's work, man.
*  It is work.
*  It's labor.
*  It's a concept.
*  Have you ever read Pressfield's The War of Art?
*  Yeah, of course.
*  Great book.
*  Great book.
*  I think he's right though when he says you summon the muse when you sit down to work,
*  but that's also just like an intention thing.
*  You have so much time and effort put on a thing, and when you do that, your mind gets
*  more in sync with creativity.
*  But if you treat it like it's a muse, it actually does work.
*  Like if you show up every day and like say...
*  Click into that thing.
*  Yeah, and pay respect to the muse.
*  I'm sitting here and I'm ready to write, and I'm a professional, and I'm ready to go, and
*  treat it like you're summoning the muse.
*  It actually works.
*  There actually is an effect that happens.
*  I don't know if there's an actual muse, but you can understand why someone would think
*  that there's a muse because...
*  Why do people chant?
*  Why do people meditate?
*  Why do people that?
*  That's the muse.
*  Whatever the muse is, it's like talking about God.
*  It's God.
*  I don't know.
*  It depends on who you're talking to.
*  God is a feeling.
*  It's something that fucking thing that keeps you inspired, that keeps the gasoline at a
*  high octane.
*  That's how I see it.
*  It's something that gets you away from your ego, like with writing, something that gets
*  you away from your ego and into your mind, into your consciousness, into your perceptions
*  of things and your ability to express it.
*  It's a focused thing.
*  The more you focus on it, the more that muscle grows, the more you get adapted to it.
*  Because your ego is worried about how people are going to perceive you.
*  That's not right.
*  You're writing for somebody else.
*  You want to look cool.
*  You want to look cool.
*  People are like, fuck.
*  I read that book that you wrote, man.
*  Holy shit.
*  I had no idea.
*  You're amazing.
*  That's the grossest conversation ever.
*  Cocktail party in Hollywood.
*  Some guy comes up to you and tells you you're amazing.
*  You are a genius.
*  You're so incredible.
*  I had no idea.
*  Meanwhile, that guy is trying to sell you on some multi-level marketing scheme or something.
*  There's something he's trying to tap into you with.
*  I want to buy that book.
*  I want to option your book.
*  I want to turn it into a fucking movie.
*  I also have a script I'd love you to see.
*  Yeah.
*  Is it a Disney?
*  Is it about animals talking?
*  I really love about living in Texas is there's no Hollywood.
*  There's no show business.
*  I don't have to deal with any of these people with like alternative agendas.
*  We just moved to say we just I want to go back to that but we just moved to Santa Barbara.
*  Santa Barbara is awesome.
*  Santa Barbara.
*  It's funny.
*  I love it.
*  Why does everybody fucking think that?
*  It is awesome.
*  Montecito.
*  I love it out there.
*  Why?
*  Because it's beautiful.
*  Because it's beautiful.
*  What about the people?
*  They're a little elitist.
*  There's a lot of elitist people out there.
*  So that's a perfect place for me.
*  So I grew up in Santa Barbara.
*  I was in Paso Robles, which is ranch country, about two hours above Santa Barbara.
*  Then we moved to Santa Barbara when I was 11 and it was Montecito but it was a very
*  different Montecito.
*  Yes, there were a couple of rich people.
*  Yes, my dad was doing okay by then.
*  He had done Marcus Welby.
*  He did at that time he did Amityville Horror.
*  So he had a little bit of money but we bought what would now be a $35 million home in Montecito.
*  He bought for $600,000.
*  Same fucking house.
*  Do you know what I mean?
*  So it was a different Montecito and then whatever group I grew up with.
*  The point is I went to jail there a lot.
*  I just did.
*  I just liked it.
*  Instead of the museum I went to jail.
*  I was like, no mom, I'm going to go to jail today.
*  In LA, Venice Beach, I love Venice Beach but Venice Beach has even changed.
*  You used to know everybody and everybody kind of coexisted beautifully and then Venice Beach
*  changed and it got totally randomly violent.
*  Yes, we became very dangerous.
*  Little kids.
*  Okay, so we moved to Malibu.
*  We were close to Laird.
*  I know Laird and Gabby and all that thing.
*  But it never landed.
*  So we were always talking about moving even though we were kind of building the house
*  and we were finalizing everything.
*  We're always talking.
*  We talk about Texas.
*  My mom's from Texas.
*  We were talking about East Coast.
*  We were talking about Europe.
*  All these places but never Santa Barbara.
*  I would never move back to Santa Barbara because by the way honey, if we moved to Santa Barbara
*  which you love so much and you think is so beautiful, our little girls will eventually
*  for sure go to prison.
*  That was in my mind.
*  Why?
*  Because in my mind I had built totally.
*  Most of my friends who grew up in Montesquieu are dead.
*  Really?
*  Like 36 out of 50.
*  Really?
*  Oh yeah.
*  From what?
*  Heroin epidemic, punk rock, driving accidents.
*  36 out of 50?
*  Out of 50.
*  Wow.
*  Best friend Jason Sears who was the lead singer of Rich Kids on LSD, RKL which was a big punk
*  band that influenced a bunch of people.
*  Nirvana, Pearl Jam, all these people.
*  Rich Kids on LSD is a great name for a band.
*  You should look it up.
*  Can you look it up?
*  Jason Sears, Rich Kids on LSD.
*  We got a tattoo at the same time.
*  I got a tattoo from Freddie Negretti that's gone now because I removed it.
*  But it was a big Jesus with blood coming out of the hands and Jason that same night got
*  the same night got eat shit on his ass.
*  See if you can find Jason's ass that says eat shit on it.
*  Wow.
*  You're going to put that in?
*  Jason Sears, eat shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Where is it?
*  Oh, you got to just keep looking.
*  Yeah, it'll be there.
*  So why was I?
*  Oh, so eventually when we finally said, look, we're not moving, we should be grateful.
*  We're not grateful enough.
*  That's the problem.
*  I'm not grateful enough, but Malibu just didn't kind of sit.
*  And then one day I'm lying on the bed.
*  What didn't you like about Malibu?
*  I love Malibu.
*  It's just remote.
*  You know, like we already are remote in Paso Robles.
*  We have a place in Paso Robles, a place where I grew up, not the ranch I grew up.
*  It's about three miles down the road, but that's remote and a remote that I love.
*  I love remote, but I love extremes.
*  I don't want to be sort of next to Santa Monica and it's 20 miles away and it takes two and
*  a half hours to get there.
*  You and I were talking about that.
*  I don't want to sit in traffic for half my life.
*  I just don't want to.
*  If I'm going to be somewhere, I want to be somewhere.
*  So Santa Barbara represented a place where you kind of had your own piece of property,
*  but everything was 10 minutes away.
*  You got dance class for the girls.
*  You got soccer.
*  You got this.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Yeah.
*  So that was the thing.
*  But never was I going to go back to Santa Barbara.
*  I finally put on Zillow Santa Barbara.
*  One house came up and that's the house that we bought.
*  And it was Joe Walsh's old house.
*  Wow.
*  That's incredible.
*  Incredible.
*  That's incredible.
*  And I asked him.
*  Anyway, I have to finish the story is that I was so freaked out about moving up to Santa
*  Barbara.
*  I still hadn't made the kind of transition that I contracted a mild case to a Bell's
*  palsy.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Like literally was stressing out.
*  My wife was like, you got to, and I'm not a stress guy.
*  And she was like, you got to mellow the fuck out.
*  I'm like, yeah, but you don't know what's going to happen when we move up here.
*  It's like, it's going to be.
*  So literally I'm washing my face and I'm doing this and it just started going.
*  Whoa.
*  When was this?
*  Four months ago.
*  OK.
*  That's a side effect of the vaccine too.
*  That's one of the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines.
*  I've also heard that speech impediments have also I've heard a lot of things.
*  Kids taking vaccine.
*  Yeah.
*  Things happening.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That vaccine in particular.
*  That one.
*  The mRNA one.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And then the other one is the one that developed Bell's palsy from them.
*  Well, whatever you want to call it.
*  Are you serious?
*  Yeah.
*  Facial paralysis.
*  Yeah.
*  I know two people specifically.
*  I wonder if that.
*  They developed facial, like droopy face.
*  Because when my older kids.
*  They went away.
*  When my older kids were young, there were what?
*  17 vaccinations.
*  And now that my younger kids are young, there's 50.
*  72.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a series of them, but it's ultimately 72 shots.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And.
*  It's a scary prospect, man.
*  The fucked up thing is if you talk about it, you're an anti-vaxxer.
*  And you're a conspiracy theorist.
*  Can you talk about anything?
*  But that's a big one.
*  Because they've done a really good job of demonizing anyone who questions a medicine
*  that might be correlated with a bunch of fucking serious diseases.
*  Yeah.
*  Exactly.
*  And for whatever reason.
*  Profit.
*  They've just done a great job of gaslighting people.
*  Yeah.
*  And scaring the shit out of people by labeling anybody who did.
*  Like, look what they did to Jenny McCarthy.
*  Do you remember when Jenny McCarthy had a kid and her kid had autism?
*  And she thought that autism had possibly come from vaccines.
*  And they basically ran her out of Hollywood.
*  But why would they do that?
*  What's the reason?
*  Money.
*  What do they benefit money?
*  Well, the thing is, during the Reagan administration, the vaccine companies, pharmaceutical drug
*  companies that are making vaccines, they said we are unable to make these vaccines
*  if we're liable.
*  There's too many lawsuits are going to come our way because vaccines cannot be completely
*  safe and effective just by virtue of the mechanism in which they work.
*  You have an irritant.
*  You have this virus, this dead virus.
*  Your body sees the aluminum or whatever it is.
*  It reacts to that in a negative way and it finds the dead virus.
*  It develops antibodies just by the way they work.
*  When you vaccinate an enormous amount of people, you're going to have a certain amount of people
*  that have a negative reaction.
*  If we have lawsuits for every person that has a negative reaction, we're going to go
*  out of business.
*  So they made them immune.
*  They made them immune.
*  And you know what happened?
*  Immediately, they're like, well, you need a vaccine for this and you need to go vaccinate
*  that.
*  And knowing that there was no drawback.
*  And they give babies hepatitis B vaccines.
*  Babies.
*  Right when you're born.
*  Why were you born?
*  Right when you're born.
*  There's also doctors that say it doesn't even really work for babies.
*  But what you're doing is you're conditioning the parents to accept the fact that your child
*  is going to get regularly vaccinated.
*  My doctor, fortunately, our pediatrician wanted to put the kids on a different schedule, a
*  slower schedule.
*  And he didn't want them to have any vaccines until they were two.
*  Your doctor in California?
*  Yes.
*  And he but it was not like a quack.
*  He was like, I think the way to do it.
*  I mean, yeah, there's a schedule of vaccines your kids have to get unless you have religious
*  exemption.
*  And let's not assault your children with a potential poison because everybody is different.
*  If I take a bong hit, I might end up under the table.
*  If you take a bong hit, you actually may feel smarter and clearer.
*  I remember Dean Potter, who was a climber, and he was like, I stopped smoking pot for
*  four months.
*  But when I started smoking pot, I could feel the hold at 2000 feet.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Sheer cliff.
*  Nothing underneath, no ropes.
*  But I felt more confident.
*  And for me, I go, if I took a bong head up there, I could be four feet up and be freaking
*  out.
*  Right.
*  It's different for everybody.
*  Because everybody has different brains.
*  It's like psychopharmaceuticals.
*  Let's just give them all lithium or let's give them all that.
*  You have to experiment.
*  The idea of experimenting with that shit is super scary.
*  It is.
*  It is super scary.
*  And it's also super scary when you're not liable for any of the repercussions.
*  And you're just pushing it on people because you're a corporation.
*  And corporations just want to make money.
*  Their thing is just unlimited growth.
*  They just have an obligation.
*  They're shareholders.
*  Every quarter, they want to make more money and they just keep ramping it up.
*  I remember Seinfeld talking about that.
*  He was like, I remember back in the 70s in comedy, green rooms and all that.
*  We'd all be fucking with each other.
*  And it had never had anything to do with money because nobody was really making money.
*  Like money, money.
*  Like tons of money.
*  It was just about what said, are you going to do?
*  What are you trying out?
*  Are you going to fail?
*  Are you not going to fail?
*  But it was this community again.
*  And I think that things have grown into not that I wanted to talk about this or they even
*  thought about it before, but the money thing is a very interesting thing to me.
*  And if you want to take it back to the book, which we can talk about later, money is the
*  anti-celebrity.
*  It's like, how do you stay grounded?
*  How do you stay accountable?
*  And why would you stay accountable?
*  Because I actually give a fuck about people instead of just being in it for myself.
*  And I think that's the difference.
*  Well I think one of the things that happens to people with money is you didn't have money
*  when you were young.
*  Now all of a sudden you have money and you get really scared about losing that money.
*  If somebody else is going to take it away.
*  Yeah.
*  You get scared it's going to go away because now you realize, oh my God, it's so much better
*  to not have to worry about your bills and so much better to have some money to buy things.
*  And then you start thinking only about money and start making decisions only for money.
*  And then you go down the weird road.
*  And it really distorts artists.
*  It fucks a lot of people up.
*  You see it in a lot of bands.
*  They start making poppy songs when they used to be raw and gritty when they were younger.
*  They used to be authentic.
*  And then all of a sudden they're making theme songs for films.
*  It's weird fucking romance songs.
*  For rom-coms.
*  Like Aerosmith went through a bunch of that shit.
*  Totally.
*  As an Aerosmith lover as a kid to see them go from like dream on to like the shit they
*  were...
*  And I wonder with like drug addiction and all that, I wonder if it's like if the parallel
*  is I went back to heroin at that point because I just couldn't fucking deal.
*  Do you know what I mean?
*  I think it's when they get off heroin and they start wanting to make money.
*  They start, maybe.
*  I don't know.
*  I need to make some money.
*  I spent all my fucking money.
*  But look, I wonder if there's any connection like with, remember Philip Seymour Hoffman,
*  one of the greatest actors that ever lived.
*  And I've known his mother since I was doing theater in Rochester, New York.
*  He was like a 20 year old, 21 year old.
*  And she would come up to me and she'd say, I think you're a fine actor.
*  I'd go, oh, thank you very much.
*  And she goes, you know, my son just moved to New York.
*  He wants to be an actor.
*  And I said, oh, what's his name?
*  Phil.
*  Phil's his name.
*  Oh, well, Phil, good luck.
*  Good luck to Phil.
*  And it's like anybody who wants to be an actor, just the odds of it happening, it's just not
*  going to happen.
*  And then Phil became this guy, 22 years of sobriety, who had an inkling in the beginning
*  and said, you know what, I don't want this to control like my thing.
*  So I'm not going to do it.
*  I'm going to give everything I am to acting and I'm going to try to make the best career,
*  theater career, movie career, whatever.
*  And then, you know, and I again, I have it in the book where I see him on the street
*  and I'm crazy and I've gotten into a fight with my wife and I'm walking down Columbus
*  Avenue and I have cords on.
*  I have no shoes.
*  I have no shirt on my way out of my fucking head.
*  And I look to my left and I see Nick Nolte at a cafe and we lock eyes and I've never
*  met Nick Nolte.
*  I've never seen him and it will happen that I actually will have a relationship with him
*  later on.
*  But we lock eyes and the moment is he's seeing in me what he used to be or seeing in me what
*  I'm to become.
*  I'm seeing in him what I'm to become later.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  I see a guy, a guy named Jeff Hoffman who's standing there talking.
*  I go, hey, Phil, it's Josh.
*  What's up?
*  You're doing so well, man.
*  Fuck.
*  Good for you, dude.
*  No shirt.
*  No shirt.
*  No shoes.
*  And he's standing there with one foot pointed toward me and another foot pointed in the
*  direction that he wants to go.
*  You know how people stay in there and they're like, could you see him, man?
*  Yeah, good.
*  Good.
*  Oh, no.
*  Now, how is that the guy that died of a heroin overdose?
*  Did he get injured?
*  No.
*  No?
*  He just got back on it?
*  Because sometimes what happens is people get injured.
*  I know.
*  And they have surgery and then they have back and then they get on, you know, OxyContin.
*  I know a lot of people that that's kind of been the trajectory.
*  No back pain, nothing.
*  To me, there's another parallel and the parallel is I just want to make money.
*  Finally, I'm sick of doing independence.
*  I'm sick of doing this and not making any money.
*  And then you start doing, you know, whatever he was, Hunger Games or.
*  And then you feel hollow.
*  And then you want to fill yourself.
*  We were talking about before.
*  Right.
*  You want to numb yourself up because you feel like a whore.
*  You feel like a whore.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like there's one thing about like actually finding solace and saying, hey, man, I'm older.
*  I'm going to do this movie.
*  I get it.
*  I would like, you know, I got college coming up for my kids and you justify it in a way
*  that's OK.
*  And that's one thing about you've identified yourself so much as an artist that to release
*  yourself from that identity in other people's minds, again, going back to the ego, that
*  you just just fuck you up.
*  Right.
*  And then you want to escape from your reality.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  You want to numb yourself.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that is a real fucking thing, man.
*  And if you've ever done a project where it's like really I did a really bad sitcom once.
*  And I remember you acted in.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  It was terrible.
*  I remember while I was doing it, I was just imagining like, what if this is my life?
*  What if this stupid piece of shit sitcom goes for like 10 years and I have to keep you because
*  there's sitcoms that inexplicably are very successful or were the 90s and very successful.
*  And they were terrible.
*  Terrible.
*  They're terrible.
*  People love them.
*  Well, people want to be known.
*  Ice cream.
*  They just want to slack draw in front of the computer or whatever the TV and eat Spaghetti
*  O's just fucking numb themselves to some mundane bullshit.
*  And if you're doing that kind of a thing, you live in hell.
*  And a lot of those people that do those things, they wind up doing drugs because they just
*  feel very lost.
*  If you do that and you're doing it, you live in hell.
*  Yeah, you live in hell.
*  Which it is to me.
*  It sounds crazy to a person listening.
*  Oh, you make it $50,000 a week.
*  How are you living?
*  You're living in hell.
*  Like what are you talking about?
*  No, no, no.
*  That's not the point.
*  Most people would be like, that's great.
*  That would be amazing.
*  But if you want to do a thing, if like you want to be a great comic or you want to be
*  a great actor and you're doing something.
*  You have to have incentive.
*  Right.
*  You have to have you want to you have to want to create something really good.
*  Right.
*  And when you can't create something really good and you're just doing it for money, you
*  feel trapped and you feel like shit.
*  And then you have to reward yourself for this stupid fucking thing you do.
*  So what do you do?
*  You go out and buy a nice Mercedes.
*  You get a fucking house in Malibu.
*  Now you have a large monthly nut that you have to cover.
*  But when you take people over your house like, look how I'm living.
*  Look at this ocean view.
*  How much of this house to use?
*  Nothing.
*  Almost nothing.
*  I always say to my friends, my young comic friends that are coming up, your house is
*  just your house.
*  I remember when I first got a nice apartment when I moved to North Hollywood in 1994, I
*  got a loft apartment and a pool table in it and a nice stereo.
*  And I was like, this is incredible.
*  I have a nice apartment.
*  This is amazing.
*  And then after a while, it just became my house.
*  It was where I live.
*  And I realized at that moment, like, oh, this is it's all the same feeling like all you
*  need in a house is it to be comfortable.
*  Yeah.
*  It's not supposed to be.
*  It's supposed to be the place that you sleep.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a place where you relax.
*  It's not the place where you live the entirety of your life.
*  You can relax almost anywhere that's comfortable and safe.
*  That's all you need.
*  And then everything else is kind of bullshit.
*  It's kind of the things that you get for your money.
*  It's like there's a lot of things that people spend a lot of money on and they're not really
*  worth it.
*  You don't really get anything out of it.
*  That's why it was interesting walking in here and, you know, man cave.
*  I hate that fucking term man cave, man cave.
*  You know, it's a gay cave.
*  You know, well, it's man cave because no woman would ever let me decorate this place this
*  way.
*  But it's not that no woman wouldn't like it.
*  I think there's there's my wife likes it when she comes here.
*  She doesn't want to live in it.
*  She doesn't want to live.
*  Do you want to live in it?
*  No, I wouldn't want to live here.
*  But I might if I was like a single guy, I might decorate my house like this.
*  But it's things.
*  The point is that there's things when I walked in here, it made me smile because I started
*  seeing things that inspire and you like to surround yourself like if somebody comes in
*  and does an interior design of your office.
*  Yeah.
*  And they go, we brought in this amazing fabric from Paris and you go, but I don't like it.
*  And I remember when we were doing our house, we were like, I said, look, man, you can get
*  things from Target.
*  I don't want to feel that people have to take.
*  I don't want anybody to feel that they have to take their shoes off.
*  That's what I don't.
*  I don't feel that they can scuff up the floor because that's the mark that they made when
*  they walked in my house.
*  And maybe I don't even like the scuff.
*  I don't like that they walked so heavy.
*  But it's their mark.
*  We are leaving our mark.
*  So I said, that's how I feel about this table.
*  That's why this table has all these stains on it.
*  Seriously, it's good.
*  It has character.
*  Yeah, it's a lot.
*  And that's the thing is like when we built our ranch, I said there were shelves.
*  I said, I want linoleum or what is it?
*  Linoleum on the shelves.
*  And we have 150 year old barn wood.
*  But along with linoleum, because linoleum reminds me of like trailer parks and shit.
*  It just makes me fucking smile.
*  So I saw this thing when I walked in because I have one.
*  And that is Ralph Stedman's print that you have.
*  Oh, OK.
*  The Hunter of Thompson print.
*  So Ralph Stedman, Johnny Depp gave me Ralph Stedman's number because he was close with
*  Hunter.
*  And my son was graduating.
*  My son's an artist and he was obsessed with Stedman.
*  And I called Ralph Stedman.
*  He said, hello.
*  And I said, hey, I said, listen, you don't know me.
*  I'm a friend of Johnny's and this.
*  I said, you know, my son's graduating and like the greatest gift I could ever get him.
*  And this is not just to throw Stedman under the bus because it comes full circle.
*  But he says, I said, my son's graduating.
*  Can you do like a little thing?
*  I'll pay you for it.
*  Can you do just draw a little thing for him for his graduation?
*  There was a long, long pause.
*  And he goes, why the fuck would I do that?
*  So that conversation went nowhere.
*  What the fuck?
*  And then 20 years went past and my book is designed by one of his protege's.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And then so Joey Feldman, he called me one day and he said, he said, Ralph wants to send
*  you a print.
*  And I said, no way.
*  Does he know or that we have like a history?
*  And he said, no, I don't think so.
*  So I sent him a voice memo of the history and I said, I never held it against you.
*  I totally understand it.
*  Especially somebody.
*  So he sent me one for my son and one for me.
*  And I have it hanging up in my house.
*  That's cool.
*  I love having that thing, man.
*  He was an interesting artist.
*  He is very interesting.
*  Yeah, I should say is.
*  But I mean, the stuff that he did, it's like that's also in that Gonzo documentary where
*  talks about how Hunter gave him acid and mushrooms and he just started fucking writing,
*  drawing really crazy shit.
*  Yeah.
*  And like the thing for do you remember the thing he did for the Kentucky Derby is
*  decadent and that was like the first thing was that I think that was how they got
*  together.
*  You find that the Kentucky Derby is decadent and depraved.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a really good article, actually.
*  Well, that was fast, dude.
*  Yeah.
*  But look at that.
*  That article is fucking amazing.
*  It's amazing article.
*  It's one of my favorite Hunter pieces.
*  And I don't think that they spent a lot of time together, but I think.
*  Hunter and him?
*  No, I don't.
*  There's a lot of it in the documentary where they're hanging out together.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, he picks him up at the airport and his VW bug.
*  No, I know it exists, but I don't think that they spent the amount of time that you
*  would think given that they collaborated so much.
*  I think Ralph was back in Britain and Hunter was.
*  I know.
*  Look at that.
*  See, that's the kind of shit.
*  Do you miss that?
*  Like, is part of driving your car and all that?
*  That's the thing from the put your headphones on for a second.
*  Yeah.
*  Take the thing out for an honest run down the coast.
*  I would start in Golden Gate Park thinking only to run a few long curves to clear my
*  head.
*  It's so good.
*  Waivering alcoholic off the wagon.
*  But in a matter of minutes, I'd be out at the beach with the sound of the engine in
*  my ears.
*  Surf booming up on the seawall and a fine empty road stretching all the way down to
*  Santa Cruz.
*  There was no helmet on those nights, no speed limit and no cooling it down around
*  the curves.
*  I love seeing the sand in the road.
*  Then into second gear, forgetting the cars and letting the beast wind out.
*  Thirty five, forty five.
*  Then into third, not worried about green or red signals.
*  Only some other werewolf.
*  Now there's no sound except the wind.
*  The needle leans down on a hundred windburned eyeballs strained to see down the
*  center line.
*  No room at all for mistakes.
*  That's when the strange music starts.
*  The edge.
*  There is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it
*  is are the ones who have gone over the others.
*  The living are those who pushed their control as far as they felt they could handle
*  it and then pulled back or slowed down.
*  But the edge is still out there.
*  That guy was fucking amazing.
*  It's great.
*  It's great.
*  It's fucking amazing.
*  What do you love about his writing and what type like fear and loathing?
*  Well, I was just reading Hell's Angels recently, actually.
*  That's the book that I go back to.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's really him when he was starting, right?
*  That was the beginning of the sort of gonzo journalism stuff because he was kind
*  of mixing in fiction with reality.
*  That's one of the things that pissed off the Hell's Angels is that he took a lot
*  of liberties with the truth to try to like paint a picture.
*  Right.
*  Which was his deal, which style later on is like exaggerating and kind of
*  romancing his own life.
*  Well, he was out of his fucking mind, out of his mind.
*  But he was also one of the most brilliant technical writers that ever was.
*  And that's what that's what's forgotten.
*  Like even people talk about Kerouac and Kerouac was like, you know, he rode on
*  the road and he was on the road and it was the Hunter S.
*  Thompson type of thing.
*  And you're like, you know, he edited on the road for seven years.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And nobody knows that because Kerouac kind of like, you know, he put forth this
*  thing of like first thought, best thought.
*  Don't edit.
*  Don't it was again, it's total horseshit.
*  Oh, wow.
*  That's why I say it goes back to writers.
*  It's a labor.
*  Yeah.
*  You sit down and you write all the fucking time.
*  My friend Ari on his laptop, he's got a little piece of paper above the keyboard
*  that says the first draft of everything is shit.
*  That's it.
*  It's true.
*  It's Hemingway.
*  Yeah.
*  Hemingway wrote that.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, his first book, Hemingway's first book was lost by his wife.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  She lost it.
*  Yeah.
*  She, she grabbed it for him and was on a train and then she went to the bathroom
*  and actually left the satchel on the seat.
*  When she came out of the bathroom, it was gone.
*  Oh my God.
*  Never to be found again.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah.
*  I know.
*  Can you imagine?
*  Oh my God.
*  All that work.
*  Did that marriage work out?
*  No, thanks.
*  I bet you did on purpose that bitch.
*  I bet you did it on purpose that bitch.
*  Yeah, man.
*  I love writing.
*  I love when someone's a really good writer because you just get these like
*  moments where you're like, yes.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Oh, that's it.
*  Yeah.
*  There's moment.
*  Hunter had a lot of those moments where you're like, God damn it.
*  That's good.
*  You have so many people who were great young.
*  And I know that there's a danger and a chaos within like the vortex within which
*  they lived, but it couldn't survive.
*  Do you know what I mean?
*  When Hunter got, he was just too fucking alcoholic.
*  Yeah.
*  And Dylan Thomas became too fucking alcoholic.
*  And it's one of those things that you go, you were literally writing things that
*  aren't possible.
*  You were putting together like wordsmithing things that are magic.
*  Magic.
*  Yeah.
*  How he was describing it's that thing, whatever it is you're doing, how do you
*  get to that place, which most people can't touch?
*  Well, you can't neglect your physical health.
*  That's the problem is that in this chase for the muse, in this dance you do with
*  the drugs and the alcohol and the wild writing and, you know, I'm sure you've
*  seen a Hunter S.
*  Thompson's, there's a thing that a reporter, he hung out with Hunter S.
*  Thompson and detailed what, what a day in the life of Hunter S.
*  Thompson is.
*  What, who was it?
*  Well, there's a, there's a band called Beardy Man and Beardy Man took me and
*  Greg Fitzsimmons reading off Hunter S.
*  Thompson's routine, his daily routine before he writes and made a song out of it.
*  It's fucking incredible.
*  See if you can find that because the routine was so insane and this was like
*  really what he would do.
*  He would wake up like two in the afternoon.
*  No, chaos.
*  Okay.
*  Full on chaos.
*  Here, let's put this, put the headphones back on.
*  Beardy Man.
*  In the 6 a.m.
*  3 p.m.
*  Rise.
*  Shiva's regal with morning papers.

*  Ponderous Thompson is ready to write.
*  6 a.m.
*  In the hot tub with champagne.
*  6 a.m.
*  In the hot tub with champagne.
*  6 a.m.
*  In the hot tub with champagne.
*  So this is like a electronic dance music song that plays in clubs sometimes.
*  Super funny.
*  When did you do that?
*  I was a long time ago.
*  Many years ago.
*  I ever lived like that.
*  No, no, I've never even done coke.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, I've never fucked around with coke.
*  I like psychedelics.
*  I like weed.
*  I like a little alcohol every now and then, but I don't fuck around with anything that's going to kill me.
*  Not interested.
*  Yeah.
*  And I'm not interested in anything that helps my ego that boosts it up.
*  Makes me fearless.
*  I'm not interested in any of that.
*  I like things that make me scared.
*  I like things that make me nervous.
*  Like that's what I was talking about early on.
*  What do you?
*  I like to feel vulnerable.
*  I like it.
*  You like to challenge yourself.
*  Yeah.
*  I think your perception and how you perceive certain things.
*  I think I like voluntary adversity, physical voluntary adversity, but also I think mental voluntary adversity.
*  And I think that's what I like about like psychedelics.
*  I think there's like a, you have to go on like a journey and you can't control it.
*  It's you.
*  It takes you somewhere.
*  And then when you're back, you realize like you ain't shit.
*  Just get all that ego stuff out of your system, relax and just be appreciative and enjoy life and try to spread as much positivity as you can.
*  That's what you're here for.
*  Do your best at everything you do.
*  That's what you're here for.
*  And how do you find yourself doing that once you're not on it?
*  The incorporation of it into your life.
*  Just remember, you know, I just, I've, it's, there's profound moments where I think, you know, change you forever.
*  And those, if you can hold onto them, some people don't hold on them, but it's a matter of intention, right?
*  It's a matter of like, what are you trying to do?
*  You're trying to be better at life.
*  Well, if you're trying to be better at life, you can hold onto it.
*  If you're not, if you're just trying to like be the man or, you know, get all the accolades or, you know, win a fucking Grammy or whatever you're trying to do.
*  Like if that's your real goal, like you're going to get lost because it's a shitty goal.
*  How old were you when you took a hallucinative for the first time?
*  30.
*  I was 13.
*  Whoa, so that's a little too early.
*  I wouldn't recommend that.
*  I wouldn't recommend it either, but it changed my life.
*  And I had, by the way, I took it twice in a 24 hour period.
*  So I took it 13, had the greatest trip ever, like still affected by it.
*  And then I took it again that night and went to hell.
*  Oh no.
*  I don't know.
*  You got cocky.
*  No.
*  Psychedelics want to bring you down a notch.
*  It just did what it did.
*  It did.
*  It did.
*  And I truly believe that psychedelics, I don't do psychedelics anymore, but I think I did.
*  But I do breath work.
*  I do shit like that.
*  And you go, can you get there?
*  And I go, yeah, I've had some of the most amazing hallucinations I've ever had.
*  Most profound hallucinations I've ever had.
*  Holotropic breathing, breath work with Laird going off.
*  And if you do it long enough, you just reach a place.
*  Or if you're in a sauna at 240 degrees for an hour doing breath work, you're going to go places.
*  Yeah.
*  No doubt.
*  Sensory deprivation tank.
*  You don't need anything.
*  You don't need anything.
*  You trip balls.
*  If they could give you in a pill form what the experience you get from a sensory deprivation tank, it would be a very popular drug.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's completely safe.
*  And a productive drug.
*  Yes.
*  Very productive.
*  So there's sensory, you say the sensory deprivation tank, but I just saw, you can see it online or whatever, where people literally put a thing.
*  They go into a room and there's silence.
*  It's not like a, you know, where they don't talk, a meditation retreat or whatever.
*  But they literally go into a room by themselves.
*  They don't see anybody else.
*  They put a thick mask on and they're in for four days.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  Have you seen that?
*  I have heard of people doing stuff like that.
*  Yeah.
*  What about that?
*  Well, I think being alone with your thoughts is uncomfortable for people.
*  And I think a lot of people avoid that.
*  Avoid really thinking and you're forced to really think, you know, when you're in those sort of situations, you're forced to be alone with your thoughts.
*  You know, scary.
*  But we're always distracted.
*  We're distracted by people and devices and input and news and social media.
*  And there's like constantly stuff coming in.
*  And sometimes you don't like, how do I feel about everything?
*  Like, what do I even know?
*  Have I ever really considered things?
*  Like you need time alone.
*  You need time to think, you know, that's what I really like about.
*  But it's why I work out by myself.
*  That's why I like to work up by yourself.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Unless I'm doing...
*  You don't like having a trainer.
*  I mean, I've had a lot of trainers.
*  I appreciate them for technical advice and stuff like that.
*  But this is a meditative aspect of working out by myself that I think is very important.
*  It's also discipline.
*  Like, I don't know.
*  It's easy to go somewhere and the guy tells you, OK, 10 reps.
*  But I write my own workouts out.
*  Based on that day.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I know what I want to do.
*  I, you know, I'm pretty good at it.
*  So it's funny.
*  I haven't heard many people say that, but I, I, I feel, and it's not just some bullshit like affectation, rebellious thing.
*  When I'm with it and I appreciate trainers too, and I've had worked with some great trainers, but they make me want to do less.
*  Why?
*  You know, they go, do 10.
*  And I go, but why?
*  I'm one of those assholes.
*  But I will actually push myself.
*  If say 12, just for random word, a random number, 12 is my limit.
*  I'm good at pushing myself to 15 or Jeff Cavallari.
*  Do you know who that is?
*  No.
*  Athlean X.
*  Oh yeah, you ever heard of that guy?
*  Yeah.
*  Super smart guy.
*  Yeah.
*  And we would go back and forth and I'd be like, look, if I'm in, if I'm, you know, if I'm at my last three reps, why do we have to rest for two minutes?
*  Like who said that?
*  Who made that up?
*  Is it really a recovery thing?
*  Two minutes before you can go back into 12 more reps.
*  What if we just rest 30 seconds and then you're right back into that thing almost immediately.
*  And those are the things that are tearing the tissues and growing the muscle and all that kind of stuff.
*  So just experimenting with it all.
*  Again, this all goes back down to what we watched.
*  Like, what are we doing to just live a little more vividly?
*  How are we pushing ourselves?
*  How are we changing our perception?
*  How are we pushing our perception?
*  Well, it depends on what you're trying to do, right?
*  If you're just trying to get like conditioned, yeah, give yourself the minimal amount of rest and do it for as long as possible.
*  And then take time off afterwards for your body to heal and then get back after it.
*  It's just a base.
*  But it depends on what you're trying to do.
*  If you're trying to get strong, I always recommend taking out like long, long periods of time in between sets.
*  I take like five minutes, maybe even more in between sets to come back in at your strongest.
*  Yeah, but I have your body workouts.
*  My workouts like two hours, sometimes two and a half hours because I have these long breaks in between.
*  But because of that, it's you know, Pablo Tatsulini is no, he's one of the godfathers of kettlebells.
*  He's one of the first people that introduced kettlebells to America from Russia.
*  And their their philosophy, his strong first philosophy is that strength is a skill and you don't work on a skill when you're tired.
*  So it's all about how many repetitions you do.
*  And that's what builds strength.
*  So it doesn't mean you have to do 10 in a row, like, say, if 10 is your max.
*  So if you pick up a weight and you could do 10 cleans and presses and on the 10th one, you're like,
*  his philosophy is do five, do five, wait a long time, do another five.
*  So you've got the 10 in, but you've got the 10 with perfect form.
*  And then you're still getting the same amount of repetitions, but you're not breaking yourself down to the point where you might get hurt or where you're doing it incorrectly or form.
*  So that's how I talked. I talked to me, too.
*  I talked to my wife a lot about that, my wife would say, because I'm all about form.
*  Yes. Because otherwise you just get hurt and you get hurt.
*  And point. Yeah, I rarely get hurt from lifting weights.
*  And I've ever gotten hurt in jujitsu.
*  Oh, yeah. A lot.
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
*  I have surgeries and fucking bulging discs and torn this and torn that.
*  Yeah, you have to.
*  It's a sport where you're trying to kill each other.
*  You're trying to get really good at killing people with your body.
*  So other people are doing that to you.
*  I had sciatica for a year and a half.
*  We. Bad sciatica.
*  Nine millimeters slip between S, no, L5 and S1.
*  How'd you get rid of it?
*  And they wanted to do surgery.
*  And I had had surgery when I was really young
*  because I had a slip disc between C5 and C6, and they took out part of my hip
*  and they went in through my neck.
*  They moved everything over and they replaced my my disc with part of my hip.
*  Back when they used to do that, they used to replace your disc with part of your hip.
*  Yeah, they would chisel out a part of your head.
*  A bone. Yeah.
*  And that's what your disc was now.
*  A piece of bones now.
*  That doesn't even make sense.
*  You just because they be spongy.
*  I know. I don't understand why they put a piece of bone in there.
*  Yeah, and it worked. It actually worked.
*  Yeah. Dr. Delamorder. I never forget his name. Jesus.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Now, yeah.
*  And then they use cadaver bone for a while.
*  And now they use what?
*  Well, it depends. There's artificial discs.
*  I know a couple of people that have artificial discs.
*  And it worked. Yeah.
*  My friend Eddie got it done in his lower back.
*  He was basically bone on bone, constant inflammation.
*  So you got a titanium articulating disc in his back.
*  What is this?
*  Surgeon may take a small piece of bone from the hip called an autograft
*  to use in a neck surgery called interior cervical disectomy and fusion.
*  The bone is placed between the space
*  between the vertebrae to stimulate bone healing and promote fusion.
*  Oh, so you got your neck fused.
*  Yeah, they call it a Brolin graft.
*  Oh, really? No.
*  Yeah. Hey.
*  Hey. Wow.
*  So yeah, that's that's different.
*  That's you got your hip, your neck fused. Fused.
*  Yeah, which they probably don't even do fusion. They do.
*  They say if it's a if it's a massive break or something like that,
*  maybe I don't recommend it.
*  There's other ways you can heal bulging discs.
*  And one of them is there's a process called Regenekin.
*  And Regenekin is I had that done in L.A. in Santa Monica.
*  They used to do it in Germany.
*  You have to go to Germany to do it.
*  And like Kobe Bryant went over there and Peyton Manning went over there.
*  And what they do is they take your blood out.
*  It's like platelet rich plasma.
*  It's a more advanced.
*  It's more advanced version of it.
*  And they spin your blood in the centrifuge and they add some stuff to it.
*  And it turns it into like one of the most potent anti-inflammatories.
*  And then what they do is you lie down there and they inject it in your back.
*  They have like these little needles.
*  I think there's an Instagram post of me getting it done on my lower back.
*  Did you have a slip disc in your lower back?
*  Bulging. You know, it's it's essentially a bulging disc, but it can go back.
*  Bulging disc can go back.
*  But that was my experience.
*  You also have to have traction like decompression.
*  So there's a bunch. There it is.
*  So that's my back.
*  I had that done.
*  So they take that and they stick all that shit.
*  But all that. And they drill that, don't they?
*  They just put holes.
*  No, it's just needles.
*  I know it's needles, but it's not like acupuncture.
*  They actually drill that.
*  Then they put that needle in, don't they?
*  No, no, they just shove that needle in place.
*  It's just like a syringe on each side of your spinal column.
*  Yeah, it's like a syringe.
*  And then inside the syringe, they pump in the Regenekine stuff.
*  And then it it fills your those those areas up with this platelet
*  rich plasma that's been enhanced and it just heals everything.
*  And did you feel like it helped? Oh, yeah, absolutely.
*  It helped my neck so much.
*  My neck was so fucked.
*  My neck was so fucked, I was getting numb fingers and pain in my elbow.
*  I have that now. Do you really?
*  Yeah. You should go go to that place.
*  And when I ride motorcycles also,
*  I have my hands up like I mean, I have shoulder issues,
*  but I have a that slip disc was a nine millimeter slip.
*  Why not do this? Why this?
*  Because that looks cooler.
*  Does it? Not to me.
*  It looks super cool when you're doing it right.
*  This looks retarded. This looks good.
*  This looks like you could put it up super high.
*  You can move it up super high.
*  This is that looks retarded turn.
*  Yeah. Like how you turn like that?
*  You're not going to do a good job.
*  You look like a gorilla. This is better.
*  This is better. What about that?
*  This is better. What about this?
*  Well, Ducatis. I mean, that's like you're down like that's right.
*  That's when I finally crashed was a Ducati.
*  Oh, really? You went crazy.
*  No, I didn't go crazy. I didn't do anything differently.
*  With parley's, you go slower. Right. Right.
*  It's about it's loud. So you know you're there.
*  Thank you. That's a big one. It's huge.
*  They have electric bikes. I'm like, do you want to die?
*  They're fast. They're so fast.
*  But do you want to die?
*  They make no sound. Nobody can hear you.
*  Nobody can hear you. If I'm riding in a grid of 16 guys.
*  Because everybody thinks Hell's Angels.
*  I go, there's nothing about it that's trying to emulate Hell's Angels,
*  Mongols, any of that, you know, one percenter thing.
*  But when you hear that rumble coming down the road,
*  you can't wait to get the fuck out of the way.
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
*  And that helps. That's true.
*  That definitely helps you stay alive. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Loud pipes save lives. I've heard that many times.
*  So to finish that thought, what I did was is I went to I started
*  instead of resting, which is what doctors normally say, they say,
*  do surgery, do surgery, rest, sleep, see if that helps.
*  If it doesn't help, do surgery.
*  And I did the opposite, which later, you know, Laird was like,
*  anytime you get hurt, Laird will be like movement, movement, movement, movement.
*  But this was before all that.
*  But I started working out and it got worse and it got worse and worse.
*  But I continued to work out and I started running
*  and I started doing pistol squats and all this kind of shit.
*  And then one day it was gone and I never came back. Really?
*  Never came back.
*  So he just beat it out of you. I beat it out of me. Wow. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Movement is everything.
*  You need circulation and we need blood in there, which is why they do PRP,
*  which is why they do stem cell work or whatever. Yeah.
*  And if you're just sitting there, the problem is you're also going to
*  your body's going to atrophy.
*  You're going to lose strength.
*  And then it's going to make whatever injured that area in the first place.
*  That was always promoted by doctors.
*  Why would that always be promoted by doctors?
*  Again, whether it's politicians or whether it's doctors or whether it's
*  they're telling you this is you got to eat from the four food groups, man.
*  You're going to die otherwise.
*  Well, you know, that there's a lot to that stuff.
*  But the the the four group four food group shit is a lot of people
*  just not knowing what the fuck they're talking about.
*  That's what I mean.
*  And also there's a different perception back then of like what was healthy
*  versus now. But it's also a lot of these doctors, they're not athletes
*  and they don't really understand like what's possible with the body.
*  They just know how to fix things when they break.
*  And then for the average person, they say just rest
*  because the average person is not going to fucking do what you're doing anyway.
*  So it's like, why? Why tell them like what you really need to do is movement,
*  constant movement and just beat that injury into submission.
*  That's right. And no one's going to tell you that.
*  How do I feel better? Lose some weight. Yeah.
*  Like, go do that uncomfortable thing.
*  Start walking, start slow, maybe jog a little bit, maybe lift a little something.
*  That's why when you see those videos of these guys that just for whatever
*  is in their personality, they've had fucking enough.
*  They're 400 pounds and they go, that's it.
*  Uh huh. Buck stops here.
*  Yeah. I'm going to start doing my shit.
*  Yeah. They hit rock bottom. They hit rock bottom. Yeah.
*  And then you see this again, what we were talking about before, incentive
*  where they just go, I don't give a shit.
*  Well, it's not the same with everything.
*  Like, isn't that how you quit drinking?
*  You just hit rock bottom. Just about to say that. Yeah.
*  Yeah. But you don't.
*  I don't. I hit rock bottom when I was 15, you know, shooting coke at 15.
*  So, yeah, the thing that you didn't want to try.
*  I didn't want to try. But that was that group.
*  That's why so many of those guys died. Yeah. You know what I mean?
*  So when I look at Hunter S Thompson, who I love as a writer,
*  when I look at Dylan Thomas, who I love as a writer and all these guys
*  that had this kind of amazing life and I feel too parallel.
*  I had an amazing life, except nobody cared about mine.
*  People really cared about theirs.
*  I was just Josh that you wanted to stay the fuck away from.
*  Well, like that motherfucker is great to spend like an hour with.
*  And once it hits 10 o'clock, the moon comes out and the clouds part,
*  you don't want to be anywhere around.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Then you get to that point where you go, when did Hunter S Thompson,
*  when did these guys just become like
*  some kind of clown mask of themselves? Right.
*  Do you know what I mean?
*  Well, in the end, Hunter was definitely that.
*  You ever see when Hunter was on Conan O'Brien's show? No.
*  It was horrible.
*  He could barely talk.
*  You barely can understand him.
*  His everything is a mumbling.
*  Was every it was real weird.
*  And, you know, he was he got a gunfight with his fucking neighbors.
*  He's like shooting at his neighbors.
*  That's what I mean.
*  Yes. At what point does it turn on drunk?
*  But it wasn't just that his body was like rapidly deteriorating.
*  He had a hip replacement surgery and he was only 60.
*  That's not old. No, no, not that old.
*  That's young. That old for.
*  How old are you?
*  Fifty seven. I'm 56.
*  Yeah. Like my mom died at 55.
*  The whole thing this book became was my mom dying at 55.
*  And me thinking back then, she lived a nice long life.
*  Isn't that crazy? It's fucking crazy.
*  And it turned out that I was 55 when I wrote the book, which I'd never even
*  the book kind of dictated itself.
*  And then I went, holy fuck, I'm 55.
*  Wow. I'm super young.
*  Fucking super young.
*  Like this, I have some joint issues, but I'm young.
*  Right. For the most part. For the most part.
*  Yeah. You're physically healthy. You're not falling apart.
*  You just have a few issues.
*  Yeah. Which is just wear and tear of life.
*  That's it. Yeah.
*  But there's some people that if you don't take care of yourself
*  and you don't eat well, and there's also a lot of other factors, genetic factors.
*  But you could fall apart pretty quick.
*  But if you're a guy like Hunter that's doing coke and drinking every night,
*  you can't do that. No, you can't.
*  It just won't. And the writing was bad.
*  Like his writing, the only time he wrote anything good in later years was 2001.
*  Right after 9-11. Right after 9-11, he wrote this great piece.
*  I want to say it was like for Sports Illustrated.
*  It was I forget who he wrote it for, but he wrote this really great piece
*  talking about what happens next after the Twin Towers fall.
*  It's like he wrote this thing about waking up in the morning,
*  seeing the Twin Towers fall and then realizing what's ahead for us.
*  Right. It was very pressing.
*  It was very good. It was very it was.
*  Was it accurate? Yeah.
*  Now that it's been. It was dead on.
*  It was dead on. And it was Vintage Hunter.
*  It's like he tapped back into it again.
*  It's on ESPN. ESPN. That's it.
*  ESPN. This is the article.
*  Yeah, this is the article.
*  Would you send me this article if it's an article article?
*  Yeah, I'll send it to you. I would love that.
*  Yeah. But this is, you know, this is the whole thing.
*  I mean, what's so great is when you go, I mean, this is kind of
*  popping all over the place.
*  But when you go back and you look at all the politicians, whatever side
*  you know, whatever whatever red, blue they lean toward, it didn't matter
*  because Hunter was there kind of looking for something different.
*  And it wasn't all about when it came down.
*  They all describe Hunter as this like crazy.
*  It was so much fun to hang out with him.
*  But there was never a lack of he was super intelligent.
*  Yes. And wanted the best for everybody.
*  Wanted he wanted a patriot.
*  It was a true patriot. Yeah.
*  Well, did you ever read Fear and Loathing on the campaign trail?
*  Yeah, that's one of the more interesting pieces because you got this guy
*  who's following around the campaign trail and he knows he's only in it
*  for this one time. So he's not like any of these other reporters.
*  He's just writing a book. Yeah.
*  We said that people are. Yeah, exactly.
*  And not only that, you can't because he's going to write a book.
*  Like he's writing a book.
*  You can't fire what you like.
*  Yeah. What do you like it or not? He's writing that book.
*  But, you know, he's dropping acid.
*  He's talking these guys into drinking.
*  Like he's taking all these like fucking nerdy political reporters.
*  And he's introducing them to a perspective that they they're not aware of.
*  They don't know anybody like that.
*  And the book is fucking incredible.
*  But when you see Gonzo, when you see it's funny how much we're talking about.
*  But when you see Gonzo, I don't know if it was in Gonzo or another documentary.
*  You see how they're affected by it.
*  You see a humanity in them because of him that you don't normally get to see.
*  Right. Don't you agree?
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  He made you question a lot of things. Yeah.
*  And when people question things, they're like, what am I doing?
*  Like, yeah, why am I here? What is my purpose?
*  Or did I have a purpose when I was young and I just fell into this political status quo?
*  And he even was questioning, like in the documentary, he was like,
*  I don't even know what people want anymore.
*  They want Hunter S. Thompson or they want Gonzo.
*  Like, that's not even me anymore.
*  It's like I'm a prisoner of this thing that I've created.
*  And that's that's the thing that happens to people where they they develop
*  this sort of image and persona. Yeah.
*  And then you feel like you're trapped by it.
*  Yeah. You people have expectations when they meet you.
*  Kennison talked about that.
*  Did you know, Kenison? No, unfortunately.
*  Did you? No, shit.
*  Yeah. And not because of drugs, just because I was around.
*  What year was this? When did he die?
*  A 90 ish to 92 maybe.
*  I was in New York, so it had to be pre 94.
*  Probably 90. Somewhere around then.
*  I would say 90. I knew him.
*  90, 91. It was through a friend that I met him and then he liked me.
*  Wow. And sweet, incredibly sweet guy.
*  He was a motherfucker, dude. Mother.
*  We just got a this guy does bottle cap art.
*  Go to my Instagram, Jamie, and see the photo.
*  This guy just made this insane bottle cap art piece of Kenison
*  for my comedy club. And we put it up last night.
*  Is he a hero of yours? Oh, yeah.
*  He was one of the first. There it is.
*  Oh, that's all bottle caps.
*  Oh, no shit. Yeah.
*  Those are bottle caps. If you see them.
*  Man. Yeah.
*  That's like in prison when they use
*  they use cigarette packs and do Patricia Arquette gave me a piece of art
*  with a bunch of cigarette packs. Oh, really?
*  Yeah, they make frames. That was it.
*  Oh, wow. Same kind of this guy.
*  His name is Jam bottle cap art.
*  J.M. Bottle cap art.
*  He does a bunch of different pieces of bottle cap art.
*  Yeah, he's really good.
*  It's really, really cool stuff.
*  You need my picture outside. I saw all your mug shots.
*  Your mug shot. I'd love to have a mug shot of you.
*  I'll send you. Is it good?
*  How fucked up do you look?
*  Pretty fucked up.
*  I got a smile on my face when somebody smiles during a mug shot.
*  I always find that really funny.
*  So when you met Kinnison, was it at a show? Was it just?
*  No. Oh, it might have been the comedy club.
*  I'd only been a comedy star. Sorry. Comedy store.
*  He was out of there by then.
*  He was out of there by 90.
*  Well, what's the one down the road by where Greenblatt's used to be?
*  Laughatory. Yeah. Yeah.
*  You like those? I do. Very much.
*  The Laugh Factory. The Laugh Factory.
*  It might have been that.
*  He got kicked out of the comedy store, I think, in like 87 or 88.
*  Then it wasn't there.
*  Yeah, it's probably the Laugh Factory.
*  But that's not where I met him. I met him at a house.
*  OK. I met him at a house and I never went to a lot of those parties.
*  I was just not part of that. Sam wasn't invited.
*  But I but I met him and he just he was really sweet, man.
*  He would like mellow out. It wasn't like a thing.
*  It wasn't an act all the time. Right.
*  You know, he was a prisoner to that thing that he became. For sure.
*  Yeah. His brother wrote a great book. It's called Brother Sam.
*  It's really, really good book describing like the ascent of his career
*  and how it fucked him up and what happened to him.
*  And what do you think it was?
*  I mean, was drugs, drugs and partying and just stratospheric.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Wasn't it instantaneous for him? Pretty quick.
*  So in 1986, he's on Roddy Dangerfield's Young Comedians special.
*  And then he does an insane
*  to this day holds up HBO Hour.
*  And then those two things and then an album that he made called Louder than Hell.
*  And those those things are the best things he ever does.
*  Everything after that becomes like a significant drop off.
*  And in the end, he was basically a caricature of who he used to be.
*  Yeah, a caricature of himself. Exactly.
*  And he just was captured.
*  But it's also imprisoned.
*  There wasn't anybody to tell you how to do it back then.
*  There was only a few like massively famous comedians back then.
*  There wasn't a lot of us.
*  It wasn't it wasn't like today.
*  Today, there's like a giant community of comedians.
*  We all talk to each other and figure it out together.
*  And everybody's just about making better stuff.
*  It's not about like getting hugely famous.
*  The ones that just want to get hugely famous, they're all mentally ill.
*  And usually their their career drops off.
*  Their comedy starts to suck.
*  They're trying to do the wrong thing.
*  So in Kinnison in the beginning, he just wanted to be the best he could be.
*  He just wanted to be really fucking good at comedy.
*  And he coming from this, you know, tent preacher.
*  So he's like this revival tent preacher.
*  And then he gets in a standup comedy and he has this charisma
*  and this ability to deliver that's so different than everybody else.
*  And he's this short fat guy.
*  So when he talks about being married and living in hell,
*  kind of like empathize with like this fucking guy's amazing and revolutionized
*  comedy, changed comedy.
*  He was the first guy that I ever saw that made me think I could do comedy.
*  Because before then, I loved comedy.
*  I always loved standup, but I loved it because it was funny.
*  I would just like to watch Jerry Seinfeld on TV.
*  Oh, these guys are so funny.
*  Funny because you're so different than he is.
*  And yet he was the one that you paralleled with that like liberated you.
*  Yeah. Well, he was wild.
*  That was the thing. I never felt like I fit in.
*  I always felt like I didn't want to be around polite people.
*  I didn't want like, you know, if a girl wanted me to go over
*  her house and have dinner with her parents, I was like, oh, Jesus, I'm fine.
*  I think I'm fucking crazy.
*  But I was a kickboxer.
*  You know, I was a kid who had I went from, you know, when I was 15 years old,
*  I got like deeply involved in martial arts.
*  My entire social life up until like 21, 22,
*  was just traveling around the country fighting.
*  And so my I was feral.
*  My my mindset was just I just didn't fit in.
*  I couldn't wear a suit jacket and pretend to be the guy.
*  Did you ever notice? I wasn't that guy.
*  Hello, sir. It's great to meet you.
*  Things that I thought were funny, other people would think were fucked up.
*  But my fucked up friends would think were funny.
*  And those are the ones who talked me into doing stand up.
*  But they were equally fucked up.
*  Did you start stand up back then?
*  Boston in 88 in 88. Yeah.
*  Yeah. And and I went to see Kenison in 89.
*  I got to see him live in 89.
*  I got to see him three times.
*  One time when I was working, I was working at Greatwood Center
*  for the Performing Arts and he was performing there.
*  And I got to see him live. I was a security guard.
*  It was this place in Mansfield.
*  Yeah. This the whole Taekwondo team that I was a part of.
*  Is that what you did? Yeah.
*  That's what I used to compete in.
*  Oh, no kidding. Yeah. Where did you compete out of?
*  Jun Chung. Where was that?
*  L.A. OK. Taekwondo.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I fought in L.A.
*  When I lived in Boston, I fought in Anaheim in the Nationals.
*  Right on. I traveled all over the country competing.
*  That's all I did.
*  And one of the guys who work with us,
*  one of the guys who trained with us, got a job as a security guard.
*  And the guy was like, hey, do you know any more guys who know how to fight?
*  Like, we need more guys like that to work for us.
*  They just hired a bunch of us. Right.
*  And so we got to see all these crazy concerts.
*  I got to see Bon Jovi.
*  I got to see Bill Cosby, which was kind of crazy.
*  Yeah. I saw Rodney Dangerfield.
*  And Rodney Dangerfield was there was this backstage area
*  and Rodney Dangerfield was naked with a bathrobe on.
*  And that's how he would go on stage.
*  And the end of his career, like Rodney would go.
*  And by the way, murdered.
*  I mean, I was fucking had people on the floor laughing.
*  He was probably I don't know how old he was in 89, but he was old.
*  And this fucking guy was just on stage with a bathrobe on naked
*  killing a giant hog, like hanging out of his fucking pants.
*  And he was just just hanging out, smoking pot.
*  And then he would go on stage with a bathrobe on and just kill.
*  But because he wanted to be comfortable.
*  How did other how did other comedians feel about him?
*  Oh, they loved them. They loved everybody.
*  Everybody loved Rodney.
*  Rodney was one most universally loved comedians because he helped other comedians.
*  Yeah. Like Rodney Dangerfield.
*  He did these things, the Rodney Dangerfield specials like Rodney and Friends.
*  And so he would have he introduced the world to Dice Clay, Sam Kinnison, Robert Schimel,
*  Lenny Clark, Dom Iara, like some of the greats.
*  And they all came out of his Rodney Dangerfield and Friends specials.
*  There were some of the greatest specials ever.
*  Because he would have all these guys that he thought were worth seeing.
*  And he would put them out there to the world.
*  And they all became superstars.
*  I mean, that's how Sam Kinnison launched.
*  He launched from Rodford Rodney.
*  And so Bill Hicks, a lot of people launched from Rodney.
*  And so everybody loved Rodney.
*  He was just loved.
*  I know he's your buddy.
*  And I, you know, because comedians, I used to listen.
*  I used to have six albums and one was a bloody red vinyl.
*  Remember the red albums?
*  OK, sure. Yeah, yeah.
*  And it was sick. And I don't know where I got them.
*  I think I got them from like a flea market or something, but they were Lenny Bruce.
*  Oh, yeah. And that was the beginning.
*  He was the first. He was the first.
*  He was the first real modern standup comedian.
*  Everybody else just told jokes like two guys walking over bar.
*  Like that kind of shit.
*  He was the first guy that was like, why do we do this?
*  And why is that? Yeah.
*  What is where he questioned it? Yeah.
*  Questioned authority.
*  And people would come to see him because in the 60s,
*  everybody was so confused as to how to think like, what?
*  Yeah. What are we doing?
*  And this guy was like, how do we treat each other?
*  And then he'd point people out and he'd go even kike.
*  There's a Mick.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Go right, right, right, right, right.
*  At the most tense time.
*  And then he'd bring it around.
*  And that's why it reminds me of Chappelle.
*  Because Chappelle would get so seemingly or ostensibly inappropriate.
*  And then somehow bring it around.
*  And you go fucking.
*  Dave's a master master.
*  And he's a real artist.
*  That's a guy like, you know, I talk about like people that only start
*  thinking about money. Yeah, that's not him.
*  That dude lives in fucking Springfield, Ohio.
*  And just travels around and just does a lot of shows for no money.
*  He does a lot of shows.
*  He just shows up and performs.
*  One time I was in Denver and I get off stage.
*  It's first show, our second show Friday night.
*  So it's 10 o'clock show shows over.
*  I get off stage. I go to the green room.
*  Dave's there. I go, Dave, what are you doing here, man?
*  It was all about I come out and visit you.
*  Just hops on a fucking private jet and flies to Denver
*  because he knew I was there.
*  Didn't even tell me. Just shows up.
*  And then I go, do you want to go on stage?
*  He goes, oh, should I go? Fuck. Yeah.
*  So I ran out while the people were leaving.
*  The show was already over. I go, oh, oh, oh, oh.
*  Tell everybody on the stairs, come back.
*  Dave Chappelle's here.
*  So they all come back in and sit down again.
*  And he does like 45 minutes.
*  And it was right around when Trump was doing it, when he got caught
*  saying, grab him by the pussy.
*  So like 10 minutes of a grab him by the pussy.
*  It was fucking genius.
*  It was so good. Off the top of his head, though.
*  Oh, no. He I mean, I don't know exactly how.
*  How designed it is material.
*  I think what Dave does is spends a lot of time thinking
*  and listening to music and coming up with ideas.
*  And he writes some stuff down.
*  But a lot of what he does is just performs constantly.
*  He's constantly on stage working.
*  You said it earlier, artist.
*  He's a real artist.
*  That's the difference between somebody who's just good at what they do
*  and somebody who is an innate artist.
*  He's a real artist. He's a hero.
*  He gets he's a hero of mine, too. He's a good friend.
*  But he gets these giant deals with Netflix where he makes a lot of money,
*  which is great.
*  But he doesn't do it for money.
*  He's doing it.
*  No, but what you can tell is he gets these like, oh, he turned down
*  50 million dollars and went crazy, moved to Ohio or whatever
*  the fucking story is that you want to make up.
*  But then he comes back.
*  He makes these 20 million dollar deals with Netflix.
*  But it's never in place of his agenda.
*  No, it's all about the art.
*  It's all about this wins.
*  This wins. This is the part why he left his show because they were twisting it.
*  Of course.
*  I know why he left his show, because I've been in that position where you go.
*  This is turning into some corporate version of what you like.
*  You love what I do.
*  Now, you can't wait to put your fingerprint on it.
*  Exactly. That's it.
*  That's exactly what you can take.
*  So you can go, you know, that was me.
*  And he gave up 50 million when no one was giving nobody would
*  quit doing comedy for 10 years.
*  And you know what he would do?
*  He would occasionally show up in a park with like a fucking speaker
*  and just show up and do stand up.
*  Yes, he did. He did in Seattle.
*  I know he did in Seattle because a friend of mine was at the show.
*  He shows up. He goes, Dave Chappelle just shows up in this fucking park.
*  He gets a speaker with a microphone and he just starts talking.
*  And people just gather around.
*  He was just doing these like shows, these impromptu shows.
*  He would show up in a bar.
*  Can I go on stage?
*  And they would go, OK.
*  And he would just knowing in his mind that he would eventually come back.
*  No, that was just the present moment.
*  I think this is what I want to do is just being an artist
*  for the pure sake of being an artist.
*  So he had the money that he did make off Chappelle show.
*  And he decided to like live frugally and take that money.
*  And he didn't do anything for money for like 10 fucking years.
*  He just raised his and then he started coming back.
*  And then we started coming back.
*  I remember I'm coming around the comedy store again.
*  And we had some conversations about it.
*  And he just, you know, he just decided to start doing comedy again.
*  And then you see people getting canceled now and it's devastating to them.
*  And yet that's what that was.
*  He just did it himself. Right.
*  He canceled himself. Yeah.
*  And the greatest sketch show of all time, of all time.
*  Yeah. And it only did two seasons.
*  It's still the greatest.
*  That's not something that you see very often.
*  It's somebody who just fucking can't help but beat to their own drum. Right.
*  But the art wins. Right.
*  The art wins. You know what I mean?
*  Well, it's obviously when you see him, he's so good.
*  He's not malicious.
*  He seems there are moments where you think he's malicious.
*  And again, he brings it around.
*  Well, that malicious is just to heighten the humor.
*  It all just like brings it in.
*  It also accentuates like some thoughts that you might have about whatever he's
*  talking about. But it's what everybody's thinking.
*  Yeah. It's so fucking terrified to say that's why everybody's thinking.
*  Me. Yeah, I'm watching it and I'm the inappropriate guy, you know,
*  and my dad goes, how the fuck do you say what you say?
*  And I don't understand. I go, you know,
*  I said, honestly, do you want to know?
*  Because I'm not ultimately mean.
*  I don't want I don't want to fucking hurt.
*  I don't want people to feel less than I do. Right.
*  But I watch Chappelle, even me.
*  I'm like, oh, fuck.
*  Wow. Yeah. He watched that line.
*  He gets out there and walks that line, but he dances around it
*  and he makes it beautiful comedy.
*  He did it so much because without him, we're all fucked.
*  And he's the way to find out if a comedian's a cunt.
*  Like if a comedian doesn't like Chappelle, they start shitting on Chappelle.
*  Like, OK, then you know, he's a cunt.
*  Piece of shit. You're a piece of shit.
*  You're just a garbage human. Have you ever met anybody like that?
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of these. He's not a real comedian.
*  There's a lot of an asshole.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of like comedy activist comedians.
*  And what they are is really not talented.
*  So they've glommed on to this idea of like being like socially conscious.
*  And that's more important than the humor itself.
*  But nobody wants to hear you preach.
*  Nobody nobody thinks that your opinion is better than theirs.
*  This is what I always say.
*  Like if you go on stage, you have an opinion like other people have an opinion, too.
*  Like if you go on stage and say, you know, I think Kamala Harris
*  would be the greatest president of all time.
*  A lot of people are like, well, I don't agree.
*  But you have to have a way to make it funny so that they laugh.
*  The people that disagree with you laugh.
*  I don't even think this guy's correct.
*  Well, goddamn, that's funny.
*  And that's the way you can introduce an idea into someone's head
*  that maybe would never accept that idea. It was just opinions.
*  So someone's on stage and they're just saying opinions.
*  Like you could you could disagree with that opinion.
*  It'll frustrate you. And you can't talk.
*  You know, but if that guy can take that opinion
*  and that perspective and make it funny, you're forced to acknowledge that he has a point.
*  Yeah, like there's something in there like I agree with that.
*  But fucker. God damn, that was good. God damn, that was good.
*  And that's the liberates.
*  Yes, that's the real Chappelle art.
*  That's I mean, not that we'll stay on this forever, but remember Eddie Murphy
*  when he did what not the first not raw, but delirious.
*  Delirious. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
*  Well, he was a fucking powerhouse power to this day.
*  That is the guy that I just wish I was friends.
*  I was friends with his brother, Charlie. Yeah.
*  But I wish that guy I wish he would come back.
*  You know, I know he got like some weird stuff where he got arrested
*  with transsexuals in his car and so on.
*  Whatever. So did other people.
*  Whatever. They came.
*  He's just too good. He's too good.
*  He's too good. Do you ever see when he gave a speech, he got like,
*  I think it was like one of those Mark Twain awards or something like that.
*  And he did stand up like where he has to stand up in forever.
*  But he was talking about Bill Cosby having to give his awards back. And.
*  Because, you know, he does an amazing Bill Cosby.
*  Yeah, no, I remember.
*  And so he he did stand up and it was as sharp as ever.
*  And like, God damn, this guy came back and it was just off the cuff.
*  It was something that he prepared.
*  No, I'm sure he prepared, but nobody really knew he was going to do it.
*  Right. He knew he was going to give a speech. Right.
*  And his speech was essentially stand up with, you know, his acceptance speech.
*  Like 20 minutes or 15 minutes. Yeah.
*  And it was fucking great.
*  And there was all these rumors that he was going to start doing it again.
*  I remember Charlie told me that Dave was thinking about doing it again
*  or that Eddie was thinking about doing it again, but he never did it.
*  He never did it. Never.
*  I think it's just too heavy. We need comedians.
*  I mean, that's like the theme of this whole thing is whether you're talking
*  about Hunter, whether you're talking about this.
*  It's just too bad that they self-destruct, whether it be from drugs
*  or fame or whatever.
*  And you know what I mean? It's hard, man.
*  It's really hard to maintain.
*  And then once you make it, there's these weird pressures.
*  But it breaks up the status quo of this contraction, especially that we're feeling.
*  I know that's why people move to Austin.
*  They're like, I'm fucking sick of being told to think a certain way.
*  Well, that's why comedy in Austin works so well,
*  because we all moved here at the same time.
*  We all moved here in 2020.
*  Like I was I was here because, well, Ron White moved here first.
*  And Ron White is a dear friend of mine, and he moved here before the pandemic.
*  And Ron was like, I don't want to live in L.A. anymore.
*  I fucking love it here.
*  There's no traffic. Food's great. Fucking people are nice.
*  I can travel. I fly.
*  I'm in the center of the country. I fly anywhere real quick.
*  And I was like, damn, could I live in Texas?
*  Like, I don't know about that.
*  And then Covid came and right away, like my wife was kind of
*  interested a little bit.
*  But then when the riots started happening in L.A., then she got really scared.
*  She got very like it's a lot of like home invasions.
*  It was a lot of crazy shit that was happening.
*  Where is she from originally?
*  She was from Colorado. OK.
*  And so not in L.A. born. No, no, no.
*  And so she lived in L.A. with me for a while.
*  And we were happy.
*  You know, we lived in Bell Canyon, which was like outside of L.A.
*  It's nice, peaceful, had a little land, still in Hawks and shit.
*  Yeah. Well, for me, it was OK.
*  Because I had quiet where I lived and then I could drive into the comedy store.
*  And I loved it. But then when they shut the comedy store down,
*  they shut everything down and the rise.
*  And I was like, maybe they're not going to let us go back.
*  This is like these fucking cocksuckers have control now.
*  And that's what they like.
*  That's why they became politicians in the first place.
*  They like telling people they can't work.
*  They have a grip on society and they're going to fucking keep this grip.
*  We got to get the fuck out of here.
*  So did you move sight unseen?
*  Did you move? Just did you just come?
*  Did you find a place or did you?
*  You came and you hung out for a while looking to see if I could deal with it.
*  We took like a few days off and we flew to Austin with some friends
*  who were also thinking about doing it.
*  None of them wound up moving here.
*  A couple of them moved to Dallas.
*  But we came here.
*  And then one of the things that helped, my daughters were 10 and 12 at the time.
*  They were really young and they were real confused about what was going on in L.A.
*  It was spooky.
*  You know, you had to wear a mask everywhere and that freaks kids out.
*  Like, it's just freaky.
*  It had a major impact on kids.
*  No masks.
*  You go to restaurants and we had this great real estate lady and this great.
*  She's a good friend now.
*  And she took us to see we wanted to see this house and she took us on a ride on a boat.
*  She had a friend to take us on the lake.
*  We go on the lake. People are playing Leonard Skinner.
*  They're jumping in the water. They're laughing and singing.
*  And in L.A., everybody's thinking like the world's going to end.
*  There's no man. I was in I was in New Mexico and I was out on a hundred
*  thousand acre ranch.
*  Oh, right. And we were doing outer range.
*  We were doing the first season of our show and we were tested every morning.
*  And when I was out in the middle of nowhere, I mean, with like good
*  15 mile an hour winds, you'd have somebody come up.
*  If I put my mask down to talk, you'd have somebody go.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  I'd be like, there's no we're in the middle of nowhere.
*  Also, it doesn't even work. It doesn't work.
*  It's stupid. The mask.
*  I'm not even saying that I have a certain belief system or anything,
*  but in that moment.
*  Yeah. Provable that they don't work. Provable.
*  Yeah. And people lost their fucking minds.
*  And it was a stress test.
*  And so we came out here.
*  I bought a house like quick and I was still the same house you have now.
*  Really? Yeah. Cool.
*  We we looked at the house in May.
*  I was living in it in August and we were here.
*  And then my kids started going to school out here. They loved it.
*  I loved it right away.
*  We were performing and then we were doing shows inside where everybody's like,
*  this is crazy. You guys are doing shows indoors
*  because Texas didn't give a fuck.
*  They're like two shows like a couple of months after Covid.
*  They're like, eh, open it up.
*  And so what are the numbers of people who got Covid?
*  You know, I've never had Covid.
*  You never got it at all. That's crazy.
*  I never got it. I don't know if that's a blood type.
*  I don't know. What is that?
*  Maybe you're healthy.
*  Maybe I have it right now. I have a cold right now.
*  Maybe I have it. The new Covid is a joke.
*  It's like I used to test every day.
*  We still like everybody that came in because I wanted to be compliant.
*  I wanted people to feel safe.
*  People were flying out here to do podcasts.
*  I wanted to make sure they're not a dick.
*  And so we tested everybody before every show.
*  And one time I came in and I had the sniffles and I was like, maybe it's Covid.
*  Maybe it's Covid.
*  And the nurse was like, actually, you have Covid.
*  I was like, no way. I'm like, this is the new Covid.
*  But I had it once and like famously got in trouble
*  for saying that I didn't get vaccinated, but I got healthy.
*  And those the CNN attacks and all that shit.
*  And then the second time I got Covid, it was literally sniffles.
*  And it was gone in like a day or two.
*  So were the numbers different in Texas than anywhere else?
*  I don't know. I'm curious.
*  The numbers are all like the real people that got sick are the people with comorbidities.
*  That was the real issue.
*  It would it expose.
*  It's not that it didn't exist.
*  It did, because I have a brother in law who was in New Orleans in the epicenter of it.
*  And it was the beginning of his residency and all that.
*  And he was like, oh, bro. Oh, it fucking exists.
*  It was fucking gnarly.
*  Yeah. If you're really unhealthy, Covid fucked you up.
*  If you're really fat in particular, there was something about
*  the way it reacted.
*  African Americans, too, he said.
*  That's a vitamin D thing.
*  That's a vitamin D.
*  Yeah. Well, you know, African Americans, the reason why they're so dark,
*  the melanin is to protect them from the sun and melanin in white people.
*  The reason why they're so pale is because it acts as like a fucking solar panel for vitamin D.
*  Right. So the melanin actually protects them from the sun's damage.
*  And but it also makes it more difficult for them to get vitamin D.
*  So my friend did his residency in New York and he said during the wintertime,
*  we would do blood panels on people and they would have undetectable levels of vitamin D.
*  And this is the reason why people get sick in the winter.
*  You're covering up your indoors most of the time.
*  You're not getting any vitamin D. You're not getting any sun.
*  If you're not supplementing and not just with vitamin D, by the way,
*  you have to mix vitamin D with K2 and magnesium.
*  That's the most effective way for your body to process it.
*  If you're not doing that, your immune system is shit.
*  It's not that you're giving you're not a living Petri dish and you're giving each other
*  the thing because you would do that in the summer, too.
*  But the minute you go outside and you get that a vitamin D,
*  you get that sun, it's burning it away. Yeah. Well, you're out in the sun.
*  You're healthier. You're supposed to be outside.
*  We're not designed to be locked up in fucking cubicles and fluorescent lights
*  all day. It's not normal. Yeah. So it's not healthy.
*  And if you don't do something to mitigate that and the counteract that your
*  your metabolic health is going to suffer if you're not fit, if you're not healthy,
*  if you're overweight, if you're not eating well, if you're not taking vitamins,
*  all those things are a huge factor that was completely ignored.
*  And the narrative was like, no, you need this novel injection
*  that we haven't tested on anybody. We're going to fucking shoot it in every baby,
*  every kid, every pregnant woman. Did you ever take one? No, I almost did.
*  I didn't think it was a bad thing.
*  This whole pandemic is through education and talking to doctors
*  and also through my experiences, it completely changed my concept
*  and my thought about the medical system.
*  When the vaccine was first available, I was more than willing to get it.
*  In fact, the UFC allocated like one hundred and fifty vaccines for other employees.
*  And we were doing these covid shows where there was no audience.
*  So we would do it at the apex in Vegas, where the UFC has their own small arena.
*  And we'd have the fights there and you'd go and get tested.
*  I would get tested in Austin.
*  I'd fly to to Vegas and then they test me again.
*  And you weren't supposed to go anywhere.
*  You just stayed in your hotel and then you showed up and did the fights.
*  And then they got the allocations to the vaccine.
*  And I called up the doctor and I said, hey, I'm here for the fights.
*  Can I get vaccinated? They said, sure. Come on in.
*  And then when I got there, I called the doctor and said, actually,
*  you have to go to the clinic. We have to do it at the clinic.
*  Can you go on Monday? And I said, I can't.
*  I have to go back to Austin, but I'll be back in two weeks for the next fights.
*  And we'll do it then. They said, great.
*  In that two weeks, they pulled the vaccine because people were getting blood clots.
*  And then also during that two weeks, two people that I knew
*  had strokes like one guy was in his fifties and one guy was in his forties.
*  Immediately following the vaccine within within days of the vaccine.
*  Got strokes. And I had a bunch of friends that had complications.
*  One friend who has a pacemaker.
*  I have a second friend now that has a pacemaker.
*  And there was all these things that just can't make it.
*  They'll have for the rest of their lives.
*  I don't know. It depends on whether or not your heart heals,
*  like how bad the damage is.
*  But his heart was stopped.
*  It would stop beating for like nine seconds at a time.
*  And he would just faint and he was falling down.
*  And, you know, Dr.
*  Drew's talked about this, about he believes that's what happened
*  to a lot of people that got boosted.
*  A lot of people like after the booster, like there's something that would happen
*  where your heart would just stop beating for a while and you'd black out.
*  And it would start up again.
*  And it because it wasn't proven, it wasn't a proven thing.
*  But then again, how many of them are proven?
*  Because, right, let's what you said, what, 72, 73 shots?
*  Yeah, well, that's a different kind of vaccine.
*  No, but I understand that.
*  But there's still vaccines.
*  Yeah. You know, why so much more now is there that much more?
*  No, it's it's I think it's all based in money.
*  I mean, I'm not an anti vaccine person, but like I subscribe
*  to Robert F.
*  Kennedy's perspective, like they should all be tested.
*  They should be safety tested.
*  And they're not, you know, it comes down to this thing.
*  Like we were talking about working out.
*  It comes down to this thing where you go, listen, the medical community
*  I can use for certain things, the holistic community I can use for certain things.
*  Why do I have to deny one just to be full in on the other?
*  Right. Exactly.
*  Well, it's just a narrative that they put out there that medicine
*  and pharmaceutical drugs are the most important thing and everything else is bullshit.
*  Everybody should take OxyContin.
*  Everybody should be on.
*  Yeah. At least 10 OxyContin a day.
*  Help you feel better.
*  You'll feel better.
*  Just like, oh, I feel better.
*  You don't have to do anything.
*  It's helping you. You don't have to feel bad about it.
*  So when we came here, that was the thing was like everybody who came here.
*  Was kind of like, fuck this.
*  And then there were so many of us that Ron talked me into opening up a comedy club.
*  I remember you opened your own.
*  Yeah. Ron went on stage like for the first time in like months, like I think it was eight months.
*  And he grabbed me by the shoulders like right after I got.
*  I mean, he fucking crushed.
*  He goes on stage as this giant standing ovation.
*  He crushes and he comes off stage.
*  He grabs me by my shoulders.
*  Whatever the fuck we have to do, we're going to keep doing this.
*  He goes, you got to open up a club.
*  I go, OK, I'm going to open up a club.
*  Yes, sir. And then I just started looking at club spots.
*  How often do you do it?
*  Almost. I mean, every week, but every week.
*  You're last night three times.
*  I went out and did three sets last night.
*  Wow. Yeah, that's constantly working.
*  Yeah. Do you know Robert Rodriguez, the director?
*  Yeah. No, I don't know him personally.
*  That's surprises me.
*  Yeah, that's who I'm doing.
*  I'm at the Paramount Theater tonight.
*  I love that guy. I love him.
*  Yeah. I've done one to have known him for 30 years.
*  Oh, I'd love to meet him.
*  Yeah. But no, I love his work, though.
*  Yeah. Super good guy. Yeah.
*  And he plays at Antoine's a lot.
*  Oh, yeah. Antoine's. Yeah. Antoine's.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  That's a Gary Clark Jr.'s place.
*  Is it? Yes. My friend, Gary.
*  I didn't know it.
*  So my wife knows Gary's wife really well.
*  Oh, my wife knows Gary's wife really well.
*  Oh, shit, dude.
*  I met somebody on the plane who sat next to me.
*  So I flew to New York.
*  They sent a picture to my wife.
*  No. Yes. Yes.
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
*  Bentley.
*  I don't know the guy's name.
*  I don't know the guy. No, no, no, no, no.
*  The guy that I met on the plane today, he said, what are you here doing?
*  I said, oh, I'm going to see Brogan this afternoon.
*  I'm doing Paramount Theater tonight.
*  And he said, oh, that's so funny.
*  And he didn't talk to me the whole flight.
*  And he said, my son, Bentley, went out with Rosie.
*  Yes. That's for a year.
*  Yes. That's what it is.
*  So he sent a photograph to my wife.
*  Yeah, because I took a photograph.
*  Yeah. So I saw it today right when I was leaving.
*  My wife shows me the photograph.
*  That's fucking funny. It's crazy.
*  That's crazy. Small world.
*  It's my really small world.
*  Super, super small world. Yeah.
*  But yeah. So yeah.
*  Gary's wife and my wife are good friends.
*  Yeah. So I've never met Gary.
*  I'm the best. I love him.
*  He's the best. I mean, that's another artist.
*  A true artist. That's an artist.
*  I mean, he's an artist. Another true artist.
*  I was just with him. I did his video.
*  I was asked to do a lot of videos and I've never done a video
*  because I've never wanted to do a video.
*  The idea of doing video seems weird to me.
*  You're like, you know, singing somebody else's song
*  or something like that.
*  But Chris Stapleton, who's been a friend for a long time.
*  So we were in Marfa together. He's been on podcast.
*  Has he? Yeah.
*  I love that guy. One of the greatest fucking guys.
*  He and Morgan, one of the greatest people.
*  So yeah, we were together over the weekend in Marfa, Texas.
*  Oh, that's fucking cool. Yeah, it was awesome.
*  Yeah. There's, I mean, and Gary's another guy
*  that I knew back in L.A.
*  I met Gary at the Comedy Store.
*  Doesn't he still live in L.A.? No, he lives here.
*  Oh, he does? Full time. Yep.
*  And that's the same thing.
*  Like when I talked to Gary about it, I go,
*  why'd you move to Texas?
*  And this was back when I was still living in L.A.
*  He goes, man, fuck that. Right.
*  Fuck that place. Fuck everything about that place.
*  I don't like it. I told you.
*  I don't feel good there. We just moved out of,
*  we haven't moved to Austin.
*  I've spent a lot of time here. I love it here.
*  My mom's from Corpus Christi.
*  I've spent a lot of time in Texas.
*  I'm gonna eat water burger while I'm here.
*  Yeah.
*  And, but I, you know, we moved to Santa Barbara recently
*  and it's one of those things.
*  It's just like, there's the thing about L.A.
*  when you don't need,
*  because you can do so many things remotely.
*  And you go, why am I here? Right.
*  Right. Why am I here?
*  Like I embrace this staunch thing of I'm a Californian
*  and I loved going to New York
*  and seeing how proud people were in New York.
*  And I'd go back to California and I'd say,
*  I want to be the one proud person that's in California.
*  There was proud people in L.A. for a while.
*  There were. We were all proud
*  that we were L.A. Comics. Yeah.
*  There were L.A. Comics were like a different thing
*  than New York Comics. Right.
*  Cause New York Comics were all like for themselves.
*  They were all kind of shitty and backstabbing.
*  And at the Comedy Store, we had a real community.
*  Where there was like.
*  And that's the best thing.
*  And what you've done is recreate it.
*  Like even when I talk about a chopper community,
*  that's what it is.
*  It's a community that you can rely on.
*  Yes.
*  Regardless of belief system or anything like that.
*  You go, but that guy has my back.
*  Yes.
*  That guy will walk through fire for me.
*  Yes.
*  That guy wants me to do well.
*  That's your people.
*  That's my people. Yeah.
*  And that's the same thing with that.
*  All my people moved out here.
*  They moved out here with me.
*  So we had like 16 top shelf comedians
*  move out here in the first two years.
*  That many?
*  There's so many clubs out here.
*  There's five clubs on the street where my clubs are.
*  That's crazy.
*  I bought the old Ritz Theater.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's the comedy mothership now.
*  And down the street, there's a Sunset Club
*  that my friend Brian owns.
*  And that's a club.
*  That's like five doors down from me.
*  So all these are new clubs
*  that's happened in the last four years.
*  The Vulcan was already there.
*  That was the club that we started working at
*  when we came here.
*  That's down the street from me.
*  That's only like a block away.
*  And then there's the Creek in the Cave,
*  another comedy club that's only like two blocks away.
*  There's a bunch of them just on this one street.
*  What if I move here and open a club
*  and just do monologues?
*  Do you think people will come?
*  Sure.
*  Different night.
*  If it's good.
*  Ladies and gentlemen, this one's from Sicario.
*  If it's good, people would go.
*  They might.
*  Look man, you really have a passion for something.
*  This is the weird artsy city, which I love.
*  It's a great artsy city.
*  It is. It is.
*  There's a lot of fake artists.
*  I know there, but there is everywhere.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of posers.
*  That's all people that just like the idea
*  of them being the one who decides what's real
*  and what's not real.
*  Just goofs.
*  You're always gonna have that.
*  There's a lot of that that hated us when we came here.
*  But really what they didn't like is that
*  you couldn't just fuck around anymore.
*  The real killers were here now.
*  The real top shelf national headliners,
*  guys like Tom Segura and Tim Dillon
*  and these animals moved into town.
*  So this is like a new hub.
*  It's the hub of the world for comedy.
*  The comedy mothership is the hub of comedy in the world.
*  That's wild.
*  Yeah, and it just opened two years ago.
*  That's cool.
*  It's packed every night.
*  It's awesome.
*  Dave came down opening week.
*  It was incredible and no one knew he was there.
*  So I did a set and then after I did a set,
*  I introduced him and everybody just went fucking ape shit
*  and we were like, it's up.
*  The club's rolling now.
*  Now it's really happening.
*  All these people were coming in from all over the country
*  and a bunch of people moved here.
*  There's people moving here constantly.
*  Shane Gillis moved here and all these guys moved here.
*  So it's still happening.
*  Oh yeah, it's still growing.
*  People still coming, migrating in droves.
*  We're talking about opening up another club
*  because we're so packed every night
*  and we have so many comics.
*  We almost have too many comics and not enough room.
*  Has the place grown a lot in the last four years?
*  The city?
*  Other than people, yeah, but you see a gentrification of it
*  or just like things that you got, no.
*  You see a lot of tech bros have moved here
*  because Google moved here and Facebook and Tesla.
*  I remember when Jesse James moved here,
*  which was a while ago.
*  He moved here a long time ago.
*  Long time ago.
*  I remember when he moved from Long Beach
*  and he called me and he was like, it's fucking great.
*  It's fucking great.
*  It's better.
*  I just never will live in a place that has traffic
*  ever again.
*  I'll never live in a big city.
*  Austin's like a million people.
*  It's a million on the outside and a million in the city.
*  It's nothing.
*  It's easy.
*  It's easy to get around.
*  People are friendly.
*  They're just like real people.
*  There's no one here that's connected to that machine
*  that forced compliance.
*  Why do you think that feeds into your,
*  or to me being an ally when everybody's talking about,
*  what's your status right now?
*  Yuck.
*  Yuck.
*  Yuck.
*  Yuck.
*  What's your status?
*  All people care about is, are you killing?
*  Are you going on stage and fucking killing?
*  Are you doing your best work?
*  Are you doing it, period?
*  Are you doing your best work?
*  Do you care?
*  Yes.
*  Do you really care?
*  Are you really working on it?
*  Are you really in?
*  Are you just another affectation?
*  And if you're at that club, you have to be working on it
*  because there's too many people that are working on it.
*  There's too many killers.
*  You can't just be lazy.
*  You won't survive.
*  There's too many killers.
*  I want to go to this club.
*  Anytime.
*  Go tonight.
*  If you want to come tonight.
*  Well, I got this thing to do tonight.
*  When's your thing?
*  What time is it?
*  I don't know, eight, seven?
*  We have a seven o'clock show and a 10 o'clock show.
*  Really?
*  Maybe I'll come after this.
*  Come after, come hang out.
*  Jelly Roll was there last night.
*  Really?
*  Was he really?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That's cool.
*  Jelly Roll's the man.
*  He's here all the time.
*  He's always hanging out here.
*  Do you have my book?
*  I do not.
*  You don't?
*  No, I do not.
*  No one sent it to me.
*  They did.
*  It probably went to a publicist or someone.
*  I was going to bring a book for you.
*  I'll buy it.
*  Josh Brolin.
*  From Under the Truck.
*  Why from Under the Truck?
*  What do you think?
*  Is that's where you were drunk, passed out?
*  That's where my mom's boyfriend was drunk and passed out.
*  But it has this, to me, I chose it
*  because it has a double entendre
*  that when you're under a truck,
*  you're either fixing it or getting run over by it.
*  Hence my life.
*  Ooh.
*  I'm either getting run over by it or fixing it.
*  How did you sort it out?
*  Because you're so together now.
*  Am I?
*  Yeah, I think you are.
*  Thank you.
*  You're fun.
*  Thanks, man.
*  Fun people are together.
*  If you can be fun, you're together.
*  I think I'm at that place.
*  I found a place that you have always been at
*  that I didn't have.
*  I had the opposite, where you go,
*  no, I didn't do cocaine because,
*  and forget the drugs, it's the mentality.
*  I didn't do cocaine because it would kill me.
*  And I would go, oh, that stuff will kill you.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's just walk that line.
*  I always wanted to walk that line.
*  And I had a mother that walked that line.
*  The book is very mother heavy.
*  Very, very mother heavy.
*  And it wasn't intended to be.
*  It just turned out that way.
*  That's why I wanted to, fuck, I wish I had a book.
*  No worries.
*  I wanted to read you a section of the LSD thing.
*  A 13 year old LSD thing.
*  Because it's fun.
*  Yeah, it's juicy.
*  You like juicy stuff.
*  I do.
*  And I want to read you juicy stuff.
*  13 LSD is so wild.
*  That's such a crazy mind blowing experience
*  for a 13 year old to have.
*  Yeah.
*  Can you imagine?
*  Because you look at, I mean, I had kids,
*  when I had my first kid, I was 20 years old.
*  And I was looking at 14 years in prison.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  So, that's why I missed my shot out there.
*  I was surprised.
*  It's Johnny Cash.
*  We'll get it.
*  There's Brolin.
*  We're gonna order it.
*  Find Josh Brolin's.
*  Oh yeah, see if it's in there.
*  I think there's a couple.
*  Get a big mental print of it.
*  Not that I'm proud of it.
*  But, well, it's part of your life
*  and it's why you're you today.
*  Because you've gone through shitty experiences.
*  Yeah, but I don't know if they're shitty.
*  That's what I haven't decided, whether they're shitty
*  or whether they're necessary for this person
*  to get to this place.
*  And not everybody gets to that place.
*  So we're talking about all these people.
*  Like, Hunter S. Thompson.
*  Hunter S. Thompson is my mother, man.
*  Just that she wasn't a good writer.
*  But everything that you, the song,
*  that was my mom.
*  My mom had a loaded nine millimeter
*  at her bedside table all the time.
*  She was part of the, what was the scam
*  that went on in the 80s?
*  The pyramid scam.
*  Remember that?
*  She was one of the top five winners of the pyramid scam.
*  She could talk anybody into anything.
*  So she would come home, literally, man,
*  with bags, with grocery bags full of cash.
*  Wow.
*  And she'd dump it out and she'd say, count.
*  Jesus.
*  So I would sit there and.
*  Wow.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And she'd put them in.
*  I finally found, I think she had hidden some
*  in her dresser and there was like a loose board
*  that she took away and put money in there.
*  I found it and bought some drums.
*  When my grandmother died,
*  we found stuff like that in her house
*  because my grandmother went through the depression.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And so everybody went to the,
*  they all like stockpiled money.
*  So she had coffee cans filled with money
*  that she had like tucked away
*  in like different areas of the house
*  that we found after she died.
*  Right, right.
*  That's kind of great.
*  Yeah.
*  The mentality of like.
*  Yeah, well the mentality when you grow up
*  or you literally might starve to death,
*  there's no food.
*  And you become, there's no way that can affect you
*  and that's the whole point.
*  No way.
*  There's no way that somebody can have that mentality
*  of every cent means something.
*  Right.
*  And we have to hide it unless somebody else takes it
*  or whatever.
*  With my mother,
*  it was always looking for the most vivid experience.
*  And I don't know why that was.
*  Her parents weren't like that.
*  It's just how she was.
*  How she was.
*  And then you either have my brother.
*  I don't know if you have siblings or not,
*  but my brother dealt with it totally different.
*  My brother imploded.
*  So he lives his life as simply as you can possibly live it.
*  Whereas me, it was, my reaction was.
*  The other way.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So how now and why, I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  45 years old.
*  I think it feels like a good age to go, okay,
*  do I wanna go Nick Nolte or do I wanna go?
*  Right, right, right, right.
*  And I can do that.
*  Easy.
*  Nick used to date Vicki Lewis,
*  who was on news radio with me.
*  Yeah. No way.
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't know that.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember Vicki well.
*  Super talented.
*  Super talented.
*  Yeah, sing, could act.
*  She was a firebrand.
*  And Nick, we used to hang around the set
*  and it was always so weird to me to be talking to Nick Nolte.
*  It was so strange.
*  Yeah.
*  And I remember one time I went to Fry's Electronics
*  cause I was going to buy some,
*  I used to make my own computers.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause I was like really into like computer games.
*  So I'd like build my own computers.
*  And so I'm there like looking at motherships
*  and I see this fucking old guy with his glasses on.
*  And I go, Nick goes, oh, hey Joe, how are you, man?
*  Do you know anything about these things?
*  And like I was talking to him about like computer stuff,
*  but I just couldn't believe he knows my name.
*  Yeah.
*  And he remembered me.
*  He saved my life, man.
*  He saved my life at 25.
*  I was.
*  Bro, there's a terrible movie called Warrior.
*  It's a terrible movie.
*  Terrible movie.
*  You mean the UFC movie with Tom Hardy and.
*  That movie sucks.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  But he's fucking incredible in it.
*  He's amazing.
*  His one scene, this one scene when it breaks down,
*  you know, he's the dad.
*  It's so fucking good.
*  It's so good.
*  That one scene is worth sitting through
*  the entire preposterous movie.
*  Yeah.
*  Why do you hate that movie so much?
*  Because it's fake.
*  You can't have, you can't fight like two days in a row.
*  Wasn't the Tyson-Jake fight, wasn't that amazing?
*  Yeah.
*  It's amazing they got paid so much money for that.
*  25 million and 40 million?
*  I think 20 and 40.
*  Yeah, I think that's what I'd heard.
*  You know, which I'm happy Mike got the money
*  and I'm happy that he didn't get hurt.
*  That was my fear that it was gonna be a real fight
*  and he was gonna get hurt.
*  You've known him for a long time.
*  I've known him for a long time.
*  I love that dude.
*  Me too.
*  And he was a like larger than life figure in my childhood.
*  Truly, me too.
*  When I was a kid, when he was the champ,
*  it was like, people don't understand what a champ he was.
*  Like he wasn't just the heavyweight champ of the world.
*  He was an executioner.
*  Like you, every fight was just a matter.
*  I don't remember which fight it was
*  that I went to go see a couple of fights.
*  And I actually went to go see Julio Cesar Chavez fight.
*  And that's when I met Tyson in the green room
*  and I met at the same time, Muhammad Ali in the green room.
*  Oh, wow.
*  That was a moment.
*  Wow.
*  As a boxing fan, that was a real moment.
*  But I remember, and I don't know who it was,
*  and I think it was a 90 second fight
*  and I went to go see this fight and Tyson was fighting
*  and this guy was doing this stuff before.
*  And he had this cut.
*  He had built himself into confidence
*  and Mike came out afterwards.
*  He was the first one, obviously.
*  Mike came out afterwards and I watched his face.
*  I didn't watch Mike.
*  You would normally watch Mike
*  because he's so charismatic and he's coming.
*  You want to see what he's going to do.
*  And I watched the guy's face
*  and I watched that confidence bleed
*  from his face instantaneously.
*  He had absolutely lost the fight long before Mike
*  had ever gotten in the ring.
*  Yeah, I maintained that in a time where he was champion,
*  like the two or three years where he was at his best,
*  he was the greatest fighter of all time.
*  Of all time.
*  Of all time.
*  I don't think anybody-
*  It was so interesting to me as I was watching it
*  and I'm very verbal when it comes to that shit.
*  Come on, what the fuck?
*  And he's still quick.
*  Oh yeah.
*  He's still quick.
*  He's still very quick.
*  And he would do these things.
*  But you know, Mike had, he was walking with a cane
*  just like a year and a half ago.
*  Yeah, but he was really out of shape.
*  He had bad sciatica.
*  Bad sciatica, I didn't know that.
*  Yeah, real bad.
*  It wasn't that long ago that he was,
*  I mean, when I first met him, he was very heavy.
*  He was not working out at all.
*  And I asked him, how come you don't work out?
*  He goes, I don't wanna ignite my ego.
*  That's what he said.
*  He goes, I don't wanna ignite the gods of war.
*  The gods of war, yeah.
*  And then the second time he came in
*  was when he was preparing for the Roy Jones Jr. fight.
*  Came in here?
*  Yeah, and he was a totally different human being.
*  He was fucking jacked and in shape
*  and he looked super intense.
*  And he was just like ready to go.
*  And it was terrifying.
*  It was like, and Jamie-
*  Wait, when was this?
*  A few years ago, four years ago.
*  And so when he came in the second time,
*  I was like, Jamie said it afterwards.
*  He was like, that's a totally different human being
*  than the first time we saw him.
*  He was one of the first guys,
*  like I said, with Nick Nolte, he was like,
*  is that really Nick Nolte?
*  This is crazy.
*  I can't believe he's right there.
*  Mike Tyson was one of the first people that I met
*  that I can't believe he's really here.
*  Because he was so iconic.
*  Like you had to be alive and be a kid
*  during the time where he was the champion
*  to understand what he was.
*  After Muhammad Ali, Larry Holmes was a great fighter,
*  but no one liked him because he beat up Muhammad Ali.
*  So people always just wanted him to lose.
*  But is that the only reason?
*  There's just a certain air of somebody
*  and they come along once in a great while.
*  Yes, but Larry Holmes never got his due.
*  He was an amazing fighter.
*  Amazing fighter, but still.
*  But when he retired, then there was just like a series
*  of boring champions.
*  No one cared about the heavyweight division at all.
*  No one cared.
*  And then the cover of Sports Illustrated,
*  I have it framed in my office at home.
*  It said Kid Dynamite on it.
*  And he was 19 years old.
*  And I was like, who is this guy?
*  And then I started watching him fight.
*  And then he was fighting on like ABC,
*  Wired World of Sports.
*  And you're like, Jesus Christ.
*  Do you find yourself going back
*  and watching highlights just to do it?
*  Oh yeah, I watch Tyson fights all the time.
*  Yeah, I just watched this fight with Frank Bruno
*  just a couple of days ago.
*  Oh my God, Tyson was something just,
*  I just don't think you can maintain that.
*  You can only do that for a few years.
*  The only fights that never worked out,
*  do you remember the fight with him and Bone Crusher Smith?
*  Oh yeah, yeah.
*  Not a great fight.
*  No, it wasn't the best fight.
*  Because Bone Crusher Smith was not a great fighter.
*  Well, he was a good fighter.
*  He's just a tough guy.
*  But brutal knockout puncher.
*  It just wasn't at Mike's level.
*  Mike was at a level that no one was at.
*  It was just an insane combination of discipline,
*  talent, incredible coaching, psychology.
*  You know, when he was 13 years old,
*  he was adopted by a guy, Cus DeMoto,
*  who was a hypnotist.
*  Cus used to hypnotize him.
*  Oh, I didn't know that.
*  Yeah, he hypnotized him when he was 13.
*  Into being the greatest fighter?
*  Into being the greatest fighter.
*  Wow.
*  And he told him, you don't exist, only the task exists.
*  And the task was just destruction.
*  Did Mike tell you that?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I've never heard him say that.
*  Does he say that to other people?
*  Oh yeah, he said it publicly.
*  He's talked about it.
*  I mean, I've never heard it.
*  They talked about the hypnosis.
*  He started doing it when he was 13 years old.
*  So what's the parallel between,
*  and this is the last thing I'll interview you about,
*  what's the thing between Tyson and John Jones,
*  who I met once and I looked at him
*  when I met him on a plane,
*  and he didn't give me really the time of day,
*  but I was like, I'm a huge fan,
*  and I don't say that often to a lot of people.
*  He probably gets that all day long.
*  I'm sure he does.
*  It's no doubt.
*  Special fighter.
*  It's conquerors.
*  That's what it is.
*  They're both conquerors.
*  I had this thing that I put up on my Instagram
*  the other day that somebody made,
*  it was me talking about,
*  trying to explain why John exists,
*  that there's people that are just different,
*  their why are different,
*  and they are uncommon amongst uncommon men.
*  They rise to the top of the top.
*  They're the black hop of their population.
*  They just dominate, and that's John.
*  He's just the greatest of all time.
*  It's exciting to watch.
*  He's 37 years old, and he's still the greatest.
*  I mean, watching that fight,
*  watching Tyson or Jake Paul or whatever,
*  Jake Paul, I wouldn't even want to say Tyson,
*  and then going the next day and watching that fight,
*  watching those fights.
*  It wasn't the only fight.
*  The one before was,
*  what was his name?
*  The fight before John Jones.
*  Oh, Charles Olivera and Michael Chandler.
*  Yeah, incredible fight.
*  Incredible fight.
*  Amazing fight.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, John is a special dude.
*  When he's gone, we're all gonna miss him.
*  It's a different kind of guy.
*  He's been at the top for 14 fucking years.
*  He won the title of the youngest guy
*  to ever win a UFC title, 23.
*  23.
*  Mike was the youngest heavyweight champion
*  of all time at 20, which is really crazy.
*  Crazy.
*  But when John Jones won that title at 23,
*  it's just been destruction of everyone ever since.
*  Never ducked anybody, fought all the best,
*  destroyed everybody, dominated his division,
*  went up to heavyweight, dominates at heavyweight.
*  Why does somebody like that self-destruct?
*  Is that a self-destruction?
*  Because he's a wild motherfucker.
*  That's how you get to be that good.
*  Isn't that what we're talking about the whole time?
*  Whether it's Hunter S. Thompson and this,
*  and how you walk that line.
*  Mike Tyson spending, whatever, 350, $400 million,
*  going to jail, whatever that is.
*  Wild.
*  Wild.
*  But that's also what makes you so good, that wildness.
*  John Jones, when he fought Mauricio Shogunhua
*  for the light heavyweight title when he was 23 years old,
*  he opens up the fight with a flying knee.
*  Nobody does that.
*  You're fighting a legend.
*  Shogun, at that time, when he was
*  the light heavyweight champion, he was a legend.
*  And not just a legend from the UFC, but a legend from Pride.
*  Pride was this gigantic organization in Japan
*  that Shogun really became famous.
*  So he was like a mythical creature almost in MMA circles.
*  That was Shogunhua, he was a beast.
*  Conor McGregor and John Jones.
*  John's in a different category.
*  It's a different thing.
*  Conor self-destructed in a lot of ways because of money.
*  I mean, he took that fight with Floyd Mayweather,
*  made a ton of money off that, and then
*  took a long time before he came back to MMA,
*  and has just not been the same guy since.
*  And I think that's just, it's money,
*  it's a lot of partying, but it's the same kind of thing.
*  It's just a wild, but in his prime,
*  when Conor was in his prime, he was a fucking assassin.
*  Fucking amazing.
*  But it's that thing, that through line
*  of not being able to let go.
*  It's like what you were talking about, Chappelle.
*  Chappelle leaves for 10 years, but then he goes to the park
*  and he does a thing.
*  There's a thing that's insatiable,
*  that warrior mentality.
*  Yeah, but there's a difference because physically,
*  you can only fight for so long.
*  Comedy, you get better every year.
*  If you keep doing comedy, Dave's better now
*  than he was a year ago.
*  He'd be better two years from now than he is now.
*  Rodney Dangerfield eventually.
*  Rodney Dangerfield, when I saw him,
*  he was probably 70 years old and he was murdering
*  in his fucking bathrobe naked.
*  And with his shlong hanging out.
*  Yeah, he was still amazing because it's not a physical thing.
*  You don't have like, your body can only compete
*  at the highest levels for so long,
*  which is one of the things that's so extraordinary
*  about John, because he's 37,
*  he still competes at the highest level.
*  It blew my mind the other night.
*  Well.
*  It was exciting.
*  It was nice to be excited about something.
*  Steve A's past his prime, unfortunately,
*  and he's got a lot of wear on the tires,
*  and it was kind of rough watching him get beat up like that.
*  But that's the game they play.
*  That's the sport.
*  Yeah, and what's great about UFC
*  that I never thought would last in the beginning,
*  the great thing is anything can happen.
*  Anything can happen.
*  Yeah, Frank Fertitta and Lorenzo Fertitta
*  always said that every fight, every UFC,
*  we sell holy shit moments.
*  That's what he said.
*  Like there's moments in the fight where you're like,
*  holy shit, they look around at each other,
*  and everybody's like.
*  Dude, nobody does it better than you.
*  When you do this, you go back in your thing,
*  you go, oh, and your eyes are this big.
*  We always did that,
*  but then they started putting cameras on us.
*  And I don't know why, when they started doing that.
*  You and Cormier?
*  Yeah, we always did that.
*  Every time something would happen, we would throw our.
*  Because it's organic.
*  It's like you can't help it.
*  That's what I'm doing at home.
*  Yeah.
*  Holy fuck.
*  Holy shit, yeah, holy shit.
*  Yeah, there's moments where you just like,
*  you can't believe it's really happening.
*  That's the sport.
*  The sport is, it's the craziest sport.
*  It's the highest consequences of any sport.
*  It's so raw and dangerous, and you can't look away.
*  It's so crazy.
*  And when someone can dominate it,
*  like John Jones or George Saint Pierre
*  or Mighty Mouse or any of the greats.
*  George Saint Pierre, another great one.
*  Greats.
*  When they can do that,
*  it's like that's a different kind of human being.
*  I mean, to be the best of the best people,
*  the best people in the world at fighting,
*  and that he's the best of the best people.
*  And when George was in his prime,
*  it was that same sort of thing.
*  You would see him stand there,
*  like this intense look in his eyes,
*  just couldn't wait to get his fucking hands on that guy.
*  You're like, god damn.
*  I feel very, very, very, very fortunate
*  that I've been able to witness personally
*  so many of those moments.
*  And be there to watch greatness so many times.
*  I think it's great that you've continued.
*  It's surprising to me.
*  I love it.
*  I know you do, and that's why you continue to do it.
*  Well, I did the first 13 of them for free.
*  First 13 ever?
*  Yeah, the first thing I did.
*  No, there was already,
*  it was like UFC 37.
*  Oh, when you got into it.
*  I started working at UFC 12.
*  I did, UFC 12 was the first event that I did in 1997.
*  I was the post-fight interview guy.
*  And so I did that for a couple of years,
*  but it was banned from cable.
*  It was basically like-
*  That's what I said, it was going,
*  it kind of went like this, and then it was going down.
*  Boxing did it to them.
*  Boxing in cahoots with Budweiser,
*  which is funny, because now Bud White sponsors the UFC.
*  But they all wanted the MMA thing to go away,
*  because it was so exciting and crazy.
*  They thought of it as a threat.
*  And they essentially banished it.
*  It also just had this unsavory look to it.
*  You're fighting in a cage.
*  Back in those days, it was bare knuckle.
*  And then-
*  It was bloody.
*  Yeah, it was just crazy.
*  It was like, they would call it human cock fighting,
*  which I always found disgusting.
*  But me, as a martial artist, the question was always,
*  what would happen if you got a judo guy
*  and he fought a wrestler?
*  What would happen if you got a boxer
*  and he fought a karate guy?
*  And the UFC was like, let's find out.
*  So, Hori and Gracie came up with this concept.
*  That's what I was gonna say.
*  Gracie was one of the first judo versus jiu-jitsu, right?
*  Well, Hoyce.
*  Hoyce was the first champion of the UFC.
*  And he was the first guy to introduce that technique
*  is more important than everything.
*  Technique is more important than being big,
*  more important than being strong.
*  Because Hoyce was like 175 pounds.
*  He was very slight and long.
*  I remember the fight.
*  I remember when we were in the ring
*  with a jiu-jitsu wizard,
*  and he would get guys on the ground
*  and strangle the fuck out of them.
*  We were like, what happened?
*  This is crazy.
*  You see the big jack guy.
*  You see the big jack guy's tapping.
*  You're like, what?
*  What happened?
*  And Hoyce just opened up the world to Brazilian jiu-jitsu.
*  And it made Brazilian jiu-jitsu
*  the most popular martial art on Earth.
*  His appearances in the UFC changed
*  the entire course of martial arts.
*  His family, the Gracie family,
*  particularly his father Elio, his brother Hickson,
*  his brother Hoyler, and Horian of course,
*  because he created the UFC.
*  They changed martial arts forever.
*  More development and evolution of martial arts
*  has taken place over the last 30 years
*  than over the last 30,000 years.
*  Yeah, really that's accurate.
*  Fighting is different.
*  People really understand what works
*  and what doesn't work now.
*  And watching him was balletic.
*  It was like a ballet.
*  Yes.
*  It was art.
*  It was art.
*  It wasn't just- It's real martial arts.
*  No.
*  It wasn't that.
*  My dad told him, don't hurt these people.
*  Don't hurt them.
*  You don't have to hurt them.
*  Show them the art.
*  Just submit them.
*  Show them the art.
*  Yeah.
*  So like Hoyce, when he got on top of people,
*  he wasn't like elbowing them, the eyeballs.
*  He was just strangling folks.
*  Just arm barring folks.
*  Making them tap, making them quit.
*  And he did it to everybody.
*  And they were all like, what the fuck just happened?
*  And then everybody had to learn jiu-jitsu.
*  It changed martial arts forever.
*  Do your kids do jiu-jitsu?
*  Yeah, my kids have done it, yeah.
*  Have done it.
*  Yeah, they don't do it anymore.
*  They do other stuff.
*  I don't push them.
*  No.
*  They said, I'm thinking about doing some kickboxing.
*  Let's go.
*  Where you want to go?
*  But I don't believe in, everybody's different.
*  I don't want them to follow my footsteps
*  or anything stupid like that.
*  I want you to be your own human being.
*  What are you interested in?
*  They're both interested in different things.
*  My youngest is an artist.
*  My other one is a phenomenal athlete.
*  It's like, I think that you should do what you want to do.
*  And if you want to do that, I'll bring you.
*  I'll show you.
*  I'll teach you.
*  I'll help you.
*  I don't want to do that.
*  I don't want to push you.
*  Let me be a good parent and celebrate what my kid is,
*  not what I want.
*  There's so many different kinds of things
*  you could be interested in in life.
*  And everyone has a different psychology.
*  So everyone has different things they gravitate towards.
*  It's just like, what is the thing?
*  Is it music?
*  Is it art?
*  Is it your writing?
*  What do you like to do?
*  Find that thing, chase it down.
*  How many kids do you have?
*  I have three.
*  I have a grown, she's 28, and I have a 16 and a 14.
*  I feel like you've got to do what compels you,
*  what drives you.
*  And part of it as a parent is like,
*  there's so many stories of parents,
*  particularly with like talented athletes,
*  that were too hard on the kid
*  and put too much discipline on the kid
*  and the kids burned out.
*  I've seen so many cases of that.
*  You know, with these sideline parents.
*  That Russian mentality or that Asian mentality.
*  You just fucking kill the joy.
*  You know what Hoist Gracie's dad used to do?
*  If he lost a competition, he would buy him a present.
*  Because what was the psychology?
*  They're always gonna wanna win.
*  Meaning the effort, he bought the effort,
*  he bought the present for the effort?
*  No, it's like it doesn't matter.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  Like here, you have a toy.
*  Here's a gift.
*  Here's a thing.
*  This is just growth.
*  It's just development.
*  Hoist's dad, Elio, felt like you live the same life
*  over and over and over again until you get it right.
*  He subscribed to that like ancient,
*  Eastern philosophy of reincarnation.
*  He really believed you'll live the same life
*  over and over until you get it right.
*  And so his philosophy on the way he's kids.
*  Just do 1% better a day.
*  Just do 1%.
*  It's not about going from here to here.
*  It's not living at 100% all the time.
*  It's the process.
*  It's the process.
*  It's the process, the constant process of growth.
*  And through that constant process,
*  what they did was even more crazy
*  because Elio, along with Carlos Gracie,
*  they revolutionized a martial art.
*  Jiu-Jitsu is brought over by these judokas from Japan,
*  Maeda and Kimura, who came over to America,
*  or came over to Brazil rather, and trained with the Gracies.
*  And then they took those techniques
*  and made them applicable to smaller people.
*  Made them applicable to like,
*  because Elio was only 145 pounds.
*  But even have these no rules fights in Brazil.
*  These fucking huge fights
*  that would go for like an hour and a half.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, and he would just beat these guys with technique.
*  So they developed leverage.
*  And they figured out a way to highlight the submissions
*  and make things super technical.
*  And they would analyze moves and break them down.
*  And it became the philosophy of the entire family.
*  That one family created more fucking assassins
*  than any other family in the history of martial arts.
*  And yet they're the nicest people.
*  The nicest people.
*  Yeah, I hoisted here a couple months ago.
*  He was awesome.
*  He's so fun.
*  You know Sessy?
*  No.
*  She's a girl, she's with Laird a lot.
*  She's with Laird's place a lot.
*  I mean, they have a clan, bro.
*  It's a clan, but it's a close clan.
*  Yes.
*  And it's a friendly, familial clan.
*  Yep, yeah, they're very nice people.
*  But that's the thing about Jiu-Jitsu,
*  it's like you get out all your aggression in the gym,
*  and it kills your ego.
*  And you can go be kind.
*  You can just be a nice person.
*  Be a nice person.
*  Jiu-Jitsu people are some of the nicest people
*  I've ever met. Me too.
*  They're super friendly and warm and normal people.
*  They just are obsessed with this one thing.
*  And through that thing, it's like a vehicle
*  for developing your human potential.
*  Because it's so difficult.
*  And when you do a difficult thing,
*  it makes the rest of life a lot easier.
*  Because there's no way whatever you're experiencing
*  during the day is gonna be as difficult
*  as someone on your back trying to strangle
*  the blood out of your brain.
*  Like literally trying to fucking choke
*  the blood out of your head.
*  Like there's no way.
*  Life could be harder than that.
*  But that's the thing is the wildness.
*  You have to have something.
*  To be a champion.
*  You have to be a fighter.
*  To be a champion or to be a good person, I think.
*  You have wildness, which we've talked about
*  throughout this whole thing.
*  If you don't have wildness, you're gonna be boring.
*  Honestly, because I have to bring it back to the book.
*  That's what the book is about.
*  Wildness unmitigated.
*  Right, but you eventually figured out a way
*  to get a grip on it. That eventually turns out on you.
*  No, but most people, it turns around
*  and it bites you in the ass.
*  Most people. And it's a sad ending.
*  But I think those sad endings are a valuable lesson
*  for the other people.
*  Power of example.
*  Yeah, you learn from a lot of,
*  one of the reasons why I never did coke
*  is when I was in high school,
*  my friend's cousin became a coke head.
*  He was a coke dealer and became a coke head.
*  And him and his girlfriend would just do coke and hide.
*  They were just like, they had an attic apartment.
*  They were in this fucking apartment
*  and were just like doing coke and selling coke
*  and watching TV.
*  And he like swithered away.
*  He lost all this weight.
*  Like he got bit by a vampire.
*  And I remember thinking, Jesus Christ,
*  stay the fuck away from coke.
*  He was terrifying.
*  Why would you want to do that?
*  What would be attractive about that?
*  Nothing.
*  I guess it's the, I mean, you've done it.
*  I haven't done it.
*  I guess it's the euphoria when you get that hit.
*  You have that feeling, that feeling of elevation.
*  That feeling of like, you just know fear
*  and you feel excited.
*  You want to start a business with people.
*  And you got plans.
*  We're gonna fucking take over.
*  I just love, like in the description of it,
*  the eyes kind of get like this and the craziness.
*  And you go, yeah, it's bad for everybody else.
*  It may be good for you for like 15 minutes,
*  but everybody else is fucking miserable around you.
*  The worst thing to me was when I would be high,
*  like smoking weed and I'd be like just chilled and silly
*  and I'd run into a coke head.
*  And you're like, oh no.
*  He's trying to talk to you like this.
*  You just get battered with like talk.
*  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  I'm gonna get out of here.
*  It's disgusting to me.
*  It's a weird drug.
*  It's a weird drug, but it's obviously very popular.
*  And it causes a lot of problems.
*  Yeah, no thanks anymore.
*  No thanks, I'm good.
*  Not interested in that one.
*  You smoke your butt, I'll smoke Mike's cigar.
*  Yeah, I like cigars too.
*  Cigars are conversational.
*  They're tools for conversation.
*  It'll relax you, light your brain up a little bit,
*  get you a little fired up.
*  Read this book when you can.
*  I will.
*  Seriously, I think you'll like it.
*  I know I'll like it.
*  I like talking to you.
*  Yeah, it's, yeah, you'll laugh.
*  You'll laugh.
*  Not everybody will laugh when they read the book.
*  You will laugh.
*  Because I think you understand absurdity.
*  How long did it take you to put it together?
*  Two years.
*  It's non-linear.
*  It goes all over the place in all these years.
*  Did you have, when you sat down,
*  did you have like a framework in mind
*  of how you wanted to pursue it?
*  No. No?
*  No, because I've written probably 90 journals in my life.
*  90 full journals, and I would go back,
*  and I kind of started to put some of those together,
*  and I'd go, oh, that happened in 88,
*  that happened in 76, and that kind of stands out
*  as being a milestone moment or whatever.
*  And I'd start to write those down.
*  They were really poorly written,
*  and then that started to instigate one thing
*  and another thing, and it kind of wrote itself.
*  I think it was 450 pages when I finished,
*  and then I knocked it down to like 240.
*  What is that process like, the editing process?
*  That's a good process.
*  That's the hardest process I've ever gone through,
*  but you become a better writer.
*  It's like a jiu-jitsu. Do you do it with an editor,
*  or do you do it by yourself?
*  No, I did it with an editor
*  because I didn't sell the book right away.
*  First of all, most memoirs are not written
*  by the people who they're about,
*  which makes no sense to me,
*  because you're writing about yourself,
*  but you're hiring somebody else to do it,
*  but you're taking the money.
*  I don't get it.
*  So I wrote it.
*  I wrote the entire book.
*  Then I sold it, so I didn't sell it based on a celebrity.
*  I just sold it based on the book
*  because you could read the book.
*  And some people hated it.
*  Some people read it and they go, I don't get it.
*  It's too wild, it's too whatever.
*  Well, everything is not for everybody.
*  Exactly, and that's okay.
*  Yeah, it's more than okay.
*  What's wild is when I was in the middle,
*  which I think you would like,
*  when I was in the middle of doing the audible for the book,
*  about halfway through stumbling through the audible,
*  I go, what the fuck did I do?
*  I should burn any evidence
*  that this fucking was ever even thought about.
*  And then I spiraled for about a month, and I don't spiral.
*  I just don't spiral about anything.
*  I'm pretty cool with anything that comes along.
*  And then people started reading the book.
*  And then I got this varied response that was always visceral.
*  It was never like, I really liked your book a lot.
*  I thought it was well written and all that.
*  Somebody would go, fuck.
*  And that's nice.
*  That means you nailed it.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know, but I do know that the responses are good.
*  Well, that's what's important.
*  It's working.
*  It had a desired effect.
*  You got out your thoughts.
*  You got out your experiences.
*  But that editing process is a good process
*  because you refine and you clarify and you simplify.
*  Yeah. That's cool.
*  You get to look at it with fresh eyes.
*  With fresh eyes.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the arm bar.
*  You could just grab an arm
*  and then try to bend it as much as you can.
*  Or you can fucking figure out how to get in there every time.
*  Did you-
*  And tap the guy out.
*  Did you always know that you were gonna do this?
*  You're gonna write this book?
*  No, I'd written two or three books
*  and put them in the corner, in a dark corner,
*  and let them accumulate dust.
*  I never thought I would do it publicly
*  because I was always into that thing of like,
*  oh, you're an actor and get over it.
*  You wanna be a writer.
*  You wanna be a writer or you wanna be a musician.
*  Every actor wants to be a musician.
*  Every actor wants to be a rock star.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And I was like, nah.
*  And then this lady read this book, this lit agent,
*  and I said it the third time,
*  and she said, you need to fucking stop saying,
*  referencing yourself as an actor who's a writer.
*  You're a fucking writer and a really good writer.
*  Just write.
*  And she was tough on me.
*  So you feel like you had almost like a disclaimer.
*  Like I'm an actor. Through her.
*  Oh yeah, I did.
*  That's what you're doing, giving yourself an escape.
*  I did because it was something about that profession anyway
*  that I always looked at and I always thought,
*  why do I do this?
*  This is dumb.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And where does the self-importance come from?
*  What happened to the wagon that just went down
*  and people tried to shoot you?
*  Doesn't the self-importance just come from attention?
*  You get extraordinary amounts of attention
*  and then people develop self-importance because of that
*  because they think they deserve that attention.
*  Because it's a false thing.
*  And then you start seeing people manifest it like,
*  excuse me, I said hot coffee.
*  I didn't say warm coffee.
*  I said, you know, and you go,
*  I don't understand the mentality.
*  That's the grossest.
*  So for me, it's probably another attempt,
*  which I think I've manifested in a bunch of different ways
*  of right sizing.
*  And there's nothing that will right size you
*  like a fucking book.
*  Puts you right back into why are you doing
*  what you were doing?
*  Where do you come from?
*  How do you feel about your kids?
*  Where's your sensitivity?
*  Where are things that have become concrete
*  that you need to break in order to feel again?
*  Where are you limiting yourself?
*  And I don't like the idea of limiting myself.
*  Like what I love to, did I love drinking?
*  When I, fuck yeah.
*  I had so much fun, dude.
*  And so did a lot of other people.
*  But I go, this is now limiting.
*  Well, don't you want to go out and take a drink?
*  I go, fuck no.
*  When you're out with a bunch of people having fun,
*  no, because I'm having fun.
*  Right.
*  You don't need to drink to have fun,
*  but there's a thing when you're drinking a lot
*  and having fun, do you think this is the reason
*  why I'm having fun?
*  This is the reason why I'm having fun.
*  Yeah, it's a trap.
*  That's the trap.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the trap.
*  Well, you can have a drink or two and really enjoy yourself,
*  or you could think that the only reason
*  why you're enjoying yourself is
*  because you're having a drink or two.
*  And that's usually why you have more drinks,
*  because you think this is the reason
*  people are liking me right now.
*  This is the reason people think I'm funny.
*  And you keep chasing that dragon.
*  Imagine if you went on stage,
*  and every time you went on stage,
*  you had to have at least six drinks.
*  And you'd go, this is what they want.
*  And then you'd wake up in the morning,
*  and your kid goes and wakes you up,
*  and you're like, oh, fuck.
*  And you go, that's not worth it.
*  What's the fucking dude's name from Knight Rider?
*  You know who I'm talking about.
*  Oh, David Asselhoff?
*  Yeah.
*  You ever see that video?
*  Of course I did.
*  The kids.
*  The burger video.
*  Yeah, it's the saddest fucking thing ever.
*  Yeah, it didn't look like a good burger.
*  Well, he's just hammered and his kid filmed it.
*  It's awful, man.
*  Oh, it's so awful.
*  It's so cringy.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what everybody's afraid of,
*  becoming that pathetic example to children.
*  And you wonder how much that exists,
*  and the video's not going.
*  That daughter videoed that.
*  Right.
*  Like, I want you to see what this looks like.
*  Right.
*  And supposedly that kind of threw him
*  into sobriety or whatever.
*  I don't know if he's sober or not.
*  Did he?
*  I don't know.
*  I hope he is.
*  If anything would throw you into sobriety,
*  your children filming you,
*  the lowest moment possible would do it for you.
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't want to be filmed.
*  So I stopped early.
*  He got off at the right time.
*  The last time, I drank, yeah, it was super lame.
*  I was at a, what do you call it, a Del Taco,
*  and I tapped the cab in front of me accidentally
*  when I was moving forward,
*  and he got out and created a thing,
*  and somebody filmed it from the back of the cab.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Yeah, and I looked stupid.
*  You can't fucking drive.
*  You're not a fucking drive.
*  Oh, dude.
*  Shh, quiet.
*  Don't speak.
*  Oh, no.
*  Don't speak.
*  There's nothing worse than being sober
*  and seeing something when it drops.
*  Oh, there's nothing.
*  Oh, no, I'm so gross.
*  Because your perception of it,
*  why you were like, no, man, this is an honorable moment.
*  You're saying I did something that I didn't do.
*  Right.
*  And we need to hash this out.
*  When the reality is,
*  is you're just kind of regurgitating bullshit.
*  Yeah.
*  No.
*  Also, you know how to affect people with your words.
*  Yeah.
*  You know how to express yourself in a dramatic way,
*  and you think you're gonna fucking get through this on top.
*  I'm an actor, motherfucker.
*  Yeah, motherfucker.
*  Watch this.
*  I'm going Shakespeare on you.
*  You know what my favorite movie of yours is?
*  What?
*  No Country for Old Men.
*  Why?
*  Because it's so fucked up.
*  Because it's so fucked up?
*  It's such a fucked up movie.
*  It's, even in the end,
*  when it ends, you're like, what happened?
*  That's the end?
*  Yeah.
*  It's like that guy, what's the name?
*  Javier, what's his name?
*  Bourdain.
*  God damn, that guy was a good psycho.
*  He was so good.
*  God damn.
*  That movie was so, it was just so unusual and intense.
*  And there was no feeling,
*  and people ask this all the time,
*  there was no feeling that it was a special movie.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  I told you I went back to Marfa, Texas
*  for the first time in 18 years with Stapleton.
*  And the guy running the bank is the first guy
*  that Javier kills in the movie.
*  This is the guy running the bank right now, Chip.
*  Wow.
*  And I talked to Chip, I have a picture of me and Chip,
*  and I talked to Chip and I said,
*  fuck, you were the first guy, you know,
*  did you think that?
*  And he said, no, that was a friend of a friend
*  who said that they were auditioning people,
*  and the reason I did it is because I figured
*  nobody would ever see it.
*  It seemed like a small,
*  no, that's the proprietor.
*  It's the first guy that Javier killed outside.
*  That was a good scene though,
*  the proprietor was a good scene.
*  What is that dude like, a person, Javier?
*  The best, the sweetest human being,
*  one of my best friends.
*  Crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  That's inside of him, that he can.
*  Well, that's the thing.
*  That's what makes him an artist.
*  Yes, yes.
*  Because he's one of these guys that literally,
*  he was so depressed during that thing.
*  Really?
*  Oh my God, dude.
*  Because he didn't like doing it?
*  No, he was like, look at my hair, what the fuck?
*  You know what I mean?
*  That's depressed him.
*  Look at him.
*  Oh my God, he played such a good psychopath.
*  He wore SPF 100, he had an umbrella all the time
*  to keep the sun off him.
*  You see how pale he looks?
*  Yeah.
*  But yeah, that's the guy, the guy to the left, that's Chip.
*  Can you stand there for a second, please?
*  So he was really depressed because of his hair?
*  Yeah, and me and Woody would take him out,
*  we would take him out to the cowgirl,
*  what was it called, cowgirl cafe.
*  And we would have drinks with him, we would make him,
*  because he would stay in his apartment
*  with the drapes drawn and all this kind of shit.
*  He just didn't wanna go out.
*  He said, I don't like violence, I don't drive,
*  I don't know why they hired me.
*  Why the fuck did they hire me?
*  Why am I here?
*  Well, how did he pull that out then?
*  And I'm from Spain.
*  This guy's not from Spain.
*  I remember when we worked, we sat in a trailer
*  and he said, in that proprietor scene,
*  he has this great line, he goes, call it.
*  He takes the coin and goes like that, and he says, call it.
*  And the guy says, I don't wanna call it.
*  And he says, you have to call it, it's destiny,
*  call it for you.
*  And we were in his trailer and Javier says, how do you say it?
*  And I said, call it.
*  And Javier kept saying, call it.
*  And I said, no, dude, call it.
*  Can you hear it?
*  Yeah, I can.
*  I'll put the headphone on.
*  What's the most you ever lost on a coin toss?
*  Sir?
*  The most you ever lost on a coin toss.
*  I don't know, I couldn't say.
*  Call it.
*  Call it, yes.
*  For what?
*  Just call it.
*  Well, we need to know what we're calling it for here.
*  You need to call it.
*  I can't call it for you.
*  It wouldn't be fair.
*  I didn't put nothing up.
*  Yes, you did.
*  You've been putting it up your whole life,
*  you just didn't know it.
*  You know what date is on this coin?
*  No.
*  1958.
*  It's been traveling 22 years to get here.
*  And now it's here.
*  And it's either heads or tails.
*  And you have to say, call it.
*  Look, I need to know what I stand to win.
*  Everything.
*  How's that?
*  You stand to win everything, call it.
*  All right.
*  Heads, then.
*  Well done.
*  Don't put it in your pocket, sir.
*  Don't put it in your pocket, it's your lucky quarter.
*  Where you want me to put it?
*  Anywhere, not in your pocket.
*  Where it'll get mixed in with the others
*  and become a jester coin.
*  Which it is.
*  I mean, if you look at that from a different perspective,
*  you say that scene could have been the worst scene ever.
*  It's because of the simplicity of the scene.
*  It just-
*  Plus the consequences.
*  It's the pause.
*  Bloom in the air.
*  It just hangs.
*  And it's, you know that this guy
*  has some sort of weird morals.
*  It's so good, man.
*  Yeah, he's got some code that he lives by.
*  And he's about to win.
*  He's about to impose this code on this guy.
*  And it has no problem putting that bolt through his brain.
*  No problem.
*  And the guy knows it.
*  And he doesn't even know what it-
*  Why he knows it.
*  It's just something that's-
*  Right, he just knows it.
*  Yeah.
*  And you sit there and you just kind of-
*  It's a great fucking scene.
*  It's a great scene, man.
*  Yeah.
*  How did you not know that movie was great
*  while you were doing it?
*  Because it was so, we were just-
*  The Coen brothers are fucking amazing.
*  They're amazing, but you were just having,
*  they had done two movies that were sort of bigger
*  than what they normally do.
*  One was with Clooney and one was with Tom Hanks
*  and it didn't work.
*  Old Brother Horatio?
*  No, that fucking Old Brother Horatio was amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  It was amazing.
*  Was Lady Killers and what was the one with Clooney?
*  I never heard of that.
*  Well, there you go.
*  Yeah.
*  But yeah, so I think that-
*  So you just had this feeling of-
*  They just went back to this simple, like, Burn After,
*  no, Burn After reading was After No Country,
*  which was also really good, super good.
*  But yeah, they just kind of went back
*  to this very kind of feral, you know, base place
*  and just said, let's just tell this simple story
*  and let's let it happen.
*  Maybe, I don't know.
*  I don't think they're like this, but maybe-
*  How did you not know while you were doing it though?
*  Like these amazing scenes?
*  It didn't have that vibe.
*  It was so simple.
*  Wild.
*  It was so simple and-
*  But then when you saw it though.
*  Into the wild, dude, when I saw it with my kid,
*  which was probably super irresponsible.
*  How old was your kid at the time?
*  He was 16.
*  He was like, that's on the cost.
*  But I saw it with him in an editing room on a big screen
*  and we left and we got in the car
*  and we didn't talk for 15 minutes.
*  And that's never happened.
*  Wow.
*  Like literally not one word.
*  Wow.
*  And then I said, what do you think?
*  And he goes, fuck.
*  Which is a great response.
*  That's that movie.
*  That is that movie.
*  That movie is fun.
*  I wanna tie it together too in the end
*  and like a typical Hollywood ending
*  and Javier and my character go head to head at the end
*  and that doesn't happen.
*  So you do something, which is how it was written
*  in the book, Cormac.
*  And I got to know Cormac really well.
*  I was with Cormac the night before he died.
*  Oh, no kidding.
*  Wow.
*  So, and I asked him-
*  That guy could fucking write.
*  Fuck, dude.
*  Some of the greatest writing.
*  I could fucking write. American writing ever.
*  Yeah.
*  In the history of this country.
*  There was something about his writing.
*  It was like, Jesus Christ.
*  That's another one of those guys, artists, where you go.
*  I would ask him about his writing.
*  He didn't wanna talk about it ever.
*  And then finally he got mad at me one day
*  and he was like, I don't fucking know, man.
*  I just sit down at the typewriter and it comes.
*  Like, what do you want me to tell you?
*  Wow.
*  I was like, all right, man.
*  I was fucking 87 years old, relax.
*  But he could write.
*  I mean, he had some, he was tapped into it.
*  Then talk about a guy who just like,
*  you were like the muse and do you have a special place
*  and do you have this thing that, no.
*  Just sits down and writes?
*  The bed that he was on, it was me, his ex-wife, his son
*  and Cormac that last night.
*  Wow.
*  Always at the edge of his bed was that typewriter
*  that he used for 25, 30 years to write all those novels.
*  And then he had one before that that was exactly the same.
*  But that typewriter was on an old piece of wood
*  at the foot of his bed.
*  Wow.
*  And even at the end, he would just grab that thing and.
*  Wow.
*  Get it out, it's cool.
*  Yeah, there's rare humans like that that have that thing.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  They just tap into something.
*  And they tap into it and they just keep going.
*  They get on that path and they just keep going.
*  It just keeps getting better.
*  They just get better at it.
*  We've talked about a series of very special people.
*  You know, what makes the, what's the difference
*  of what makes somebody that special, that iconic?
*  Are they crazy?
*  They're definitely different.
*  They're different.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a resistance to the norm.
*  It's acceptance of reality.
*  It's a poetic understanding of our place in the universe.
*  There's so many different things that are all sort of
*  coalescing into this.
*  But they see through a different lens though.
*  They're just made up of a different cellular makeup.
*  Well, that's probably why you didn't wanna talk about it.
*  He didn't wanna fuck it up.
*  He didn't wanna fuck it up.
*  Yeah.
*  He didn't wanna mitigate it.
*  He didn't wanna lessen it.
*  He didn't wanna, what's the word, make it pedestrian.
*  Yes.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Yes.
*  He didn't wanna try.
*  Sometimes magic is just magic.
*  You don't wanna figure out how it's happening.
*  Just know that you can do it and just keep doing it.
*  Exactly.
*  Just be a craftsman.
*  Be a person who's dedicated to this thing.
*  Yep.
*  He had to know it was really good.
*  Enough people told him it was really good.
*  Yeah, but if you have even a guy like that
*  who wrote the first Up and Tell All the Pretty Horses,
*  none of his books sold.
*  That's pretty crazy.
*  Like a thousand people bought it.
*  1,500 people bought it.
*  And then it was made into a movie.
*  And then you go back and you're like,
*  all these banned books that we know back in the day.
*  1984, George Orwell.
*  Henry Miller.
*  All these fucking people.
*  People were like, ew.
*  And then Van Gogh, painting a painting
*  and all those paintings being outside getting rained on.
*  And now they're selling for a hundred million dollars.
*  Yeah, all after he's dead.
*  All after he's dead.
*  He never knew.
*  He sold one painting in his lifetime.
*  So he never got to, not even a little bit,
*  experience what, look at what you did.
*  Right.
*  Wow, man.
*  Well, maybe that's why they're so good.
*  Cause it's like the purity of expression.
*  Yeah, he's just doing it.
*  Whether people paid attention or not is who they were.
*  And they gave themselves to it.
*  Yeah.
*  A thousand percent.
*  He's an artist.
*  An artist.
*  A real artist.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Thanks dude.
*  Thank you.
*  It was a lot of fun.
*  Really appreciate it.
*  I really appreciate it.
*  I'm gonna read your book immediately.
*  I would like you to.
*  I will definitely.
*  You're one guy I would really like for you to read.
*  I'll get on it.
*  All right.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Bye everybody.
*  Bye.
*  Bye.
