*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=0.0s)]
*  Train by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6.0s)]
*  Alright, what up, Paul? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=12.0s)]
*  What are the odds that I contact you on Instagram and the fucking day you're here is the day your book comes out? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=14.0s)]
*  It's pretty unlike. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=20.0s)]
*  Kind of crazy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=23.0s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=24.0s)]
*  Right? You know, it's kind of like the universe smiled upon us. You know what I mean? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=25.0s)]
*  It's like, it's synchronicity. If you want to believe in the simulation. Sometimes I do. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=29.0s)]
*  I'm with you. I, sometimes you just see something and you're like, this is, this is a simulation, right? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=35.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=41.0s)]
*  We're not in the real. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=42.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=43.0s)]
*  There's a second and a third and a fourth and so on. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=44.0s)]
*  Sometimes just things seem like God is showing you satire. Like, there's just a little fun thrown in there. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=46.0s)]
*  I'm with you. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=53.0s)]
*  I know what it is on your Instagram page. I have to tell you, dude, I have wasted so much fucking time, so much time watching your videos going, what the fuck? Is that real? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=54.0s)]
*  And so many things I've learned from it. It's actually, it's very educational, but it's also very fun. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=66.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=72.0s)]
*  Cody Tucker, your book is called And Now You Know. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=73.0s)]
*  And now you know. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=76.0s)]
*  I didn't even know you had a book and I reached out to you. I just said, this guy's gotta be interesting. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=77.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that remains to be seen. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=81.0s)]
*  We'll find out together. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=84.0s)]
*  You are on Instagram. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=85.0s)]
*  How did you get started doing that type of a page? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=87.0s)]
*  Because it's very specific. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=90.0s)]
*  I mean, I've always been interested in like random facts, like, you know, origin stories of words, like movies, all these different things like the dark side of history. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=91.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=101.0s)]
*  And I like telling people those stories and they seem to enjoy it whenever I tell them. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=102.0s)]
*  So it's like, well, why don't I just like make little videos and clip them, you know, clip them up, make them look all right. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=106.0s)]
*  What were you doing before you're doing that? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=113.0s)]
*  I mean, I've always had a podcast. No one watches this thing. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=115.0s)]
*  It's all right. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=118.0s)]
*  We'll bump that bitch up now. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=119.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, my change now. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=121.0s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, I wouldn't necessarily recommend watching the podcast, but it is it exists. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=123.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=128.0s)]
*  But yeah, it's by the way so much better than please watch my podcast like and subscribe whenever a video gets interrupted by like and subscribe. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=129.0s)]
*  The last thing I want to do is like and subscribe. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=137.0s)]
*  I mean, I'd rather you just if you watch it and like it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=139.0s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=143.0s)]
*  If you don't get it, you get in line. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=144.0s)]
*  Well, that's how podcasts get good. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=147.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=149.0s)]
*  That's that's what I started out doing with this. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=150.0s)]
*  I never advertise this thing once. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=153.0s)]
*  Yeah, this this thing got where it is. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=155.0s)]
*  100% word of mouth. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=158.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=160.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=161.0s)]
*  So I started watching pretty early and it was but it still had like a pretty decent following then. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=162.0s)]
*  But I know you like you started like we started in 2009. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=167.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=171.0s)]
*  So this would have been like a couple of years after that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=172.0s)]
*  Even when I started, you know, me and my friend Brian, when we started, we weren't even thinking it was a podcast. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=174.0s)]
*  We we had already done these things where we'd stream live from the green room at comedy clubs back when it was on Justin TV, which became what, Jamie? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=179.0s)]
*  Twitch. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=189.0s)]
*  So we would just be, you know, like Joey would be talking shit in the green room and we'd be having fun and, you know, we'd just film it just for fun. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=190.0s)]
*  Gotcha. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=196.0s)]
*  And then I had a few friends that started doing Internet shows. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=197.0s)]
*  Tom Green was the big one because Tom Green had it all set up at his house. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=201.0s)]
*  He's incredible. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=205.0s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=206.0s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=207.0s)]
*  He's such a sweetheart, too. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=208.0s)]
*  It's like such as everything you would hope he'd be. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=209.0s)]
*  That's who he is. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=211.0s)]
*  Great, great fucking guy. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=212.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=214.0s)]
*  And, you know, like really forward thinker early on who's like, I think I could just do this from my house. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=215.0s)]
*  But it was too early. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=220.0s)]
*  Like this is 2007 and the Internet sucked. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=222.0s)]
*  It wasn't ready yet. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=225.0s)]
*  You know, no one had smartphones yet. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=227.0s)]
*  It was like but he was patient zero, I think. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=229.0s)]
*  Gotcha. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=232.0s)]
*  Him. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=233.0s)]
*  And then there was this Opie and Anthony show that they used to do. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=234.0s)]
*  Oh, they were amazing. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=237.0s)]
*  They were amazing. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=238.0s)]
*  And but Anthony Kumia started doing this thing live from the compound in his basement where he would do karaoke with a green screen, holding a machine gun. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=239.0s)]
*  He was fucking nuts. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=248.0s)]
*  He's had his fun. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=249.0s)]
*  And he had like beers on tap. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=250.0s)]
*  So they'd be getting hammered. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=252.0s)]
*  He's playing video games. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=253.0s)]
*  He's a maniac. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=254.0s)]
*  And I was like, that looks like so much fun. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=255.0s)]
*  I was like, he just has a studio that he set up in his basement. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=258.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=261.0s)]
*  And so we just started fucking around with the most bare of equipment. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=262.0s)]
*  It was a fucking laptop webcam. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=266.0s)]
*  And we had like a USB mic. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=269.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=273.0s)]
*  One of them blue mics. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=274.0s)]
*  Yeah, the blue. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=275.0s)]
*  The big, stupid silver ones. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=276.0s)]
*  We have one of those. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=277.0s)]
*  It's like 30 bucks at Walmart. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=278.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=279.0s)]
*  That's how we started. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=280.0s)]
*  And then, you know, we just kept doing it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=281.0s)]
*  But telling people not to go to your podcast is classic. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=283.0s)]
*  That's very fun. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=287.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=288.0s)]
*  I mean, that's yeah. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=289.0s)]
*  I think that's one of the things that I use in my thing. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=290.0s)]
*  Because there are people that do watch it and I think they like it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=291.0s)]
*  And I like those people. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=294.0s)]
*  I'm glad those people are around. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=296.0s)]
*  But it's not something that should ever become popular. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=298.0s)]
*  Well, you know, there's two schools of thought today with the youngins like yourself. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=301.0s)]
*  It's like just get famous at any cost. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=305.0s)]
*  Get on TikTok. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=310.0s)]
*  Share your dick on OnlyFans. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=311.0s)]
*  Whatever you have to do. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=312.0s)]
*  Or not. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=314.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=315.0s)]
*  Or fuck that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=316.0s)]
*  And you're in the fuck that category. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=317.0s)]
*  Yeah, I could care less about being having anyone know who the fuck I am. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=318.0s)]
*  Which granted here I am. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=323.0s)]
*  I know it's not. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=325.0s)]
*  But that's the but that's also why you're here. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=326.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=328.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=329.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=330.0s)]
*  That's also why your book came out today. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=331.0s)]
*  It's like there's a synchronicity going on. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=332.0s)]
*  Something. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=334.0s)]
*  Something's happening. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=335.0s)]
*  Things are crossing over. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=336.0s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=337.0s)]
*  So you just you did your podcast. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=338.0s)]
*  And in those stories that you would tell on the podcast, we would drop some crazy information. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=340.0s)]
*  Then you decided to start clipping them up. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=345.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=346.0s)]
*  So I would end it with just like, oh, here's some like half-ass history, which is what [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=347.0s)]
*  I called like the segment. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=350.0s)]
*  And then I was like, oh, here's like a half-ass history segment. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=352.0s)]
*  I'm just ramble about some bullshit from like Napoleon or something. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=356.0s)]
*  I binged them today. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=360.0s)]
*  And what because, you know, get ready for you to come in. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=361.0s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=364.0s)]
*  No, it's fun. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=365.0s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=366.0s)]
*  You really freaked me out with the whole Outlaw Josie Wales thing. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=367.0s)]
*  Like I loved that movie. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=369.0s)]
*  And now I'm like, oh, no. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=371.0s)]
*  Yeah, I can't watch it anymore. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=372.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=373.0s)]
*  I wrote the book that turned into the I mean, tell the story because it's so crazy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=374.0s)]
*  So yeah, there was a fellow named Asa Carter. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=379.0s)]
*  So Asa Carter is this massive white supremacist. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=382.0s)]
*  Like he was in the KKK and then left the KKK because they weren't racist enough. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=385.0s)]
*  He was like, y'all don't hate people way more like you should be hating these people way [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=390.0s)]
*  more than you should. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=395.0s)]
*  So he made his own version like a splinter group of the KKK. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=396.0s)]
*  And I mean, he was part of like he would show up to like Nat King Cole concerts, try to [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=401.0s)]
*  drag him off the stage. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=407.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=408.0s)]
*  And he became a speechwriter for George Wallace, not the comic, but, you know, the governor [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=409.0s)]
*  of Alabama, George Wallace, who was, you know, the segregation now segregation forever. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=416.0s)]
*  He was, as you said, a massive piece of shit mess in the video. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=421.0s)]
*  Horrible human being. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=425.0s)]
*  I mean, yeah, just an all around. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=426.0s)]
*  So he's speechwriter for that. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=429.0s)]
*  He helped write that speech. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=430.0s)]
*  The segregation now segregation forever. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=432.0s)]
*  He was a co-writer of that speech. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=435.0s)]
*  Then things kind of fell apart from him. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=436.0s)]
*  George Wallace is like, you're too racist for me, buddy. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=439.0s)]
*  Like, I just don't want him to go to school with my kids. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=442.0s)]
*  I don't want them to not exist. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=445.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=447.0s)]
*  And yeah, so he moved to Florida, changed his name kind of I think to Forrest Carter. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=448.0s)]
*  I think is the way he changed his name to start writing books. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=454.0s)]
*  One of them was the rebel outlaw, Josie Wales, which, you know, Clint Eastwood turned into [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=456.0s)]
*  outlaw Josie. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=462.0s)]
*  I guess back then there was no Google. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=463.0s)]
*  So a guy could do something like that. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=465.0s)]
*  You would never know. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=467.0s)]
*  How would you know? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=468.0s)]
*  That's how Stephen King had Richard Bachman. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=469.0s)]
*  Remember exactly what he wrote? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=471.0s)]
*  Running Man. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=473.0s)]
*  Running Man is Richard Bachman. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=474.0s)]
*  I know other things too. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=476.0s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=477.0s)]
*  What is it? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=478.0s)]
*  The Dark Half? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=479.0s)]
*  Is that the other one that I really liked? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=480.0s)]
*  Is that Richard? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=482.0s)]
*  I don't know if that was a I think that was a Bachman. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=483.0s)]
*  Was it the Talisman? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=485.0s)]
*  I got a bunch of them that were great. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=486.0s)]
*  That guy was so cocaine works so well for him. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=488.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=491.0s)]
*  I mean, if there's ever a dude and I know he's clean and sober now and God bless him. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=493.0s)]
*  And I feel terrible that the guy got hit by a fucking van like the whole deal. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=496.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=500.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=501.0s)]
*  Is that the Dark Half? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=502.0s)]
*  Stephen King adaptation? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=503.0s)]
*  Oh, so what's Stephen King? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=504.0s)]
*  It was Bachman. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=505.0s)]
*  Oh, another suit of him. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=506.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=510.0s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=511.0s)]
*  That's how prolific that guy was. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=512.0s)]
*  I had no idea. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=513.0s)]
*  He had another one. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=514.0s)]
*  He's so prolific. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=515.0s)]
*  He has extra pseudonyms. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=516.0s)]
*  He has a pseudonym for a pseudonym. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=517.0s)]
*  Bro, there's not a guy who has ever lived who has made more bangers, more just. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=519.0s)]
*  Follows Thad Beaumont, a writer who achieves fame. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=526.0s)]
*  So that's about that. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=528.0s)]
*  That's the pseudonym of the guy in the book. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=529.0s)]
*  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=530.0s)]
*  So now because if you look on the poster, it says Stephen King's name on the. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=531.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's just the Google, the AI. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=534.0s)]
*  But I think that's the actual, is that the trailer for the film or the poster for the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=536.0s)]
*  film? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=542.0s)]
*  A writer who made the movie. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=543.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=544.0s)]
*  Is that what that image is though? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=545.0s)]
*  Or is that the image from the book? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=546.0s)]
*  Timothy Hutton plays George Starks though. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=547.0s)]
*  No, no, I know that. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=548.0s)]
*  But is that image, is that from the book? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=549.0s)]
*  That's the poster. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=550.0s)]
*  For the movie? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=551.0s)]
*  That's the movie, George A. Romero. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=552.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=553.0s)]
*  So it says Stephen King there for sure. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=554.0s)]
*  That's why it says Stephen King is because they're selling it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=555.0s)]
*  You'd have to find a picture of the book and see if like the book says. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=556.0s)]
*  But bottom line is. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=557.0s)]
*  They all say Stephen King. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=558.0s)]
*  They all say, well, why would you change it now? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=559.0s)]
*  It's like, see even the, see if the movie is like, you know, it's like, you know, it's [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=560.0s)]

*  Hold on. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=619.0s)]
*  Is that Richard Stark? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=620.0s)]
*  Richard Stark is another one? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=623.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=625.0s)]
*  Richard is a tribute to author. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=626.0s)]
*  Got it. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=629.0s)]
*  Did he write it as Bachman? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=630.0s)]
*  He did. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=631.0s)]
*  There should be like a bibliography. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=632.0s)]
*  I wonder. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=633.0s)]
*  At the last moment he changed it to Richard Bachman. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=634.0s)]
*  But then or was? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=638.0s)]
*  Gus Pillsbury was a different one he was going to use. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=639.0s)]
*  Oh my God, that's hilarious. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=641.0s)]
*  At the last moment he changed it to Bachman. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=642.0s)]
*  So Bachman was the dark half. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=644.0s)]
*  If I was a porn star, my name would be Gus Pillsbury. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=647.0s)]
*  Or was it the dark half? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=649.0s)]
*  It says thinner. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=650.0s)]
*  They're bringing up the dark half. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=651.0s)]
*  So it has to be there. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=652.0s)]
*  Stark was later used. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=653.0s)]
*  Does surname Stark? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=654.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=655.0s)]
*  Either way, this Stephen King. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=656.0s)]
*  Let's forget about it. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=657.0s)]
*  But I think Running Man, I'm pretty sure Running Man is one of them. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=658.0s)]
*  So he wrote so many good books. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=659.0s)]
*  It was like, I'm giving these people too many books. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=660.0s)]
*  Let me write some under a fake name. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=661.0s)]
*  Mom, the biggest book selling fiction guy in the world. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=662.0s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=663.0s)]
*  Have you ever looked at just like the first book that you've ever read? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=664.0s)]
*  I've read a lot of books. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=665.0s)]
*  I've read a lot of books. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=666.0s)]
*  I've read a lot of books. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=667.0s)]
*  Maybe that's what the dark half is about. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=675.0s)]
*  It's like about his using of a pseudonym. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=676.0s)]
*  Maybe that's why you're thinking. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=679.0s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=680.0s)]
*  Oh, well, that makes sense. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=681.0s)]
*  The dark half. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=682.0s)]
*  That does make sense. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=683.0s)]
*  But see, at the top it said Running Man. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=684.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=686.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=687.0s)]
*  OK, OK. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=688.0s)]
*  The dark half book is great. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=689.0s)]
*  I've never read that one. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=690.0s)]
*  Well, it's so funny that King was able to pull this off because how many of his fucking [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=691.0s)]
*  stories about a writer who lives in Maine? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=696.0s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=698.0s)]
*  The guy just picks his home state, a writer picks his profession, and then insanity ensues. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=702.0s)]
*  You know, like it's all like a writer in Maine. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=708.0s)]
*  Well, and they're all based on just things that are happening to him, like I can't remember [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=711.0s)]
*  which book it is that's about him like going through alcohol DTs. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=716.0s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=719.0s)]
*  It's, I can't remember. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=720.0s)]
*  But the Shining. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=721.0s)]
*  The Shining. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=722.0s)]
*  The Bookography. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=723.0s)]
*  The Shining. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=724.0s)]
*  The Bookography, whatever you would call it. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=725.0s)]
*  Bibliography. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=726.0s)]
*  Bibliography. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=727.0s)]
*  If you look at his bibliography, it's insane. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=728.0s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=731.0s)]
*  Because it's so many bangers. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=732.0s)]
*  Carrie is number one. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=733.0s)]
*  And then it's like Carrie, Salem's Lot, The Shining, a couple other it like and then Christine, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=734.0s)]
*  which. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=740.0s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't enjoy the dark half movie. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=741.0s)]
*  It's like I hate that cliche of the books better because it's never better because you [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=743.0s)]
*  can see the movie. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=747.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=748.0s)]
*  But they never nail it. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=749.0s)]
*  It's just too hard. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=750.0s)]
*  Well, The Shining kind of does because it's being done by Stanley Kubrick. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=751.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=755.0s)]
*  But he hated it. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=756.0s)]
*  Which is so nuts. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=757.0s)]
*  Well, he said that he thought Nicholson turned crazy right away and he wanted it to be a [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=758.0s)]
*  very gradual thing. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=763.0s)]

*  Robin Williams or Harrison Ford. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=769.44s)]
*  Bro, you ever seen Robin Williams in that 24 hour photo movie? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=770.44s)]
*  One hour photo. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=774.0s)]
*  Oh, that's it. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=775.0s)]
*  That's it, dude. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=776.0s)]
*  That movie is so good. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=777.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=778.0s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=779.0s)]
*  He's so good in it. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=780.0s)]
*  He might be one of the greatest actors of all time. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=781.0s)]
*  Like crazy how good he is in that movie because you just really believe he's a psycho. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=783.08s)]
*  Yeah, because he's so lovable at first, but there's all these little signs that like keep [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=788.2s)]

*  to that woman and he says, I'm already dead. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=826.16s)]
*  And she doesn't know what he's saying because he didn't tell anybody. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=829.36s)]
*  The dude went through the mill. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=832.04s)]
*  He was filming the movie while he was battling cancer while everyone was making fun of him [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=833.3199999999999s)]

*  It is. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=847.4s)]
*  So did Norm MacDonald. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=848.4s)]
*  He did the same thing. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=849.4s)]
*  Norm MacDonald didn't tell anybody that he had cancer. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=850.52s)]
*  Just went up to Canada and died. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=853.4s)]
*  He's battling it for years. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=856.2s)]
*  He told no one. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=857.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you could kind of it's one of those things that you can tell when you look back. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=858.9200000000001s)]
*  Like when you look back and watch like episodes of like his show, you know, Norm's show. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=861.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I know you see the puffy it ness and the round eyes. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=866.52s)]
*  His eyes looks very tired. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=871.6s)]
*  That to me, that's the funniest human being of all time. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=874.64s)]
*  He's one of the all time greats. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=876.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=877.5999999999999s)]
*  So I'm sure you met him quite a bit. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=878.5999999999999s)]
*  I accidentally sat next to him twice on airplanes. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=880.0799999999999s)]
*  Totally accidentally. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=885.5999999999999s)]
*  What a person. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=886.5999999999999s)]
*  And we were already friends. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=887.5999999999999s)]
*  So it was super cool. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=888.5999999999999s)]
*  Like I knew him from the clubs and I knew him from being around. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=889.5999999999999s)]
*  And my good friend Adam was a good friend of his. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=893.3199999999999s)]
*  He used to do that show that they did together. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=895.4s)]
*  Adam Eaget? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=897.52s)]

*  Okay. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=899.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=900.52s)]
*  Who's the talent coordinator at the mothership. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=901.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=902.52s)]
*  I'd known Norm forever. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=904.36s)]
*  And then one time I was flying back from somewhere and I sit down and then Norm plops right next [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=905.36s)]
*  to him like, dude, like what are you doing? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=910.64s)]
*  And then we're having the most fun. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=913.0799999999999s)]
*  It was the most fun. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=914.56s)]
*  But the second time was even crazier because Norm sits down next to me. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=915.56s)]
*  We're having a great time. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=919.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=920.68s)]
*  Just laughing and he's so fun. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=921.68s)]
*  We're talking all kinds of crazy shit. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=923.4399999999999s)]
*  And he tells me, yeah, quit smoking. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=925.4399999999999s)]
*  And fucking hard to do, man. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=928.24s)]
*  But I quit. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=930.0799999999999s)]
*  I feel so much better. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=931.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm so glad I did. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=932.0799999999999s)]
*  It's so bad for you. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=933.64s)]
*  I go, yeah, good for you, dude. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=934.64s)]
*  Fuck those cigarettes. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=936.5200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=937.5200000000001s)]
*  So we land and he walks straight into the store and buys a pack of cigarettes and is [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=938.5200000000001s)]
*  literally lighting it before he gets out the door. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=945.84s)]
*  And I go, what are you doing? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=949.8000000000001s)]
*  I thought you quit. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=950.8000000000001s)]
*  And he goes, yeah, but all that talking about cigarettes made me want one. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=951.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, he did quit for a little bit. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=955.5200000000001s)]
*  And then I know I did. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=960.32s)]
*  I know a lot of people have quit and a lot of people, I mean, they keep pointing to like [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=962.0799999999999s)]
*  it's like everyone's playing Russian roulette with fucking lung cancer. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=967.16s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=971.3199999999999s)]
*  You're praying right. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=972.3199999999999s)]
*  Like, 80 percent of people don't even get cancer, bro. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=973.3199999999999s)]
*  Which I'll take those. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=977.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, look, I'll tell you, smoking just looks so cool. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=978.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=982.28s)]
*  Smoking cigarettes like I smoke cigarettes, which I need to not do that. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=983.28s)]
*  But God, it does feel cool. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=987.9599999999999s)]
*  Because also there's an I don't even give a fuck about my health. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=990.6s)]
*  I'm out here thinking. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=994.72s)]
*  Well, I don't have to be smoking a cigarette for people to realize that. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=995.72s)]
*  Nobody's looking at me like, Jesus. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1000.12s)]
*  But that's like accelerating your demise, like purposely accelerating your demise for [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1002.08s)]
*  a head rush, which is I had to do this thing once. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1008.9200000000001s)]
*  But Buddy of mine had this sketch show and they had this sketch that they were they were [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1013.4s)]
*  together, this idea. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1018.5600000000001s)]
*  And he asked me to be like this troubled poet guy. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1019.5600000000001s)]
*  And I said, OK, what do you think I should do? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1023.44s)]
*  He goes, I think you should be like smoking cigarettes. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1025.56s)]
*  You should be like this guy just smoking cigarettes and talk. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1028.88s)]
*  And I'm like, OK, OK, OK. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1031.44s)]
*  So I never smoked before. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1033.64s)]
*  And that day I probably smoked like 15 cigarettes. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1035.8s)]
*  I like fucking dog shit. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1038.48s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1041.08s)]
*  My hands were shaking. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1042.08s)]
*  And my friend Adam Ferrara, who's a comedian who is doing this with me, he smoked. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1043.76s)]
*  And he gave me his cigarettes and everything. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1048.32s)]
*  How do you do this? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1050.6799999999998s)]
*  How are you doing this to yourself every day? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1052.1599999999999s)]
*  This is so crazy. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1054.1599999999999s)]
*  In what time span do you think the 15 cigs? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1055.0s)]
*  Ah, I guess we're doing it all throughout the day. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1057.9199999999998s)]
*  So it's probably four or five hours. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1060.6799999999998s)]
*  It's quite a bit. I mean, even for like a because I don't smoke like I'm not like a pack a day [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1063.48s)]
*  or something like that. Well, that's good. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1067.56s)]
*  Probably a pack every three days. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1069.4399999999998s)]
*  So that's not too bad. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1071.2s)]
*  But it's still terrible. It's still not good. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1072.76s)]
*  I mean, I try to justify it in my head. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1074.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, but I don't I'm not there. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1076.6s)]
*  I really do. I want right before I go on stage. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1078.56s)]
*  I really do. It's a it's a nicotine thing. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1080.76s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's like you can get nicotine from a but but it's the delivery methods [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1084.28s)]
*  that that's different. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1089.12s)]
*  Like this. There's something about smoking it. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1090.36s)]
*  And cigars is similar to smoking the nicotine. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1092.3999999999999s)]
*  It's a very different thing than like nicotine pouches. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1095.9599999999998s)]
*  I've never done the gum. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1100.08s)]
*  But there's a benefit to nicotine. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1102.0s)]
*  It's just the delivery method. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1104.08s)]
*  That's what's terrible for you. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1106.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think nicotine's ever really been proven to just be horrible for you. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1107.72s)]
*  It actually is neuroprotective, which like I love saying those words [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1111.72s)]
*  because I don't really know what the fuck I'm saying. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1116.1599999999999s)]
*  But it sounds like you're smart. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1117.84s)]
*  Yeah. You know, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1120.24s)]
*  Jillian Michaels in here the other day and she was talking about it. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1122.1599999999999s)]
*  And she chews gum and, you know, people are trying to keep smoking. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1125.0s)]
*  So like, no, it's actually good for you. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1128.8s)]
*  But most people aren't aware of that. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1131.0s)]
*  They just think of cigarettes smoking equals cancer, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1132.6s)]
*  equals nicotine, equals you're doing something bad. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1135.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, because the nicotine obviously gets you partly addicted [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1138.08s)]
*  and then makes you smoke more cigarettes, which is horrible. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1141.08s)]
*  Yes. They do. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1144.28s)]
*  There is like almost there's kind of like some blame you could put towards nicotine. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1145.6s)]
*  Well, since in that sense, yeah. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1149.56s)]
*  And with how much your privacy is being invaded online, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1152.0s)]
*  VPNs are no longer just a nice thing to have. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1155.08s)]

*  When you see tweets like people get busted all the time now, these air quotes, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1514.28s)]
*  influencers, they'll tweet something and then you'll see like 30 versions of the [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1518.9599999999998s)]
*  same tweet with the same wording. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1523.24s)]
*  Yeah. Like what is going on? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1526.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1527.8799999999999s)]
*  For now forever. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1528.76s)]
*  I'll never listen to you again. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1530.32s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1531.8s)]
*  And yeah, on both sides. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1532.8s)]
*  That's so it's not a left wing thing. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1534.32s)]
*  It's not a right wing thing. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1536.32s)]
*  I see it with fucking everything. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1537.6000000000001s)]
*  It's like there's like large scale manipulation going on. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1539.6000000000001s)]
*  That's like really nuts to see. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1543.88s)]
*  I like about that Reddit dead Internet thing. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1546.32s)]
*  Reddit did it. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1549.3600000000001s)]
*  Did you see, Jamie, do you know about this? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1550.4s)]
*  Like there's I believe it's might be a lawsuit. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1552.3600000000001s)]
*  So this company used a bunch of chat bots. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1556.0s)]
*  I believe it was on red. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1561.52s)]
*  I just sent it to someone. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1563.1999999999998s)]
*  I'll find it if you can't find it. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1564.76s)]
*  But I think I forget what the argument was about. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1566.8s)]
*  But essentially they're getting in trouble for facilitating these fake [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1569.52s)]
*  arguments like as an experiment, which is if that's why for sure countries are [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1573.8799999999999s)]
*  doing that, Reddit threatens to sue researchers who ran a dead Internet AI [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1579.6799999999998s)]
*  experiment on its site, deeply raw on a both moral and legal level. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1583.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, it's not good. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1589.9599999999998s)]
*  So this is what they did. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1591.24s)]
*  Change my view is the subreddit long been a contentious place for Reddit users to [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1594.76s)]
*  post an opinion and understand other people's perspective. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1599.36s)]
*  Form filled with fiery but largely civil debates covering everything from the role [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1602.12s)]
*  political activism to the dangers of social media and echo chambers. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1606.6399999999999s)]
*  OK, lately, though, not every user posting on the forum has been a real human. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1612.0s)]
*  As 404 Media reported this week, University of Zurich researchers dispatched [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1616.76s)]
*  an army of boys, Zurich, that's not a good place to do it from, guys. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1621.1200000000001s)]
*  You shouldn't be involved in the [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1624.72s)]
*  world, you sketchy research dispatched an army of AI chat bots to debate [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1626.96s)]
*  human users on the subreddit in a secret experiment designed to investigate [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1633.3600000000001s)]
*  whether the tech could be used to change people's minds. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1638.0s)]
*  The optics were horrendous with bots claiming to be characters, including a [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1640.72s)]
*  survivor of sexual assault and a black man who opposes the Black Lives Matter [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1644.84s)]
*  movement. Worse yet, the AI models scoured the post [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1648.8799999999999s)]
*  history of users they were applying to in order to be as convincing as possible. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1653.2s)]
*  Basically a formalized trial run of the [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1657.76s)]
*  dead Internet theory that much of the Internet is already AI generated. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1660.32s)]
*  You know about that theory, huh? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1664.68s)]
*  The AI dead Internet theory. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1666.8799999999999s)]
*  So the idea is that AI becomes sentient and completely fakes the Internet. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1669.5600000000002s)]
*  Fakes the Internet? Yeah, pull it up, Jamie. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1677.68s)]
*  Like, I don't know if I explained it in that article. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1680.2s)]
*  But there was a link in that article under when it got to dead Internet theory. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1682.4s)]
*  There was actually a link. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1687.3200000000002s)]
*  It was right there. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1688.48s)]
*  Where is it? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1690.6000000000001s)]
*  Scroll down a little bit. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1692.0800000000002s)]
*  It didn't have a link. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1694.3600000000001s)]
*  The link was actually about a passing the Turing test, which is it already. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1695.8000000000002s)]
*  Right, right, right. Which is back to 2016. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1699.5600000000002s)]
*  Oh, did the Internet die in 2016? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1702.1200000000001s)]
*  Is online. I think so. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1704.4s)]
*  There's a lot of kooks, like people with schizophrenia, that get things right. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1705.92s)]
*  Yeah, that is kind of the problem is they're not always wrong. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1710.2s)]
*  Well, eventually they're right. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1713.4s)]
*  Like Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, you know, that guy, his whole thing was [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1715.0400000000002s)]
*  that technology was going to overtake the human race. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1721.48s)]
*  Right. And I think he's right. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1724.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you know, he wasn't necessarily wrong. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1726.76s)]
*  He was just wrong to be blowing people up. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1729.12s)]
*  Well, he was that's the really fucked up. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1731.44s)]
*  Did you ever see the Netflix stuff? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1733.92s)]
*  Did you see the Netflix documentary when they go over his life? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1736.2s)]
*  Yeah, as a baby, when they left him in the crib. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1739.8s)]
*  Yeah. And he never got touched for months, which immediately permanent damage. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1741.88s)]
*  You're screwed. You can't fix that. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1747.24s)]
*  Yeah. But I get those wide eyes, you know, or [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1748.68s)]
*  that's a little someone's crazy. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1751.36s)]
*  It's in the Harvard LSD studies where they humiliate him while he's on acid. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1752.8s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1756.84s)]
*  Because he was part of the MK Ultra. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1757.6s)]
*  Like he is a professor that was like recruiting impressionable, but highly [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1759.1599999999999s)]
*  intelligent young men and how crazy is that program? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1763.3999999999999s)]
*  MK Ultra is wild. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1768.56s)]
*  That's that is one of the most interesting. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1770.1599999999999s)]
*  The CIA in general. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1772.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, just like this is a rabbit hole of just the craziest things I've ever seen. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1773.8s)]
*  But like all the Manson stuff, which I'm obsessed with Charles Manson. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1778.1599999999999s)]
*  So all that stuff is of the Manson stuff is crazy. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1781.84s)]
*  The CIA stuff is not even a rabbit hole. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1784.36s)]
*  It's like one of them labranas that they find in Turkey. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1786.04s)]
*  Like 2000 people could live underground. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1790.04s)]
*  You're like, who built this? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1792.12s)]
*  Yeah. What the fuck is this? [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1793.2s)]
*  Yeah. Like the. How long has this been going on? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1794.2s)]
*  Like the French catacombs where people get lost every day and all that. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1796.2s)]
*  If you go down the CIA rabbit hole, you'll find a city like a civilization. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1800.08s)]
*  Atlantis. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1804.72s)]
*  And then you have to think, OK, but also Russia has the same sort of [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1806.0s)]
*  operation going for Russia. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1811.08s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1813.04s)]
*  Every country has them. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1813.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Everybody has the CIA, KGB. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1815.04s)]
*  I mean, so they have to exist. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1817.2s)]
*  So I like that's all get rid of the CIA. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1818.84s)]
*  And then what? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1821.6s)]
*  We get taken over completely by Russia and China. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1822.36s)]
*  It's like slow down, everybody. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1824.68s)]
*  Yeah. Like there's a nutty AI war going on right in front of your face. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1826.56s)]
*  You just haven't heard the bombs go off yet. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1830.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1833.0s)]
*  It's happening right now. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1833.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1835.96s)]
*  And if they pulled that off from the University of Zurich, which is kind of creepy, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1836.28s)]
*  that a university would like do that, pretend to be a black guy who's against [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1841.68s)]
*  the Black Lives Matter movement and a woman who survived a sexual assault. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1848.2s)]
*  You're just making it up with AI chat bots. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1852.0s)]
*  Like this is fucking wild. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1854.84s)]
*  And just to see how people react. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1857.32s)]
*  How the fuck do you think is going to happen? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1858.64s)]
*  Or find somebody who actually is one of those people and then see how people [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1860.64s)]
*  react, if that's what you want to do. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1864.0s)]
*  Like you don't have to pretend to be one. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1865.44s)]
*  There are lots of people who, yeah, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1867.44s)]
*  probably just volunteer and you could have a whole study control group, you know, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1869.84s)]
*  have the whole thing. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1873.8s)]
*  Yeah. You don't have to do it anonymously on the Internet under false pretenses. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1874.68s)]
*  Like you wouldn't have to do that. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1878.64s)]
*  You just want to have fun. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1879.64s)]
*  I mean, I guess that's there. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1881.3600000000001s)]
*  But the problem is. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1882.56s)]
*  Anytime you're doing a study with real people, they know they're in a study. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1885.56s)]
*  Yeah. What's that? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1889.1200000000001s)]
*  There's a law like a [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1890.16s)]
*  where like you can't something about being observed, like ruins the thing, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1892.48s)]

*  Well, I don't even know if that science. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1901.36s)]
*  I'm just talking about like humans, like people know they're being right. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1903.28s)]
*  Watched as a part of a study. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1907.6799999999998s)]
*  You behave completely differently. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1909.36s)]
*  Yeah. You're going to influence their behavior. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1910.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, it's just like if you get asked a question to be part of a survey, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1912.76s)]
*  you're not answering that thing accurately, even if it's anonymous. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1915.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1918.36s)]
*  Just because you know that like your answer is going to be make you look maybe [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1919.2s)]
*  a little bit bad, you'll you'll church up your answer a little. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1923.12s)]
*  Maybe not outright lie. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1926.04s)]
*  But if it asks you how many drinks do you have a week? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1927.32s)]
*  You're not telling them. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1930.2s)]

*  You're going six to eight. Sounds about right. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1932.92s)]
*  Yeah. This uncertainty is why I think we're super vulnerable. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1935.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1939.44s)]

*  any sort of electronic bridge that they start using. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1951.68s)]
*  Like whether it's a wearable or an implant that lets you legitimately read minds, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1957.3999999999999s)]

*  God, I hope not. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1967.2s)]
*  It's so scary, dude, because we'll give it up to know the truth. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1968.3999999999999s)]
*  People give it up to know the truth. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1971.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1973.68s)]
*  I mean, think about how much of your data you give just so that you can Google things. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1974.44s)]
*  Think of how much how much money they make [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1980.32s)]
*  off of your data and giving out your email address and all the fucking spam [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1982.84s)]

*  You gave that up. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1990.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, just for free Internet, just for free Google. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1991.8799999999999s)]

*  I just give it all up. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1997.32s)]
*  Everybody does. But imagine like what Google would cost. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=1998.28s)]
*  Like if Google was a pay thing and the only way you could ever know anything [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2001.1599999999999s)]
*  about what's going on in the world, you have to search it. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2005.76s)]
*  Every search engine costs money. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2008.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2009.44s)]
*  It's like, oh, but instead, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2010.1599999999999s)]
*  you get this free value. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2012.6399999999999s)]
*  But wouldn't you rather not pay? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2014.24s)]
*  Of course. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2016.4s)]
*  But what if you paid for it and then they couldn't use any of your data ever? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2017.12s)]
*  And it was a totally like honest relationship. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2021.0s)]
*  And you're not allowed to curate the information either. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2023.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2025.8799999999999s)]
*  You just have to put out the information as it exists online. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2026.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2029.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2030.6399999999999s)]
*  We gave up privacy. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2031.6399999999999s)]
*  We gave up our data and we didn't even think about it. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2033.44s)]
*  We didn't even know it was a thing that we're giving up. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2036.0s)]
*  And then we're going to give up sentience. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2038.04s)]
*  We're going to we're going to we're going to fucking be connected to the hive mind. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2041.28s)]
*  Yeah, I really think so. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2044.6s)]
*  Yeah, because it's weird, like with the, you know, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2046.52s)]
*  online like data privacy, like you don't really know what it is that you're giving up. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2049.36s)]
*  It's not like normal privacy where like if somebody asks like, hey, can I take [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2054.44s)]
*  a picture of your driver's license? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2058.2s)]
*  You'd say, no. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2059.4s)]
*  What are you talking about? No, you can't. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2060.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2061.92s)]
*  But they can get the majority of that information through, you know, they can try [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2062.36s)]
*  and get your address, get your they can find out even more information about you [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2066.32s)]
*  through giving up like your your privacy, like data privacy. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2070.92s)]
*  But we don't like no we don't have like a list of what they're getting. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2074.64s)]
*  I mean, I guess you do if you read that whole damn thing. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2077.96s)]
*  But who's reading that? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2080.4s)]
*  Like, right. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2081.44s)]
*  I see terms. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2082.04s)]
*  Nobody reads that shit. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2082.52s)]
*  Somebody told me there was something that we might have to edit this out. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2083.88s)]
*  It's not true. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2087.4s)]
*  But somebody told me there's something fucked up about Google's terms [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2088.2000000000003s)]
*  and whatever terms apply there with the thing that you have to agree to, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2093.4s)]
*  that it has something in there that you'll agree to mediation. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2099.3199999999997s)]
*  Mediation. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2103.72s)]
*  Yeah, like in case of some sort of a dispute, a legal dispute, you've agreed [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2104.8399999999997s)]
*  to mediation in the so you're not going to sue them. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2109.08s)]
*  So you can't really. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2111.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2113.44s)]
*  Like whenever you get hired at a new job, they have those kinds of like clauses. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2113.7999999999997s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2117.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2118.2s)]
*  That's that's so if it's true. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2118.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2121.2799999999997s)]
*  But we need to find out if it's true. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2121.8399999999997s)]
*  Somebody was telling me and I was like, wait, what? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2123.3199999999997s)]
*  Who? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2126.68s)]
*  That sounds insane. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2127.8s)]
*  Except it's required by applicable law, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2134.92s)]
*  mediation is voluntary and neither you nor Google are obligated to settle [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2137.32s)]
*  disputes through mediation. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2142.0s)]
*  What the hell does that mean? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2144.92s)]
*  I don't know the context in which you were told it because this is like for. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2147.2s)]
*  But this is I said Uber. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2150.12s)]
*  They said Google. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2152.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2153.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2154.56s)]
*  No, Uber. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2155.12s)]
*  Oh, OK, Uber. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2156.2s)]
*  I'm sorry. I was probably mumbled. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2157.52s)]
*  OK, Uber's terms of service include a binding arbitration clause, meaning users [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2164.0s)]
*  agree to resolve disputes through arbitration rather than in court. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2168.6s)]
*  This arbitration is individual and non [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2172.2799999999997s)]
*  consolidated, meaning you can't join with others in a class action suit. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2174.96s)]
*  Uber also limits its liability and states [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2179.4s)]
*  that drivers are independent contractors, not employees. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2182.08s)]
*  If you have a dispute, you could try to resolve it through mediation, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2186.16s)]
*  but it may ultimately be resolved through arbitration. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2189.08s)]
*  That's that's wild. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2192.0s)]
*  Jesus, that's kind of wild. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2194.0s)]
*  It's like we have our own rules. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2195.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2197.08s)]
*  Our laws. No, no, no. Forget about the laws of the land. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2197.7599999999998s)]
*  You agree to a legal contract. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2200.24s)]
*  That's like very sneaky. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2202.32s)]
*  Very. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2203.68s)]
*  Because there's like laws. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2204.4s)]
*  If we have laws to prevent fraud and laws to prevent negligence, we have those for [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2205.68s)]
*  companies and you're a company like no, we're not. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2209.68s)]
*  We're not a company. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2211.9199999999996s)]
*  These people, they're independent contractors. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2213.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2214.96s)]
*  Oh, you have no liability at all. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2215.3999999999996s)]
*  You make all the money. What a great deal. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2216.9199999999996s)]
*  Who did you pay? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2218.52s)]
*  Who did you who did you fucking pay off to get that sweetheart of a deal? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2219.68s)]
*  Yeah. And also, how many people know what arbitration is? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2223.3199999999997s)]
*  Because I'll be honest, I don't know what it is. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2227.16s)]

*  Sounds scary. If you got to go through arbitration. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2230.2s)]
*  I could not. I don't want to do that. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2232.0s)]

*  We have to have some sort of mediation. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2245.12s)]
*  I think that's what they're saying. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2247.16s)]
*  I could be wrong. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2248.88s)]

*  That's not. Yeah, that's wild. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2253.04s)]
*  The thing about Uber is if they're just private contractors, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2255.8s)]
*  then it becomes like, OK, what is your responsibility to screen these private [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2262.52s)]
*  contractors? Because some of these people might be psychos and, you know, you're a [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2265.48s)]

*  Good. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2352.7200000000003s)]
*  You're probably right. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2355.52s)]
*  Perfectly fine with that. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2356.36s)]
*  God is Grok your favorite to use? [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2359.4s)]
*  What do you like to use most? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2361.96s)]
*  You have to go. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2363.32s)]
*  I honestly think you have to test them all when you're asking a question you really [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2364.48s)]
*  want the answer to. They give you varying responses. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2367.52s)]
*  I had I had a chat GBT lie to me yesterday four times in a row. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2372.1600000000003s)]
*  Look how quick this is. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2375.6400000000003s)]
*  Let me break this down for is a wild American audience in plain language. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2376.8s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2381.12s)]
*  This selection of a contrast explains. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2381.84s)]
*  See, this is what I'm saying. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2383.44s)]
*  Like if it's already happened. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2384.36s)]
*  Yeah, if AI is already taken over, we've already agreed by the timing of your book. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2386.0s)]
*  The synchronicity is real and that maybe the simulation is real. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2390.6400000000003s)]
*  And then if it's going to be simulated, it's not going to be simulated by a bunch [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2393.96s)]
*  of people. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2397.96s)]
*  It's going to be simulated by artificial intelligence. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2399.04s)]
*  There'd be way more mistakes. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2401.8s)]
*  Those people. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2403.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2404.2000000000003s)]
*  Dutch law applies the contract government of the laws of the Netherlands, not US law. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2405.2400000000002s)]
*  This means Dutch legal principles will guide how the contract is interpreted [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2409.44s)]
*  except for conflicts of laws, rules which deal with choosing which country's laws [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2412.88s)]
*  apply. That's what it is. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2418.7200000000003s)]
*  Also, an international treaty called the Vienna Convention, which covers sales of [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2420.56s)]
*  goods, doesn't apply here. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2424.84s)]
*  So essentially they're saying like we go by the Netherlands laws. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2426.1600000000003s)]
*  If you have different laws, the United States go pound sand. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2429.28s)]
*  Those don't matter. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2431.84s)]
*  Yeah, this is in the Netherlands. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2432.88s)]
*  You're a lawsuit here. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2435.44s)]
*  It also probably depends on what happened. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2436.92s)]
*  Like if you if it's a speed limit thing, you go by the rules of the speed limit. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2438.2000000000003s)]
*  But if it's something about, you know, interpersonal, the driver and the [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2441.44s)]
*  dance and don't you think that if you do business in a particular country, you'd [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2445.6s)]
*  have to follow the laws of that country. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2450.96s)]
*  Doesn't that just you would think? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2452.92s)]
*  I mean, I'm not even trying to be unreasonable here. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2454.64s)]
*  Maybe they're better in the Netherlands. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2456.88s)]
*  Maybe they're more fair. I don't know. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2458.2000000000003s)]
*  It's not even like a value judgment. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2459.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2461.2000000000003s)]
*  Maybe they are. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2462.04s)]
*  Maybe they just want the best for their their customers. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2462.7200000000003s)]
*  So you know what? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2465.44s)]
*  If they really want to sue the fuck out of us and when really should do in the [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2466.4s)]

*  because I was like, well, let me just get one to take me up to like Sixth Street or [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2611.32s)]
*  something. Did you get in? [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2614.1200000000003s)]

*  Like what if something happens where it's like, you know what I would like to do? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2620.52s)]
*  Take you down 35 at about 90 miles an hour in the wrong lane. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2623.64s)]
*  You know, what if my front camera goes out [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2627.72s)]
*  and I can't see what's in front of me and I just start plowing into other cars? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2630.7599999999998s)]
*  Like, yeah, I'm not saying that that's going to happen or wherever will happen. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2633.7999999999997s)]

*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2637.68s)]
*  But it just sketches me out. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2638.52s)]
*  Although I do think it's inevitable. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2640.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I looked it up. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2642.3199999999997s)]
*  There's only been one fatality involving one, and it wasn't even their fault. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2643.12s)]
*  It was a driverless one where someone rear ended the Waymo like, you know, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2647.12s)]
*  so I was like, well, they seem pretty safe, like in terms of like the way they drive [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2651.68s)]
*  to they drive real slow and steady and they're easy to avoid. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2655.72s)]
*  I can see you taking one like if you're just going around like a neighborhood or [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2659.36s)]
*  something, you know, you just like you never going above 30 miles an hour. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2662.48s)]

*  We're psyched. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2681.44s)]
*  Well, this is cool. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2682.2s)]
*  I'm guilty of it. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2683.7599999999998s)]
*  I have a Tesla that does it does auto driving. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2684.7599999999998s)]
*  You go, yeah, you turn this button on and it fucking stops. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2687.24s)]
*  It stops, it signs, hits its blinkers, goes around stuff. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2690.44s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2693.4s)]
*  Do you use it? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2694.24s)]
*  Very rarely. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2695.0s)]
*  OK, it weirds me out. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2696.0s)]
*  But I do sometimes. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2697.04s)]
*  I mean, I've done it like I haven't driven me home three or four times. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2698.52s)]
*  Just like, do do just like this is crazy. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2701.96s)]
*  Just because it's weird, you know, but I'm always my hands are close. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2704.4s)]
*  You know, I'm never like looking at my phone or that's crazy. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2707.84s)]
*  I would trust that. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2710.88s)]
*  Like if you're just sitting in there and like kind of [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2712.04s)]
*  you could take control if you need need be. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2714.6400000000003s)]
*  But that's the bridge, bro. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2717.48s)]
*  That's the bridge. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2719.6800000000003s)]
*  That's the bridge to transhumanism. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2721.1600000000003s)]
*  I think we all need to stay in our separate. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2723.4s)]
*  No bridges. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2725.52s)]
*  I agree. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2726.6400000000003s)]
*  But I think we're going. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2727.5600000000004s)]
*  I think we are the last of these kind of people. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2729.08s)]
*  And then the people from now on will be like personally, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2732.48s)]
*  like physically integrated with some kind of electronics. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2735.12s)]
*  Yeah, I don't like that one bit. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2738.6s)]
*  There's much of an acoustic type fella. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2741.04s)]
*  I can't be. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2743.6s)]
*  I think there's so much wild genetic stuff going on right now that they're [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2744.48s)]
*  going to change what it means to be a person within our lifetime. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2749.32s)]
*  Like there's some there was a thing in China. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2753.44s)]
*  See if you could find this. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2756.56s)]
*  Do you know what a tardigrade is? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2758.08s)]
*  No, tardigrades are these really weird little almost insect looking things that [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2759.88s)]
*  are unbelievably durable, tiny microscopic little fuckers. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2765.64s)]
*  Yeah, they call them like something bears. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2769.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2771.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2772.4s)]
*  What do they call them? What kind of bears? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2773.04s)]
*  Water bears. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2775.0s)]
*  So these little fuckers can survive forever in space [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2776.6800000000003s)]
*  for whatever reason, they go into like hibernation in space like. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2781.04s)]
*  And they think there's some of them from the Japanese lunar lander that are actually [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2785.12s)]
*  on the moon. They think tardigrades are on the moon and that they're like in a [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2791.04s)]
*  suspended state of animation and that if you brought them back to the United [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2794.44s)]
*  States, they'd kick back in and be alive again. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2797.7599999999998s)]
*  That's how crazy these little fuckers are. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2800.48s)]
*  So there was this Chinese experiment where they're integrating tardigrade DNA into [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2802.7999999999997s)]
*  human DNA. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2808.2s)]
*  That's a good idea. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2810.44s)]
*  There's nothing that could ever go wrong with doing that. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2811.36s)]
*  But what happens if someone develops like a bulletproof, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2814.68s)]
*  immortal human [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2818.96s)]
*  that lives, like literally lives forever unless it gets hit with a meteor? [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2821.6s)]
*  Like, that's not outside of what's possible, man. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2826.6s)]
*  No, they developed or they were developing some kind of... [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2831.12s)]
*  See if you can find that first for making Google this. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2835.8s)]
*  But they were trying to develop some sort of bulletproof human skin using spider [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2838.04s)]
*  silk. So they were going to sense like Kevlar's [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2842.32s)]
*  spider silk, but your own skin. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2845.32s)]
*  Like with gene splicing. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2849.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't like that. The gene splicing thing, Freaks Man Splice, like that movie. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2851.48s)]
*  I don't know if you ever saw that with AJ. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2854.92s)]
*  I did. Oh, that was crazy. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2856.32s)]
*  It's a great movie. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2858.28s)]
*  But like just seeing all the I'm like, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2859.32s)]
*  that's what my mind immediately goes to is him banging this thing with that. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2861.2000000000003s)]
*  Dralian thing. Yeah, that thing was sick. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2865.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was a kind of a goofy movie. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2867.6400000000003s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2870.0800000000004s)]
*  Well, it wasn't like, like, wow, I would really believe that was happening. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2870.7599999999998s)]
*  No, it was Schindler's List or something. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2874.4s)]
*  Yeah, it was kind of goofy, but it was fun. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2877.2799999999997s)]
*  And it was just very strange, you know, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2879.8399999999997s)]
*  because you go, OK, I could kind of see that happening. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2883.24s)]
*  For sure. Yeah, I think so. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2885.88s)]
*  I mean, that's kind of what a lot of that is. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2887.24s)]
*  I just what was that? [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2888.92s)]
*  CRISPR. You remember that thing was kind of that was a talking point. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2890.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, they have CRISPR too now, which is even more effective, apparently. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2893.3199999999997s)]
*  Made by an artist. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2896.48s)]
*  Bulletproof skin is made of goat. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2897.72s)]
*  No, this isn't it. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2899.52s)]
*  Goat. No, there was. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2900.88s)]
*  What's that? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2902.6s)]
*  Lab grown skin reinforced spider silk and stop bullets. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2903.4s)]
*  But when you go to what it actually is. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2906.88s)]
*  Oh, so it's bullshit. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2909.08s)]
*  It's bullshit. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2910.2s)]
*  But it's just, you know, it's someone sort of explaining things differently. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2911.4s)]
*  I mean, I thought there was it was a study about human skin. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2915.44s)]
*  I think that they were trying to say, oh, so it's a bullshit headline in this story. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2923.04s)]
*  So it is back from 2018 is when this did you find anything in the tardigrade thing? [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2927.12s)]
*  Yeah. And it had they were explaining what it did. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2931.4s)]
*  So there's [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2935.24s)]
*  it showed that there was a clean transfer. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2937.6s)]
*  New cells function normally, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2939.6s)]
*  but also demonstrate increased rate of cell growth. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2941.96s)]
*  They're trying to make them immune to radiation is what the idea was. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2944.7599999999998s)]
*  They're making super people, man. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2949.88s)]
*  They're making X band. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2951.7599999999998s)]
*  That is so crazy. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2953.92s)]
*  That is wild. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2956.48s)]
*  They're going to put I don't like that. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2957.8s)]
*  Tardigrades genes into humans. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2959.52s)]
*  That makes me so uncomfortable. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2962.6400000000003s)]
*  They may create super soldiers. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2964.44s)]
*  So, OK, China has already done [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2967.92s)]
*  these genetic experiments on babies that are supposed to inoculate them to HIV, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2971.52s)]
*  but also somehow increase their intelligence. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2977.76s)]
*  And the guy got in trouble and they said, you're bad. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2980.8s)]
*  You shouldn't have done that research that we paid you to do. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2984.44s)]
*  And so they put him in jail for like company, play golf. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2986.56s)]
*  And then good fellows. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2990.0s)]
*  Now he's out. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2991.4s)]
*  But that happened. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2992.32s)]
*  And that's just what we know about publicly. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2994.0s)]
*  Like, why would they tell if they were like making super soldiers? [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=2996.6s)]
*  And if they really by the time we hear about it, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3000.52s)]
*  there's probably some mountain in China that has an underground base, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3004.0s)]
*  just like we have, just like Area 51, you have some base carved to the side [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3007.04s)]
*  of a mountain and they're doing wild shit over there. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3011.6800000000003s)]
*  Where Jared Leto lives or what? [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3014.2s)]
*  He lives in the L.A. one. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3017.08s)]
*  Yeah, he lives in the one that's connected to the music scene in Laurel Canyon. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3018.64s)]
*  You know, because it's all like, you know, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3022.84s)]
*  the whole music scene has like weird intelligence agency. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3024.7599999999998s)]
*  The Laurel Canyon thing is strange. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3027.88s)]
*  Yeah, with all those people like Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3029.96s)]
*  maybe not Neil Young, but like, yeah, a lot of those artists had like [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3032.36s)]
*  too many connections. Yeah. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3036.96s)]
*  And Jim Morrison's dad started Vietnam. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3038.3199999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3040.24s)]
*  Jim Morris's dad was like a serious military man. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3041.36s)]
*  He was the Navy Admiral during the Gulf of Tonkin. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3044.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3046.56s)]
*  It's one of those things where it's like you first you first hear about that one. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3047.36s)]
*  We go, what? Get out of here. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3051.36s)]
*  But then you hear, well, no, like it's not like these artists didn't exist. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3053.3199999999997s)]
*  But why did they become famous? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3058.0s)]
*  Why did they get promoted? [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3060.44s)]
*  Like what was it about? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3061.88s)]
*  Was it a do you think it's like a psychology? [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3063.64s)]
*  But because like take a guy in the Laurel Canyon scene like Hendrix. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3066.12s)]
*  Look, you can't make a Hendrix accidentally or you can't make a Jim Morrison, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3071.04s)]
*  even though his dad was like, there's something about that guy. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3076.72s)]
*  The way he sang his just the way it felt when he was on stage. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3079.72s)]
*  He was a star, man. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3083.64s)]
*  I don't think you could turn a person who isn't that into that. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3085.04s)]
*  No, not even close. No, no. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3088.32s)]
*  You can you can pump up like a pop idol. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3090.08s)]
*  You can't really pump up a rock star. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3092.84s)]
*  Right. You can make a boy band. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3094.96s)]
*  Yeah, you can make a boy band. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3096.92s)]
*  You could, you know, make Ariana Grande out of clay and send her ass out there. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3098.08s)]
*  You can't make Bob Dylan. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3103.32s)]
*  God, no, you can't. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3104.6s)]
*  Yeah, you can't do that to Jim Morrison. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3105.8s)]
*  Right. You can't do that to like a lot of those like a actual rock star. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3107.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's just that's like a flash in the pan. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3111.08s)]
*  It happened. We don't know how it happened. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3113.88s)]
*  What kind of musical star it's like it either, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3116.12s)]
*  you know, there's no way I shouldn't say no way. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3120.12s)]
*  But I don't think the intelligence agency [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3123.64s)]
*  can like get a guy and train them to be that. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3126.2799999999997s)]
*  No, you could like take a budding scene and pump it up. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3130.56s)]
*  But but that seems already there. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3136.6s)]
*  Like it was already going to exist. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3138.92s)]
*  Like it already was existing. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3140.6s)]
*  I mean, there was like the beat next stuff [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3142.04s)]
*  in New York that was already happening way before any of this. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3143.8399999999997s)]
*  So like and they were just kind of the next generation of that. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3146.3599999999997s)]
*  Just the West Coast version. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3149.52s)]
*  But, you know, there's. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3151.64s)]
*  Like that's all that was already there. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3154.12s)]
*  So, yeah, if you want to say there's like a conspiracy that they pumped it up and [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3156.04s)]
*  like put more money into like marketing their music to make sure that those [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3160.6s)]
*  artists music got sold more and played on the radio more like kind of a paola [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3165.7200000000003s)]
*  sort of thing, right, that makes sense. Yeah, that could be. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3169.48s)]
*  I don't know that it happened, but I know it's it's confusing, right? [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3172.44s)]
*  Because you want to draw conclusions, but then you're going to go, OK, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3175.76s)]
*  you can't invent jazz Joplin, you can't make that in the lab. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3178.84s)]
*  Like, you know, when she's singing Peace of My Heart, you know, like [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3182.56s)]
*  you just like that is either that's like God just kissed her with this talent. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3187.48s)]
*  You can't like engineer that, I don't think. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3193.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think there's no way. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3195.56s)]
*  But if they if they could do that, they could they could manipulate all of reality. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3197.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, if they could do that, then they should probably do another one. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3200.56s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3203.28s)]
*  I mean, the amount of times that I've seen like people on TV, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3204.92s)]
*  they're supposed to be these like massively famous artists. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3207.96s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know who any of these people are. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3210.44s)]
*  And I'm like in the age where I should still know who all these people are. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3212.5600000000004s)]
*  Like, I'm pretty young, but like, yeah, I don't know who they are. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3216.2000000000003s)]
*  And they all sound horrible. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3219.1200000000003s)]
*  Like, I don't like like this is the proof of there being some simulation where we're [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3220.52s)]
*  all just like listening to the same. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3225.0800000000004s)]
*  But I wonder if people thought that about every damn genre of music. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3226.6400000000003s)]
*  I think they did. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3230.0800000000004s)]
*  But I think there's something particularly lost about this current generation [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3231.88s)]
*  because of social media. Yeah. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3236.7200000000003s)]
*  Because of what we're talking about with those chat bots arguing with each other. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3238.8s)]
*  And we know for sure that happens all over Twitter and Instagram. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3242.1200000000003s)]
*  A lot of accounts. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3246.32s)]
*  And I think people are super confused as to like what's like a real thing. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3247.52s)]
*  Right. What's real? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3253.28s)]
*  What resonates? Like what feels what feels what's cool and what's not what's [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3254.52s)]
*  what's being promoted and artificially astroturfed and what's just fucking cool [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3259.5600000000004s)]
*  or draws people into it. And it's harder to tell now. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3264.88s)]
*  It's tricky. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3268.24s)]
*  Well, it also seems like there isn't because like, you know, you go back to, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3269.56s)]
*  let's say, like the 60s and you think like, OK, late 60s, this is the time of like [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3273.56s)]
*  Hendrix and like the Rolling Stones, the Sergeant Pepper, like, right. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3278.48s)]
*  Like the highly influential experimental musicians. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3282.48s)]
*  And yeah, cream cream was like, you know, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3285.24s)]
*  hadn't broken up the at the Bergham like 70. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3287.72s)]
*  But like the number one song in like 1969 or one of them was, you know, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3290.2s)]
*  Sugar Sugar by the Archies, like one of the most mainstream bubblegum pop [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3294.16s)]
*  songs ever. It's like there was. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3298.2s)]
*  But those like Hendrix and stuff were still there. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3300.36s)]
*  Like it was in the zeitgeist. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3303.12s)]
*  It was still popular. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3305.2799999999997s)]
*  But now it's like those types of people are nowhere to even be found. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3306.88s)]
*  And it's all just the sugar sugar type thing. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3310.88s)]
*  Interesting, interesting. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3315.04s)]
*  You know, I mean, there's still a lot of really good bands now. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3316.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, there are. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3319.52s)]
*  The thing is, like the whole music business is weird because you don't sell [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3320.2799999999997s)]
*  anything anymore other than tickets to come see people. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3324.68s)]
*  But yet there's still a giant industry [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3327.6s)]
*  that is involved in promoting and taking these artists and, you know, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3332.12s)]
*  essentially locking them up to these deals. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3337.32s)]
*  Well, yeah, because you get the ticket money. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3340.52s)]
*  Yeah, but they get the ticket money now. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3343.32s)]
*  And that's the thing. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3345.12s)]
*  The music companies didn't used to get exactly. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3346.6s)]
*  So, so, yeah, you still are going to market, distribute the way that you would have [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3349.44s)]
*  in the past. But now you're just getting your your slice of cake from a different [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3353.76s)]
*  piece, you know, you're getting it from a different area than you used to. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3359.6800000000003s)]
*  But you're still pumping them out, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3362.84s)]
*  you know, pumping them up for the same reason, ultimately to make money. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3364.36s)]
*  It's just you're getting it in a different way. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3367.7200000000003s)]
*  What I'm saying is that now a bunch of people are merging that aren't doing any [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3369.6000000000004s)]
*  of that stuff. You got like your title, the creator type dudes. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3372.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Completely disconnected. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3375.92s)]
*  That's true. Yeah, yeah. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3377.48s)]
*  Makes his own music, makes his own. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3378.44s)]
*  He's the creator of his own domain. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3380.6000000000004s)]
*  And yes, you don't need all those people. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3383.24s)]
*  And so you have this weird thing happening now where you have a lot of like [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3385.48s)]
*  AstroTurf stuff, a lot of stuff that's just like thrown out there to try to get [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3390.68s)]
*  people to link it sounds like stuff that people like and it's created. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3395.64s)]
*  But you still have a lot more opportunity [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3399.3199999999997s)]
*  for legit artists to just like Zach Brian just emerged from like TikTok clips or [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3402.12s)]
*  whatever they were. Yeah, right. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3407.52s)]
*  YouTube clips. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3408.52s)]
*  Yeah, there's always going to be the ones who come out in like the indie way, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3409.36s)]
*  you know, like like what Tarantino was for like movies, you know, like come out like [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3414.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm doing this all on my own. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3419.1200000000003s)]
*  And like there's always going to be those people. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3420.6000000000004s)]
*  I just think it seems like there's not a lot of those. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3422.84s)]
*  Yeah, but when they break through, it fucking means something. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3426.36s)]
*  Yes. Like Oliver Anthony. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3430.6000000000004s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3432.56s)]

*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3437.56s)]
*  How about that? [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3438.64s)]
*  Everybody at home will be right back. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3439.6800000000003s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3441.96s)]
*  Oh, my God. Yeah, man. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3443.52s)]
*  Dude. See, that's that Jesus exists. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3445.92s)]
*  Right. So in the middle of all this honey, honey, sugar, sugar shit, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3451.48s)]
*  there's still there's still Oliver Anthony. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3456.04s)]
*  There's still people out there that are legit. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3459.04s)]
*  They're legit. There's a bunch, man. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3461.8s)]
*  There's a lot. There's just a lot of noise. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3463.84s)]
*  Yes, true. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3466.16s)]
*  And I think I also just don't try to find things as much. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3467.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like I don't like [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3471.24s)]
*  pursue it the way I probably should, because in my head I just have this [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3473.08s)]
*  bias of like, if it came out in the last 20 years, I don't care. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3476.92s)]
*  It's hard to find stuff. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3480.56s)]
*  You know, it's like I get suggestions from a lot of my friends. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3482.16s)]
*  That's some of the best songs. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3484.92s)]
*  But also Spotify has a really good I work for Spotify. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3487.2s)]
*  But for real, their suggestion thing is [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3491.56s)]
*  it's amazing. The the algorithm's very good. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3494.24s)]

*  Yeah, it's like that's what's interesting, too, about people curating their own [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3532.6400000000003s)]
*  playlists like like there's a bunch of my friends that will give me their playlists. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3536.1600000000003s)]

*  You are a doctor, though, right? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3634.04s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3635.92s)]
*  I mean, as much as, you know, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3637.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm guilty as charged, I self diagnosed myself with ADHD. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3639.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but you know, but you know yourself better than anybody else. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3643.6s)]
*  So you should be able to self-dignify. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3647.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, I don't think necessarily ADHD is even totally real. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3649.6s)]
*  You know, I think it's one of those things for people that just think [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3653.72s)]
*  differently and they're fucking bored as shit and they can't pay attention to stuff [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3656.52s)]
*  that sucks when there probably is some disorder in it. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3659.64s)]
*  But to like. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3664.0s)]
*  Because I don't think it's wrong to say that there is like a thing, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3665.8799999999997s)]
*  but to say that it's like a disorder and that it's negative and that it needs to be [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3668.9199999999996s)]
*  treated is different, like I don't think ADHD necessarily needs to be treated. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3672.9199999999996s)]
*  It just needs to be like funneled. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3677.16s)]
*  It's only disorder because we have a very rigid civilization. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3678.8799999999997s)]
*  Exactly. If we so we don't live in accordance to the way our bodies were [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3682.16s)]
*  designed, our bodies were designed to be hunter gatherers. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3687.68s)]
*  That's the reality. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3691.24s)]
*  That's the reality because it takes so long. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3692.6s)]
*  You become a hunter and gatherer. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3695.16s)]
*  And it took like hundreds of thousands of years for us to be good at it. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3696.68s)]
*  And we've only been living in civilization for a little tiny, little blink of time. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3700.7999999999997s)]
*  So our fucking programming is all not to sit still all day, not to stare at a fucking [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3705.16s)]
*  teacher, not to be bored memorizing shit. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3711.3199999999997s)]
*  Our old thing is like, be active, do something, learn, get excited about something. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3713.6s)]
*  So we have like an entire forgotten group [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3717.96s)]
*  of people that have so much energy and they have all these interests that are [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3721.12s)]
*  not what you're dulling them down with all day long. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3725.12s)]
*  And they could learn in a way better [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3728.7999999999997s)]
*  manner by just like participating in things and reading stuff as well. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3731.4s)]
*  But having a teacher that actually is [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3736.04s)]
*  enthusiastic about it, where they get you excited about it, like not having to sit [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3738.04s)]
*  down all day, you're fucking 10, you want to run, you want to play with your friends, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3741.7599999999998s)]
*  you want to have fun and you sit there and by the end of the day, like, I hate school. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3746.3199999999997s)]
*  Yes, it's fucking boring. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3750.88s)]
*  School sucks. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3752.4s)]
*  School ruins everything. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3753.7200000000003s)]
*  It ruins the natural love of learning that I think most humans have. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3756.2000000000003s)]
*  It's ruined by schools because one, you're there way longer than you should be. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3761.88s)]
*  There's no reason a kid should be in school for eight hours, nine hours sometimes. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3766.48s)]
*  Why would an eight year old need to be in school that long? [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3770.5600000000004s)]
*  It's a real good question. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3773.8s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3774.5600000000004s)]
*  What are they actually what are you teaching a 10 year old? [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3775.6400000000003s)]
*  In eight hours, like that they're going to remember. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3779.52s)]
*  And also, I mean, like, don't have you don't have to have recess. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3782.32s)]
*  You don't have to have all these extra things like you can shorten all this down, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3785.04s)]
*  make it more streamlined and have kids home. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3788.44s)]
*  But it's just to prepare people for a nine to five. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3790.6400000000003s)]
*  And so many two parents or so many households have both parents working. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3793.6s)]
*  So it's like, well, it is kind of nice to not have a babysitter. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3797.0s)]
*  You just send your kid to school and, you know, have your kid be a latchkey kid. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3800.04s)]
*  Like I was like I was too. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3804.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3805.8s)]
*  That was a normal thing back then. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3806.76s)]
*  You know, no one thought twice about letting your kids just go outside. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3808.36s)]
*  Like all the kids in the neighborhood, we all grew up like that. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3811.88s)]
*  We all would just go over each other's houses. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3813.96s)]
*  We just come home from school. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3815.4s)]
*  His home. He had a key. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3816.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, yeah, I would just come in and saw like playing guitar or something. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3818.0800000000004s)]
*  I mean, I didn't go around and the neighborhood. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3821.92s)]
*  And it was a lot of meth labs, a lot of fully functioning. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3824.1600000000003s)]
*  You live in meth labs and you're a kid. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3826.28s)]
*  Yeah. No shit, dude. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3827.92s)]
*  Fully functioning. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3829.32s)]
*  Where do you live? [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3830.52s)]
*  Well, East Texas, which is, you know, don't have to say don't rat anybody out. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3831.6400000000003s)]
*  The address. Yeah. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3835.0s)]
*  Some right now. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3838.4s)]
*  The mother fucker. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3839.6800000000003s)]
*  I remember him. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3840.76s)]
*  I'm going to fucking find him. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3841.84s)]
*  Yeah. Well, they've actually all kind of blown themselves up since then. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3843.0800000000004s)]
*  Funny how that works. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3846.56s)]
*  Yeah. It's a yeah. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3847.44s)]
*  Nature really has a way of taking care of itself. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3848.6000000000004s)]
*  You know, it's such a crazy decision to make. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3850.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm going to cook meth in a trailer. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3854.04s)]
*  Yeah. One blew up like the one next to my house blew up not that long ago. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3855.56s)]
*  Like I was just asleep. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3861.2400000000002s)]
*  I thought I heard a shotgun and looked and there's just fire. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3862.2000000000003s)]
*  And I was like, what is this? [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3864.36s)]
*  I'm imagining a slow mo of the trailer [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3866.04s)]
*  blowing up with that Oliver Anthony song playing in the background. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3868.8s)]
*  Yeah. You'd be you wouldn't be far off. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3872.6000000000004s)]
*  Boom. Yeah, it's pretty close. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3875.2400000000002s)]
*  But yeah, meth labs are known. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3878.44s)]
*  They are known to go up badly. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3880.32s)]
*  Yeah. It was not a neighborhood that you go like ride bikes around and like play [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3882.1200000000003s)]
*  and shit like that, but because you're cooking meth and you're on meth. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3887.0s)]
*  So right. Yeah. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3890.2000000000003s)]
*  And even if you're not on meth, you're in contact with it all the time. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3891.32s)]
*  So you're probably getting at least a skin high. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3894.72s)]
*  And they're not using like, you know, high grade equipment. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3897.0s)]
*  I mean, they're wearing like, you know, some like cheap gloves. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3900.36s)]
*  Maybe. I mean, most of us barehanded, you know, they're like old school hat makers. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3904.72s)]
*  You know, they would get mercury poisoning and go crazy. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3908.36s)]
*  What's really crazy is that we look at that and we say that is so nuts that people [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3910.6s)]
*  take meth. Why would you do that? [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3915.16s)]
*  And yet what percentage of kids today are on Adderall, which is the exact same thing, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3917.4s)]
*  just a slow release, a delayed release meth. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3923.08s)]
*  What percentage? If you had to guess. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3925.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's probably lower than we think, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3928.44s)]
*  because in my head, I think it's like 40 percent, but it's probably about 15. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3930.64s)]
*  If I'm just if I'm really guessing, like trying to win some money. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3935.04s)]
*  That's a lot of still a lot. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3937.88s)]
*  That's still so many kids. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3939.7999999999997s)]
*  That's crazy. More than one out of 10. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3941.52s)]
*  And that's so crazy. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3943.52s)]
*  That's just the idea that is so nuts. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3945.48s)]
*  They're all on meth. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3947.84s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3949.48s)]
*  And that's an ADHD thing, right? [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3950.92s)]
*  They give it to you any of ADHD. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3952.6s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Riddle. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3954.12s)]
*  Yeah. I used to be ADHD medication when I was a kid. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3954.88s)]
*  I would run through. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3957.56s)]
*  I would take my clothes off, ran through the woods. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3958.92s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3961.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3962.4s)]
*  Well, what's crazy is just turns kids into a zombie. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3965.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3968.44s)]
*  Like it's it's so sad. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3969.16s)]
*  Like I used to work in a pharmacy for a long time and just seeing like how many [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3971.6s)]
*  parents are coming in there, giving their kids, their kids just like zonked out. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3976.44s)]
*  They look like they're in one floor of the Cougars. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3979.56s)]

*  It's spooky that you can get a doctor to tell you that's cool, too. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3996.3999999999996s)]
*  As long as the doctor tells you it's OK. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=3999.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he needs that. Oh, great. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4001.2799999999997s)]
*  Look, we got medication for him. We're going to be fine. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4003.08s)]
*  Little Billy's gonna be fine because you come home from school or from work, [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4004.64s)]
*  rather your feet hurt. You fucking sit down, take your shoes off. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4007.48s)]
*  The kid's fucking sword fighting with his brother in the middle of the living [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4010.0s)]
*  room like, hey, you got to stop. You got to listen to me. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4013.16s)]
*  Hey, you little fucker. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4015.88s)]
*  You're so tired. Your ankle hurts. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4017.48s)]
*  You can't get up. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4019.12s)]
*  Like Medicaid, this little motherfucker. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4020.28s)]
*  Medicaid. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4022.36s)]
*  Yes, because it's easy to do. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4023.56s)]
*  And you have a doctor telling you it's OK. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4025.48s)]
*  So that immediately gives you some like [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4027.44s)]
*  reassurance that why would a medical professional tell me this is a medical [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4029.08s)]
*  professional? And he gives me my medication. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4033.0s)]
*  He allows me to get through my day as well. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4034.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4037.0s)]
*  Oh, I mean, it's a great Rolling Stones song. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4038.96s)]
*  Remember that Mother's Little Helper? [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4041.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mother. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4043.3599999999997s)]
*  That's what it's called, right? Yeah, it is. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4045.16s)]
*  It is a great fucking song. Great. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4046.52s)]
*  I mean, running for the shelter. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4048.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think that was the Valium days, right? [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4050.12s)]
*  Was that what it was? Well, yeah. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4052.92s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if they didn't [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4054.3599999999997s)]
*  necessarily call it that, but there was like speed and Valium, right? [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4055.52s)]
*  Like an upper and a downer. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4058.72s)]
*  And you know, you take the upper to get all your chores done as a housewife. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4060.04s)]
*  And then you take the downer. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4063.8399999999997s)]
*  So you didn't kill your kids. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4064.8799999999997s)]
*  They prescribed those to people like candy. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4066.96s)]
*  Yeah, forever. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4070.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, I think they figured out that Valium is like super addictive, right? [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4072.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think they legitimately didn't know back then. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4075.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Any excuse after that? [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4078.6400000000003s)]
*  You're out of your mind, like the Oxycontin bulls, you know, with all that. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4080.92s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, for sure. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4083.8s)]
*  They knew about Oxycontin being they knew that was essentially heroin. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4085.0s)]
*  I mean, that's one of the great moments [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4088.0s)]
*  in that Peter Berg docu-series on Netflix, where the docu-drama series, [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4089.76s)]
*  where the guy is breaking it down to him, the doctors breaking down to him. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4095.72s)]
*  Like you're when the hot girl comes in, just pitching that stuff. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4099.4s)]
*  And he's like, you're selling heroin. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4102.28s)]
*  Yeah, you need to. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4104.2s)]
*  This is exactly the same thing as heroin. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4105.08s)]
*  You tell him, I should put my patients on heroin. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4106.92s)]
*  Or what are you doing? [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4109.92s)]
*  Like, you know, the lone ethical doctor, right? [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4111.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, fucking shitty little house that he lives in. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4115.04s)]
*  You know, because he doesn't like the big because he doesn't make the big money [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4117.92s)]
*  because he's a good guy, which is like, unfortunately, not unrealistic. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4120.64s)]
*  Like, you know, that's how it is. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4125.72s)]
*  Yeah. Because if you prescribe it, they give you, you know, a five hundred dollar [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4126.92s)]
*  gift card to, you know, a steakhouse, they'll, you know, they'll buy you a new car. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4130.080000000001s)]
*  Well, that all that stuff's nuts. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4134.360000000001s)]
*  You know, like with a certain amount of vaccines, if 60 percent of your patients [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4136.240000000001s)]
*  or more are vaccinated, you get a larger incentive. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4141.320000000001s)]
*  So you like pushing it. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4144.04s)]
*  The whole thing is nuts. It's nuts that that's legal. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4145.6s)]
*  Incentivizing anything medical, medical isn't. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4148.32s)]
*  I mean, why are you doing that? [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4152.6s)]
*  Like, dude, there was a guy that got arrested. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4154.16s)]
*  I forget how many patients it was, but he was an oncologist and he was giving [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4156.68s)]
*  people chemotherapy that didn't have cancer because chemotherapy is very profitable. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4162.4800000000005s)]
*  So this piece of shit was telling people [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4167.0s)]
*  that they had cancer and then giving them fucking chemotherapy. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4169.08s)]
*  That's just for money. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4173.28s)]
*  That sucks. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4175.52s)]
*  There's a special. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4176.76s)]
*  It was like a bunch of people. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4177.64s)]
*  And I think he had some insane excuse when they asked, you know, that you eat what you [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4179.64s)]
*  kill, you know, that that philosophy that they kind of have in medical school. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4185.4400000000005s)]
*  You have to do surgeries because that's how you get your money. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4189.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Like, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4192.52s)]
*  I thought you were fixing folks. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4194.6s)]
*  I didn't think this is all about you making money. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4196.72s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4199.6s)]
*  And that the fact that they incentivize you to do that. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4201.08s)]
*  So a pharmaceutical drug company can incentivize you to push their stuff. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4204.76s)]
*  Right. Whoa. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4209.92s)]
*  You had to push their medicine over another medicine, even though their medicine [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4210.8s)]
*  might have more side effects or maybe not even be the exact right one. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4213.92s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4218.04s)]
*  I'm on a couple of pharmaceuticals. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4218.8s)]
*  What are you on? [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4221.12s)]
*  If effects are and I took a clonopin about two hours ago. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4222.4800000000005s)]
*  So, well, what a small, very small dose. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4226.320000000001s)]
*  It actually did absolutely nothing. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4228.88s)]
*  So maybe kicks in at five. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4230.8s)]
*  We'll find out. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4233.0s)]
*  I'm laid out. What is effects? [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4234.32s)]
*  Or is that necessary? Yeah, it's necessary. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4235.32s)]
*  But when did you start getting on that stuff? [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4237.64s)]
*  I started taking those [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4240.12s)]
*  part 2013. Wow. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4242.4s)]
*  Yeah. And I've never noticed a difference. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4244.44s)]
*  I just keep taking them because I think at some point it's going to work. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4246.96s)]
*  But [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4250.2s)]
*  you never know. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4254.28s)]
*  Sometimes there's like a delay in the effectiveness. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4255.08s)]
*  Have you ever gone off them just to see what it feels like? [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4258.36s)]
*  Yeah, because I started. Well, whenever I started drinking a lot, [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4260.72s)]
*  I was like, it said you're not supposed to do both. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4263.32s)]
*  I'll just take the alcohol. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4267.2s)]
*  I'll take the depressant over the anti-depressant. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4268.96s)]
*  The alcohol worked. For sure. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4270.719999999999s)]
*  Really interesting. Well, that night it worked real well. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4272.32s)]
*  And then the next day it's like, you know, that's the problem. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4274.96s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, if my ceiling was stronger, I'd have a noose hanging up there. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4277.88s)]
*  But yeah, well, you know, it's like someone's got to design a better alcohol. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4281.36s)]
*  Someone's got to design something that, first of all, doesn't massively fuck up [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4285.16s)]
*  your motor functions. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4289.639999999999s)]
*  You know, which is the most dangerous part of alcohol is like, [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4291.84s)]
*  your body's not functioning right. I want that to happen. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4294.76s)]
*  I like that. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4297.56s)]
*  I like the whole feeling. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4299.68s)]
*  You like just stumbling? Yeah. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4301.360000000001s)]
*  Being hammered? Yeah, I like waking up and being like, why is my knee bleeding? [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4303.240000000001s)]
*  Like, that's a great feeling. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4307.280000000001s)]
*  It's definitely fun to be had. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4311.04s)]
*  But it's just like you're agreeing, just like you're agreeing when you're [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4312.72s)]
*  smoking cigarettes, like I'm giving up some health here for this experience. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4316.160000000001s)]
*  There's like a quote, I don't know whose it is, it's definitely not mine. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4321.92s)]
*  But like getting drunk is you're just buying happiness from tomorrow. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4325.2s)]
*  It's a great quote. It makes sense. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4330.04s)]
*  Because that is what you're doing. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4331.48s)]
*  You're getting twice as happy. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4332.4s)]
*  But tomorrow you're going to have zero happiness. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4333.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I was buying like weeks ahead. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4337.32s)]

*  the better at wrestling you are for an alligator. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4502.08s)]
*  You don't want to be 120 pounds and jump on the back of an alligator. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4505.360000000001s)]

*  to jump on the back of an alligator because they roll. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4510.76s)]
*  Like their whole thing is rolling. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4512.96s)]
*  But they wouldn't be able to roll quite as much. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4514.12s)]
*  If I'm on the back of an alligator, that thing is not budging. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4516.360000000001s)]

*  I've seen so many videos, [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4529.76s)]
*  especially crocs, when dudes like they put their arm in a croc [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4532.0s)]
*  and the croc says like not today. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4535.0s)]
*  Well, see, crocodiles are different. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4537.4400000000005s)]
*  Crocodiles are very vicious. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4538.96s)]
*  An alligator is basically just a giant turtle. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4540.200000000001s)]
*  I mean, you could just smack that thing around. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4542.4400000000005s)]
*  It's not going to do anything to you. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4544.120000000001s)]

*  If they get a hold of you, they'll take you and drag you under a log. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4553.0s)]
*  It's just they're not as aggressive as crocs. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4555.56s)]
*  Crocs actively target people, whereas alligators are like if you fuck up. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4558.04s)]
*  There's a fun story. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4561.96s)]
*  Guy was in a police chase in Florida. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4563.120000000001s)]

*  He gets killed by an alligator right in front of a big one too. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4576.04s)]

*  Sometimes the universe is there with a 13 footer. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4583.6s)]
*  Like right when you dive in, you're like, oh no! [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4588.0s)]
*  Quiet! [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4590.88s)]

*  And it is it's kind of terrifying. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4602.76s)]
*  Hearing the the the I can't make the sound, but that like, [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4604.92s)]
*  you know, that sound they make. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4608.24s)]
*  They're dinosaurs. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4609.68s)]
*  Yeah, they're heartless, soulless eating machines. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4610.84s)]
*  I was going to take a piss by a tree and just heard that sound. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4614.28s)]
*  I was like, it was nighttime. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4617.68s)]
*  So I'm like, oh, I don't I don't like that. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4619.4800000000005s)]
*  That just happened. That's not good. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4621.92s)]
*  And look around. There's one not like super close, but close enough to get a good [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4623.32s)]
*  look and be like, oh, when I was a kid, I lived in Florida from age 11 to 13. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4628.0s)]
*  We lived in Gainesville, which is why Bud's place called Lake Alice and Lake [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4633.92s)]
*  Alice had all kinds of alligators and people would go there and feed them [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4638.28s)]
*  marshmallows, chuck marshmallows in the water. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4643.2s)]
*  And then they eventually told you, hey, stop doing that. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4645.4400000000005s)]
*  It's bad for the alligators. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4647.08s)]
*  But alligators were like a protected species back then. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4648.4800000000005s)]
*  I'd have been dressing up like an alligator so quick. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4651.400000000001s)]
*  But it was so weird to be like I lived in San Francisco before that. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4655.360000000001s)]
*  So you see nothing. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4659.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden dinosaurs like legit dinosaurs. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4660.400000000001s)]
*  Why? And I remember being a little kid [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4663.36s)]
*  thinking, why is everybody so goddamn comfortable being around these huge fucking [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4665.12s)]
*  lizards? It is crazy when you go to Florida because I'm I'm pretty close to Caddo [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4669.08s)]
*  Lake, which I'm familiar with Caddo Lake, but it's no it's like the largest [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4673.24s)]
*  natural lake in Texas. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4677.4s)]
*  It looks like you went back in time five million years, 60 million years. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4679.08s)]
*  Like it's the scariest looking place on the planet. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4683.5199999999995s)]
*  And they're just filled with alligators. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4686.48s)]
*  So we would go there as a kid all the time. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4688.8s)]
*  And yeah, you see alligators and you're just like, but nobody cares. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4690.44s)]
*  People are just like out barbecue and like grill and up against the light. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4692.96s)]
*  And, you know, obviously the meat being around like these alligators just come up. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4696.64s)]
*  Just don't care. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4700.68s)]
*  They're like, all right. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4701.72s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4702.68s)]
*  Yeah. So crazy that people just tolerate dinosaurs. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4704.32s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I guess just, you know, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4707.68s)]
*  they don't do anything to people like unprovoked, really, like as far as I know. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4710.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, well, they can. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4715.28s)]
*  They certainly should. Yeah, for sure. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4716.8s)]
*  But they're just like they're so overpopulated now. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4718.76s)]
*  And they're all over Florida. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4721.599999999999s)]
*  They say essentially any body of water in Florida that still there's a potential [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4723.4s)]
*  for an alligator being inside of it because they just travel at night and go [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4727.32s)]
*  into a new lake and sit there and wait. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4730.719999999999s)]
*  They can hold their breath for hours. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4732.88s)]
*  I would have to eat for a year. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4735.04s)]
*  Like, what? Like, what? [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4737.48s)]
*  What are we doing? Oh, my God. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4739.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, that is. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4743.04s)]
*  Yep. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4744.28s)]
*  Have you ever heard of alligator gars? [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4745.36s)]
*  Yeah, we have them. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4748.16s)]
*  Yeah. So like my family, I love them. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4749.28s)]
*  Living Gonzalez on a familiar with that is by San Antonio. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4750.88s)]
*  And they go like both fishing for guards. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4754.24s)]
*  And we used to go fishing for guards, [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4756.04s)]
*  like in a spillway, just fish for these bastards. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4757.599999999999s)]
*  You can't eat them. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4760.16s)]
*  Apparently you can. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4761.44s)]
*  You could smoke them. That's what I heard. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4762.44s)]
*  We would just pull up and then smash their head with a rock. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4764.12s)]
*  How rude. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4766.599999999999s)]
*  What am I supposed to do? [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4767.8s)]
*  My point was some guy just caught a world record in Texas. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4769.44s)]
*  I think it was out in [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4772.88s)]
*  Lakeway. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4774.88s)]
*  I forget where it was, but it was seven feet long. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4776.0s)]
*  See if you could find it. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4779.56s)]
*  And he caught it on like two pound test or something crazy. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4780.8s)]
*  No, that was a lake trout. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4783.84s)]
*  Different story. There's got to be bigger ones than that. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4785.320000000001s)]
*  Then seven feet. I wonder if it was. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4788.92s)]
*  Jesus, look at the size of that thing, man. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4791.0s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4793.6s)]
*  That is Houston Chronicle. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4794.88s)]
*  So look at the size of that thing. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4796.56s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4797.96s)]
*  That's so big. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4799.72s)]
*  That two hundred and twelve pound alligator gars. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4801.0s)]
*  16. And those things, man, look like they're from a different era. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4803.6s)]
*  Those things look like they're not supposed to exist. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4808.0s)]
*  Like that is a goddamn prehistoric creature. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4810.64s)]
*  Pull up some photos, Jamie, of alligator gars. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4813.84s)]
*  They also don't attack people. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4816.88s)]
*  No, no, they don't. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4818.8s)]
*  Very kind of skittish. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4819.84s)]
*  But my kids found out that they're in lakes now. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4821.4800000000005s)]
*  And they're like, fuck this. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4824.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4826.160000000001s)]
*  I don't blame them. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4827.360000000001s)]
*  You don't have to take a chance with those things. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4828.76s)]
*  Look at their face. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4830.160000000001s)]
*  Look at that photo. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4831.280000000001s)]
*  Look at that face, man. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4832.240000000001s)]
*  That looks like something from a book on dinosaurs. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4833.28s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4836.5199999999995s)]
*  It's like a sturgeon, like this huge sturgeon in Alaska. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4837.24s)]
*  We're like, oh, from a different time. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4840.2s)]
*  Yeah. A sturgeon looks like it doesn't belong in this time. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4842.0s)]
*  Look at that thing, man. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4844.88s)]
*  I don't like that. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4846.32s)]
*  But even the eyes, it just looks primitive, like a shit early design, like a 1955 Ford. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4847.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4853.8s)]
*  It's like, what were you doing back then? [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4854.5599999999995s)]
*  Like, that's a shit design. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4856.48s)]
*  It's an edsel. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4857.96s)]
*  That stupid eyeball at the end of the mouth. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4858.5199999999995s)]
*  It looks dumb. Right. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4860.5599999999995s)]
*  Make that picture bigger. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4863.08s)]
*  The one that's you got. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4864.0s)]
*  That's big right now. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4864.92s)]
*  Look, it's look how fucking crazy that is. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4865.8s)]
*  It's a god. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4869.76s)]
*  Tommy is so crazy. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4871.84s)]
*  Look at that thing, man. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4873.68s)]
*  Never go. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4874.96s)]
*  They only give you a small ver. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4875.64s)]
*  Isn't that weird? What a weird even if you open it. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4877.0s)]
*  Oh, there it is. That's so strange. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4879.4s)]
*  Wow. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4881.6s)]
*  But look how bad that design is. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4882.72s)]
*  That's like, you know what it's like? [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4884.76s)]
*  It's like you ever see like a Dodge Charger, like a 69 Charger, a badass looking car. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4886.4400000000005s)]
*  But like, why is it so long and goofy? [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4891.24s)]
*  Like, what's going on? [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4893.12s)]
*  It's like old time. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4894.12s)]
*  They haven't figured out proportions yet. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4895.44s)]
*  Looks weird. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4897.2s)]
*  Yeah, that thing looks weird. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4898.36s)]
*  It doesn't look modern. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4899.92s)]
*  It looks like it's from a different time. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4901.24s)]
*  It's definitely not modern. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4902.92s)]
*  Why does it have a nose? [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4904.2s)]
*  Probably slammed into things. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4906.04s)]
*  Like a whole nose. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4908.04s)]
*  That's like a real nostril. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4908.96s)]
*  Doesn't it breathe another way unless it can breathe above? [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4910.36s)]
*  Is that a nostril you think? [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4913.16s)]
*  Well, it does look like a nostril. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4915.16s)]
*  See if there's other ones that show that same thing. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4917.2s)]
*  That's crazy if that's a nostril. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4919.88s)]
*  That could just be a hole in its nose. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4921.2s)]
*  It could. But I think unless they're like, no. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4922.84s)]
*  Oh, God, it does look like a nostril. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4925.4400000000005s)]
*  They all have a little nostril. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4927.6s)]
*  Find out if it can alligator guards breathe air because there are some fish that gulp air. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4929.2s)]
*  Have you ever seen that? [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4934.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4935.280000000001s)]
*  When they go up, they actually can gulp air. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4935.96s)]
*  There's no oxygen in the water. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4937.72s)]
*  I mean, these things all look like they have nostrils. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4940.320000000001s)]
*  They have nostrils. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4943.08s)]
*  So the primary respiratory organ is a swim bladder, which can be used to breathe [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4944.16s)]
*  in air when needed, especially in low oxygen environments. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4947.6s)]
*  Wow. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4951.200000000001s)]
*  But they do breathe using gills at the top. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4952.0s)]
*  They say they have gills and nostrils. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4954.120000000001s)]
*  That's nuts. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4956.52s)]
*  Like it says, like most fish have nostrils. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4958.4800000000005s)]
*  I didn't know that. Most fish have nostrils. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4960.92s)]
*  However, they have a unique adaptation, a swim bladder connected to their mouth. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4963.200000000001s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4968.88s)]
*  And swim bladder functions as a lung, allowing them to breathe air. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4969.72s)]
*  See, that's why they're still around. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4973.320000000001s)]
*  When when did these motherfuckers first start being around? [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4974.68s)]
*  Like how long have they been on Earth for? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4977.72s)]
*  I'm going to guess millions. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4980.080000000001s)]
*  Oh, right. Yeah. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4982.200000000001s)]

*  That seems like a many million year old fish. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4984.52s)]
*  I would guess like. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4987.160000000001s)]
*  100. Oh, there is 100 million in the Cretaceous. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=4989.320000000001s)]

*  I mean, that's how he found he busted that guy at that market, you know, [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5093.48s)]
*  the servant human meat that guy killed and ate people. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5096.639999999999s)]
*  And then he was forgiven because he found Jesus. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5100.4s)]
*  Yeah. And then he became a pastor. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5103.12s)]
*  Oh, amazing. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5106.04s)]
*  Well, he would take off all his clothes [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5107.679999999999s)]
*  and go into battle and kill people while his butt naked with a machete, [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5109.88s)]
*  with a machete. Yeah. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5113.88s)]
*  He would find children, kill them, cut their heart out and eat it so that he [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5114.799999999999s)]
*  would become invincible. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5119.56s)]

*  That's the thing. You can dismiss it all you want. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5129.0s)]
*  Yeah, but the proof is in the pudding, as they say. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5131.360000000001s)]
*  The devil has very specific rules. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5133.92s)]
*  If you want the superpower from monster to minister is the past about to catch [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5136.080000000001s)]
*  up to Liberia's war criminals. So that's the thing is Liberia. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5139.72s)]
*  OK, do you know the history of Liberia? [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5142.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, with James Monroe and Monroe. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5143.96s)]
*  I mean, well, I know, like, that it was a colony, [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5146.080000000001s)]
*  basically to send African like slaves, slaves back to Africa. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5148.24s)]
*  Exactly. And that's why the capital's Monrovia is named after James Monroe. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5152.96s)]
*  It is an insane place. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5157.16s)]
*  In the weeks before he found Jesus, [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5158.84s)]
*  the evangelist formerly known as General Butt Naked reckons he was sacrificing four [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5160.639999999999s)]
*  or five children a day. Oh, my God. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5164.84s)]
*  Murder had long come naturally to him. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5168.48s)]
*  He was only 11 when the elders who had steeped him in the ways of witchcraft [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5171.12s)]
*  first handed him the sacrificial knife. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5175.36s)]
*  But he never killed with such intensity [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5178.36s)]
*  and ferocity as during those weeks in mid 1996, when Liberia's first civil war [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5180.599999999999s)]
*  reached its calamitous climax and the blood soaked streaks of Monrovia, [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5185.16s)]
*  the country's battered capital. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5189.84s)]
*  Several times a day, the warlord and his battalion of boys, all naked as he was, [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5191.92s)]
*  would emerge into the maelstrom firing wildly as they added their own breed [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5195.92s)]
*  of terror to the chaos. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5201.32s)]
*  Wow. Yet the bloodletting always began [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5205.36s)]
*  before a single bullet had been fired before each engagement. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5207.5199999999995s)]
*  Butt naked pagan priests and holy warrior would lay a child face down on the [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5211.0s)]
*  sacrificial table, slice open its victims back and pull out [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5215.4s)]
*  their still beating heart, thus ensuring magical protection for the coming battle. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5218.759999999999s)]
*  Fucking yo, it's not really like a nice thing to do to someone. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5225.28s)]
*  I mean, fucking yeah, that's that's insane. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5230.24s)]
*  I mean, I don't care if you found Jesus, but he found Jesus. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5232.88s)]
*  Hold on. He found Jesus. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5235.88s)]
*  Is that actually why he got let off or more than 20 years later? [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5238.16s)]
*  General Butt naked, Nom de Gur, evangelist Joshua Milton, blah. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5243.2s)]
*  He no longer cares to use, has never appeared in court for the war crimes he [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5248.76s)]
*  so freely admits to, neither for that matter as anyone else, not in Liberia at least. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5253.320000000001s)]
*  That's pretty crazy. So they didn't. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5258.76s)]
*  So that's how bad. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5260.360000000001s)]
*  If he got off, they just didn't even try. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5261.76s)]
*  That's how bad that place is. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5264.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, because he was under what's that guy's name? [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5266.320000000001s)]
*  Charles Taylor. Charles Taylor is an absolute nut job as well. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5268.0s)]
*  You ever seen Machine Gun Preacher with Gerard Butler? [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5271.6s)]

*  When does this one when this one come out? [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5279.76s)]
*  Maybe 2014, 2015 or so. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5281.56s)]
*  So decently old 2011. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5284.8s)]
*  OK, yeah. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5287.400000000001s)]
*  But it's based on true story of a guy who, you know, had like some alcohol, [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5288.360000000001s)]
*  like drug issues, I believe, and here it is. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5291.88s)]
*  Machine Gun Preacher. Yeah. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5294.92s)]

*  Yeah, we do my favorite. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5302.84s)]
*  I mean, no. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5303.88s)]
*  Yeah, he went to Africa like this guy. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5305.0s)]
*  Yeah, went to Africa and started building these, like, you know, kind of, [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5307.4400000000005s)]
*  I guess, not orphanage, but like schools basically. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5311.4400000000005s)]
*  And then obviously, you know, the warlords would come in and burn these schools down [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5313.84s)]
*  because they didn't want to be built and try to take the money that's being donated. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5317.56s)]
*  So he started like going over there like he was at one point just kind of, [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5321.4s)]
*  you know, getting money and sending it there. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5325.96s)]
*  And then he was like, well, I'll actually go over there [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5328.32s)]
*  with weapons and I'll protect these schools. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5331.04s)]
*  And it's basically what he did. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5333.639999999999s)]
*  It's a pretty crazy story. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5335.5599999999995s)]
*  The movie is phenomenal. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5336.8s)]

*  Which is really great about the early days of Vice. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5343.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah. The early days of Vice, man, [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5346.32s)]

*  It was the Cannibal Warlords of Liberia was the documentary. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5353.16s)]
*  They would go everywhere. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5356.400000000001s)]
*  All the crazy places. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5358.24s)]
*  They would go to all parts of the world. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5359.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5362.2s)]
*  Yeah. Amazing. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5363.68s)]
*  Like just how crazy people are. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5365.16s)]
*  People that don't visit those places, the world, they don't see like the look [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5367.52s)]
*  in the eyes of people that have been to all those dangerous parts. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5372.0s)]
*  Like my friend Shane, Shane Smith from Vice. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5375.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5378.0s)]
*  He's got this when he starts talking about these places that he's been, [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5378.44s)]
*  especially the early days, like there's like he has an understanding of the [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5381.639999999999s)]
*  dangers of the outside world that I think us in this little gated community we [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5385.12s)]
*  call the United States, we're very, very ignorant about how fucking [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5388.88s)]
*  sideways things have gone in other parts of the world right now. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5393.5199999999995s)]
*  While you're enjoying Netflix, cuddling up with your sweetheart, eating popcorn. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5397.759999999999s)]
*  There's parts of the world right now where [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5401.92s)]
*  someone's cutting out a child's heart to eat it before they go to battle. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5403.48s)]
*  Like maybe not in the same timeline, but close enough. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5407.0s)]
*  Not I mean, who knows? [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5410.12s)]
*  He's not doing it doesn't mean somebody else is happening right now in certain [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5411.6s)]
*  war torn parts of the world and we just think, well, you know, [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5415.96s)]
*  what we really need is equity like we do. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5420.68s)]
*  What about the climate? [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5423.76s)]
*  The climate should be our number one priority. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5425.12s)]
*  Like actually, you need to stay safe. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5428.08s)]
*  You need to fucking stay safe and you need to understand there's a bunch of spots [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5430.92s)]
*  that aren't safe. Yeah. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5434.24s)]
*  Well, and also, yeah, climate change. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5435.5199999999995s)]
*  Sure. Worry about it. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5437.719999999999s)]
*  But like that kid's going to get his heart ripped out in the next 15 minutes. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5438.639999999999s)]
*  Let's go ahead and like worry about him. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5442.08s)]
*  That's probably number one. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5443.599999999999s)]
*  And then, yeah, let's go ahead and worry about him for a little bit. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5444.5199999999995s)]
*  Then we'll go to climate after that. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5447.32s)]
*  People who are good people don't want to believe that there's bad people in the [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5449.2s)]
*  world. And I understand that reluctance. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5453.44s)]
*  I understand you have this perspective and in your world that you've cultivated, [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5455.36s)]
*  you probably are safe because you've cultivated this world of a bunch of people [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5459.48s)]
*  that share the world view of you. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5462.84s)]
*  But when you enter into other people's spaces and you are ignorant to their [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5464.72s)]
*  culture and how crazy we're like, I read about this this couple has decided [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5469.88s)]
*  they're going to prove that people are just good people everywhere. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5475.52s)]
*  And they went and hung out with ISIS and they killed them. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5477.92s)]
*  Did you read about that one, Jamie? [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5481.2s)]
*  Do you know that story? [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5482.32s)]
*  That is incredible. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5484.08s)]
*  I was like, you need better friends. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5485.28s)]
*  You need better friends. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5487.08s)]
*  You need better friends that show you some videos, you know, that show you like this [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5488.32s)]
*  is what's going on in this part of the world. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5492.32s)]
*  You have to understand like it is you need to talk to someone who's maybe [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5494.12s)]
*  serving Afghanistan like you need to understand what's going on over there. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5497.679999999999s)]
*  The problem is those people would never listen to that. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5501.759999999999s)]
*  They'd be like, well, you just saw the bad side of ISIS. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5504.08s)]
*  Like you got you got ISIS on a bad day. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5507.12s)]
*  It was like I have a lighter that my friend Chris Williamson gave me that is [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5509.799999999999s)]
*  from my comedy club that went to Antarctica because they took a group of people to [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5515.2s)]
*  show them that the world isn't flat. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5519.759999999999s)]
*  They show them the sun actually at the start. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5522.08s)]
*  It does go around like that. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5524.08s)]
*  You can watch it the whole time. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5525.32s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5526.56s)]
*  Like this, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5527.6s)]
*  you completely calibrate like that guy that tried to launch himself up in the sky [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5529.36s)]
*  to prove it and he died. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5534.64s)]
*  Yeah, that guy, he needed better friends. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5536.0s)]
*  All these people just need better friends. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5538.6s)]
*  Like, yeah, you need you need people around you. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5540.4s)]
*  Hey, yeah, don't do that. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5543.68s)]
*  Yeah. And just to reassure them, just tell them it's flat. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5546.28s)]
*  Don't worry. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5549.8s)]
*  Look, it is flat. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5550.599999999999s)]
*  You don't have to worry about it. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5551.44s)]
*  Imagine if it was like imagine if all those morons were right. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5552.24s)]
*  And then everybody, all these scientists, all these sad, all lies, all CGI. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5555.32s)]
*  They've all been in cahoots for this whole time. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5559.96s)]
*  Even was it Socrates or Aristotle? [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5562.24s)]
*  I think Aristotle that mapped it out back in 3000 years ago. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5565.0s)]
*  This is my take on it. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5568.799999999999s)]
*  I firmly believe that at one point in time, there was a bunch of people that were [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5570.28s)]
*  uninformed that thought the world was flat way back in the day. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5575.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5578.96s)]
*  And they figured it out with experiments. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5579.4s)]
*  And then you look at all the other bodies in the solar system. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5580.88s)]
*  Everything else is round. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5583.44s)]
*  Kind of makes sense. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5584.5199999999995s)]
*  You realize that this is how planets are formed. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5585.5199999999995s)]
*  Gravity spins and the whole deal. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5587.5599999999995s)]
*  But then I think they're psyops. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5590.16s)]
*  And I think a bunch of people went on there, just like they did with women, [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5591.8s)]
*  with the free bleeding movement, they convinced women to just fucking bleed all [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5595.12s)]
*  over their crotch. They convinced them and they did it by making it seem like a [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5600.04s)]
*  feminist thing, like these fuck patriarchy. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5604.4s)]
*  I don't have to wear a fucking tampon. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5607.0s)]
*  I'm going to wear white pants. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5608.44s)]
*  Fuck you. Look at my blood. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5609.639999999999s)]
*  You know, and then women actually went and did it because people will buy into almost [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5611.44s)]
*  anything. They just there's a certain percentage of the population, whatever it [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5616.44s)]
*  is, that's so easily there's so suggestible. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5620.92s)]
*  They're so easily influenced. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5624.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5625.799999999999s)]
*  You can kind of talk them into almost anything. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5626.28s)]
*  And I think that's part of where the flat earth thing got sideways. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5628.5199999999995s)]
*  Because I think just like MK Ultra used to exist, I think there's still some let's [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5632.88s)]
*  find out how dumb they are experiments. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5637.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5639.5599999999995s)]
*  It was also just a lot of real dumb people. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5640.0s)]
*  There's also some people who like they also want to like think that everything's a [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5642.48s)]
*  cover up. I don't. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5647.2s)]
*  Yes. NASA. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5648.36s)]
*  Like, yeah, I trust NASA. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5649.4s)]
*  I don't know why not. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5650.84s)]
*  Like, like we didn't go to the moon. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5652.5599999999995s)]
*  So the earth must be flat. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5654.2s)]
*  I guess if those two things are related, I don't know. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5656.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I just. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5659.12s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of that. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5661.24s)]
*  There's a lot of people that don't want to actually do research. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5662.5199999999995s)]
*  They want to watch a YouTube video and then start talking about it. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5665.44s)]
*  That's me. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5668.0s)]
*  That's my mom. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5668.879999999999s)]
*  I'm with it. Yeah, I'm with it, too. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5670.12s)]
*  Yeah, I like a good deep dive, but sometimes just give me the damn bullet. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5672.32s)]
*  Yeah. Well, sometimes I'm just fucking around and I'm not really serious about [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5676.04s)]
*  whether or not I care if it's real. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5679.36s)]
*  I'm more interested to know about these emerald tablets. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5680.679999999999s)]
*  Like, where are they? Who's got them? [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5683.44s)]
*  What do they say? [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5685.08s)]
*  Like, I don't want to know. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5686.04s)]
*  It's a hoax, but I'm only fucking around. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5688.04s)]
*  I'm not like completely invested in it. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5691.04s)]
*  But when you start making videos about how you're correct and the world is flat [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5693.12s)]
*  and everybody else is wrong, like, no, that's you're being you're annoying. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5697.32s)]
*  This is silly. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5702.2s)]
*  Like, you're just not seeing things correctly. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5702.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5704.8s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of lies. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5705.36s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of conspiracies. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5706.88s)]
*  It doesn't mean all of it. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5708.24s)]
*  OK, it doesn't mean the stars are actually lights in the sky. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5709.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, a more interesting possibility is that it only exists when [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5712.4400000000005s)]
*  consciousness engages with it and that that's that's the real simulation theory. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5718.12s)]
*  That's the real weirdness. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5722.52s)]
*  That's that's when things get like Tom Campbell, you know, the My Big Toe, [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5724.0s)]
*  the theory of everything. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5728.56s)]
*  That's the things get really weird when instead of conscious, [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5729.92s)]
*  consciousness is like a part of the creation of reality itself, that it's all integrated. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5734.200000000001s)]
*  Jesus. Yeah. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5739.400000000001s)]
*  I don't like thinking about any of that stuff. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5740.56s)]
*  He weirded me out. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5742.72s)]
*  Yeah, I don't like the like space. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5743.64s)]
*  I leave that alone. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5746.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5747.88s)]
*  Space is also like what happened before. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5748.76s)]
*  Like and then what happened before that? [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5751.92s)]
*  Because there's an environment before the Big Bang. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5753.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think they call it the environment. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5757.92s)]
*  Is that what it's called? [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5760.04s)]
*  Yeah, what do they call it? [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5763.24s)]
*  Brian Cox was explaining to us. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5764.76s)]
*  I was like, what? Oh, God. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5766.56s)]
*  Yeah. Like the all theoretical, of course. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5767.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5770.0s)]
*  Which is the problem, because then [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5770.6s)]
*  like sometimes it's just I don't know, like I couldn't have that be which, you know, [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5772.84s)]
*  great for like those people. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5778.280000000001s)]
*  I could not have that be my life, is coming up with these theorems and like [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5779.48s)]
*  studying them, because you're never going to get an answer. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5783.36s)]
*  But it doesn't have to be you. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5785.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm glad it's not you. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5787.24s)]
*  Oh, well, yeah, yeah, for sure. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5788.48s)]
*  I'm glad you do what you do. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5789.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, exactly. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5791.08s)]
*  No, I'm glad that they do it. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5792.2s)]
*  I'm just saying like for me, it would drive me. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5793.839999999999s)]
*  Right. Absolutely. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5796.28s)]
*  Because I can't I have to like know an answer. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5797.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5799.5199999999995s)]
*  I can't I hate like hypotheticals and like like string theory. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5800.04s)]
*  I hate it. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5805.08s)]
*  That that could piss off. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5805.919999999999s)]
*  I don't need to know any about that. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5807.48s)]
*  That was weird. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5809.04s)]
*  Yeah. Any of that stuff. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5810.08s)]
*  I like I like this happened on this day. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5811.2s)]
*  This is who was involved. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5813.84s)]
*  This is what happened. Right. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5815.16s)]
*  Hard that kind of stuff. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5816.52s)]
*  Well, space is the ultimate who the fuck knows, because we can only see so far. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5818.68s)]
*  We see so far. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5823.16s)]
*  But even so far is only so far. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5824.88s)]
*  Well, and then they're saying like it's always expanding. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5826.84s)]
*  That's that can't be true, because what is expanding into if space is space? [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5828.96s)]
*  You know, if they're like, oh, it's like [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5834.0s)]
*  blowing up a balloon where everything's OK, but you're blowing up a balloon. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5835.400000000001s)]
*  In a room. Right. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5839.04s)]
*  So what's the room that you're blowing the balloon? [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5840.28s)]
*  Right. And then that's in a bigger room. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5842.2s)]
*  And then that's right. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5843.96s)]
*  And then there's the concept that it's actually finite. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5845.12s)]
*  It's not infinite. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5847.96s)]
*  It's some sort of donut shape. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5849.12s)]
*  It's like the Lord goes back around eventually. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5850.92s)]
*  Then who made all that? [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5854.68s)]
*  Right. Is there a God? [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5856.08s)]
*  Did God make this or is God the universe? [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5857.36s)]
*  Yeah, but then who made God? [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5860.52s)]
*  And then that bothers me. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5862.0s)]
*  Right. But who made that thing? [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5863.24s)]
*  Is that a thing that we think that like, because we were born and we die, [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5865.04s)]
*  that we have these biological. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5870.76s)]
*  Limitations that we attach to the universe itself. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5874.68s)]
*  That's that's a very that's fair. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5877.28s)]
*  That we just we see things as being built and destroyed. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5880.04s)]
*  That there's always been something. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5883.6s)]
*  Well, wouldn't it be crazy if there wasn't something at one point in time? [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5884.68s)]
*  That seems even crazier than there always has been something. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5887.56s)]
*  Because if it's just something, [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5891.4800000000005s)]
*  if it's just the nature of everything, there is always something right. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5892.88s)]
*  Right. It couldn't be nothing. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5897.400000000001s)]
*  And then all of a sudden everything that seems because what started that, [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5899.12s)]
*  what kicked that off, what snapped its fingers like that's McKenna's great line. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5902.88s)]
*  Terrence McKenna had a great line about the difference between science and [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5907.52s)]
*  religion is that science only asks you for one miracle. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5910.88s)]
*  I want you to believe in one miracle. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5914.16s)]
*  The Big Bang. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5915.76s)]
*  That's a good it's a great line. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5918.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's because it really is true. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5919.4400000000005s)]
*  And it's funny because people would be [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5921.08s)]
*  incredulous about the resurrection of Jesus Christ. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5922.92s)]
*  But yet they're convinced that the entire [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5925.88s)]
*  universe was smaller than the head of a pen and for no reason than anybody's [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5929.2s)]
*  adequately explained to me makes sense. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5933.12s)]
*  No, I've did. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5936.48s)]
*  Aneas Lee became everything. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5937.4s)]
*  Yeah. OK. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5939.8s)]
*  I can't buy that. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5942.24s)]
*  I'm sticking with Jesus. Yeah. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5943.4s)]
*  One. Yeah. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5944.96s)]
*  Jesus makes more sense. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5945.6s)]
*  It makes it a lot more sense. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5946.84s)]
*  People have come back to life. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5948.2s)]
*  Like in fact, you were one of your videos was about a woman who was hung. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5949.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5955.400000000001s)]
*  Tell that one. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5956.52s)]
*  Was it Nancy Green or Anne Green? [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5957.320000000001s)]
*  I think Anne Green. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5960.04s)]
*  Yeah, she was she had basically a miscarriage. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5960.96s)]
*  And, you know, at the time it was basically like, oh, you're a witch. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5963.96s)]
*  We're going to kill you because your baby's not it didn't live. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5967.56s)]
*  So she just buried the thing. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5971.200000000001s)]
*  Acted like nothing happened. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5972.360000000001s)]
*  They tried her, convicted her. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5973.84s)]
*  So she had a miscarriage, buried the child and they caught her. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5976.0s)]
*  Yeah, they caught her thinking that she had killed the kid. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5978.6s)]
*  Like, why would you be just burying your baby? [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5981.200000000001s)]
*  Like they weren't really thinking that she had a miscarriage. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5983.56s)]
*  Hunger. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5987.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, as far as they know, she's dead. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5988.92s)]
*  Put her in a box, wooden box, take her to a mortuary. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5991.360000000001s)]
*  And the guys, you know, getting her ready to prepare to bury her. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5994.400000000001s)]
*  And she wakes back up after they start doing it like they feel. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=5997.68s)]
*  Well, they feel like a faint pulse. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6000.88s)]
*  And they're like, oh, my God, this woman's so alive. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6002.84s)]
*  But she's not like coherent and alert. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6005.0s)]
*  So they start giving her like tobacco smoke [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6007.68s)]
*  enemas, which all got to be a great idea. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6009.92s)]
*  How do you go to that one first? [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6012.8s)]
*  Well, I don't know. I think I got an idea. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6014.68s)]
*  I mean, slapping the hell out of her probably was the first option. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6016.8s)]

*  Which is fine. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6236.32s)]
*  I mean, well, how do you research it? [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6237.96s)]
*  How do you find crazy facts? [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6240.719999999999s)]
*  I just will one just read like books constantly. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6242.719999999999s)]
*  So like I'll say like Napoleon ought to be like, all right, let me find a book on [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6246.04s)]
*  Napoleon, read about Napoleon. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6250.12s)]
*  And I'm mostly just skimming through looking to like find something that seems [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6251.84s)]
*  interesting or then I'll just Google like interesting shit about Napoleon and then [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6255.84s)]
*  read through it. Half of it's not true. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6260.719999999999s)]
*  So I got to sift through that and then [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6263.44s)]
*  put it all together into like kind of a story and do it that way. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6266.08s)]
*  But yeah, it's mostly just reading like [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6269.92s)]
*  articles online, like scholarly articles, I guess, and say just like flipping through [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6271.4800000000005s)]
*  them until I find something. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6276.84s)]
*  Imagine trying to piece through the truth of the seventeen hundreds. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6278.08s)]
*  Just imagine. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6283.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, right now, like try to figure out exactly what happened. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6285.24s)]
*  It's. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6290.72s)]
*  I mean, there there was some good like, you know. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6293.16s)]
*  Sure. No, no, no. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6295.8s)]
*  But it's going on. But how would you know? [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6297.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, barely know. Yeah. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6299.68s)]
*  I mean, really, you don't have to go back, go back to the 20s. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6300.96s)]
*  Right. Like who now is going to be like, oh, yeah, that did happen. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6304.56s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6308.4400000000005s)]
*  But at least we have like photographs and stuff. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6309.76s)]
*  But my point was going to be now, now take it back a couple of thousand years ago. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6312.56s)]
*  Like, good luck. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6318.16s)]
*  Well, that's why so many people think some, you know, [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6319.88s)]
*  have a hard time knowing for sure whether some people even existed like Achilles. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6322.799999999999s)]
*  Like people, you know, still believe that he necessarily existed. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6327.48s)]
*  I mean, they didn't believe that entire war happened until like relatively recently. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6331.08s)]
*  Well, they didn't find Troy until like what year? [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6336.5199999999995s)]
*  Like Troy was supposed to be just mythical. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6340.28s)]
*  Exactly. I don't know a date. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6342.639999999999s)]
*  I'm thinking the 50s. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6344.919999999999s)]
*  If I had to guess, I think it was like kind of close. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6346.32s)]
*  But yeah, they they just knew less than 100 years ago. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6348.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6351.4s)]
*  I mean, because they which is nuts. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6352.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, they just knew Homer. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6353.92s)]
*  They said the only the Odyssey and those things and thought it was all big. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6354.96s)]
*  Because then if you know that that war is true, like once you've discovered that [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6358.28s)]
*  that did happen, it's like so was Achilles real. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6363.16s)]
*  So it's like Agamemnon real. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6366.12s)]
*  Like it's like hard to know is Odysseus real. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6367.88s)]
*  And then right. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6370.4s)]
*  But obviously there's things in there that aren't real. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6371.36s)]
*  You know, that's what's weird, right? [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6373.24s)]
*  It's like there's some for sure fiction, I think. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6375.4s)]
*  But maybe not. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6378.88s)]
*  Maybe the world was way weirder back then. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6379.88s)]
*  Because maybe all those weird things got killed off. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6382.2s)]
*  Right. That's the thing. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6384.52s)]
*  It's like maybe there were like almost God like creatures that existed that we are. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6385.72s)]
*  You know, we want to call Zeus or Hercules or maybe this is just like years [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6390.88s)]
*  and years and years of retelling stuff, because like Homer's take on Atlantis [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6396.56s)]
*  is one of the most fascinating. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6401.16s)]
*  I've been obsessed with Atlantis [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6402.84s)]
*  ever since, particularly had Jimmy Corsetti on the podcast. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6405.639999999999s)]
*  And have you ever seen his videos on the Rishart that he said, Jimmy, Richard, [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6409.599999999999s)]
*  Richard, Richard structure? [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6414.24s)]
*  There's this area in sub-Saharan Africa [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6416.879999999999s)]
*  that has all of the attributes of Atlantis, including its position where the mountains [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6420.12s)]
*  are to the north, where the rivers to the south, the concentric rings. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6426.48s)]
*  It literally is the same size as described the concentric rings. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6430.04s)]
*  It looks like a complete anomaly. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6434.48s)]
*  It does not look like something that's naturally occurring. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6436.48s)]
*  And the entire area looks like it's when you look at it from like an aerial [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6439.4s)]
*  satellite photo, it looks like it's blown out by water, like immense amounts of water [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6445.08s)]
*  rushed through the land, like the whole area looked massive water erosion. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6451.24s)]
*  Like when you look at it from above, [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6455.36s)]
*  it looks like it just got hit with the most fucking insane flood of all time. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6456.96s)]
*  There's literally salt. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6461.24s)]
*  There's white all around the area where this Rishart structure is, [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6462.8s)]
*  which was probably from the fucking ocean. Right. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6468.320000000001s)]
*  For sure. Yeah. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6471.6s)]
*  This to this day and also evidence of human habitation. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6473.04s)]
*  They found pottery. They found a bunch of things. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6476.4800000000005s)]
*  But it's a kind of sketchy area of the world. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6478.240000000001s)]
*  And I don't think there's been a lot of like real excavation done there. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6480.320000000001s)]
*  But look at it from the top. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6483.4800000000005s)]
*  I recommend everybody go to Bright Insights YouTube page and just watch some [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6485.68s)]
*  of the videos he has on it. And he's not saying it's for sure this. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6491.32s)]
*  But he and it's not just him. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6494.36s)]
*  It's many other people. This is the area. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6496.16s)]
*  Show it the image of it from space. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6498.96s)]
*  Because it's crazy, dude. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6502.2s)]
*  It literally looks like how Atlantis was described with concentric circles. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6504.12s)]
*  But crazier still is its position to the mountains, which are in the north [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6510.24s)]
*  and the south where the river runs through is literally exactly as described. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6516.56s)]
*  And if you look at the image from. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6522.400000000001s)]
*  But look how it all looks blown out, man. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6523.76s)]
*  It all looks completely washed out. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6526.0s)]
*  That is crazy. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6528.6s)]
*  Watch how you go further out. Look at that. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6529.56s)]
*  Tell me. Oh, the whole thing. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6531.52s)]
*  The whole thing. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6532.96s)]
*  It looks like the whole thing is just scarred from water. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6534.320000000001s)]
*  Just a massive amount of water. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6538.4400000000005s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6540.4400000000005s)]
*  So from a. Yeah, that is from the position where it is. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6541.68s)]
*  The description of it, [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6545.5599999999995s)]
*  the actual dimensions of it, everything about it, man, even the descriptions of it [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6547.759999999999s)]
*  and like the colors of the rocks that are in that area. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6553.599999999999s)]
*  It matches so many details. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6557.32s)]
*  It's a more attain. OK, isn't that nuts? [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6559.5599999999995s)]
*  That is amazing. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6562.36s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6564.32s)]
*  Shout out to Jimmy Corse, because once because because Randall Carlson [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6565.48s)]
*  dismissed this, but I was like, how are you dismissing this? [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6569.12s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6571.879999999999s)]
*  I mean, dismissing it based on he doesn't think that this is it. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6572.839999999999s)]
*  And as he thinks Atlantis is somewhere else, maybe he's right. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6575.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. Maybe there was more than one. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6578.12s)]
*  I mean, when a bunch of people die at a time where you don't have phones [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6580.04s)]
*  and you don't have computers, like it's real possible that the myth of Atlantis, [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6584.719999999999s)]
*  you're talking about like a civilization that existed at a certain point in time. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6590.48s)]
*  And it might not have just been this one incredible city. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6594.36s)]
*  But it's probably multiple cities that existed that just don't exist anymore, [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6597.44s)]
*  just completely flattened. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6601.32s)]
*  And then some people remembered this one. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6603.4s)]
*  You know, that's also part of the equation that you have to look at when you see [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6606.679999999999s)]
*  that kind of insane water erosion, like how much did people just have no [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6610.76s)]
*  recollection of? Right, right, right. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6614.679999999999s)]
*  But it's all lines up numbers wise. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6618.4s)]
*  This is what's nuts. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6620.599999999999s)]
*  Homer was talking about it being nine thousand years old. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6621.8s)]
*  That's two thousand years ago. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6625.12s)]
*  That's at the time of the younger dryest impact theory. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6626.679999999999s)]
*  It's the same time period. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6629.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6631.76s)]
*  So it's like a lines up perfectly for it. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6632.24s)]
*  It lines up perfectly. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6634.92s)]
*  The description is perfect. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6636.04s)]
*  The position is perfect. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6637.4s)]
*  Again, I'm a moron. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6638.4s)]
*  But don't listen to me. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6640.16s)]
*  Go listen to other people that are interested in it. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6641.08s)]
*  Because I became fat. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6643.24s)]
*  I probably watched 30 videos on it. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6644.92s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6646.36s)]
*  Because it's so cool. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6648.0s)]
*  It looks like Atlantis. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6649.5199999999995s)]
*  It looks like the way they described it. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6651.5599999999995s)]
*  God, there's so many people that are resisting it. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6654.04s)]
*  There's a really interesting thing in [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6656.679999999999s)]
*  archaeology where there's, you know, there's not disrespectful to archaeology. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6658.64s)]
*  It's an amazing thing. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6662.360000000001s)]
*  I'm glad you guys are out there. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6663.320000000001s)]
*  But there's a lot of people that do not want anyone to find something out before [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6664.96s)]
*  they have, and they do not want anyone to uncover something before they have, [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6670.52s)]
*  especially if these people are not credentialed academics. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6674.84s)]
*  They're not PhDs. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6678.400000000001s)]
*  They're not doctors. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6679.64s)]
*  I'm Dr. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6680.8s)]
*  Smith and I'm out here finding this. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6681.68s)]
*  Now, they don't want like regular people looking at Google images and going, hey, [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6683.64s)]
*  what the fuck is this? [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6687.92s)]
*  And let's go into it. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6689.32s)]
*  And then like, let's look at the history of the description of the place. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6690.08s)]
*  Actually, it lines up exactly. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6692.68s)]
*  They don't want to miss that. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6694.4400000000005s)]
*  So they'll try to dismiss it with every fiber of their being rather than give [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6695.84s)]
*  ground and give credibility to these amateurs. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6699.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's what happens in like the like this true crime community people, [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6703.0s)]
*  you know, because they'll sometimes like bust a case wide open. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6706.8s)]
*  Cops and detectives hate it because it's like you're just a guy sitting on your [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6709.6s)]
*  couch at home and you did more than what I did. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6713.64s)]
*  But, you know, obviously, like a detective has all these different cases like [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6716.24s)]
*  they're not going to they're going to make a few mistakes. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6719.4s)]
*  And some probably do just not give a shit. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6721.8s)]
*  Fucking ego. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6723.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6724.76s)]
*  But that's part of it is that they will just dismiss the leads because somebody [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6725.5199999999995s)]
*  will like call in, be like, hey, like, have you all checked this person on this [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6729.4s)]
*  date, like ask what they were. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6733.5599999999995s)]
*  And they're like, we did it. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6734.88s)]
*  Don't worry about it. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6736.36s)]
*  And of course, they never did. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6737.16s)]
*  So it is. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6738.5199999999995s)]
*  So that is kind of similar situation. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6739.28s)]
*  Like, like we want we want to be the ones to find it. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6741.88s)]
*  Not you. So we don't care. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6745.48s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6746.919999999999s)]
*  Gone out and done your own thing. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6747.799999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6749.36s)]
*  And have a theory that may be true. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6750.04s)]
*  I mean, maybe bullshit, but it may be true. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6751.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6753.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's interesting. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6754.28s)]
*  It is very interesting. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6756.04s)]
*  The whole thing is very interesting because clearly we don't have all the [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6757.4s)]
*  pieces of the puzzle laid out and there are people that want to pretend that we [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6761.28s)]
*  do and that's just not the case. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6764.32s)]
*  Yeah, there's just there's too much weird stuff and there's too much time that [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6765.719999999999s)]
*  passed and the weird stuff is like go back Lee Tappy and these eleven thousand [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6769.08s)]
*  year old structures and a bunch of stuff that they're finding in Malta. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6773.24s)]
*  The Malta stuff's nuts. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6776.16s)]
*  But it's also it's just there's no way you can know. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6777.92s)]
*  Like if you if you're an expert in like [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6780.8s)]
*  combustion engines and you want to break down the new Coyote 5.0 that Ford makes [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6783.92s)]
*  and you're an expert in engines, I'm going to listen to you because I don't know how [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6791.16s)]
*  it works. How does it work? [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6794.4s)]
*  Why is it so good? [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6795.639999999999s)]
*  How does the supercharger work? [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6796.639999999999s)]
*  And then it does what? [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6797.8s)]
*  OK, how do you control all that? [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6798.5599999999995s)]
*  And with the ECU and the traction control? [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6800.28s)]
*  OK. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6801.96s)]
*  Because you're an expert in that. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6802.68s)]
*  But you can't be an expert in the entire [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6804.0s)]
*  history of the human race because we don't have all the information. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6806.64s)]
*  So you're bullshitting. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6809.96s)]
*  You at least have to be kind of bullshitting. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6811.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6813.120000000001s)]
*  But we just found out super recently that there was human beings definitely in [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6813.68s)]
*  North America 22000 years ago. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6818.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6820.160000000001s)]
*  Super recently. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6820.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6821.8s)]
*  I thought it was even a pass like earlier than that. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6822.360000000001s)]
*  Could be. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6826.240000000001s)]
*  Maybe they've updated. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6826.92s)]
*  I thought. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6827.8s)]
*  But I know the foot. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6828.240000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6829.4400000000005s)]
*  Those New Mexico footprints, the New [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6830.0s)]
*  Mexico footprints, I believe are 22000 years ago. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6832.04s)]
*  So what did they think before that? [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6834.72s)]
*  Thirteen. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6836.32s)]
*  They were those Clovis first. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6837.04s)]
*  Those people that thought the Clovis people. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6838.52s)]
*  But again, you don't fucking know. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6840.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, it wasn't I mean, that long ago when [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6843.08s)]
*  people found out about like the Vikings coming over to New England. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6844.84s)]
*  I mean, yes. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6848.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. That was a somewhat recent discovery. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6849.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, obviously not like in the past couple of years, but it was [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6852.96s)]
*  not very well known that like Leif Ericson's. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6856.599999999999s)]
*  I guess it was Eric the Red. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6859.16s)]
*  So Leif Ericson like coming over 500 years before Columbus. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6860.879999999999s)]
*  I know. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6864.799999999999s)]
*  And that nuts. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6865.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6865.879999999999s)]
*  And they were here. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6866.08s)]
*  I mean, they just didn't settle. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6866.919999999999s)]
*  So it's not significant, but, you know, they were here. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6868.24s)]
*  And so who's to say that there weren't people way before them? [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6871.679999999999s)]
*  And then there's all these different routes you can take. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6874.639999999999s)]
*  And there's ideas of like the Phoenicians coming or maybe the Egyptians like coming [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6876.5199999999995s)]
*  into South America even longer than that, like thousands of years ago. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6880.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6885.44s)]
*  There's those theories which, you know, who knows? [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6885.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6888.6s)]
*  Well, there's also all the stuff in the Amazon, right? [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6889.24s)]
*  The Lost City of Z like that stuff. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6892.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6894.52s)]
*  That's amazing. Have you ever seen that movie? [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6895.52s)]
*  Yes. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6897.2s)]
*  Yes. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6897.84s)]
*  The book, too. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6898.4400000000005s)]
*  What's interesting about the story about [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6899.52s)]
*  the Lost City of Z is that it all changed in 100 years. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6902.12s)]
*  So it's true in the 1500s, that first guy goes and he gives everybody cooties and he [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6908.6s)]
*  doesn't know. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6913.6s)]
*  And then they come back 100 years later [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6915.08s)]
*  to see if he was telling the truth and everybody's dead. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6917.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6920.88s)]
*  Everybody's dead and all the cities are gone in 100 years. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6921.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6924.08s)]
*  And they're like, I was bullshit and we got there. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6924.76s)]
*  So fucking cities made out of gold. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6926.6s)]
*  Guys, an asshole because the jungle ate it. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6928.68s)]
*  Yeah. Which 100 years is such a long time. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6931.52s)]
*  It was like that kind of like, yeah, wouldn't structure. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6934.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6937.4800000000005s)]
*  That's not a yeah. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6938.4400000000005s)]
*  It's not the middle of the desert where, you know, [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6940.0s)]
*  the structures will last for thousands of years. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6941.92s)]
*  I mean, what was that like? [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6944.4400000000005s)]
*  Because I forget the gentleman's name, who was the first explorer? [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6946.28s)]
*  Percy Fawcett. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6949.52s)]
*  Thank you. Percy Fawcett, the first guy? [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6950.36s)]
*  No, no, that's the guy that disappeared. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6952.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6955.6s)]
*  He's the guy that got eight in the movie. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6956.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6958.16s)]
*  Like the Rockefeller kid. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6960.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6961.72s)]
*  He's the one that formulated the idea about a lost city named Z. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6962.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6965.12s)]
*  But who was the first explorer to the Amazon that reported these incredible [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6965.8s)]
*  cities because that was in the 1500s? [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6969.08s)]
*  I think Percy Fawcett. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6970.96s)]
*  No. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6972.8s)]
*  Was it somebody like that? [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6973.52s)]
*  They found a document. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6974.4s)]
*  It was a European guy who was a explorer who went specifically to try to travel [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6975.4s)]
*  the length of the Amazon River. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6979.52s)]
*  This is the it's believed to have been written by a Portuguese named [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6980.92s)]
*  Howell da Silva Gumeres. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6983.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6987.4s)]
*  1753. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6988.12s)]
*  1753? [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6989.24s)]
*  That he had discovered the ruins of an ancient city that contained arches. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6990.32s)]
*  No, there was a guy from the 1500s. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6993.04s)]
*  This is what I'm reading from Wikipedia. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6994.76s)]
*  No, I understand. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6996.44s)]
*  But I was watching this video where they were talking about this guy who was [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=6997.12s)]
*  initially from the 1500s, who was the first to describe what he saw there and that he [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7002.04s)]
*  saw thriving populations, like incredibly sophisticated agricultural setups. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7006.8s)]
*  Like these people, they lived in harmony with the rainforest in some strange way. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7011.48s)]
*  Like instead of like because what the video was about was about [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7016.8s)]
*  they were trying to reconcile how you could get enormous populations of people [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7021.2s)]
*  that lived in this area without the kind of agriculture that we assume you need [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7026.32s)]
*  to have in order to support these kind of populations. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7031.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7033.599999999999s)]
*  So they did something different and integrated somehow with the rainforest. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7034.28s)]
*  And it was also about that stuff that [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7038.8s)]
*  Hancock has talked about, terra preta, the type of soil that they had created. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7040.5599999999995s)]
*  It's a manmade, like composted soil. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7045.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7048.2s)]
*  And they talked about this, too. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7049.08s)]
*  But in this documentary, they were going over the guy who came in the 1500s [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7050.36s)]
*  and the guy who visited it might have been the Y files. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7055.68s)]
*  I'm seeing a known Italian navigator, Christopher Columbus, enters the area [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7058.72s)]
*  in 1498, known as present day Venezuela. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7063.8s)]
*  Two years later, Pinzone sails into the Amazon. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7066.6s)]
*  So the same year Brazil is being accidentally found by Portuguese explorer Cabral [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7070.6s)]
*  on route to the Orient. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7076.280000000001s)]
*  Four years later, a guy named Oriana, Orieliana. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7078.08s)]
*  God, I wish I could remember the name of the guy. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7082.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7084.6s)]
*  But the point is, the first people to go there that were Europeans that went back [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7085.0s)]
*  to Europe described these insanely sophisticated cultures that had millions [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7089.8s)]
*  of people living in it. Right. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7094.84s)]
*  They had huge populations. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7096.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7098.12s)]
*  And they talked about the elaborate headgear they wore, like the way they dressed. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7098.4400000000005s)]
*  And there was gold everywhere. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7102.64s)]
*  And so everybody was like, we're going to go back and get rich. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7104.4400000000005s)]
*  And they went back and everyone was dead. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7107.16s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7109.76s)]
*  Could you imagine, like, you'd feel like such a jackass, you know, [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7111.799999999999s)]
*  having everybody come back there and you're. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7115.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, it's essentially what we did with North America. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7117.36s)]
*  Not we. I mean, my parents, my grandparents came here in the 20s. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7119.28s)]
*  But essentially, when Europeans came here, that's what killed just disease, [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7123.16s)]
*  killed 90 percent of Native Americans. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7128.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7130.2s)]
*  Which is. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7130.919999999999s)]
*  I mean, it was the same in like the Indies. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7132.4s)]
*  Yeah. Whenever Columbus came everywhere, just massive amounts of people. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7134.32s)]
*  Just like China did to us. Just kidding. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7138.0s)]
*  Just kidding. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7139.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7141.599999999999s)]
*  Not really. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7142.919999999999s)]
*  They didn't. But it killed a lot of things. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7144.36s)]
*  But it's just bizarre that we've missed that chapter. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7147.639999999999s)]
*  And it wasn't until LIDAR that they started to realize, like, oh, [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7152.639999999999s)]
*  there's like sophisticated grid work down here that seems to indicate that there is [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7157.24s)]
*  there's aqueducts, it seems like there's like places where there was channels and paths. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7163.36s)]
*  And yeah, well, we have. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7168.48s)]
*  I mean, there's obviously like a Euro centric idea. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7170.64s)]
*  A lot of the times where we think like, [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7173.88s)]
*  oh, we're the only ones who could have ever come up with like these advanced [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7176.08s)]
*  technologies and like have these advanced civilizations. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7179.200000000001s)]
*  And you look and it was like in Africa, [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7182.200000000001s)]
*  there's all sorts of like massive civilizations. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7184.76s)]
*  Which is about the Aztecs. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7187.76s)]
*  Yeah. And then, of course, like, yeah, South America is huge. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7189.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, like the Olmecs, Aztecs, Mayans. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7192.68s)]
*  I mean, especially the Aztecs, though. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7195.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, the Aztecs is a giant. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7197.76s)]
*  Nuts. Their stuff was nuts. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7199.84s)]
*  Like you imagine what experiencing that must have been like the first people that [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7202.240000000001s)]
*  were like Europeans that like stumbled upon these immense Aztec cities. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7206.04s)]
*  Like what is happening? [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7210.320000000001s)]
*  That was Cortez. Cortez was the first, I think, I think for the Aztecs. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7211.56s)]
*  I think so, right? [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7215.0s)]
*  On horse, when they thought he was a god. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7215.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7217.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's the other nutty thing that we brought horses over here. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7219.52s)]
*  Like what? Yeah. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7223.92s)]
*  Like they used to be over here and then they all died off. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7225.16s)]
*  And then we brought them back. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7227.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7229.08s)]
*  God, no, that's crazy. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7230.64s)]
*  So great. Thomas Jefferson brought mac and cheese here. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7232.12s)]
*  He's the guy made it pop. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7235.12s)]
*  I mean, like it was like nobody ate that shit. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7236.96s)]
*  He went to Paris, you know, obviously, [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7238.76s)]
*  like for pre-American Revolution to get some buddies going. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7240.32s)]
*  And yeah, I brought back mac and cheese. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7244.28s)]
*  Also, like one of the first Americans to cultivate tomatoes. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7245.76s)]
*  Really? People thought people thought they were poisonous, which to an extent they are. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7248.68s)]
*  I mean, it's yeah, I was reading about that, like that you should be really avoid [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7252.28s)]

*  But, you know, like for your blood type, you know that. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7275.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I did one of those a long time ago. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7277.44s)]
*  And they told me to avoid avocados. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7279.4s)]

*  It was one of them wacky things where I was very skeptical going in. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7286.16s)]
*  I'm like, all right, I'll try it. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7289.64s)]

*  of normal individuals had an average age of around 45, 50 years old, [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7672.599999999999s)]

*  It's the equivalent to an entire standard [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7682.759999999999s)]
*  plastic spoon in your fucking head. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7685.08s)]
*  Compared to autopsy brain samples from 2016, that's about 50 percent higher, [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7687.84s)]
*  he said. That would mean that our brains today are 99.5 percent brain and the rest [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7692.4s)]
*  is plastic. That's not bad. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7698.24s)]
*  It's a good percentage. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7700.48s)]
*  0.5 percent is not bad. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7702.28s)]
*  However, the current methods of measuring [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7704.72s)]
*  plastics may have over or underestimated their levels in the body, [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7707.0s)]
*  Campin said. We're working hard to get a very precise estimate, [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7710.44s)]
*  which I think we will have within the next year. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7713.44s)]

*  There's no plastic at all in there. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7719.04s)]

*  It's like one. We were going over this. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7740.0s)]
*  What was it? Every month it was a credit card or a week. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7742.5199999999995s)]
*  I've seen this. Yeah, it's a month. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7746.28s)]
*  I think credit card amount of plastic consumed. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7748.2s)]
*  I remember it's a week or a month, but it's crazy. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7751.959999999999s)]
*  We're like, where's it all going? [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7754.0s)]
*  Because I've been eating for a long time. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7755.28s)]

*  I would hope so. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7761.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I would hope so. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7763.04s)]
*  Remember how this was studied? [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7764.639999999999s)]
*  I had to dig into it and they had studied like an animal or something [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7765.919999999999s)]
*  and found it in the animals and they were like, that's. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7769.639999999999s)]

*  I don't trust animal studies. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7780.56s)]
*  The only way I didn't really know is if you try it on people. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7782.12s)]
*  Right. That's why we've got to put them prisoners back in Alcatraz. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7784.68s)]
*  Now, do what you got to do. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7787.72s)]

*  It's not just Alcatraz. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7815.92s)]
*  We use a federal penitentiary since 1963, [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7817.4400000000005s)]
*  a capacity of roughly 300 people. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7820.08s)]
*  I went there as a kid. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7822.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, really? Yeah. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7823.76s)]
*  When I was in what grade was I? [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7824.96s)]
*  So I was I was in San Francisco from age seven to 11. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7827.4s)]
*  So I think I was eight years old. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7830.44s)]
*  I went over there. I have a little school trip. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7832.48s)]
*  We went on a ferry. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7834.719999999999s)]
*  You go to Alcatraz and you think about how the fuck someone could swim. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7835.639999999999s)]
*  Because there's a dude, Nick Diaz, UFC fighter. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7839.639999999999s)]
*  He's done it five times. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7843.28s)]
*  Swim from Alcatraz. Yeah. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7844.719999999999s)]
*  Five times. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7845.96s)]
*  I wouldn't do that. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7847.16s)]
*  In shark infested water, by the way. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7848.44s)]
*  You couldn't fucking pay me to do that. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7850.84s)]
*  Fuck all that. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7852.84s)]
*  I mean, I can swim like a motherfucker. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7854.16s)]
*  But do you know the kind of balls you have to have to know that, you know, [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7855.72s)]
*  you don't have a life vest. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7859.4800000000005s)]
*  You're just swimming. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7860.68s)]
*  You have to be able to swim all the way to shore with sharks underneath you everywhere. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7861.6s)]
*  And, you know, if they bite you, you're dead. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7868.72s)]
*  And, you know, they bite people. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7871.6s)]
*  I'd rather just be in prison, really. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7873.76s)]
*  Yeah, but he's doing it for funsies. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7876.56s)]
*  He's doing it. Nick Diaz does it in between MMA fights. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7878.12s)]
*  He was doing this. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7882.04s)]
*  Well, the Diaz brothers, that's a set of balls unlike, you know, like no other. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7882.72s)]
*  Like those guys are legends, you know, for sure. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7888.08s)]
*  They have a sense of the word. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7890.88s)]
*  So that doesn't surprise me at all, actually, that they, you know, [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7891.92s)]
*  that they swim in from Alcatraz. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7894.92s)]
*  Well, people miss Nick's prime because Nick's prime. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7896.4800000000005s)]
*  A lot of it happened in Strike Force. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7899.96s)]
*  Like people missed that. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7901.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's when he was just like just so dominant. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7903.360000000001s)]
*  So he came into the UFC kind of later into his career. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7906.360000000001s)]
*  Well, he started the UFC very early. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7909.16s)]
*  So he knocks out Robbie Lawler early in his career, has some great fights early [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7910.84s)]
*  in his career. So he was in the UFC early on, but then left the UFC and went over [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7914.76s)]
*  to Strike Force where I think he like reached his prime. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7920.52s)]
*  OK, like when he beat Frank Shamrock and Cyborg, [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7922.92s)]
*  he was in his fucking prime over there, a world championship caliber prime. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7926.320000000001s)]
*  But that guy would swim across from Alcatraz in between his like his training [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7930.92s)]
*  for fights and in between training for fights, he's running triathlons and [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7937.52s)]
*  hitting the bong while he's doing it. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=7942.040000000001s)]

*  Like there's nothing about me that is like Teddy Roosevelt. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8071.24s)]
*  How about that dude that ate that guy's heart that had been pickled for like, oh, [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8074.16s)]
*  yeah, William Buckland. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8077.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he ate King Louis XIV's heart, which had been in formaldehyde. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8078.92s)]
*  Yeah. Well, yeah, King Louis XIV just in general, an absolute nut job, [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8083.72s)]
*  birth and fetish, like to watch women give birth, which don't we all. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8087.96s)]
*  But yeah. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8092.36s)]
*  But yeah, so he dies. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8094.52s)]
*  One hundred and thirty years later, you know, his heart has been preserved [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8096.4s)]
*  in what I guess would be formaldehyde, and it's sitting in this guy's office [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8100.12s)]
*  basically, and a fellow, I think he was like the archbishop of Canterbury, [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8105.76s)]
*  I don't know, some Lord of whatever, their little fruity little names. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8110.400000000001s)]
*  They give each other. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8113.76s)]
*  But then this fellow named William Buckland comes in and who had kind of like [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8114.76s)]
*  a notorious big stomach, ate a lot of weird shit. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8119.12s)]
*  And he saw the heart and was like, holy hell, that's the heart of King Louis XIV. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8122.84s)]
*  I've never eaten the heart of a king before, so how about I just give it a try? [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8127.04s)]
*  And then they come in, come back in and he's eating the damn heart. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8131.52s)]
*  Raw? [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8135.84s)]
*  Well, preserved, I mean, as best preserved as it gets. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8136.96s)]
*  It's been preserved for a hundred and thirty years. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8139.72s)]
*  But he's not even cooking it. That's my point. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8141.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. He didn't have like a hot plate in there. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8142.64s)]
*  Just pulling it out. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8145.0s)]
*  Yeah, it wasn't in the microwave. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8146.08s)]
*  Imagine being in the room with that guy when he takes those bites. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8147.52s)]
*  You'd be like, oh, God. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8150.400000000001s)]
*  You'd be retching. Like, what are you doing, man? [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8153.12s)]
*  Have you ever dissected like an animal in high school? [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8155.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that smell is like a smell that I can smell it right now thinking about it. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8158.68s)]
*  You know, like it's one of those things that never leaves you. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8162.68s)]
*  It's like a dead body smell biting into a raw heart with that smell. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8165.88s)]
*  It's pretty tender. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8170.4800000000005s)]
*  He tried to eat everything. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8171.4400000000005s)]
*  He doffs his cap to Victorian feud hero, [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8172.92s)]
*  a gentleman whose ambition was to eat an example of every animal in existence. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8175.04s)]
*  Again, this Courtney, Walter and Tam Haines, [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8180.84s)]
*  who are running 250 miles right now and this dude is like, I want to eat one of everything. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8183.56s)]
*  I want to eat a fucking rat. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8188.84s)]
*  I mean, what? This guy ate rats. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8190.96s)]
*  He probably had rabies. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8193.28s)]
*  He kept a pet jackal in his house. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8194.84s)]
*  This guy had a jackal in his house. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8197.0s)]
*  He built the country's first mosque, had a jackal in his house. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8198.64s)]
*  He lived in a hut made from driftwood, [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8203.08s)]
*  dressed as a mermaid and excommunicated his cat. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8205.0s)]
*  Somebody else, though. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8208.199999999999s)]
*  I really should have done that. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8209.24s)]
*  Robert Hawker. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8210.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, to the West. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8212.16s)]
*  Fame Cornish poet Robert Stephen Hawker lived in a. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8214.119999999999s)]
*  So this is not just a bunch of weird guys that were living in that time. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8216.92s)]
*  Oh, also, then it goes into this. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8219.72s)]
*  Oh, this is a different guy. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8222.24s)]
*  Not any of these were thought it was the same guy. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8223.240000000002s)]
*  OK, this is a bunch of weirdos all throughout history. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8225.44s)]
*  So Charles, [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8228.16s)]
*  Major General Charles George Gordon. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8230.12s)]
*  So it's the third paragraph starts the William Buckland, I think. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8232.400000000001s)]
*  These are all eccentric guys from. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8235.0s)]
*  Oh, different people. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8236.44s)]
*  Right here, Buckland was born. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8237.480000000001s)]
*  I think that's all going to be about him. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8238.880000000001s)]
*  This is also pretty good, though. Don't leave this out. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8241.480000000001s)]
*  Right. So this guy, [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8243.320000000002s)]
*  Major General Charles George Gordon, a British Army officer whose day job [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8245.16s)]
*  saw him fight a series of bloody campaigns across the Middle East and Africa. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8249.68s)]
*  Yet was almost as notorious for believing the earth was encased in a hollow sphere [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8252.92s)]
*  and that the Garden of Eden was located in the sea somewhere off the coast of [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8257.800000000001s)]
*  Seychelles, Seychelles. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8262.36s)]
*  People believe that now. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8264.08s)]
*  I think this guy, wait, the heart [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8266.16s)]
*  William Buckland. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8273.24s)]
*  So the man who ate everything born in 1784, a year in which famine in Japan [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8274.52s)]
*  claimed three hundred thousand lives and a massive locust swarm hit South Africa. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8279.880000000001s)]
*  Coincidence, of course, but it fits in the theme of this blog nicely. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8284.6s)]
*  So I'm leaving it in. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8287.960000000001s)]
*  So this guy ate everything he could. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8288.84s)]
*  Long he had his hand in a huge hyena skull, suddenly dashed on the steps, [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8293.6s)]
*  rushed skull in hand, the first undergraduate, the front bench and shouted, [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8298.32s)]
*  what rules the world? [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8301.6s)]
*  The youth, terrified, answered not a word. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8303.24s)]
*  He rushed then onto me, pointing the hyena full in my face. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8305.4s)]
*  What rules the world? [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8309.0s)]
*  Having an idea, I said. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8310.56s)]
*  The stomach, sir, he cried, rules the world. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8312.199999999999s)]
*  The great ones eat the less, the less, the lesser still. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8315.08s)]
*  So he just thought he was going to be great by eating everything. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8319.119999999999s)]
*  Some of the stuff he was eating. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8321.88s)]
*  So his lifelong personal ambition, [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8323.56s)]
*  which is to eat an example of every animal in existence, like some kind of crazed, [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8325.64s)]
*  bloodthirsty Noah. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8330.119999999999s)]
*  Oh, my God. He ate a porpoise, a puppy and a panther. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8334.359999999999s)]
*  Oh, the literary. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8337.24s)]
*  And that's just the piece. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8338.52s)]
*  Mice on toast were a regular feature of his no doubt popular soirees. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8339.56s)]
*  Oh, my God. He had a porpoise and a puppy. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8344.12s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8347.36s)]
*  I mean, the porpoise probably wouldn't be so bad. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8348.2s)]
*  I'd eat the puppy. It's like dog veal. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8350.4s)]
*  Yeah, I guess. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8353.48s)]
*  I mean, I wouldn't necessarily like flagstones to this proof of myth, [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8356.12s)]
*  myth identifying the flavor as bat urine. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8359.16s)]
*  How would you know that so quick? [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8364.72s)]
*  Well, [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8367.279999999999s)]
*  I think he had a real good reason. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8369.88s)]
*  But the eating the heart, I bet all those years of formaldehyde is probably [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8372.08s)]
*  quite tender, right? Yeah. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8375.359999999999s)]
*  Oh, it melts in your mouth. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8377.4s)]
*  What if it just tasted amazing for some reason? [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8378.76s)]
*  Right. What do we got? [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8381.199999999999s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8382.4s)]

*  In the early days of dinosaur research, [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8531.32s)]

*  That's a fucking living dinosaur. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8543.64s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I think used to exist for sure. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8545.24s)]
*  Well, some of the real big ones, you're like, they've never found one of those. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8549.16s)]
*  They just find like some stuff, right? [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8554.0s)]
*  They found some stuff. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8556.04s)]
*  And then they go, well, we think it probably [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8556.8s)]
*  looked like this based on its vertebrae looking like this. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8558.960000000001s)]
*  And when you go see the skeleton at the Perot Museum or wherever, it's all that's [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8562.119999999999s)]

*  Right. There are some of those. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8570.48s)]
*  I can get the skepticism behind that a little bit. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8572.24s)]
*  Yeah. But to say like, oh, the whole thing is [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8575.32s)]
*  like that there is no such thing as a dinosaur, that's bullshit. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8578.48s)]
*  It seems silly that people would just lie openly about that. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8581.24s)]
*  But there are some that are intact, like they found some raptors intact. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8584.039999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8703.880000000001s)]

*  Yeah, they think that's why they went extinct. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8711.28s)]
*  I hope they bring dinosaurs back. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8713.36s)]
*  They probably are going to. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8715.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8716.800000000001s)]
*  I mean, part of me is kind of against it. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8717.4s)]
*  But then part of me is because Josh Parks, my favorite movie. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8719.32s)]
*  So I got the leather. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8722.28s)]
*  Did you see the someone's leather T-Rex purse? [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8723.76s)]
*  Yeah, they're going to make T-Rex purses. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8726.720000000001s)]

*  Look, what more badass of a thing could there possibly be than a T-Rex fanny pack? [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8733.28s)]
*  I know, right? [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8737.8s)]
*  Yeah, T-Rex crocs. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8739.0s)]
*  Company claims leather made from 66 million year old dinosaur DNA is coming. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8740.52s)]
*  I think some people are very skeptical about this. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8745.68s)]
*  We should probably say this is one of the things that the guys from Colossal were [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8748.64s)]
*  telling me, the guys who resurrected the dire wolf. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8754.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8757.0s)]
*  They were telling me, Ben Lamb was telling me that when it comes to like DNA [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8757.8s)]
*  of dinosaurs, they don't really have DNA of dinosaurs. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8762.64s)]
*  Too old. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8765.88s)]
*  They don't have like full DNA profiles or whatever you would call it. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8766.519999999999s)]
*  But what they will be able to do is sort [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8770.68s)]
*  of engineer a dinosaur, which is even crazier. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8773.4s)]
*  Like take the surviving creatures like chickens, [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8776.039999999999s)]
*  shit like that, that have dinosaur DNA because chickens are full on dinosaurs. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8780.84s)]
*  Take their DNA and engineer a T-Rex out of that. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8785.119999999999s)]
*  Or a raptor, a raptor, like way smarter than a crow. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8790.6s)]
*  How about that? [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8794.44s)]
*  Oh, like hunting people through the woods, [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8795.119999999999s)]
*  little five foot fucking creepy super lizard that can run 50 miles an hour. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8797.32s)]
*  Clever girl. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8802.08s)]
*  Yeah, that would be. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8803.199999999999s)]
*  God, dude, I'd love it. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8805.0s)]
*  I hope they do. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8807.119999999999s)]
*  They could do that. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8807.92s)]
*  They're really like if they can take human [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8809.039999999999s)]
*  beings and integrate them with tardigrade DNA and have them become fucking [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8811.24s)]
*  superheroes, they can make a dinosaur. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8817.199999999999s)]
*  Man, they made a wolf. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8820.16s)]
*  They made dire wolves. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8821.08s)]
*  They made three of them, which is insane. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8821.8s)]
*  Crazy. It's nuts. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8823.84s)]
*  Like they exist. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8825.44s)]
*  They're like I think they're like 11 months old now or something like that. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8826.44s)]
*  Oh, it's that Jesus. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8829.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8832.4s)]
*  They don't. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8833.56s)]
*  Ben Lamb told me he doesn't go around them anymore. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8835.4s)]
*  Like he bottle fed them when they were puppies. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8837.6s)]
*  But then when they got to a certain age, like, I think we're done. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8839.64s)]
*  Yeah, like after like four or five months, like I think we're done. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8842.28s)]
*  What was that, Jamie? [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8845.28s)]
*  The T-Rex DNA is 66 million years old. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8846.8s)]
*  It dies. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8850.119999999999s)]
*  The DNA starts to go away as soon as they die. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8851.16s)]
*  And the oldest preserved DNA on record [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8853.8s)]
*  currently is only two million years old. Yeah. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8855.72s)]
*  So it wouldn't be a T-Rex. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8858.0s)]
*  So it wouldn't be a T-Rex. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8859.039999999999s)]
*  But they might be able to make exactly what we think a T-Rex was. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8860.16s)]
*  Yeah, we would be really off because we don't know what their tissue looked like. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8863.68s)]
*  That's where it gets really strange. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8867.8s)]
*  Like all the stuff that rots away. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8869.68s)]
*  Have you ever seen like an artist's depiction of what they take a hippo skull? [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8871.8s)]
*  Like what an artist's depiction of what the animal could look like? [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8876.76s)]
*  No. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8879.32s)]
*  It looks like a monster. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8880.039999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8880.88s)]
*  I would imagine. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8881.56s)]
*  And then you see the reality. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8882.84s)]
*  It's like, oh, hungry, hungry hippo. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8884.119999999999s)]
*  Big old sweetie. Right. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8885.88s)]
*  Hippo looks like a sweetie with cute little ears. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8887.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8889.279999999999s)]
*  You know? Yeah. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8890.56s)]
*  But then artists have depicted it like if we didn't know what it looked like, [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8892.039999999999s)]
*  maybe it looked like this. Right. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8895.439999999999s)]
*  You know? Yeah. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8897.4s)]
*  Have you seen that? That's crazy. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8898.64s)]
*  The meme says how aliens would reconstruct it. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8900.32s)]
*  So I. Oh, that's interesting. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8902.72s)]
*  Well, still see. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8904.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8906.2s)]
*  We have the one in the middle. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8907.28s)]
*  But you could like if you came from another planet and you saw this like, [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8909.52s)]
*  oh, my God, this thing must have been a terrific looking beast. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8912.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8916.720000000001s)]
*  Oh, wow. The skull. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8917.84s)]
*  Aliens would you start the animal? [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8919.240000000002s)]
*  And it's an elephant. Wow. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8920.720000000001s)]
*  That's cool. Yeah. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8922.240000000002s)]
*  I bet that's where the Cyclops myth comes from. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8924.84s)]
*  See an elephant skulls. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8927.160000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that actually makes per I've never seen an elephant skull. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8928.480000000001s)]
*  So I had no clue there was which they have a big hole. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8931.800000000001s)]
*  I don't even know if it's where the trunk is. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8935.36s)]
*  Yeah. Elephant skull. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8937.28s)]
*  I think it is. It's got to be. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8939.24s)]
*  I mean, it makes sense because the trunk just goes right to the mouth. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8941.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8944.76s)]
*  It has to be where the Cyclops comes from. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8946.08s)]
*  Has to have to. Yeah. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8947.800000000001s)]
*  Especially if you found a female one that didn't have to listen to you. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8949.400000000001s)]
*  But we're all skulls in spite. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8953.0s)]
*  Well, would you say, Jamie, every like when I I didn't even type in Cyclops [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8955.08s)]
*  and it was the first thing that was on top. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8958.960000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's because that's a theory that's been around for a long time. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8960.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Well, there was. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8964.2s)]
*  But I've been noticing. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8965.0s)]
*  Yeah. Look, it says that right there, right there. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8965.76s)]
*  Read it. The Cyclops is likely inspired by. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8967.52s)]
*  I've been noticing this happen a lot. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8969.72s)]
*  You'll be saying something. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8971.44s)]
*  I think the government's listening. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8972.4s)]
*  The first thing I'll type. Well, they're helping us. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8973.36s)]
*  It's all about completing what you just. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8974.8s)]
*  They're fans of the show, Jamie. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8976.04s)]
*  They're trying to help out. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8977.12s)]
*  Yeah, but it makes sense. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8979.52s)]
*  I mean, if you found stuff from a long. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8981.44s)]

*  I want that to be real. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8990.2s)]
*  So I want to want all this. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8991.48s)]
*  The Smithsonian's been hiding the information. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8992.96s)]
*  Does those the big could be down in their basement? [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8995.88s)]
*  They've got like a 10 foot tall human being. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=8998.4s)]

*  It just seems like they wouldn't be gone. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9007.759999999998s)]
*  They wouldn't be the ones that would have been killed off. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9010.8s)]
*  Unless in the cataclysm, like the younger drys impact theory, [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9013.599999999999s)]
*  there wasn't enough food and they died off, you know, because if you're that big, [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9017.759999999998s)]
*  you need to eat a lot. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9021.64s)]
*  So you think they were they were around like way long ago, way [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9023.68s)]
*  died off way longer. Yeah. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9027.24s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think like recently, but I think like, yeah, it is. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9029.24s)]
*  There's so many stories and so many cultures have these stories, even in the Bible, [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9032.92s)]
*  of a race of Giants, like it seems like it couldn't just be big people. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9037.56s)]
*  Right. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9042.68s)]
*  It seems like what they're talking about is something crazy. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9043.68s)]
*  I guess it could be if you're just because because you're just mythologizing. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9046.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's a word. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9051.28s)]
*  But if you're just turning something that is real, this is like a dragon. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9052.32s)]
*  You know, people obviously just get inspired by things that are around them. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9056.88s)]
*  They start to morph into things. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9059.68s)]
*  I mean, there was no fire breathing animal flying around, probably crocodiles and [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9061.28s)]
*  shit like crocodiles. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9065.28s)]
*  And then there are, you know, like cobras that spit venom, [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9066.32s)]
*  which obviously gets in your eyes, probably going to burn like a son of a bitch. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9069.08s)]
*  So like there's like the fire myth. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9072.119999999999s)]
*  I mean, and people exaggerate. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9073.96s)]
*  Yeah. So exactly. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9075.52s)]
*  So like people will take somebody who is a big son of a bitch and they go, [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9076.64s)]
*  oh, let's exaggerate for sure that the guy he fought was nine feet tall. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9080.64s)]
*  Right. Six foot five. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9085.519999999999s)]
*  Exactly. He was. Yeah. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9087.119999999999s)]
*  But also when you talk about races of these giants, you could also be talking [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9089.039999999999s)]
*  about like people from Iceland, yeah, who were naturally enormous. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9093.48s)]
*  Viking dudes who were always win those fucking strongmen competitions. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9097.68s)]
*  Those guys are just giants up there. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9102.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah. 400 like the mountain from Game of Thrones, like that kind of person. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9104.279999999999s)]
*  So you think about that, that's that size human. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9108.52s)]
*  Right. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9111.96s)]
*  There could have been a bunch of those around. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9113.039999999999s)]
*  And maybe that's what they were talking about. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9114.72s)]
*  Giants or there could have been like a specific race of humans. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9116.199999999999s)]
*  Like they keep finding these additional types of humans. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9120.52s)]
*  Like they found Dennis Owens fairly recently. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9124.72s)]
*  And then that other one that we brought up the other day, the big headed people, [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9127.64s)]
*  that's fairly recently they've discovered that this is a completely different [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9130.92s)]
*  branch that there may be. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9134.44s)]
*  But here's the thing. If they did find those, would they tell us? [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9137.32s)]
*  Like if archaeologists like who would put the cap on that if they found like a [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9141.08s)]
*  10 foot human under a gigantic, right, right human with a huge sword underground? [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9145.68s)]
*  Like, would they would they just say we're wrong? [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9152.16s)]
*  Giants existed or would they go people can't handle this? [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9155.08s)]
*  That's a tough because that's the answer to that. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9159.24s)]
*  That's the question for so many things. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9161.48s)]
*  They might say people can't handle it. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9163.32s)]
*  It's not outside the realm of possibility. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9165.44s)]
*  I would say, yeah, they probably say in that infuriating. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9169.04s)]
*  Yeah. Can you imagine if it was you? [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9173.08s)]
*  Now, imagine you're out in West Texas, wherever you are, hanging out with your [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9175.08s)]
*  friends and somebody notices something in the ground and you start digging and you [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9178.28s)]
*  pull out a fucking thigh bone that's this big and you plop it down. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9185.28s)]
*  You go, what the fuck is that? [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9189.480000000001s)]
*  And then you got a buddy who works at the university nearby and he starts digging. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9191.28s)]
*  He's like, hey, dude, this is a fucking human foot. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9194.68s)]
*  And he pulls out a human foot that's size 38. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9197.44s)]
*  You're like, what is going on, man? [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9200.16s)]
*  And so you bring in some experts and like, holy shit, dude, this is a giant. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9202.48s)]
*  And then they do DNA tests. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9206.16s)]
*  They find out it's a real a real actual creature. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9207.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9210.12s)]
*  I'm. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9211.04s)]
*  I'm telling everyone. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9212.92s)]
*  Yeah, they're going to kill you. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9214.4s)]
*  They're going to kill you. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9216.12s)]
*  The scientists will kill you. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9216.800000000001s)]
*  They're going to run you off the road. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9217.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I guess. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9219.04s)]
*  Well, longest or I guess would be the tallest. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9220.4s)]
*  The people have ever found that they've ever found. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9223.84s)]
*  It was found in China. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9225.720000000001s)]
*  It's supposedly about forty four hundred years old. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9226.76s)]
*  Would have been about 16, 18 years old. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9229.720000000001s)]
*  The weird thing here is though that it says there is three drill holes found [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9232.12s)]
*  in the skull and they don't know why. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9237.2s)]
*  Whoa, drill holes. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9240.84s)]
*  How big was it? [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9242.76s)]
*  Six, four. Oh, well, back then I was probably fucking huge. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9244.4s)]
*  They said they found it in China. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9248.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's a giant. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9250.4s)]
*  And they're calling it. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9251.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they might be Mongolian. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9252.68s)]
*  Well, well, I just looked at the Chinese that are found. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9254.84s)]
*  I probably like, holy shit, this is anywhere from modern day. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9257.56s)]
*  Maybe they say up to six six. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9262.04s)]
*  But taking the word for word from the Bible, it had been about nine nine. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9263.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I always thought. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9267.52s)]
*  I know how to wait. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9268.84s)]
*  Wait, right. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9270.48s)]
*  Well, if you're back then, nobody had any food and the average man was probably [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9271.24s)]
*  like five four. So if you encounter some dude who's six six, [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9274.84s)]
*  some big jack guy, that is a giant. [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9279.56s)]
*  That's a giant. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9281.52s)]
*  And then also, like, you got to think human beings, if they exist today and [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9282.16s)]
*  they're six six, they had a potential to be that big back then. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9285.52s)]
*  They just didn't get the food. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9287.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9289.0s)]
*  But if you are in some very nutrient rich environment, [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9289.44s)]
*  we mean both those guys play pro basketball. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9293.88s)]
*  That's not Muggsy Muggsy Bogues. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9296.92s)]
*  Yeah. But there's smaller people that exist that can function and do stuff. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9299.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah, for sure. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9303.36s)]
*  But what's crazy is that the potential for that guy, the guy who's how tall is he? [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9304.4s)]
*  But that exists in the human genome. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9311.2s)]
*  Right. That's not like we engineered them like we did dogs like that exists. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9313.0s)]
*  So maybe back then, if you had a ton of food and you didn't have to worry [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9316.6s)]
*  about war, like, and people just kept breeding and growing and getting nutrient [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9321.080000000002s)]
*  rich because the thing about people in the past is they didn't get any fucking food. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9325.28s)]
*  Man. Yeah. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9329.640000000001s)]
*  Like the average size of a guy who fought [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9330.640000000001s)]
*  in the Civil War was, I think, one hundred and twenty five pounds or something. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9332.320000000002s)]
*  Great. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9335.12s)]
*  Four and one twenty, I think is not starving to death. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9335.6s)]
*  Starving to shoot people at muskets. [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9340.039999999999s)]
*  Girl. I mean, that's like, yeah. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9342.48s)]
*  Right. And all they needed was food. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9344.759999999998s)]
*  You know, you give them give them protein and then they grow normal sized, [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9346.599999999999s)]
*  which is really wild. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9349.92s)]
*  Yeah. Because there's tons of people that are well over seven feet. [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9351.439999999999s)]
*  It's not like it's I mean, it is an anomaly compared to. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9354.8s)]
*  Speaking of, there's one guy in the Civil War, seven, six, [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9357.96s)]
*  he would have stood out a little bit, but everything else was five, eight average. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9360.72s)]
*  He was seven foot six in the Civil War. [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9364.56s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9367.279999999999s)]
*  Is that that's not a picture of him, I guess. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9368.240000000002s)]
*  Yeah. But the thing about the stories in the Bible, though, [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9370.400000000001s)]
*  it's like these are like mystical giants, the Nephilim, you know. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9373.640000000001s)]
*  Look at this guy. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9378.480000000001s)]
*  So he's there you go. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9380.320000000002s)]
*  But you do not want to box that guy. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9382.880000000001s)]
*  Seven, six, seven, six. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9384.560000000001s)]
*  That's what she must be pretty tall. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9386.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, she probably needed to do that big take care of her. [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9388.0s)]
*  Yeah. I'm saying. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9391.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. She can be in this big eight. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9392.0s)]
*  Yeah. She can't be fucking with me. [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9394.160000000002s)]
*  She'll hold me down. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9396.240000000002s)]
*  I have to fight that lady to the death. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9397.32s)]
*  No chance. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9400.2s)]
*  She's a big man. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9401.52s)]
*  Yeah. Big giant man. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9402.88s)]
*  Fuck her correctly. Yes. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9404.2s)]
*  But the stories from the Bible and the stories from like, you know, [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9406.16s)]
*  different like even though the ancient Sumerian culture, like when they had [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9409.8s)]
*  the depictions of the Anunnaki and these big giant people. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9413.36s)]
*  Yeah. Like, what was that? [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9416.2s)]
*  What is that all about? [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9417.72s)]
*  Like, is that a story about a thing that used to be real or is it bullshit? [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9419.039999999999s)]
*  Because it seems like the more we uncover [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9423.039999999999s)]
*  with ancient history, just like Troy and probably Atlantis, [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9425.92s)]
*  the more you realize, like, none of it was bullshit. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9429.92s)]
*  It was just their version of trying to tell you the story. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9432.08s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and that this all this stuff about the Nephilim, the Anunnaki [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9435.28s)]
*  and there's probably is there's some sort of a story. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9440.32s)]
*  It's just parsing out what it really was after a thousand years of people just [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9444.64s)]
*  telling it before somebody writes it down. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9449.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's I think it's more just, yeah, you know, [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9451.76s)]
*  you're getting word of mouth over so like such a long time. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9454.480000000001s)]
*  And it's probably exaggerated from the jump [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9458.800000000001s)]
*  because you're just trying to tell trying to tell a story. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9461.52s)]
*  Like creativity isn't a new thing. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9463.960000000001s)]
*  You know, people were always creative and and always lying and always lying [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9465.68s)]
*  and always trying to like exaggerate their imagination. [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9469.6s)]
*  Exaggerate. Yeah. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9472.4s)]
*  And ultimately to create some sort of allegory. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9473.16s)]
*  Right. So I don't think any of it was true. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9476.68s)]
*  I think it was all just, you know, [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9479.84s)]
*  I think it makes sense how it all got created and how every culture has their [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9482.119999999999s)]
*  own version and to me it's like an echo of the truth. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9486.599999999999s)]
*  It's like there's there's an echo there, like, God, what was the original thing? [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9490.919999999998s)]
*  What was it all about? [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9494.56s)]
*  Because like there's an echo to a lot of it, a lot of ancient stories and a lot [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9496.039999999999s)]
*  of religious stories, too, they're just like, man, I think something was going on. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9500.88s)]
*  And I think this is the echo of like this historical. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9505.8s)]
*  Depiction of probably something real that [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9511.64s)]
*  went down, like the Noah and the Ark story, I think that's a historical. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9514.64s)]
*  That's a depiction of that flood that we saw that wiped out Atlantis. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9519.08s)]
*  Without a doubt. I mean, that's part of the epic of Gilgamesh. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9523.6s)]
*  A giant flood. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9527.36s)]
*  I mean, that's the oldest story ever written. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9528.32s)]
*  Yep. We know of. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9530.92s)]
*  I mean, and it's not the only one that depicts a massive flood. [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9531.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9535.6s)]
*  Pretty much every religion that's that [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9536.16s)]
*  old has some story involving a flood. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9538.28s)]
*  I think I think when you apply that to all the other stories, too, you should [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9541.4s)]
*  probably assume that it wasn't fiction. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9545.8s)]
*  It might not be accurate because of all the factors that we already laid out [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9548.6s)]
*  because of people, but it's probably the echoes of a real story. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9552.92s)]
*  Well, the flood is. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9556.88s)]
*  Yeah. So I do think that because that's part [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9557.96s)]
*  of allegory is like taking something that is real. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9560.2s)]
*  And then you you just make like almost a fairy tale out of it. [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9563.52s)]
*  Like you still have the because you're telling in that sense, you're like saving [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9567.6s)]
*  history, like you're preserving history, but you're not doing it in the sense that [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9573.119999999999s)]
*  we would as we would do it now, where we would like dictate time and date and names. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9576.4s)]
*  Right. You're just saying, oh, there was this [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9580.8s)]
*  great event that happened in our ancestors time. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9582.76s)]
*  And if they figure this out, imagine if they figured out all these things [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9585.52s)]
*  thousands and thousands of years ago, then you have the flood, the impacts. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9589.08s)]
*  Society has to rebuild. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9592.72s)]
*  Then you're telling these stories over and over and over after all this time. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9594.039999999999s)]
*  That would kind of account for a lot of things for sure. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9597.72s)]
*  And one of them would be that God created the universe in six days. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9601.16s)]
*  Yeah. Because like, what is the Big Bang? Right. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9605.24s)]
*  What is six days? Like, what are you saying? [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9608.84s)]
*  Like, what does that mean? [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9610.64s)]
*  Is it just a short amount of time? [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9611.64s)]
*  Is that what you're trying to say? Is that like 72 virgins? [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9613.08s)]
*  You know, when they say 72 virgins in heaven, they don't really mean 72. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9615.519999999999s)]
*  It's like a fuckload. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9618.92s)]
*  It's like the way of saying it. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9620.08s)]
*  Like when you say God created the universe in six days, like [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9621.6s)]
*  maybe that means maybe that's the Big Bang. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9625.24s)]
*  Like maybe you're literally talking about the birth of the universe. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9627.68s)]
*  Yeah. In a very short period of time. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9631.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9633.24s)]
*  It could just shot boom. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9634.2s)]
*  If the universe is infinite, it's been around forever. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9635.84s)]
*  What is like that quick burst? [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9638.12s)]
*  What is that? [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9640.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's yeah, that's a man. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9642.04s)]
*  You're trying to recall that story, right? [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9644.720000000001s)]
*  You would say, yeah, on this day this happened this day, that happened. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9646.800000000001s)]
*  But ultimately, it's just day after day after day. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9650.36s)]
*  And then seven day you rest. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9652.640000000001s)]
*  And otherwise, yeah, if you're trying to explain the birth of the universe [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9653.84s)]
*  that happened, like you people were talking about it for thousands of years. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9658.04s)]
*  And then someone wrote it down on clay tablets thousands of years later. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9662.400000000001s)]
*  These are just the memories of some ancient [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9666.720000000001s)]
*  knowledge where people really had reached a level of sophistication that we could [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9669.08s)]
*  only imagine. Yeah. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9673.6s)]
*  And they were just flatlined right back to cave people again. [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9674.92s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, that's what. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9678.28s)]
*  Yeah, because like Greek mythology, all those mythologies, it's like [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9679.8s)]
*  an actual birth, like there's it all happen. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9683.439999999999s)]
*  It starts with like there's darkness and then there's light. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9686.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9688.72s)]
*  And that's like a common theme with pretty much every religion, every mythology. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9689.039999999999s)]
*  There was a sea of darkness. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9693.0s)]
*  Then there was light. And what if that's their version of the description of the [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9694.8s)]
*  Big Bang? Yeah, it's just turning on a light. [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9698.84s)]
*  That's how you describe the Big Bang to someone who has no concept of science, [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9701.76s)]
*  like no idea what are you talking about? [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9705.08s)]
*  Atoms? What molecules, subatomic particles? [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9706.880000000001s)]
*  What the fuck are you even saying? [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9709.8s)]
*  Exactly. You'd be like, yeah, imagine walking into a dark room and flicking a [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9711.28s)]
*  light switch and suddenly everything's here. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9714.36s)]
*  There was light. Yeah. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9716.56s)]
*  I mean, that's the common theme throughout any of those religions. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9717.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9721.2s)]
*  Well, I think the appeal of like a page like yours and the kind of that kind of [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9722.04s)]
*  things like people always love to learn cool shit and interesting shit. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9727.6s)]
*  Yeah. You know, whether it's interesting shit about the the universe or UFOs [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9731.84s)]
*  or crazy people throughout history. [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9737.0s)]
*  I wrote outlaw Josie Wells being a piece of shit. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9739.4s)]
*  I mean, the KKK is just not good. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9742.76s)]
*  They aren't big enough assholes. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9746.52s)]
*  Well, it's such a good movie. It sucks. Yeah, it is. [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9748.36s)]
*  I mean, yeah, it's not like you can't watch the damn movie, but you got to [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9750.92s)]
*  separate the man from the art always. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9754.32s)]
*  And then also there's a bunch of other [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oZSxMidp7E&t=9756.08s)]
