# Joe Rogan Experience #1446 - Bert Kreischer
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 24, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0V6KIZiXco)
*  And we're live.
*  Cheers sir.
*  Cheers brother.
*  Yeah, while the world is on fire we might as well get a little fucked up.
*  I've been clean for seven days.
*  No booze.
*  No nothing?
*  No nothing.
*  You look good, your face looks good.
*  I know.
*  I'm starting to see a direct difference when I quit drinking.
*  Do you feel trapped by your image?
*  By your party image?
*  I would never have said yes until this week I've exhaled for the first time in a very
*  big way.
*  Like where I was like, no road, I'm not doing social media.
*  I mean I'm doing stories and stuff but I'm not trying to put, like when things shut down
*  I kind of shut down with America and I was like, yesterday man I sat in a hammock sober
*  for like fucking two hours and just relaxed.
*  It is nice to be home for a while.
*  It is nice.
*  I realize what a beating our lifestyle takes on your body, the travel and then if you're
*  boozing too, the travel and the boozing together.
*  So we should tell everybody what we learned today.
*  I'm revising my thinking about this virus because of Michael Yeoh.
*  Michael Yeoh caught it.
*  Michael Yeoh is healthy as fuck.
*  He's not any high risk group.
*  Like he doesn't have any pre-existing conditions.
*  He's in shape and he got it and he got pneumonia too and he said it was a double combination
*  and he thought he was going to die.
*  And he was in the hospital for over a week and four days ago he said he thought he was
*  going to die.
*  That's fucking terrifying because Michael Yeoh is healthy.
*  He's not some 80 year old man.
*  I talked to my friend Dr. Peter Attia.
*  He's a physician and he-
*  That's the guy that swam from Maui.
*  Yes.
*  Swam all the islands.
*  He's a fucking straight up savage.
*  So his take, this is my question to him.
*  I said this is crazy shit.
*  What is your take on how so many people experience very few symptoms but others get wrecked?
*  And he said I still think most people below 55 sail through it.
*  I've had two patients get it.
*  Shitty cold and loss of a sense of smell and taste which probably returns soon but still
*  a small fraction of these folks get hurt.
*  I know a doc taking care of a 28 year old fitness instructor on a ventilator in New
*  York City today.
*  Why?
*  He said maybe some genetic predisposition.
*  We know blood types matters.
*  A is the worst.
*  O is the best based on antibodies.
*  He said I'm O positive.
*  He said but I don't think that explains more than some of it.
*  Maybe shit like vaping he said.
*  Still too soon to tell.
*  He is a straight up no-nonsense, no-bullshit guy.
*  And I listen to everything he says.
*  So when guys like him are concerned, I get concerned.
*  And he's concerned.
*  This is a weird disease.
*  Another thing that he said, it's weird that it seems that people who spend more time with
*  this get it worse.
*  He's like it's not like, you know, like doctors in hospitals with prolonged exposure get it
*  really bad.
*  Whereas some people get it and they don't get it bad.
*  It's weird.
*  It's a very, very strange disease according to doctors.
*  And I think we're still trying to figure this out.
*  You know, it's just wow.
*  It's one of those things where everyone's just sort of absorbing the information as
*  it comes in and you got to be open to adjusting your opinions.
*  And my opinions were I really was concerned with old people and I was concerned with the
*  I was concerned with old people and I was concerned with sick people.
*  Now after Michael Yeo, I'm like, okay, this is not that straightforward.
*  There might be some other crazy factors here.
*  Like for some people, yeah, like Idris Elba who looks fantastic, you know, fine.
*  But maybe other people are going to have a real hard time with it like Michael Yeo.
*  Like Michael Yeo is not a sickly guy.
*  He's a big robust guy.
*  That's a spooky one.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember your podcast with the.
*  Osterholm.
*  Chicken Little.
*  That scared the fuck out of me.
*  Fucking sitting in the back of my tour bus and I hear this.
*  I'm like, I've had a few cocktails.
*  I hit a joint.
*  Let's go to bed.
*  Oh cool.
*  Who's this guy?
*  Oh, the coronavirus.
*  I wouldn't mind hearing a little bit about that.
*  Holy.
*  First thing I did, I told Jamie, first thing I did, I sat up in bed and I was googled that
*  motherfucker.
*  I was like, he wrote a book, didn't he?
*  Fuck that guy.
*  I was so freaked out in that fucking podcast.
*  What's crazy about Osterholm is he predicted this shit literally specifically as to where
*  it was going to come from.
*  He was very insightful.
*  I didn't mean fuck that guy in a bad way.
*  He was a very insightful dude and it was a great podcast.
*  But man, I'll tell you right now, Joe, you said, you said, so guys that are overweight,
*  the drink a lot, the smoke.
*  I was talking to you.
*  You know that, right?
*  By the way, I thought you were.
*  I was.
*  I was.
*  I was like, I'm talking to you.
*  I didn't want to say it, but I was like, piecing together at all my good friends.
*  Who's my one friend takes care of himself the worst?
*  It's you.
*  It's me.
*  It's you.
*  I quit cigars, weed, booze.
*  Beautiful.
*  I'm having a drink now, but that's still OK, man.
*  Like if you stopped this bus now and got healthy and just drank water, only water for a month,
*  you know, you could pull this shit together.
*  I'm pulling it.
*  Relatively speaking, compared to the fucking savagery you do your physique to your body,
*  to your form, to your being by just downing booze constantly, you're great.
*  Like most people would be really fucked up if they were in your position.
*  That's we were all we were marveling when you ran that marathon like this motherfucker
*  party so hard and he just ran a marathon like it's crazy.
*  You're a very like I hate to use the same word again, but it's the right word robust.
*  You're a robust guy.
*  And the reason why you're able to endure all this booze is because you're robust.
*  But if you didn't do the booze, man, you'd probably be a stud because whatever the fuck
*  is keeping you going with all this booze, imagine what kind of you're like pouring sugar
*  water into a fucking 68 charger.
*  Clean that bitch up.
*  Clean that bitch up.
*  Replace the heads that that Hemi will purr.
*  Like you must be.
*  You have to have great genes.
*  There's no other way.
*  I mean, how old are you now?
*  47.
*  Yeah, you're 47.
*  And relatively speaking, compared to the fucking savagery you do, boozing, I boozed with you.
*  It's a rough go.
*  It's like smoking weed with Joey Diaz or with Be Real from Cypress Hill.
*  Just stop.
*  You're not in their league.
*  You don't roll with Hicks and Gracie and expect to tap them.
*  You don't smoke weed with Be Real.
*  I didn't see that.
*  I never see that.
*  And then I took Norman to Europe with me, Mark Norman.
*  And Mark Norman's a boozer.
*  Yeah.
*  And man, two days in and he tapped out.
*  We got him addicted to Ambien.
*  He is the funniest fucking human being.
*  I really love him.
*  He's a real comic, man.
*  I cherish guys like him.
*  Him, Andrew Schultz.
*  I texted with Schultz this morning.
*  These young guys coming up are everything to me.
*  Chris DeStefano?
*  Young women coming up too.
*  Do you know Chris DeStefano?
*  I do not know him well.
*  Man.
*  I know of him.
*  He's very funny.
*  He makes me giggle hard as fuck.
*  Very funny guy.
*  There's a good crop, a good crop of real comics who honor this thing that we do.
*  It's this weird thing we do.
*  It's like what we're doing is a very strange game of saying funny, silly shit and then
*  trying to make each other laugh.
*  But understanding what we're doing, don't say, oh, you really mean that.
*  Or, oh, you can't joke about this.
*  None of those guys will do that.
*  Because we know the game.
*  The game is to be funny.
*  That's the game.
*  Be funny.
*  And sometimes you say ridiculous shit to be funny.
*  Sometimes it works.
*  Sometimes it falls apart.
*  Sometimes it blows up in your face.
*  And sometimes it knocks it out of the park.
*  And so you've got to take those risks.
*  And you throw in every now and then.
*  It's the people that are in this thing that understand what we're doing and appreciate
*  that.
*  Those are the most fun people to hang out with.
*  But you never have to think about them getting upset at you for saying something or them
*  taking you literally or seriously or them not even taking you seriously but calling
*  you on to pretend that they're taking you seriously so that they can virtue signal.
*  Which I've seen before but I've never seen from anybody funny.
*  It's never from anybody funny.
*  It's always from these kind of half-assed, sort of half-cooked versions of a comic.
*  It's never been.
*  I was telling, I got into a conversation with Ari about what the parameters of a joke were
*  after the whole Kobe Bryant shit.
*  And he said something that made me like fucking stutter step.
*  He was like, you can't say it's not a joke.
*  He kept arguing.
*  You can't say it's not a joke.
*  You can't say it's not a joke.
*  It was a joke, Bert.
*  It was a joke.
*  And I was just saying to him, Tom and I had said that we didn't think it was funny.
*  We didn't think it was a joke.
*  And then I wrapped my head around.
*  I remember one time, Isla had a dance on fifth grade and they did it on stage.
*  Right?
*  And they were saying, just so you know, the parents are going to be in the audience, boys
*  may dance with boys, girls may dance with girls.
*  We just want all the parents to know that we're cool with that and make sure everyone's
*  cool with that.
*  You know, like a little preamble.
*  And I said, yeah, as long as they're white.
*  And man, some parents got so upset.
*  Like really, really upset.
*  They don't have any sense of humor.
*  And they go, are you being serious?
*  I go, guys, I'm joking.
*  Obviously, I want to...
*  I'm a professional comedian.
*  No, I don't want her dancing with girls.
*  I want her dancing with boys.
*  And that's what...
*  Did they start laughing at that at least?
*  No, no, no, no.
*  That got them more mad.
*  That got them more mad.
*  It's fucking half of the special is just times I fucking said the worst things to people.
*  Parents are weird, man, because some of them are super cool.
*  You know, and if you get lucky, like I know a really nice group of super cool parents
*  of like my kids' friends.
*  And it's a pleasure.
*  Because when we get together, it's fun.
*  Like I enjoy their company, our kids enjoy each other's company, and we have great times
*  together.
*  It's so...
*  I feel so fortunate for the friends that I've acquired this way.
*  You can find cool people that aren't comics.
*  They do exist.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You know, you can get lucky.
*  The problem is people that take themselves too seriously or people that are under the
*  iron fist of like office politics and office behavior and business behavior.
*  Those people get...
*  They get consumed because they're there every day.
*  And when you're there, you got to bullshit every day.
*  You're wearing a tie, you got slippery bottoms to your shoes.
*  The whole thing's nonsense, right?
*  And you have to speak and behave a certain way.
*  You can't make jokes about anything.
*  And sometimes you're working with girls and you're working with guys and everybody's flirting
*  with each other.
*  There's all this crazy office politics because people are trying to move up the ladder and
*  why they're trying to move up the ladder.
*  They have to make sure they don't say anything that's going to sabotage their career just
*  trying to be funny or just getting a little out of hand at the company Christmas party,
*  get a couple cocktails in you and ruin your career.
*  These people are always on the edge.
*  They're always suppressed.
*  So when they're around someone who's not, who just cuts loose, they're like, no, no,
*  you stay in line.
*  No, no jokes.
*  But looking at you though, they could have thought you were serious.
*  That's where it's dangerous because they might not be able to switch gears well.
*  Sometimes people, if they knew you were going to joke around about something, they'd be
*  fine.
*  But then you say something like that and you're like, oh my God, is he serious?
*  I have to stand up and denounce racism now.
*  That's the craziest part about having, especially I've gone through, I'm with my daughter, oldest
*  daughter is in 10th grade and my youngest is in eighth.
*  And those formative like K through five, those, that's the fun run of being a parent.
*  And because you meet a lot of parents that you don't know and you say shit and you find
*  out shit.
*  I remember one time we were at drop off and we found out we got an email about some, what
*  you would call it, and the mom sent it from her work account and it was a fucking porn
*  star.
*  And we were like, and we're in drop off, me and a couple of dads watching her fuck being
*  like, take a look at this.
*  That's rough.
*  Yeah.
*  That's one thing that's tough to switch gears from.
*  Even a guy or a girl, if you're a porn star and you want to go legit, it's a tough road.
*  It's a tough road.
*  For whatever reason, it's weird.
*  It's like if you accidentally did porn, but when you clearly like Kim Kardashian, it hasn't
*  hurt her at all.
*  Not at all.
*  But then you did porn and everybody's like, yeah, but there was no studio attached.
*  It was really independent.
*  She's like, she's like the clerks of porn.
*  Yeah.
*  And then this idea that somehow another magically got online, like what happened?
*  How did it get there?
*  Like this is a negotiation process.
*  But when you see like a mainstream porn star that's been in like tons of movies that very
*  rarely do they make a jump and then just do regular movies.
*  Tracy Lourdes is a bit of an example of an exception.
*  Yeah, but she did some stuff.
*  She did a John Waters movie.
*  Yeah.
*  She did some stuff.
*  Kim Kardashian's porn wasn't even that good.
*  How dare you?
*  It wasn't.
*  You didn't see her tits really.
*  You never saw her pussy.
*  Like it just was like her sucking his dick.
*  That's good enough.
*  I don't think you should ask for too much more.
*  It's one.
*  She did one movie.
*  She did one.
*  You got to learn your angles.
*  Paris Hilton's was better.
*  It's like her first set.
*  You know, like you realize like you got out of the gate too strong.
*  You didn't have a good closer.
*  She's not like, you know, she's not a world class professional.
*  I watched Paris Hilton's porn.
*  I was like, I would fuck her with the Herpes.
*  Allegedly.
*  Wow.
*  Just catch her on a good day, right?
*  That's what this, that's what this, when you saw fucking Florida, all those kids going
*  fuck it, this is my spring break.
*  Those are people that would raw dog it with Herpes and not tell you about it.
*  This is about me.
*  This is my vacation.
*  I'm in this other group chat and these, these comics are like, these kids are so stupid.
*  How can they be so irresponsible?
*  This and that.
*  And I just type in all caps.
*  They want to fuck.
*  That's what's going on.
*  They don't care.
*  They want to fuck and they're drunk in Mexico.
*  Like get out of here.
*  You know, they want to fuck or they're in Florida on spring break.
*  They're in Cancun or they're in, you know, there's people in Texas.
*  There was this thing about these Texas kids and they were, they were piled onto this,
*  this area together.
*  It's like this, I don't know.
*  It looked like some outdoor party area, but they were just stacked in there like sardines
*  and people are like, holy fuck.
*  Like yeah, yeah.
*  You, you didn't, you didn't raise your kids right.
*  Even if you did, even if you did, if you, they're hanging around with other kids that
*  are fuck ups, they're going to fuck up.
*  We all did that.
*  I was involved in a lot of really stupid shit because I was around some kids that were sketchy
*  when I was a kid, you know, especially when I lived in Jamaica Plain.
*  Jamaica Plain was like this, this area that we only lived there for about maybe less than
*  two years.
*  It was like a year and a half.
*  And it was like an urban section of Boston that's since been gentrified.
*  Apparently, apparently it's nice now.
*  But back then it was sketchy.
*  It was like all kinds of like everyone, Irish kids, Italian kids, black kids, Puerto Rican
*  kids, but no one was getting good parenting.
*  Everyone's parents smoked.
*  People were drunk.
*  Like they were chaos people.
*  They were like, it was weird.
*  They were wild people.
*  Like the whole block was filled with wild people.
*  They weren't bad people.
*  There wasn't like a crime infested dangerous neighborhood, but it was sketchy and everyone
*  was a mess.
*  Everyone on my block.
*  My next door neighbor, we've talked about this before, they were a punk rock band called
*  Death in the Shopping Mall.
*  And they used to play downstairs in the basement.
*  And so they had these thick layers of carpet set up in the basement.
*  So they had carpet all over the door, carpet all over the ceiling, many, many, many, many,
*  many layers.
*  And these guys would fucking go off in there playing guitar and fucking screaming.
*  And I was, I guess I was 11?
*  No, 13?
*  Yeah, I was 13 years old because it was middle school right before I went to high school.
*  So I was 13 years old.
*  And I was like fascinated because I was just becoming a teenager.
*  Living next door to these fucking savages, these savages, they just were playing crazy
*  fucking loud music.
*  And you didn't see punk rock people a lot back then.
*  I remember when there was a kid at the bus stop on Dale Mabry and he had a punk rock
*  haircut and every morning I'd drive to school, I'd look at him.
*  I'd be like, he has a mohawk.
*  His mom let him have a mohawk.
*  Well, I went from San Francisco to Gainesville, Florida, which was a college town.
*  You went to Gainesville?
*  Yeah, I was in Gainesville, Florida.
*  When I was 11 to 13.
*  You and River Phoenix?
*  And Ted Bundy.
*  That guy too.
*  They'll get me started on Ted Bundy.
*  So we lived there for a little bit and that was like just kind of college people and in
*  the apartments we lived in, just regular folks.
*  It was nothing crazy.
*  You didn't really see too much craziness as far as crime or sketchy folks.
*  Everyone was pretty normal.
*  Different races, different backgrounds, but just people, apartment life.
*  But then when we moved to Boston, man, those kids were wild.
*  They'd break into fucking warehouse buildings and everyone knew how to steal a car.
*  They were like 13.
*  They were all smoking.
*  Everyone was smoking.
*  I immediately went into this crazy environment of whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
*  I was like my dog Marshall in a room full of rabid German shepherds.
*  I was like, hey guys, can we talk this out?
*  I'm from an apartment complex.
*  I'm not used to semi-urban kids.
*  That's an interesting transition as a young child.
*  It was rough, man.
*  It was rough.
*  When I was 10, I moved to a neighborhood where it was very aggressive.
*  Same sort of situation?
*  Yeah.
*  We lived in a real white trash neighborhood, but my dad kind of sheltered me a little bit.
*  And then I moved in and there was all boys.
*  They were all a little older than me.
*  And I remember I learned the word faggot real quick.
*  That was the first thing I learned, that and how to hold an ice cube in my asshole.
*  Two really important things to have in your life.
*  I remember coming home and being like to my sister, faggot, go get my mom and dad.
*  Like what the fuck?
*  Yeah you can certainly get ruined by bad kids.
*  And no one knows that more than dads.
*  Dads see you hanging around with sketchy kids like, hey I don't like you hanging around
*  with that fucking guy.
*  Dads see where that stuff goes.
*  Sketchy boys commit murder.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Sketchy boys join gangs.
*  Sketchy boys rob cars and kill people drunk driving and set fires to warehouses.
*  That's what sketchy boys do.
*  Sketchy boys can get you locked up.
*  We did a lot of sketchy shit when I was 13 years old.
*  And I remember thinking like, wow these guys have been doing this their whole life and
*  they're 13.
*  Meanwhile, I just sort of stumbled.
*  I just want to be someone's friend.
*  I'm like, fuck.
*  That's when I took up fishing.
*  I really got into fishing.
*  For real.
*  I got to get the fuck away from these kids.
*  Everyone's crazy.
*  I didn't have your brain.
*  I kind of just picked up with them every time.
*  Man, I did not feel protected when I was young.
*  And it's one of the reasons why I value community today.
*  When I was young I felt like really disconnected.
*  My parents split up.
*  And then my mom moved in with my stepdad.
*  He's a great guy and everything like that.
*  But we moved around a lot.
*  So I was never around kids that I knew for any long period of time.
*  And I never felt like I was safe.
*  I remember kids would always start fights.
*  Boys, if you move in a new neighborhood, boys always want to start fights.
*  Especially if girls think you're cute.
*  If girls think you're cute, boys want to fuck you up.
*  And then when I was 13, I was like, I just got to get the fuck away from these kids.
*  And I found this lake that was near me.
*  I really got into fishing.
*  It was called Jamaica pond.
*  And they would stock it with trout.
*  And there was bass in there.
*  All kinds of fish.
*  You could fish there all the time.
*  And then you met this whole community of people who fished there.
*  Mostly older folks that would fish there.
*  But you learn about fishing.
*  So I fished all the time, man.
*  All the time.
*  That speaks a lot to who you are.
*  Because that's not who I am.
*  You just dove in.
*  I remember being totally anti-pot.
*  And then my buddy came in and was like, you want to get high?
*  And I was like, OK, man.
*  And we got high on Sal's dock.
*  Well, I had friends like that, too.
*  There was a friend named Vic Dobrowski.
*  I'll never forget.
*  He was the most criminal out of all of our friends.
*  And he was selling weed when we were 13.
*  Dude was selling weed at 13.
*  You just call him.
*  He had the weed.
*  And he was just like a dude that had seen some shit.
*  Like even 13.
*  He wasn't mean or anything like that.
*  He was a nice guy.
*  He'd just come over like, what's up, man?
*  Everything cool?
*  You guys cool?
*  Yeah.
*  He had seen some shit.
*  I wish I had that fucking confidence.
*  I've never been that guy that's been cool at a party.
*  You're better off.
*  You're better off.
*  He's just not as aware.
*  No one should be confident.
*  You're a jelly bag made out of fucking human skin covering these brittle bones.
*  And there's no roof over your head.
*  You're on a planet.
*  And there's no roof to the planet.
*  So it's exposed to the universe.
*  It's a shooting gallery of asteroids out there.
*  And the only thing that protects us is the thin layer of gas above our heads.
*  You shouldn't be confident.
*  You should be exactly how you are.
*  You should be exactly how you are.
*  You just need better methods of coping than alcohol.
*  But the way you are is a good way to be.
*  That confident thing is not good.
*  It's good if you have specific goals.
*  Like if you want to be a fighter, you kind of have to be confident.
*  But then, do you know who Rashad Evans is?
*  Of course.
*  Yeah, former light heavyweight champion.
*  Awesome guy.
*  He's a totally different human.
*  That was crazy.
*  I had him on my podcast.
*  And now that he's retired.
*  When he was a fighter, you have to kind of be mean.
*  You have to kind of be a specific kind of person.
*  He used to bark like a dog.
*  He was a beach dude.
*  Well, I think you're thinking of Rampage, you racist.
*  No, wait.
*  I know Rashad Evans.
*  I know.
*  Yeah, I was thinking of Rampage.
*  You're right.
*  You're definitely right.
*  I'm so sorry.
*  Listen, I'm racist.
*  I'm so sorry, guys.
*  They just had a great fight.
*  That's why.
*  Those two are connected because they were both coaches of the ultimate fighter in the
*  peak of its popularity.
*  And it was one of the most heated exchanges ever.
*  Is them standing like an inch away from each other saying, call me a bitch.
*  Rashad was like, you a bitch.
*  I remember that.
*  And they were going back and forth to each other.
*  I'm like, oh my God, these guys are going to throw down on TV.
*  It was very, very tense.
*  And Rashad won that fight.
*  But I'm like, you kind of have to be confident to be that guy back then.
*  You know, to be a light heavyweight champion, to be a guy who knocks out Chuck Liddell with
*  one punch.
*  You have to be that.
*  But once you're not doing that anymore, look to Rashad.
*  Now Rashad's like this real spiritual guy.
*  He's a vegan.
*  He does psychedelics.
*  And he's really intelligent.
*  It was a pleasure to sit down and talk to him because you realize you see the metamorphosis,
*  the evolution and maturity as a man.
*  He's like a different person now.
*  He's abandoned his old skin, his old skin, I should say, and become a new person.
*  Like a very different new person.
*  Like a really peaceful, really friendly, really nice guy.
*  He was always a great guy.
*  But he's like more at ease now.
*  I think that's what, when you said, when you were talking about me, backed into a persona
*  of Boozin and whatnot, I don't know if it's that as much, but like I had a conversation
*  with Ali Wong.
*  She said you tour a lot.
*  And I said, yeah, I was in my head.
*  It's this weird thing about like, I gotta, I gotta work.
*  Like when the special came out, that was so unearthing to not do any press, to do no press.
*  I woke up St. Patty's Day.
*  Do you know I had that huge St. Patty's Day thing planned at the store, calling sick to
*  work show.
*  I had all this press, like all these marketing ideas.
*  And then it just was like, hey, the world's stopping.
*  And it took a couple days of like depression, of just like going like, man, what am I gonna
*  do about this special?
*  I gotta promote it.
*  I gotta get out there.
*  And then I think it was perspective where I was walking to the garage one night and
*  I was just, you know, angst.
*  I go, I should make a video to let everyone know my special's on Netflix.
*  I didn't, you know, in my head.
*  And then I went, hold on, man, there's a lot going on in this world and my special being
*  watched is not the most important thing.
*  Also, I don't think you have to do much.
*  I mean, I think having a few conversations like this, people are looking for shit to
*  do right now.
*  They're throttling down the internet.
*  That's what they're really worried about.
*  They're worried about the infrastructure.
*  They're really worried about the power grid.
*  They're really worried about internet.
*  Like they're already starting to throttle internet because so many people are simultaneously
*  streaming.
*  You gotta think of how many people are home right now and how many people, when you leave
*  them home, just watch Netflix.
*  It's fucking staggering.
*  Me.
*  Me.
*  I watched a special with my daughters last night.
*  Just imagine.
*  Oh no.
*  They saw your bits?
*  Did they not know the bits before?
*  They didn't know any of them.
*  I don't want to say anything, but the one about her having her period?
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  How rough was that?
*  She was like, poor girl blew out her pussy.
*  Oh, dad, dad, dad.
*  What the, dad?
*  The one they reacted to, they had me put my dick on the ass shoulder.
*  There was a lot of them that they were touching go, but we just watched it quickly flip through
*  it and then watch Big Cats.
*  Big Cats?
*  Or Cat King.
*  Tiger King.
*  Tiger King?
*  What is that?
*  Holy fuck, Joe.
*  What is it?
*  This is talk about faux confidence.
*  It's on Netflix and it might be the most amazing show I've ever seen.
*  It's about people who own big cats like tigers.
*  But the whole thing is about petting cubs.
*  Cub petting.
*  You got to pet them when they're real young and then they stay cool with you?
*  No, no, no, no.
*  So these guys make a living off cub petting.
*  So they bring the cubs around and everyone wants a cub.
*  Then what happens is the cubs grow up and then they end up with big fucking cats.
*  It is, I won't talk to you about it, I'll let you watch it and enjoy it with someone
*  who's like, once you've seen it, there's no reason for me to tell you about it.
*  It's fucking amazing.
*  Even if you treat your cat really, really well, you got him in a cage.
*  Cat does not want to be in a fucking cage.
*  No shit.
*  They don't want to be in a cage.
*  We got a code red, someone ripped off Brenda's arm.
*  It is.
*  Someone ripped off someone's arm?
*  Joe, you got to watch it.
*  It is.
*  It's 187 cats on this Oklahoma property.
*  Oh my god.
*  150 acres or something like that.
*  Oh my god.
*  I'm going to save it for when you watch it.
*  Somebody ripped someone's arm off?
*  Uh huh.
*  She went back to work seven days later.
*  Oh my god.
*  With no arm?
*  Savage, with no fucking arm.
*  So now she has a stump.
*  Little stump.
*  Oh my god.
*  Still working with big cats.
*  That is so crazy.
*  Can you imagine if they just started eating part of you and you're like, I still got an
*  egg, I get this part of my foot.
*  The one guy found the job off Craigslist.
*  He's like, I've never seen anything like this.
*  Fuck it.
*  Let's do it.
*  It's so fucking crazy.
*  If you had a job like that, people are going to sign up.
*  No matter what it is.
*  Oh yeah.
*  If you had a job to go out and castrate wolves, there's going to be guys that are like, I
*  think I can do it.
*  Oh, by the way, we haven't even gotten to the fucking crazy part.
*  That's not even the crazy part.
*  When you get into these guys' lifestyles, this guy married one.
*  First of all, he's gay.
*  He doesn't look gay.
*  Married one dude and then they brought in another dude.
*  They have a throuple.
*  That's not the crazy one.
*  The crazy one is the guy that lives in South Carolina that's got fucking nine wives who
*  he grooms.
*  Joe, this is one.
*  Really?
*  Look, everyone, my special hey big boys on Netflix, but fucking watch this show first.
*  Wow, that's strong praise.
*  It is.
*  Tiger King.
*  I'm writing that down.
*  I'm putting it on my phone.
*  Me and the girls watched Hey Big Boy and we fuck in.
*  It was funny.
*  We giggled.
*  We talked through whatever.
*  At the end credits, I put all the stuff that's from, I put a high-lifeperiod party cake.
*  I put in the credits, I put her test, my dad howling like an owl, and then Big Cats
*  comes on.
*  Big King?
*  What's it called?
*  Tiger King.
*  Tiger King.
*  In 15 seconds, George and I are like, all right, everyone's up.
*  We found our show.
*  It's fucking good.
*  It's good.
*  There's something about people and giant crazy animals, people that want to keep those animals
*  as pets.
*  There's this Russian dude, I think, who has a polar bear and he swims with the polar bear.
*  Have you ever seen it?
*  No, no, no, no.
*  He's in a swimming pool with a polar bear.
*  He's hanging out with the thing and cuddling with it.
*  I was like, what in the fuck are you doing, man?
*  You don't identify with that a little bit because I do.
*  I definitely do.
*  As a dude with big dogs.
*  I think it's cool to watch because it's not killing him.
*  It's like, look at it.
*  It's hugging him.
*  It's kissing him.
*  Until it decides not to.
*  Bears I think are a different animal because if you keep bears really well fed, they're
*  not just predators.
*  They're omnivores.
*  So if you keep bears really well fed, they're probably pretty chill.
*  And I wonder if bears are like people.
*  I think if you feed people only vegetables, I really believe this, they probably get less
*  aggressive because I think your body probably doesn't think you need to be chasing things
*  and killing things because you're not eating animal protein.
*  So your body's like, oh, we can just relax and stroll and just pick berries and eat grasses
*  and stuff.
*  You know what?
*  I think if you did the same thing to a bear, maybe if you just gave the bear apple pies
*  Look at that bear get out of a pool.
*  Bro, he's so big.
*  I mean, here's the problem is I would love one.
*  Yeah, I don't think you're allowed to have one for a real good reason because there's
*  a lot of people that shouldn't have fucking dogs, man.
*  You've seen bad dogs and people have bad dogs.
*  There's a lot of people that shouldn't have dogs, especially in LA.
*  Yeah, well, there's a lot of people that don't train their dogs well and their dogs are really
*  aggressive and they jump up on people.
*  Imagine if it was a bear that did that.
*  Just the responsibility.
*  Look at the length of its neck.
*  So crazy.
*  They have such long necks.
*  But just what it is, the animal that it is, it seems ridiculous.
*  You should be able to have that in your backyard.
*  That's a polar bear.
*  I don't know where that guy lives.
*  Where is that?
*  Is it a say?
*  Oh, it's got to be Ohio.
*  Oklahoma.
*  One of those cities.
*  Ohio seems like-
*  Remember the one guy who shot himself and let all the animals out?
*  Yeah, they talk about that on the fucking thing.
*  That's part of the reason that it's illegal to have fucking big cats in Ohio.
*  Because of that guy.
*  I live in Ohio and raised.
*  I like those Savannah cats, Anthony Kumia has.
*  Maybe he has bangles.
*  Yeah, servals.
*  Yeah, I like those.
*  Isn't that what they're called?
*  Serval cats?
*  Yeah.
*  Those are apparently never really tame.
*  They're never really tame.
*  Are dogs though?
*  Well, I think maybe it was John Jones.
*  I think John Jones has a couple of them, but he was feeding them.
*  It was either John Jones or someone else who had them.
*  I know John has some big cats.
*  I bet he does.
*  Yeah, he's a wild man.
*  I want to party with that guy.
*  No, you don't.
*  Yes, I do.
*  You think you do.
*  I'll party, bro.
*  You don't want a piece.
*  John Jones goes to the Darklands.
*  That's my new TV show.
*  Can you out party me?
*  I just go party with John Jones, John Daly.
*  You have one episode.
*  You called me up and like, I quit.
*  I quit my show.
*  I called Netflix.
*  I can't do this anymore.
*  But yeah, so he was feeding it chicken bones.
*  I'm not sure if it was John or someone else, but it's crazy because the cat starts making
*  these crazy noises.
*  Like, while he's like giving it, whoever the guy was, it was giving them the chicken bones.
*  While he's giving this cat these bones, the cat is getting really angry, like scary.
*  He might just jump on you and bite you like primal shit.
*  They're not a regular cat, dude.
*  If you give a regular cat a chicken bone, they'll be pumped, but they're not going to
*  go, wow.
*  Crazy cat noises this thing was making.
*  I was like, what?
*  See if you can find serval cat growling while eating.
*  There's one on viral on TikTok that's been posted all the time.
*  They feed it every day.
*  I've seen our cat catch rats.
*  Oh, wow.
*  It's usually, I mean, I put it on Instagram a bunch, but it'll catch rats, bring them
*  into the house and then let the rat go, which is exactly what I want this cat for.
*  To watch it hunt a rat is fucking fascinating.
*  It is.
*  It's built in.
*  It's like you can't get that out of that cat's brain ever.
*  No, built in.
*  It's built into the system.
*  Yeah, that comes no matter what the cat's life is like.
*  If you could have a little bait, I had a ragdoll cat and she was just fluffy little ball of
*  fur.
*  Just flopped her back and get pet all the time.
*  And she was that's all she was interested in until she saw a bird and then it was locked
*  in.
*  Oh, locked in and she'd make these noises.
*  I have a bit about it in my act.
*  Oh, wait, I think I saw you talk about that.
*  That was my last special.
*  I had the whole bit about vegan cats.
*  Some lady was mean to me and I went to her page and I looked up hashtag vegan cat.
*  I was like, holy fuck.
*  This is a thing.
*  And then I started going down this rabbit hole of people with animals and cats in particular
*  and how cats are the they're the strangest animal that we keep as pets.
*  I have two of them.
*  I love cats.
*  They're sweet.
*  My daughter, my oldest daughter has them now.
*  My middle daughter is allergic.
*  But when I'm around them, I love them.
*  I love them.
*  But you got to do weird shit with them.
*  First of all, you got to castrate the males.
*  You got to fix them all like my dog Marshall.
*  He's not fixed.
*  He's fine.
*  There's nothing wrong with him.
*  He's not going to get laid.
*  He's around me all the time.
*  And it does fuck with their energy.
*  And it's irresponsible to have dogs with testicles and just have them have a bunch of babies,
*  unwanted babies.
*  You're right.
*  Absolutely.
*  But the idea that that's the only way it has to be that he said the dog has to either be
*  fixed or you are you're irresponsible and the dog is going to fuck a lot and make babies.
*  No, you can be a responsible dog owner and the dog is not fixed and dog is more energy.
*  Like police dogs that are never fixed.
*  It's for reasons because when they're fixed, they stop producing testosterone.
*  There's a lot of problems with we got our dog Priscilla fixed at a young age, a bull
*  mastiff.
*  And we found out later that when you get a dog fixed, a bull mastiff fixed too young,
*  heads up to any bull mastiff owners, it can fuck with their joints.
*  Yeah, they have to reach physical maturity.
*  Your body needs the hormones that it was born with.
*  I mean, this is the whole idea behind being a young, healthy dog.
*  And then if you trim the dog's balls, you're changing what the dog is.
*  And you can do that.
*  My point was you can do that with dogs or you cannot do that with dogs.
*  Like you can have dogs that have their testicles.
*  But with cats, you have to do it.
*  If you have a male cat, they're all fixed or they will piss all over your fucking house.
*  Dude, it's nasty.
*  I had a male cat that was a feral cat that I raised and I had to corral him in the bathroom
*  in order to trap him and bring him to the veterinarian to fix him.
*  While I was corralling him, he pissed on the wall.
*  He lifted up his tail and pissed all over the wall.
*  I was like, dude, what the fuck?
*  And I threw a towel or a bathrobe or something over him and I scooped him up and I fought
*  with this cat, fought with him and stuffed him into a laundry basket and took him to
*  get fixed.
*  You have to get him fixed, man.
*  Fighting a cat is fucking when it shows you just how weak you are.
*  He's so little too.
*  He wasn't a big cat.
*  At the time, he wasn't even a year old because I was getting him fixed.
*  I think you get him fixed like seven, eight, nine months, something like that.
*  But he was ready to fuck me up, man.
*  It was hard.
*  I had to corral him, get him into this fucking laundry basket, bring him to Dr. Craig, who
*  is my veterinarian and insino before he passed.
*  Rest in peace.
*  He was a great guy.
*  Then when I was bringing him to him, I'm like, he's in there.
*  Are you guys going to be able to get him out?
*  You want me to stay?
*  They're like, no, I think we're going to be able to handle it.
*  Then afterwards, I came by to pick up the cat.
*  He was like, what the fuck?
*  I go, yeah, dude.
*  It's a feral cat.
*  You'll only say yes to getting some kid one time who's like, hey, can you help me get
*  the cat, my cat out of the tree?
*  I was like, yeah, sure.
*  One time.
*  Then you fight a cat in a tree and you're like, fuck this.
*  You can't do that.
*  Cats in a tree, man, first of all, without a ladder, you might fall.
*  Even with a ladder, you might fall.
*  They might jump on you and bite you and you might freak out and spaz.
*  A cat is freaked out for its life up in a tree and it doesn't know how to get down.
*  They might fucking cut you.
*  Dude, once they hook onto you, they hook onto you and they just start fucking trying to
*  gut you.
*  Yeah, my cat that was feral, he was a trip.
*  I would never have a feral cat again, but I had a crazy connection with him because
*  he was a legit wild cat.
*  When I first got him, I had to lock myself in a bedroom and hang out with him for a few
*  days, just read books and had a litter box and brought food in there.
*  Just me and him hanging out together because he was really little.
*  When I would pet him, he would be fine.
*  He would purr really loud.
*  He would be fine.
*  But as soon as I put him down, he hiss at me and run away and trying to climb up the
*  curtains.
*  He went crazy.
*  I had a spare bedroom in this house.
*  I was living in Encino and I just set the bedroom up.
*  I set it up for just me and the cat.
*  I'm like, all right, dude, we're going to get to know each other.
*  These are the kind of shit things you do when you're 27.
*  You don't have a girlfriend.
*  You're like, I'm just going to fucking live with this cat for a while because me and this
*  cat are going to hang out.
*  I just read books for two days locked in this bedroom with this fucking wild cat.
*  He would calm down for a little bit, let me purr, let me pet him.
*  Then he would purr and I'd let him go and he'd hiss at me and run away.
*  This went on for two fucking days.
*  Then finally, by the end of two days, he was pretty chill.
*  By the end of two days, this guy just seems to pet me and give me food.
*  I could always come up to him and pet him.
*  But no one else could.
*  No one, none of my friends, no one could come over and pet that cat, just me.
*  I was the only one he had an agreement with.
*  He was super cool with other cats.
*  When I brought other cats in, I stayed with him for two days.
*  Then I introduced him to my other cat, Spaz.
*  Spaz is the fluff dog cat.
*  Then they got along instantly.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, he was like, cats, I can trust cats.
*  She's like, I don't know any other cats.
*  I never met another cat.
*  It was fucking great.
*  It was like a Transplains on Automobiles, one-stop candy.
*  I had this other cat that I had from the time when I was 25 and that cat was a cunt.
*  She didn't like anybody but me.
*  She just was a cunty cat.
*  Always was a cunty cat.
*  She was just a weird cat.
*  Some cats are just weird, man.
*  Then my other cat, the fluff ball cat, she fucking loved everybody.
*  Everybody that came over, she'd rub on your leg and you'd pet her and she'd purr.
*  Everybody loved her.
*  You could scoop her up and just start rubbing her belly and she would purr.
*  Anybody could pick her up.
*  But cats, they are their own little thing.
*  Every one of them has got their own little personality.
*  Joey Diaz, you talked to him about his cats.
*  At one point in time, I don't know how many he has now, but he had 11 cats.
*  Like a two-bedroom apartment.
*  I was like, that is so insane.
*  And they all had personalities, man.
*  Some of them, he was the only one that could touch.
*  Other ones, they were real friendly with everybody.
*  Cats are a trip but you have to fix them.
*  That was my point.
*  You can have a dog that has balls and they're great.
*  My dog, Marshall, he's great.
*  He's not aggressive at all and he's three.
*  He seems like a fucking cool dog.
*  He's the sweetest.
*  But you can't do that with cats.
*  You have to fix all of them.
*  They'll piss all over your house.
*  Have you ever seen a male cat that hasn't been fixed, that lives on a farm?
*  Bro, they don't even look the same.
*  They have these big heads.
*  They have big pit bull heads.
*  Really?
*  Yes.
*  Alley cats that are not fixed or barnyard cats, they're famous for being vicious animals.
*  They're different.
*  They look different.
*  They have their balls.
*  They're thick.
*  They have muscles.
*  Yeah, they have thick heads.
*  I guess I've only seen female cats and kittens.
*  When I think about it, my wife lived on a, her grandmother has a big farm and there's
*  always cats there but I think I've only seen the females and the kittens.
*  Yeah.
*  I've only seen females, kittens and fixed males.
*  You see castrated males.
*  They're different.
*  They don't pee everywhere and they're more chill.
*  Dude, if you see a fucking barnyard cat with his balls, those are sketchy animals.
*  I don't think I have.
*  I remember back in the day when you'd be like, oh, a cat sprayed in my car.
*  That doesn't happen anymore but back in Florida you just leave your windows down.
*  Cats sprayed in my car one time and I was like, fuck.
*  Smells like shit.
*  They spray everywhere.
*  They spray in your house.
*  I would open up my gym bag.
*  My cat pissed in my gym bag.
*  Oh, we had dogs that pissed all over.
*  Shit.
*  I remember one time I was in the car with my girlfriend in college and we had a dog,
*  Thelma, that pissed all over everything.
*  I was with my little sisters in the back and this girl leans forward and there's like a
*  brown stain on her back.
*  I go, hey, what's on the back of your shirt?
*  She goes, oh, I must have spilled soda on my shirt.
*  My little sister's tan at the time.
*  She goes, you drink soda over your shoulder?
*  She was like, huh?
*  My little sister goes, I think our dog pissed on your shirt.
*  And the girl's like, no, no, that's not.
*  And Connie's like, no, no, I'm pretty sure it smelled it.
*  You're like, yeah, she pissed on her fucking shirt.
*  Wow.
*  Dogs will piss in your bed if they're mad at you.
*  Cats will piss on your bed if they're mad at you.
*  They'll piss on your pillow.
*  Oh, fuck that.
*  I was never a cat person.
*  I was always a dog person.
*  Dog and reptiles.
*  I was into reptiles for a long time.
*  Yeah, I'm fascinated by animals.
*  I love animals.
*  For companions, it's hard to beat a dog.
*  So if you could go through with all the dogs you ever owned,
*  right?
*  Yeah.
*  Reboot one genetically and get that exact same dog back today.
*  Can't do Marshall because Marshall's already here.
*  I had a mastiff named Johnny Cash.
*  I met Johnny Cash.
*  He's the sweetest dog ever.
*  It's the first time I met you.
*  He's the sweetest dog ever.
*  I loved him.
*  He's a sweetheart.
*  It was real sad watching him age because at the end,
*  he couldn't walk.
*  And I used to have to pick him up and bring him
*  in the house to eat.
*  And then I would carry him outside again
*  to see if he had to go to the bathroom.
*  But he was, at a certain point in his life,
*  he really could only lie down.
*  How old did he get?
*  13, which is very, very old for a mastiff.
*  It was very old for a mastiff.
*  But it was really sad seeing him slip away.
*  It was rough.
*  Yeah.
*  It's such a short amount of time.
*  It really is.
*  13 years.
*  Priscilla's nine right now.
*  And it feels like yesterday that we got her.
*  We got a new puppy to keep her young.
*  This puppy's a cunt.
*  Oh, really?
*  Oh, no.
*  Just so much energy.
*  I was going down on Leanne the other day,
*  and the puppy just jumps on the bed.
*  Are we fucking this bitch?
*  Just starts licking her face.
*  I'm like, god damn it.
*  Fucking.
*  Rude dog.
*  Doesn't understand its place.
*  You can't work out in front of this dog.
*  He's like, oh, we're doing jumping jacks, huh?
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah.
*  I had a joke.
*  Well, it's a baby.
*  I had a joke in the old set that will probably be retired
*  now that we're not doing this for eight weeks.
*  At least eight weeks, man.
*  How long is this going to be?
*  It's probably going to be several months before.
*  June?
*  Easily.
*  Could be longer.
*  It could be maybe they find medication
*  that even though there's not a vaccine,
*  there's some hope for a few different kinds of medication.
*  One of them is a malaria drug.
*  I can't pronounce the name off the top of my head.
*  And there's another one that shows promise as well.
*  And they think that it might be possible that people
*  could catch this, and you would give them the medication,
*  it would wipe it out.
*  There's also some speculation about Tamiflu,
*  but I don't think there's any conclusive evidence that
*  shows that Tamiflu helps it.
*  But there is some of these anti-malarial medications,
*  I think, that they think has promise.
*  What concerns me is that it seems
*  to be so different with different people.
*  That's what's weird about this.
*  What's scary right now for everybody is the unknown.
*  We're in the unknown.
*  Now we've never been in this situation before as a culture.
*  We're on lockdown, and the whole world
*  is scared of a disease.
*  Not in our lifetimes, not since the Spanish Flu.
*  And back then, there wasn't as much transportation.
*  There wasn't as much distribution of information.
*  So people probably weren't as aware as we are now
*  of all the various cases all around them all the time.
*  Because we're hearing about cases in Italy and fucking
*  Australia everywhere.
*  We're hearing about cases all over the planet.
*  I don't think that was the case back during the Spanish Flu
*  days.
*  I think it was probably harder to understand
*  what was happening, because you probably only
*  got the newspaper and the radio back then.
*  And everybody had to huddle around at a certain time.
*  And those are the masters of information.
*  Whatever they said, that was it.
*  But now you get all sorts of conflicting information,
*  even from doctors, man.
*  I've read doctors that think it's nothing.
*  And then I've read doctors that were terrified.
*  It's like, whoa, this is nuts.
*  And then you look at, I don't know
*  if you've been paying attention to what these senators did.
*  There's some senators, they had a behind closed doors
*  meeting about the coronavirus in China
*  and what it could mean to the United States
*  and the various impacts.
*  And they went out and sold their stock.
*  Immediately.
*  Dude.
*  But at the same time, they were talking
*  about how under control the government had it
*  and how we're prepared and how it's going to be fine.
*  And meanwhile, they knew.
*  They knew.
*  So they had two faces.
*  They had a public face that they were given to us
*  to try to keep us calm.
*  And then they had a private face,
*  which realized that the stock market was
*  going to take a huge loss.
*  And so they sold everything and made immense profits
*  based on the information that they found out
*  from these closed door meetings about the coronavirus.
*  How are they supposed to handle the,
*  legally, what are they supposed to do?
*  Because that makes it confusing.
*  I don't know what constitutes insider trading.
*  How does that work?
*  Do you understand how that works?
*  If you have information that can allow you to make money,
*  well, isn't that what everyone's trying to do?
*  What is the point of playing the stock market
*  if you don't know things?
*  And if you do know things, if you know more
*  because you know the guy who's the president
*  and he tells you something about something they're going to do
*  and you're not supposed to trade then
*  because of that information, like, all right, okay,
*  I'm sure there's a logic to it.
*  I'm a moron, don't run it by me.
*  But if that's insider trading,
*  well, what is it what the senators do?
*  If they knew that the coronavirus
*  is going to wreck our economy,
*  if they knew that it was coming down
*  like a fucking storm of hail that no one could stop,
*  if they knew, and then they bailed out
*  and made immense profits,
*  that seems so shady.
*  That seems so shady that they didn't advise people.
*  You're supposed to be a leader, right?
*  If you're in a position, an elected representative,
*  you're supposed to be acting in the position of a leader.
*  And if your way to lead is tell people one thing,
*  but act in a completely different direction,
*  tell people everything's going to be fine,
*  but then start selling your stock at a profit,
*  and you don't tell other people to do it
*  because you're worried that maybe that information
*  is going to cause some ripple effect
*  and it's going to destroy the economy
*  even before the coronavirus hits,
*  just out of panic and fear and people are going to act wrong.
*  But you acted in a different way
*  than the way you were talking.
*  You acted like this shit was going to be real.
*  You acted like this is going to be a real problem.
*  And then the question is,
*  how much of a problem did they think it was going to be?
*  Maybe they dumped their stock
*  they thought it was going to be a little problem.
*  Would that be okay?
*  Well, but if they found out it was going to be
*  a huge problem, then it's not.
*  Well, that seems weird to me too.
*  I don't know what should the rules be
*  with information in the stock market.
*  The stock market is gross.
*  The whole thing's gross.
*  What are we basing our economy on?
*  This fucking madness?
*  This is not the way that the 2009 breakdown was.
*  2008 when the stock market crashed
*  it was based on literal numbers and investments.
*  This is real.
*  No, no, I would actually say
*  that one was more real than this one.
*  This is a, the stock market's crashed
*  in a way that you're going like,
*  it's based on, I mean, I know that it's
*  for commercial businesses, their loans are going to come up
*  and it's going to be tough for them.
*  But at some point you're like,
*  I wish you could just put it on freeze
*  and go, hey, let's come back in like two months
*  and let's start where we were.
*  Let's make sure everyone was fed.
*  Like that's.
*  But Bert, this is the ultimate real.
*  Because if it's supposed to be about confidence
*  and things rising and falling,
*  this is like the ultimate expression of that.
*  There's no confidence.
*  You can't work.
*  Of course it's going to crash.
*  If it doesn't crash here, then it's nonsense.
*  Then what's the point?
*  Because there's times where everything's groovy.
*  People are buying like crazy.
*  Manufacturing is up, everything's up.
*  Everybody's happy, consumer satisfaction's up.
*  And people are buying like crazy
*  and there's so many industries that are happening
*  and there's so many jobs and unemployment's the lowest rate
*  it's ever been ever in the history of people.
*  And then all of a sudden it's not anymore.
*  Well, of course it's going to crash.
*  So it's going to crash.
*  This is the crash.
*  This is the big one.
*  This is the big one of our lifetime,
*  maybe the biggest one ever.
*  Because this shit could go on for a long ass time.
*  This is scary too because you think of all those people
*  just like who are paycheck to paycheck
*  with waiting tables or teaching a spin class
*  or whatever it is, that's where my brain goes.
*  It's like, how come,
*  there's gotta be a way to fucking help people.
*  Yeah, there does.
*  I mean, that's all I do all day is spend like,
*  the other day I hit at McDonald's,
*  I was like, say there's a way to buy a bunch of happy meals
*  I can send to a neighborhood.
*  You could do that with certain restaurants.
*  You could support restaurants.
*  One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas,
*  Guy Tanos is in Henderson.
*  And they used to be in Calabasas.
*  We used to go to them way back in the day.
*  But they're doing a lot of takeout
*  and then they're also raising money for their employers,
*  which is very nice.
*  And I think the store is doing something like that.
*  We're all going to donate for the wait staff,
*  because the wait staff is completely shit out of luck
*  and they were doing good business down there.
*  So those folks, I'm sure they have bills,
*  like serious fucking bills.
*  And it's just piling up and there's no business.
*  They went from having this great place where you can go
*  and you can count on X amount of money per week
*  to all of a sudden gone and no one saw it coming.
*  That's never happened, ever.
*  You can't blame them for not being prepared,
*  but they're part of our comedy family, man.
*  We gotta take care of them, particularly at the store.
*  We should set up something for the improv too.
*  We should also just figure out a way
*  to find out who's hurting, who's in trouble,
*  especially in our community.
*  Comics that we know that-
*  People are too proud.
*  I know, but we don't find them though,
*  because there's a lot of comics in our community
*  that they're going check to check too, middle acts.
*  Headliners.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of headliners, right?
*  Particularly first few year headliners
*  where you're only making X amount per week
*  you gotta pay your own flight and all that jazz.
*  You're getting by, but you're not killing it.
*  And then you probably have a fucking apartment
*  that costs two grand a month or more.
*  New York City, those guys,
*  the fucking apartments in New York City are ridiculous.
*  They're so expensive.
*  So think of all those comics in New York City
*  that relied on that system of going club to club
*  and picking up a little bit.
*  For people who don't know, a lot of comedians in New York,
*  there's like, New York's probably the most condensed
*  comedy club community in the country, wouldn't you agree?
*  By far.
*  Yeah, like how many clubs you think are in the city?
*  I'd say 12.
*  Yeah, total, legit.
*  Are you counting danger fields?
*  I was.
*  Never got to perform there.
*  I've always wanted to perform there.
*  It's great, it's fucking, Joey did it.
*  Joey was in New York.
*  Joey was in New York.
*  That was my spot when I lived in New York, man.
*  It's amazing how like a comic can think
*  in another comics level.
*  Cause as soon as you said that, my two clubs,
*  I thought of Stanton, New York and Dangerfields,
*  I'm counting those.
*  Yeah, he got to count those.
*  But Dangerfields is the weirdest one
*  because that was the one where they filmed
*  those HBO specials with Rodney Dangerfield.
*  Yeah.
*  And it was always empty.
*  It was always empty.
*  There was never anybody there, man, except prom season.
*  Prom season, you'd be doing stand up
*  to like 17 year old kids.
*  And it was madness.
*  It was madness.
*  Do you ever hear Bill Burr's story
*  about getting heckled at Dangerfields?
*  No.
*  It's my favorite.
*  I've made Bill tell this a number of times
*  and I've made him tell it on our podcast.
*  My favorite podcast story.
*  You remember Bill when he was younger, right?
*  He was a little more cleaner, a little more like chippier.
*  Hey guys, huh, huh?
*  What's up with those infomercials?
*  I got the pan, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang.
*  So Bill's doing his high energy happy act
*  and it's to a prom crowd and bunch of fucking
*  bridge and tunnel posse and it's not getting anything.
*  And this guy in the back goes,
*  anything red on stage is a faggot.
*  And Bill goes, I didn't have one pullout.
*  I just went, fuck.
*  God, man.
*  Yeah, that one you gotta be prepared for.
*  But yeah, I think about it.
*  The number one thing this whole thing has done
*  is made me think how much I waste shit.
*  I waste so much shit, just food, fruit.
*  Like fruit, bananas are going bad, just throw them out.
*  No, no, no, I've been eating them.
*  It's waste and health, man.
*  When I heard you tell that podcast,
*  I'm so glad to know that you were talking to me
*  because I heard it as if you were talking to me.
*  I told Brian Callan, I go, you ever do a podcast
*  and you think Joe's talking to you?
*  And he goes, all the fucking time.
*  I'm never talking to you, Brian Callan, never.
*  If I'm talking to Brian Callan, I'll call him up.
*  He said, no, he said, he goes,
*  one time Joe even said my name.
*  The one thing that made me feel vulnerable was,
*  and you've been saying this,
*  and I've always kind of written you off about it
*  going like, well, you know, whatever.
*  You gotta get off that blood pressure medicine.
*  The second I heard China's got all our medication,
*  I got one month of blood, I literally thought,
*  man, what am I doing on blood pressure medicine?
*  Why don't I just get in shape and get healthy
*  and get in control of my weight
*  so I'm not dependent on a pill to come in
*  and then if I don't have it, I have a stroke.
*  You can do it too, Bert.
*  It's not outside of the realm of possibility
*  when you consider how well you're doing
*  while you're boozing as hard as you are.
*  Yeah, I think-
*  And you probably, and you always like,
*  fire up for Sober October.
*  The first year I was worried, I was like,
*  man, I don't know how he's gonna do.
*  And some people were actually telling me,
*  like, hey man, he could die.
*  They're like, when guys drink a lot
*  and then they stop drinking, it's really bad.
*  And apparently that's what killed Amy Winehouse.
*  Everyone kept telling me that.
*  That's what killed Amy Winehouse, you know?
*  Did you know that, bro?
*  Oh, fuck.
*  It's one thing when you host a podcast
*  and you have a fucking thousand of them,
*  people wanna tell you shit that you haven't heard before.
*  So one of the things that people love to tell you
*  is about you could die.
*  If you stop drinking, you could die.
*  You told me that and you said to me,
*  when we were leaving, you were like,
*  you gave me a hug and you go, you don't have to do this, man.
*  And I went, what the fuck?
*  I was like, I was flipped out.
*  I was worried because I was like, damn it.
*  Imagine if this is how we kill Bert.
*  Imagine if trying to get Bert healthy,
*  like it turns out to kill him.
*  Amy Winehouse style.
*  Dude, I love Amy Winehouse.
*  Oh, she was amazing.
*  I will throw on an album and listen to like Rehab
*  or some of her great songs.
*  So she had a authenticity.
*  There's like a authenticity to her voice.
*  This unmistakable like looseness to her voice.
*  She was wild.
*  Her and Bjork.
*  I used to love Bjork.
*  Yeah, Bjork is great too, man.
*  Dude, she was.
*  In a totally different way.
*  Like I had to like pause.
*  Like it's a totally different kind of sound,
*  but yeah, but authentic.
*  Yeah.
*  It's so sexy, man.
*  Like Bjork was so hot and just doing her own thing,
*  like electronic music in this time
*  when it wasn't selling here,
*  but it was like, you ever hear that song,
*  It's Oh So Quiet by Bjork?
*  No.
*  It's oh so quiet.
*  It's amazing.
*  Did you ever see Bjork fuck up that for the airport?
*  Yes, yes, yes.
*  She got my respect there.
*  This person thought they could just get right in her face
*  with a camera just because she's famous.
*  Like with no permits.
*  This is not agreed upon.
*  You just show up where a person's just at the airport.
*  With her kid, Bjork is with her kid.
*  Yeah.
*  How do you deal with that?
*  I just, most of the time,
*  like if someone wants to be interviewing me
*  when I'm at the airport or somewhere where I'm not,
*  you know, I'm not expecting it.
*  It's just not smart.
*  So that's not, I do this, all right?
*  The way you have conversations should be,
*  your thoughts that are gonna get viewed by millions of people
*  shouldn't be something that you say
*  when you have your first cup of coffee
*  and maybe you're half on an edible coming off the flight
*  and you're picking up your luggage
*  and you didn't expect to run into TMZ.
*  And they're like,
*  what do you think about the coronavirus?
*  And you're like, stop eating bats, you fucks.
*  And you're like, you don't mean that.
*  You don't mean that.
*  That's not what you, but you're, you know,
*  you're there at fucking LAX at 730 in the morning
*  getting your bags.
*  If that's, that's the problem.
*  It's just, it's not smart.
*  And then there was a weird thing that happened
*  during the Roseanne times.
*  And Roseanne was gonna do the podcast for the first time,
*  for the second time rather.
*  And she had that crazy controversy
*  and they removed her from her show and the whole deal.
*  Dude, they were showing up at places where we weren't
*  with cameras.
*  They were showing up at the comedy store
*  with cameras trying to capture.
*  Like as if like, oh, you got me on camera.
*  I gotta talk to you, I guess.
*  What the news is, if you watch like local news,
*  it's a bunch of people pointing cameras at stuff
*  and then loosely applying journalistic ethics
*  to see like what they talk about and what they don't
*  and what they feed you over the next half hour.
*  And they wanna be number one in the ratings
*  because you know, like channel sevens right now
*  is kicking our ass.
*  And I just really feel like we gotta get on the scene
*  quicker.
*  And it becomes a sport.
*  This is not necessarily the information.
*  There's personalities and jobs are at risk
*  and there's so many factors that are contributing
*  and like in moving what you listen to and see
*  in a certain direction.
*  It's not the news.
*  It's a news program.
*  It's their interpretation of what they think
*  is the most important stuff to focus on
*  over the next X amount of minutes.
*  Because life is too fucking nuts.
*  We have access to the whole world.
*  You gonna break the whole world down in 60 minutes?
*  It's an editing show, right?
*  Because you can't show everything.
*  There's millions of things that are fascinating
*  that are going on right now.
*  Positive and negative.
*  So they have balanced it out, you know?
*  What are they gonna do?
*  A Calabasas woman found out the hard way.
*  You can't, woo hoo hoo hoo hoo.
*  And they'll show a puppy peeing on her.
*  Oh, that was great.
*  That was great.
*  Now let's get back to murder and death and fucking thievery.
*  I said to someone, I said,
*  do you think that this coronavirus coverage
*  is based on the news, like saying,
*  we're taking back the news?
*  And someone was like, no, man,
*  they've been getting their asses handed to them
*  for so long by Trump,
*  this is where they're making their money back.
*  And then you wonder, like, I like Chris Cuomo.
*  I like him.
*  I actually like him.
*  I watch him and I go-
*  Did you get upset when he got mad at that guy
*  about the Fredo thing?
*  I got upset for him.
*  I go, wish I was there.
*  I go, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude,
*  don't say that, don't say that.
*  Don't say that.
*  It's not like the N word.
*  Don't say that, don't say that.
*  I understand this guy's a dick
*  and you're letting him know he can't be a dick to you,
*  but let's relax.
*  It was such. It was such.
*  It's provoked though.
*  And he was trying to get out of it.
*  Like he got, you know what it's like?
*  It's like doing jujitsu and you make a terrible mistake
*  and all of a sudden you're trapped in someone's triangle.
*  You just gotta tap out.
*  You gotta tap out and you gotta live to fight another day.
*  You got caught.
*  Don't get your neck fucked up.
*  You know, those guys hurt you.
*  And when he was trying to like save ego
*  when the guy called him Fredo.
*  First of all, the guy that called him Fredo is a cunt
*  because there's such a shit move to do.
*  Like just as a passerby, they did it to fucking,
*  they did it to George Lopez out of Hooters one time.
*  Like some guy.
*  George Lopez?
*  Who did it to George Lopez?
*  Someone did it to George.
*  I think it was George Lopez said something like
*  build a wall or something and George,
*  and they videotape it.
*  They want, they want to go viral.
*  That's what they want.
*  So they call him Fredo
*  and they're videotaping it.
*  They're looking for reactions so they can get views.
*  That's a cunt move.
*  But Fredo made me giggle.
*  It's such a funny fucking.
*  It's such a silly thing to say.
*  But to say that that's like the N word to African Americans.
*  Dude, nobody owned Fredo.
*  Stop.
*  It was so, he almost made it more enjoyable.
*  I was watching that.
*  He did make it more enjoyable.
*  It was so ridiculous.
*  If you watch Godfather 2,
*  you wouldn't be able to think of anything but Quist Chromo.
*  When you're watching that scene, you would think of him.
*  I think, I call him Fredo
*  when he comes on the TV.
*  I go, hell, I love Fredo.
*  I love him though.
*  I love him.
*  Like I say it like with a, with a, with a A, Fredo.
*  And his brother is the governor of New York.
*  They look strikingly alike.
*  Well, they look like brothers.
*  Because they are.
*  I saw him on TV today.
*  I mean, I'm very impressed with how his brother
*  is responding to this though.
*  With the, I, you know, I understand that
*  there was a certain point in time where he wasn't sure
*  whether or not they could really shut down New York.
*  But you know, now the way he's responding to it,
*  the way he carries himself, he's very, he's very,
*  like he's a no-nonsense person.
*  Like the way he carries himself.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I like, and I don't know if,
*  I don't know anything about his politics.
*  I don't know anything about what he does.
*  But you can sort of at least gather
*  from the way someone handles a crisis.
*  Like how they, how they carry themselves.
*  You gather whether or not you can trust them
*  if shit gets crazy.
*  And he seems to carry himself very well.
*  It's like, that's very important
*  for just the morale of the nation in a weird way.
*  That's why a leader is very important
*  because when someone's a real leader,
*  and even though there's gonna be people that hate them,
*  people that are pissed at everything they do,
*  and that's always gonna be the case
*  if you're the leader of the free world, right?
*  But if they can somehow or another
*  shift the way we feel about ourselves,
*  shift the way we feel about our community,
*  like give you a, there's like pep speeches
*  and a really good presidential address,
*  a really good one just gets into that feel good spot
*  and brings everybody together,
*  and it really has a tangible effect on reality.
*  It can really affect reality.
*  And that's what people don't understand about
*  why people get upset about people
*  not being able to talk well.
*  It's a big fucking deal.
*  You know, like people like,
*  why are you joking on Joe Biden?
*  Because it's a big deal.
*  He's in the biggest fucking sweepstakes on earth.
*  Who gets to control all the thermonuclear weapons
*  and the entire economy and everything that gets done
*  inside the United States of America, one guy, ready, go.
*  Like what?
*  You gotta be able to talk really well if you want that job.
*  These, part of the job is inspiring people.
*  It's one of the things Obama did better than any of them.
*  You know, like you could say what you want about Clinton.
*  He had some good speeches too.
*  I think Obama was even better
*  because he was just measured and intelligent
*  and articulate and strong.
*  There was something about the way he was talking
*  that was confidence inspiring.
*  Whether or not he was right or not,
*  whether or not he made bad decisions,
*  I don't think anybody can do that fucking job.
*  I don't, I think it's a death sentence.
*  I think it is for all of them.
*  I think they get in there and there's a tornado
*  of things that they have to control,
*  things they have to pay attention to,
*  things they're responsible for.
*  Hundreds of different fucking pieces of motion
*  all over the world.
*  All these pieces in motion, all these pieces.
*  And you're supposed to be the one guy
*  that makes the right decisions on all of those
*  and chooses the right people for both pandemics
*  and the economy.
*  How about just one?
*  Do you even understand one?
*  Yeah.
*  And then international relations on top of that?
*  Holy fuck.
*  And then you gotta go to North Korea.
*  Now we're in China.
*  It's too many things to juggle.
*  Bro, it's madness.
*  That's why Reagan, you know, I wonder,
*  I wonder if it's where we're going back is to a Reagan,
*  like, did you see Matthew McConaughey's speech?
*  No, I did not.
*  Is it good?
*  Yeah.
*  Matthew McConaughey, right?
*  Like we all bought into him in the mid-90s.
*  Like this is our dream hunk.
*  He's one of our dream hunks for sure.
*  God, man.
*  He just sits there and he's just with that Texas draw
*  about red lights and green lights.
*  It's a yellow light.
*  Right now we're going,
*  and it just, I get out and I get like,
*  I got sat up in bed and I was like,
*  I'm gonna go fucking work out, man.
*  Like, this isn't, we can do this.
*  Well, I think for the people like you and I
*  who you're gonna be okay financially,
*  it's not as scary.
*  It's a different thing.
*  But for the people where financially
*  it's gonna affect them greatly,
*  there has to be like real big decisions made
*  to help those people.
*  Cause this is not,
*  it's not a situation of people not wanting to work.
*  It's a situation of people not being able to work
*  because of an invisible enemy that kills your loved ones.
*  Like if there's ever a time
*  where the United States has to come together,
*  this is the time.
*  And I think,
*  I think we're capable of doing that.
*  And I think if we do the right thing
*  and we come out on the other side,
*  I think we're gonna be stronger.
*  I think we're gonna be stronger in not in the,
*  not dismissing the losses
*  and the people that are gonna badly miss loved ones.
*  I'm not even trying to diminish that.
*  I'm just trying to say for the people that will survive,
*  we're gonna understand what it's like
*  to go through a real adversity together
*  for the first time in a long time as a planet,
*  not just as the United States,
*  not as Germany, not as Japan, not as Iraq.
*  No, the whole thing together,
*  cause it's everywhere.
*  And the whole thing together
*  is a giant problem for everybody that survives.
*  And for everybody that survives,
*  no matter how bad it gets or how good it gets,
*  or whether it morphs and changes
*  or whether it doesn't, the people that survive,
*  we have to learn from this.
*  We gotta learn.
*  We gotta learn in every way.
*  And we gotta learn how, and I'm learning.
*  I'm learning right now, my own personal self,
*  like how I'm shifting how I view the world.
*  Like that everything has to go back to me
*  being able to do shows whenever I want
*  and to stand up whenever I want
*  and travel wherever I wanna go
*  and not worry about killer,
*  everything has to go back to that
*  cause that's what I'm used to.
*  Well, no, like just, you know history.
*  You know how the world works.
*  There's countless examples of civilizations
*  that no longer exist.
*  They got wiped out by plague or natural disasters.
*  We are well aware of this,
*  but yet none of it ever registers.
*  And we never think it applies to us.
*  We never think that this is it.
*  This is the one.
*  This is the one we gotta really pay attention to.
*  No, fucking, you see them kicking all the people
*  off the beach?
*  You see, the Malibu, Santa Monica,
*  they're like, we're closing the beach, you fucks!
*  This isn't vacation!
*  People are down there just sun tanning and hanging out.
*  My girls wanted to go for a hike yesterday
*  and I went, think of all the morons that are out hiking.
*  The thing is that this required us to act fast
*  and I think the human race is giant
*  and it's so huge.
*  The number's so spectacular.
*  To get all of us to coordinate together,
*  I think it's like an impossibly long battleship.
*  Think of a battleship that's like 100 times bigger
*  than a regular battleship.
*  Just a battleship, you think.
*  How fast that thing turned?
*  It's gotta be so slow!
*  I never thought about that.
*  It's fucking huge!
*  It's not like one of them speed boats
*  where you can just, bam, bam!
*  If you're on a battleship, that motherfucker's hard to turn
*  and I think the human race is like,
*  it's an impossible to imagine battleship.
*  It's like a battleship 100,000 times bigger
*  than any other battleship.
*  It's so big, it takes up like one tenth of the ocean.
*  That's how big this battle is.
*  And when that motherfucker has to turn, it's like,
*  bam!
*  Bam!
*  It can barely turn, bam!
*  That's us.
*  And I think this thing required us to turn.
*  We ran into like an iceberg.
*  There's a giant thing ahead of us.
*  Something hit us.
*  This change in a virus that jumped to human beings
*  and we have no immunity for it.
*  And that's what it's like.
*  It's like our battleship does not turn quick enough for this
*  and we didn't have the proper preparation
*  for something like this.
*  Because we didn't see it, even though we knew it was possible,
*  we didn't see it happening to us.
*  We made some preparations, but I don't know,
*  did we ever figure out whether or not the government
*  actually did stop this pandemic office
*  and close down this pandemic office?
*  Is that true?
*  Remember we were trying to look at that the other day?
*  Digging through that was not fun.
*  Something was changed.
*  I don't know about closing the thing.
*  It's an interpretation sort of discussion that like,
*  I don't know.
*  I was trying to dig into like PolitiFact
*  and all sorts of websites that like,
*  it took too long to find a good answer
*  that was worth sharing.
*  So like, I don't, I haven't gone with like, I don't know.
*  What did you think though?
*  What did you think when you read it?
*  Like, what were they specifically saying?
*  Definitely there's different people in place.
*  And what I had, one of the things I read along the path
*  was that there was like a meeting about possible pandemics
*  with a team of people in an office.
*  Those people are no longer there though.
*  There might be people that have replaced them
*  because of how many people have changed over
*  in the administration.
*  So the people that are in those places now
*  weren't at the meeting, so they don't,
*  they never got those like notes basically.
*  Yeah, phew.
*  But I don't know if that's what happened.
*  But that's the same stuff that happened in 9-11.
*  They're like, these were all warned.
*  Like, it's interesting to see hindsight really in action
*  where you're like, I have this comedian,
*  this very hilarious comedian who doesn't do comedy anymore,
*  a woman named Andy Smith.
*  In fucking early February, she sent me a text
*  that I figured she had postpartum depression.
*  I was like, oh, she's lost her mind, that's too bad.
*  She was really funny, she had a kid,
*  her must be going through a divorce.
*  And it was, hey, I've been translating
*  these Chinese documents, this flu is gonna get
*  a lot worse than anyone thinks.
*  We need to stay home, you need to start spreading the word,
*  you have a podcast.
*  Like, I mean.
*  Whoa, so you thought, isn't that funny?
*  I thought she was fucking crazy.
*  How long ago was that, how many weeks ago was that?
*  I'll pull it up right now.
*  She just texted me last night.
*  This was February 15th.
*  She wrote, hey, I don't have glasses.
*  Hey, it's me again, I've been Googling,
*  translating the shit out of this virus situation for weeks.
*  And stop traveling, tell everyone to stop right now.
*  I know, I know, I come off,
*  I can't fucking read, I don't have glasses.
*  Here, look at these bad boys.
*  Here, yeah.
*  Try it, see how blind I am.
*  Oh wow, we're the same.
*  But come the fuck off, are we really gonna stay until they,
*  wait until they tell us to stay off the streets?
*  That's where we are today.
*  That would be too late, right?
*  Honestly, everyone should just call in sick Tuesday.
*  What are they gonna do?
*  Suit up, fellas, come on over and see if I'm lying.
*  It's genius, really.
*  It's probably the most American-y protest thing ever,
*  just lazy paid refusal.
*  And probably our last chance to legally shift power
*  back to the people who will forcibly be dragging us back
*  in SUVs.
*  Maybe you're already in a safe hillside bunker, I hope so.
*  I'm sorry for the downer rant.
*  I'm sending this to all the smart people I know,
*  four of you.
*  Because all my dumb whore friends have no grasp
*  on strategy or intuition, fuck.
*  Stay home, learn to knit, learn how to knit a face mask.
*  I wish we could all stay home and jump the gun,
*  save ourselves.
*  And then I wrote on fucking the day my special dropped,
*  on fucking March, a month later, I wrote,
*  oh shit, you were right.
*  And then I wrote,
*  and then she texted me a bunch of medications to get
*  and I bought them all.
*  Wow.
*  She's a dude, and by the way, not to discount her,
*  she was a fucking tits hilarious comedian.
*  Why'd you stop doing stand-up?
*  She had a baby.
*  She got into major beef with Schumer and Nikki Glaser,
*  like legit fucking, this chick was a little,
*  she was rough, man, she was rough.
*  Cat fight?
*  But hardcore.
*  Oh, and last comic standing, call it Adam Hunter a cunt.
*  Just fucking burn it to the ground.
*  Why'd she call Adam Hunter a cunt?
*  Because she just, that's who she is.
*  She's a fucking, man.
*  He's a nice guy.
*  He's a great guy, he's a great guy.
*  And him and her got onto it on screen.
*  Oh no.
*  Yeah, but she's wild, man.
*  She stole Jim Jeffery's sunglasses,
*  like fucking real fucking wild chick.
*  But she sent that to me, like that much.
*  A month ago.
*  And I just was like, oh, postpartum, she's crazy, poor girl.
*  They're saying the senators,
*  these closed door meetings that they had,
*  this closed door meeting, that was in January.
*  There's a guy named Respectable Lawyer
*  that I follow on Twitter.
*  He's the one who sent it to me.
*  And he had a series of tweets about it,
*  documenting it, laying it out.
*  And you read it and you go, oh my God.
*  It's like, did they really know or,
*  it's, again, it goes back to that thing.
*  Like, what are you supposed to do?
*  Like, are you allowed to just start talking about
*  that this is coming?
*  Like, if you're a senator and you find out about something,
*  like what are your responsibilities?
*  Do they give you a mandate
*  on what you're allowed to talk about
*  or not allowed to talk about?
*  Like, if they sit you down and have some crazy meeting
*  where they tell you the sky's falling,
*  what are you allowed to say?
*  Do they tell you when you're allowed to say it?
*  Like, how does that work?
*  Black Twitter says that this was a distraction
*  because there was a comet hitting us.
*  Oh Jesus.
*  Yeah, our bus driver's black and he was like,
*  you know what this means?
*  Life suck right before the fucking big one hits.
*  How cunty.
*  Well, my, you know what, now that I'm thinking about it,
*  it might not have been Peter Atiyah that said that,
*  I don't want to attribute this to him,
*  just in case I'm wrong,
*  said that people that are around it more often
*  seem to get sicker.
*  It might have been, I don't want to look right now,
*  but let's just take that away from him.
*  But if that is the case,
*  it's so different than anything else.
*  It's weird.
*  What's weird to me is how some people,
*  apparently nothing happens,
*  and other people just get wrecked.
*  Like, we're talking about the same thing.
*  Like, what is this thing?
*  I had H1N1.
*  Did you really?
*  Yeah, I just figured it out a couple days ago.
*  It was the sickest I've ever been in my fucking life.
*  And I was like, and I mean, I mark it down as like,
*  I thought I was gonna die.
*  Was that over, did H1N1 happen a lot in America
*  or was it mostly overseas?
*  I was talking to Drew on my podcast.
*  It happened around 2009 in December,
*  November, December is when we had an outbreak.
*  In America. In America.
*  My cousin had it.
*  Dr. Drew was telling me about his experience
*  and I was like, that's so fucking crazy.
*  And I told him like, oh, the sickest I've ever been
*  and I recounted it.
*  Then I go through my Instagram or my Facebook photos
*  and I look, that's December 2009.
*  And I go, dude, I got H1N1.
*  It was, I'm telling you when I say,
*  I've never felt like that when you don't get,
*  you're kind of breathing,
*  but you're not getting oxygen to your lungs.
*  And my wife didn't get it.
*  My wife didn't get it.
*  My kids didn't get it.
*  My mom didn't get it.
*  I was with all of them and then my wife and I got on a plane
*  and I drank and that is what fucked me up.
*  I drank and I got into Mexico and I was,
*  I mean, without a doubt, the sickest I've ever been.
*  The sickest.
*  I mean, gasping for breath, could not be comfortable,
*  throwing up, chills.
*  It was the worst chest infection.
*  I mean, I thought it was,
*  I've always written it off to walking pneumonia.
*  And then we were talking about it
*  and I was like, December 2009?
*  That's exactly when I fucking got it.
*  Wow.
*  That one had a really high fatalization rate.
*  Within 40 to 50 year olds.
*  So what's crazy about-
*  Is that a word, fatalization?
*  I might've made up a word.
*  Sounds right.
*  Fatality rate is what I should've said,
*  but I said fatalization.
*  But I was thinking, does that,
*  you can't even say it that way.
*  It's funny how saying something wrong the wrong way
*  just immediately makes you a fucking moron.
*  You can say the most interesting and complicated shit ever,
*  but then you said, and then the fatalization of it all.
*  Like, what?
*  What the fuck did you just say?
*  Fatalization?
*  Bitch, you fraud.
*  It's like when you use,
*  do you ever use a saying wrong?
*  I pitched a movie in Hollywood
*  and I used salt of the earth as if they were dirty people.
*  Oh, that's hilarious.
*  These are the real salts of the earth.
*  You know the people you wanna stay away from.
*  Oh no, isn't it funny,
*  but this is how easy it is for us.
*  We can't understand that wars were fought over salt.
*  They literally fought for wars.
*  They fought wars.
*  They killed people.
*  Over salt?
*  Yeah, for salt.
*  Salt was so important.
*  Salt was everything
*  because salt allowed you to preserve food.
*  You could take fish and meat
*  and all these different things.
*  You can cover them in salt
*  and the salt prevents growth of bacteria.
*  So you can keep things even at room temperature far longer
*  covered in salt than you can
*  if they're exposed to the air.
*  For real?
*  100%.
*  Yeah, so the salt of the earth
*  was like an incredibly valuable thing.
*  Oh wow, I really used that wrong.
*  But isn't that weird?
*  You know, the people in the subway.
*  Think of, that wasn't that long ago, man.
*  People were having fucking wars over salt.
*  This whole situation has forced you to think
*  much more globally and transledentially.
*  Transledentially, you did it.
*  You just tried one out.
*  But like down the,
*  transledentially.
*  I don't even know if those two words go together ever.
*  But like, you look at like the-
*  You look like a double verb.
*  You look at the,
*  my daughters were watching some movie
*  about the Great Depression yesterday
*  and I was like, oh, that seems kind of real.
*  Yeah, now it does.
*  Before it seemed like shit, that'll never happen to us
*  because it would have never happened to us economically.
*  As fucked up as the economy is,
*  like it dips and then it comes back
*  because the same amount of people
*  need the same amount of shit, right?
*  So we gotta make stuff and it just, it comes back.
*  Same amount of people are willing to work.
*  Same amount of people are healthy.
*  Same amount of physical resources required
*  to make that shit.
*  Okay, let's figure it out how to make the shit again.
*  And then people make the shit and they sell the shit
*  and things keep moving.
*  This is different.
*  This is more disturbing than anything we've ever seen
*  because it's something that nobody suspected.
*  Out of all the consequences of a global pandemic,
*  nobody ever thought, oh no,
*  the whole world would have to stay home
*  and no one would ever work.
*  No one thought that.
*  Never in a million.
*  No one thought that.
*  No one thought that.
*  No one wrote a script about that.
*  But then some people have to work, right?
*  Like supermarket people and healthcare people
*  and firemen and all these other people that have to work.
*  You're like, okay, so we're just kind of like,
*  kind of putting a bandaid on it,
*  but it's all gonna keep getting out, right?
*  It's gonna keep getting out if they get it.
*  If they get it and they're in contact with people
*  all the time, they're gonna be the bridge
*  between people and the disease
*  because not everybody can just stay home.
*  It's almost like we'd have to go door to door
*  with people with fucking hazmat suits on,
*  delivering food, staying in your house.
*  Everyone has to stay in their house for two weeks.
*  It's gonna get to a point where if it keeps coming back,
*  do they keep instituting stiffer and stiffer measures?
*  It's just started, right?
*  And already we can't have public gatherings
*  with more than 10 people.
*  Can't go to a restaurant.
*  You can't do a standup show.
*  You can't go to the movies.
*  So all those things are done.
*  Gyms are closed.
*  All these things are closed.
*  This has never happened before.
*  And everybody just stays home.
*  Well, what if that doesn't work?
*  What if they keep ramping it up?
*  What if like five months later they realize,
*  well, what we've done is instead of like
*  letting this disease blow through everybody,
*  it's gonna blow through quickly.
*  Now it's like slowly trickled into everybody
*  it's gonna affect.
*  Still affects the same amount of people.
*  Still infects the same amount of people.
*  That mean they don't know whether or not
*  that could possibly happen.
*  They're hoping that it wouldn't,
*  but it could flare up again.
*  That's another piece of concern.
*  They're worried it could flare up again.
*  That's one of the things that's crazy is the uncertainty.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  That's the number one thing.
*  Because we all wanna pretend that all this shit makes sense.
*  Even though we're temporary life forms.
*  Oh, don't get me fucking started.
*  Even though, even though the star that powers
*  the solar system itself has a finite lifespan
*  and things have changed so much,
*  even though all those things exist,
*  we still wanna pretend that the world's gonna be
*  the way it is right now forever.
*  I think this is not good for us
*  in that people are gonna die and people are gonna get sick.
*  But it might be the survivors of it
*  might experience a shift in the understanding
*  of what it is to be alive, what it is to be a person,
*  what this life is.
*  It's not about fame or money or getting your point
*  to be the one that gets accepted by everybody
*  or arguing with the left or arguing with the right.
*  It's not that.
*  It's life is people hanging out with each other
*  and staying alive.
*  That's what it is.
*  If you interacted with people,
*  like we were out putting a fence up in our front yard,
*  some people walked down the street, it's kinda cool.
*  They're waving to each other, yeah.
*  People are saying hi, people are appreciating each other
*  a little bit more, people are scared.
*  Guy said to me the other day, he goes,
*  hey man, how you doing?
*  I said good, and he goes, how you guys holding up?
*  I didn't even know the guy.
*  I said good, how about you guys?
*  Really cool.
*  I went to, I had like a fucking insane toothache
*  in the middle of the night the other night, right?
*  I had to go to Rite Aid.
*  And it was open.
*  And I was so grateful.
*  You know, you take it for granted.
*  I was going to Rite Aid and I start driving there
*  and I go, they're probably not open.
*  Like, we're in shutdown.
*  I pull up and they're open.
*  Poor young lady sitting there with gloves on and a mask.
*  I buy some ambisol and I go,
*  I was like, I never said this.
*  I go, hey, thank you.
*  Like, thank you for being awake in the middle of a pandemic
*  and working here so that, just a toothache,
*  like a fucking toothache.
*  People risking their health.
*  I hope that we still feel this when things start to clear up
*  and I'm man, I'm optimistic.
*  I really do think we're gonna fucking flatten this curve
*  and things are gonna go back to normal
*  and everyone's gonna be safe.
*  But I hope that people are still that way.
*  I hope it weighs with young kids.
*  It weighs with me because I'm a little older
*  and I feel like I'm allowing myself to change
*  in a grateful way of like seeing things
*  and noticing things that maybe I didn't notice
*  because I lived in Florida, I lived in different places.
*  I hope it happens with kids.
*  I hope kids, my kids, put their phones down
*  and wanna interact and wanna, you know,
*  and be like, I had a month on my fucking,
*  two months on my phone, I'm out.
*  I wanna go ride a bike or something, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, there's levels that this can drop.
*  This is one level.
*  One level is stay at home.
*  You know, another level that this could drop
*  is if the grid goes down.
*  You know, there's things that we rely on
*  that we don't even think twice about
*  hitting that light switch and knowing that all that juice
*  would be powering all these lights
*  and that my refrigerator's gonna stay on
*  and that I'm gonna keep being able
*  to charge my Tesla every night.
*  You assume all that, but there's no guarantee.
*  There's no guarantee that this fragile system
*  is gonna stay in place,
*  particularly if something bad happens like a solar flare.
*  Like one solar flare could wipe out our whole grid.
*  One big one could wipe out, you know,
*  I mean, one asteroid impact,
*  one crazy super volcano eruption,
*  wipe out everything, all of it.
*  And then those things are real.
*  They happen all the time.
*  They're 100% real.
*  They're 100% real and we've documented the history of them
*  in the planet Earth.
*  Fucking thousands of them.
*  They're always happening.
*  We just don't live that long, man.
*  We don't live that long.
*  We forgot that all this shit happened
*  and we thought that because, you know,
*  from my life from 67 to 2002,
*  there was nothing like this.
*  The things like this don't happen.
*  It's amazing how many people have called me about guns
*  because I do a bit about guns in this new special
*  and everyone's like, hey man, get me your gun guy.
*  This is a good place to move, time to move to Texas.
*  Get yourself a ranch.
*  Thank God we trained with what's his name.
*  Yeah, Tarrant Tactical.
*  Tarrant Tactical, man.
*  I know how to use my gun.
*  I feel very confident with my gun.
*  Yeah, it certainly helps to get some training in.
*  That's gonna be a big issue with people
*  shooting people accidentally.
*  With people that don't have good firearm safety
*  and they haven't been instructed correctly
*  and they just go out and shoot guns.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I don't know what the rules are today
*  in terms of being able to buy a gun,
*  but when I first bought a gun, there was no rules.
*  You just, if you weren't a criminal,
*  you could just get a gun.
*  When was this?
*  When I first came here, 94.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah.
*  The rules now are it's a 12 day waiting period
*  and you have to take a test.
*  Test is pretty easy.
*  You take a test, you buy the gun,
*  and then you have to wait 10 days.
*  You definitely had a waiting period.
*  Don't get me wrong back then,
*  but what I'm saying is there was no instruction.
*  Oh no, there was no instruction.
*  Yeah, that's what I mean.
*  There was no, you didn't have to show your proficiency
*  or you didn't have to definitely show
*  that you know where the safety is
*  and you know how to remove a magazine.
*  You didn't have to show anything.
*  He gave me some play bullets, like they're red.
*  He was like, mess around with those.
*  Get comfortable with your gun.
*  And they didn't work.
*  So I never figured out, I just literally had a gun.
*  I didn't even load it.
*  I was like, I have a gun, I don't know what to do with it.
*  And then Taron taught me everything.
*  And so that's the only reason I know
*  how to do anything with my gun.
*  But I bought two guns.
*  Didn't know how to fucking, I had a bullet.
*  This is a joke in my special, but it's true.
*  I put a bullet in the shotgun
*  and I thought I got the one that goes,
*  but I didn't and I didn't know how to get out.
*  I was like, I called my buddy Cowhead.
*  I go, how do I get a bullet out of a gun?
*  He was like, this is Cowhead live in Florida?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That's why I called him.
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, Cowhead's talk to the gills.
*  I would call Anthony Kumia first and foremost.
*  Are you having another one?
*  Yeah.
*  Okay, yeah, I'll take one.
*  One more.
*  One more.
*  We're not getting crazy.
*  We're having two drinks, like gentlemen,
*  over a short period of time.
*  Yeah.
*  What is it?
*  An hour and 36 minutes into the podcast.
*  Perfect.
*  We halfway spaced it.
*  Yeah, it's perfect.
*  I feel perfect right now.
*  Yeah, no worries.
*  I don't wanna send you off the wagon.
*  You're not, man.
*  I had a little weird epiphany about like,
*  I wanna be with my kids right now, you know?
*  Like hang with them.
*  Of course.
*  But that's what I'm hoping is good
*  that's gonna come out of this, right?
*  For all of us.
*  I hope so, man.
*  Cheers, Joe.
*  Thank you for doing this, man.
*  My pleasure.
*  I know how fucking swamped you are.
*  I love it.
*  I love you, man.
*  That's a good whiskey.
*  That Buffalo Trace?
*  I just love the fact that this company started out
*  during the pioneer days.
*  This is a company from the 1700s.
*  That's ridiculous.
*  Jesus.
*  From the 1700s, one company.
*  That's gotta be one of the oldest companies in the country.
*  Like what's the oldest company?
*  How is, I mean, I think that shit was around
*  like right when the United States was being formed.
*  We got Levi's or, no, that Levi's was the 1840s, right?
*  I don't know.
*  They were canvas, right?
*  They used to make them out of canvas.
*  They made them out of old tents.
*  Well, I think, yeah.
*  I think the canvas that they had back then
*  was probably made out of cannabis too.
*  It was probably hemp.
*  That's why I was so durable.
*  That's what they used for clothes forever.
*  Apparently, I've had a hemp shirt was kind of whack.
*  I always felt like a hippie when I was wearing it.
*  But.
*  But I have a.
*  Sliding doors.
*  Sliding doors, I like to see that transition in Joe.
*  Where you smoke weed but don't love jujitsu
*  and you get into like an oxygen bar.
*  And.
*  Ha ha ha.
*  I had a, I still have a hemp gi from Datsusara.
*  It's fucking great.
*  Yeah, hemp is, it's a weird fabric.
*  It's really, really durable.
*  Like it's, my hemp gi's never ripped.
*  Really?
*  No, man, the stitching might go eventually.
*  But man, cotton gis, after a few years,
*  they give out.
*  All these dudes trying to kill you.
*  They're yanking on you and shit.
*  They rip at the armpits.
*  They get bleached a bunch of times.
*  They get a little weaker.
*  They start ripping.
*  That hemp motherfucker, that thing doesn't rip at all.
*  It's an alien planet.
*  Hey, what's the name of that?
*  Alien plant, rather.
*  What's the name of that?
*  Dude, you had the best fucking, this is nine years ago.
*  You talked about a guy who did a kettlebell workout.
*  And I had it on my computer and I haven't.
*  Keith Weber?
*  It was like a fucking 20 minute.
*  Extreme kettlebell cardio workout?
*  Oh my God, it's incredible, right?
*  It was like heart attack.
*  Oh yeah, yeah.
*  And you could do it with a 35 pound kettlebell.
*  You hold onto a 35 pound kettlebell,
*  you're like, this thing ain't doing shit to me.
*  Dude.
*  35 pound son.
*  I'll throw that around.
*  10 minutes in, I'm ready to die.
*  That's the one, I've been looking for that.
*  Weight lifting's my thing right now.
*  Like I wanna put mass on
*  because I don't want my bones to fall apart.
*  So all I do is run in spin class, that's it.
*  I wanna do, I wanna put weight on, I wanna lift weights.
*  That's a good move.
*  I like the way you're saying it too,
*  you don't want your bones to fall apart.
*  People need to take that,
*  if there was a supplement that you could take
*  that would actually increase your bone density,
*  do you know how popular that supplement would be?
*  That supplement would be so popular.
*  Everybody would wanna take something
*  that actually increases your bone density
*  and makes you less vulnerable
*  to breaking your leg if you fall down.
*  That's when the shit goes sideways
*  is when you're 65 and you break a hip,
*  you break your femur.
*  That's a game changer of broken bone at that age.
*  You wanna maintain muscle mass
*  and the best way to do that is by picking up heavy things.
*  During this isolation period though,
*  one of the things that you can do,
*  especially because we're assuming this is only gonna last
*  like a month or two, we're hoping,
*  one of the things you can do
*  is you could do a lot of fucking calisthenics.
*  You can do significant numbers of pushups
*  and body weight squats.
*  If you have a chin up bar,
*  just a chin up bar that you fit inside a doorway is perfect.
*  Just get one of those.
*  Get one off of Amazon.
*  Get the kind that you screw into the wall
*  so it can't fall off on you.
*  You don't wanna die.
*  Especially if you get silly
*  and you try to do flips back and forth
*  and you fall on your face.
*  There's no hospitals, okay?
*  Things open, you asshole.
*  But if you just get a regular chin up bar,
*  just a chin up bar, pushups, sit ups,
*  doing a bunch of different body weight exercises,
*  like pistols and one legged squats
*  and different yoga routines,
*  you could get shredded, shredded.
*  You know the Herschel Walker story?
*  That he actually got jacked from doing pushups
*  and sit ups and stuff in between commercials
*  of shows you would watch?
*  No.
*  Yes.
*  Dude, that's my brain.
*  That's my brain.
*  I love nothing more than a punishment challenge,
*  like a punitive.
*  Yes, yeah.
*  When we were doing that on the road,
*  cause Marky Mark and Dr. Os did their pushups,
*  I made a joke video going,
*  those are bullshit pushups.
*  They were bullshit pushups.
*  Dude, I did fucking 60 of them.
*  But why did they do that?
*  Marky Mark is a stud.
*  He can do a real.
*  Marky Mark's pushups were better than Dr. Os's.
*  Do you think he gets mad if we call him Marky Mark?
*  Definitely.
*  I got nothing but respect for him.
*  I got nothing but respect for him.
*  I love that guy.
*  He's a great actor.
*  He's on a campaign right now.
*  He's nothing but in my news feed.
*  About what?
*  About just, I don't know, like a PR campaign.
*  I don't know what he's doing.
*  It's probably all about him promoting a movie
*  or something like that.
*  Spencer for hires on Netflix.
*  Very fucking inspirational guy.
*  Look how fit he is.
*  Boogie Nights is one of the best nights fucking ever.
*  One of the best movies ever.
*  He's got a lot of great movies.
*  He legitimately has a lot of great movies.
*  But as a human being,
*  when you look at his dedication to fitness,
*  he's not bullshitting.
*  He really is up at five o'clock in the morning
*  working out like a beast every day.
*  He's the real deal.
*  He is, I think if you had pivoted and just on acting,
*  I think you guys have probably similar personalities.
*  Very dedicated.
*  I've never met him.
*  I don't know about that.
*  For real?
*  Yeah, I never met him.
*  He was at a UFC once, but I was doing commentary
*  and sometimes when celebrities are there,
*  I look over and try to catch their eye, say hi.
*  I got a hug from Jeremy Renner.
*  I was very excited.
*  Really?
*  I never met him.
*  He came over and gave me a big hug.
*  I was like, dude.
*  He seems like a really cool guy.
*  He's really cool.
*  He's really cool.
*  But yeah, Mark Wahlberg's push-ups look legit.
*  Like kind of legit.
*  Look, he's a legit stud if you look at his workouts.
*  I mean, that guy goes after it.
*  You don't get built like that.
*  I don't care what you're taking.
*  You don't get built like that unless you work hard.
*  There's no magic pill.
*  That's all hard work.
*  Whenever someone says, oh yeah, they're on testosterone
*  replacement, that's wonderful.
*  I'm sure that helps.
*  It definitely helps.
*  But you don't get built like that
*  unless you're working out hard.
*  Dr. Oz's push-ups are bullshit.
*  Now Mark's looks like tri-set push-ups.
*  It's a little bullshit.
*  It's a little bullshit.
*  First of all, the right way to do a push-up,
*  I'm not being a stickler,
*  but legitimately for your own body,
*  Dr. Oz is actually doing it better
*  in that he has his elbows closer to his body.
*  Follow me here.
*  Like your hands in front of you and this.
*  And this is a good motion for your shoulders.
*  A lot of people think that this is not a good motion,
*  that this elbow out, it's a different thing.
*  And maybe it might be better to do it
*  the way Mark Wahlberg is,
*  where you're not going up all the way.
*  Oh, I'm sorry, I got them confused.
*  Dr. Oz is closer to us.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  So Mark Wahlberg's doing it right.
*  Mark Wahlberg's doing it right.
*  That's right.
*  I was about to say.
*  I'm like, what?
*  I got them confused.
*  And he lapped him in his polo sweats.
*  Well, dude, Mark Wahlberg was doing them way better.
*  I'm sorry, I said it the wrong way.
*  I really thought that was Mark Wahlberg in front of us
*  for some reason, because Dr. Oz had his,
*  why did I think that?
*  This is strong weed.
*  Obviously, the guy with the fucking hat and the gloves,
*  why does Marky Mark have gloves on?
*  Here, show my, see if you can pull up my push-ups
*  on my Instagram.
*  Why does he have gloves on, though?
*  I looked at these push-ups, I was like,
*  Dr. Oz, those aren't real fucking push-ups.
*  They're not.
*  Neither one of them are doing real push-ups.
*  You go all the way up.
*  But Marky Mark, you know that Marky Mark
*  can bang the fuck out of push-ups.
*  But he's, they probably decided they're going for numbers,
*  and he can't lose to Dr. Oz by doing legit push-ups
*  while Dr. Oz is doing those bullshit push-ups.
*  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
*  It's like a strategy.
*  Here's the problem with, like, I love Mark Wahlberg.
*  I love him on this podcast.
*  But?
*  He's not on the table the way he would be without cameras.
*  Oh yeah, yeah.
*  He's too brand-friendly.
*  I want the, I want the.
*  He's doing great.
*  He's doing great, but I want to.
*  Stay on a podcast.
*  Don't do it.
*  I'll talk to you off air.
*  Yeah, I'm sure.
*  He's awesome, man.
*  He really is.
*  I was in Boston at Medford in the Chevalier.
*  It's like a smaller, like a thing in there.
*  What is it?
*  It's a theater.
*  It's sort of doing, you can do the Wilbur,
*  the Chevalier sits, seats more, but it's.
*  You say it's in Medford?
*  Medford.
*  Oh yeah, I lived there for a little bit.
*  Okay, so I know you've said, talked about
*  living in Medford, and then I got obsessed.
*  And Bill fucking sucks about this
*  because he just shuts you off.
*  He goes, it's all the same.
*  It's like in Boston.
*  Look, look, I'm not Mark Wilbur.
*  I'm not Southie, you know what I mean?
*  But like.
*  No, there's different spots in Boston.
*  I was obsessed.
*  I want, I want, if someone can online do this,
*  I want to, all the Boston comics, all of them,
*  even like Dennis Lee, like all of them,
*  I want them, I want them put on a map,
*  and I want you to tell me about that local area.
*  Because if you do that with Florida,
*  it's very simple to wrap your head around.
*  Jim Brewer grew up, like lived in Brooksville at one point.
*  If you know Florida, you know Brooksville.
*  You know who moves to Brooksville, right?
*  So like I wanted to.
*  I don't, so tell me.
*  Fucking a 70 year old World War II vet and his young wife.
*  Oh really?
*  Oh, my kind of people.
*  It is like borderline retiree.
*  That's what I want for a neighbor.
*  I want a crazy old dude with guns with a hot young wife.
*  I think that was Brewer's dad.
*  I'm like, what's up bro?
*  I like how you're doing it.
*  But I want to know all about Boston,
*  and like all my friends,
*  I want to know about their neighborhoods,
*  where they grew up, and how that defined them.
*  Because I hear Boston, and I go,
*  was Bill, you, Dane, Gary Goldman, fucking.
*  I never really lived in Boston, Boston.
*  I lived in Newton, which is a very nice community.
*  It's outside of Boston, which is Newton Upper Falls,
*  where I lived, which is like the blue collar part.
*  But even the blue collar part,
*  I went back there just a few years ago.
*  It's idyllic, it's beautiful.
*  Really?
*  Oh yeah, it's so nice.
*  I lived across the street from the Charles River.
*  Right across the street from this big ass park,
*  the Charles River was back there,
*  and I could hang around and play in it when I was a kid.
*  Newton was a very, very almost, it was suburban,
*  but there was also like elements of rural shit.
*  There was like rivers and forests and stuff
*  that were really close by.
*  A lot of woods, a lot of trees and woods.
*  So where were Matt Damon and Ben Affleck from?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't remember.
*  They were from more of an urban part.
*  I mean, like I said, I lived in Jamaica Plain first
*  for like a year, which was like sketchy,
*  but Newton wasn't sketchy at all.
*  Newton was nice.
*  It was a good place to grow up.
*  It was pretty easy.
*  I mean, there's bullshit between kids,
*  but there's always, everywhere you fucking,
*  everywhere you go, you're gonna have bullshit between kids.
*  They're all trying to figure their way through life.
*  But like ultimately, it was a pretty nice place to live.
*  And also, man, I think there's a fucking giant benefit
*  of growing up where it gets cold in the winter.
*  I really do. Really?
*  I never had cold.
*  I think my kids are getting screwed.
*  I think you're getting screwed
*  if you live in a place where it doesn't get cold.
*  Why?
*  Because it builds character.
*  It also teaches you about weather and nature.
*  Like there's a reality of the consequences
*  of going out when it's cold.
*  You could die out there.
*  There's a consequence of driving on the road
*  where you can't see where you're going
*  because the road doesn't exist anymore
*  because there's so much snow.
*  Oh yeah.
*  That's real.
*  That can happen.
*  Oh, it didn't happen to me until I was like 29.
*  It's the first time I ever drove in snow.
*  Yeah.
*  But there's something to be said for a,
*  it is cool to be a grownup and see snow for the first time.
*  Oh, I'm sure.
*  It's like-
*  Yeah, you probably appreciate it more than I did.
*  Oh, I see snow.
*  I get so excited when it snows.
*  Well, I had it till I was seven
*  and then I had it again when I was 13.
*  So all those years of living in California and Florida,
*  obviously I never saw snow.
*  I saw snow one time when I was in San Francisco, I remember.
*  I was like, wow, this is interesting.
*  It's like one of my strongest memories from San Francisco.
*  It snowed in Tampa.
*  See a little bit of snow.
*  Just a little bit of snow.
*  It snowed in Tampa in like 1978, 1979.
*  I remember it so fucking vividly.
*  It shuts shit down, but it also,
*  it pays you back with character.
*  You develop character.
*  My favorite people, almost to a person,
*  in terms of like their attitude about things
*  are all East Coast people.
*  Yeah.
*  All my favorite people are East Coast people.
*  So many of them are cold weather people.
*  So many of them.
*  I mean, there's a few that I'm really close with
*  that are LA people that born and raised here.
*  And it's not like I like them less.
*  It's just that the numbers of people that are interesting.
*  That I'm friends with.
*  I know what you're saying.
*  There's less bumps on them.
*  When you grew up in LA, you're like,
*  so you grew up in Santa Monica?
*  How, what was that like?
*  You go to the third street, prom and all that.
*  Yeah, what did you do?
*  What was the hard day?
*  It kind of rained.
*  It rained a little bit.
*  Oh, I remember Northridge.
*  Oh, I bet you do.
*  I was hanging out on the top of,
*  I had a, like when I lived in Newton,
*  we lived on this really steep street.
*  And there was a part of like above my parents bedroom
*  where you could stand on the roof.
*  So you could go out to the back,
*  you could climb up a ladder, you could stand on the roof.
*  And me and my friend Jay Jewett were,
*  no, I'm sorry, it was John Jewett.
*  It was Jay's brother.
*  Jay was my friend too.
*  But John and I were on the roof
*  and we were, because John was dating my sister,
*  and we were watching cars slide down this frozen street
*  and slam it into curbs.
*  Every car that went down the street was fucked
*  because they didn't know that it was all black guys.
*  The whole street was black guys.
*  And we sat on the roof
*  and there was not a goddamn thing we could do.
*  Wait, how many black guys?
*  No, not black guys, black ice.
*  Oh.
*  Jesus Christ, Bert.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  I had a visual of-
*  The whole street was black guys.
*  I had a visual of like 200 black guys
*  just watching white people careen.
*  And I'm like, holy, it got so much better.
*  It got so much better with black guys.
*  Winter weather, black ice, I'm sorry.
*  I probably, we've had a lot of weed and pot and alcohol.
*  I probably slurred my words.
*  It's so much better of a story
*  watching a bunch of black guys
*  like it's a slam dunk contest.
*  Like, oh shit.
*  It's hilarious.
*  Oh my God.
*  No, it was cars just bouncing off the curb.
*  And so we called the cops and we told them,
*  hey, there's all these cars, like two cars in a row
*  have come down this hill
*  and they're bouncing off the curbs.
*  And so the cops came down the hill
*  and they fucking bounced off the curbs.
*  These fucking dipshits.
*  And we're watching them.
*  And me and John are watching this car bounce off these curbs.
*  I'm like, look at this fucking idiot.
*  Did you not listen?
*  We called you, man.
*  And you're like, I got a scene for myself.
*  Why don't you come up from the bottom, you fuck?
*  You grab the phone, you're like, call Domino's.
*  They came the same way everybody else did
*  and the same thing happened.
*  Like, we know better, we know better.
*  We're gonna calm down.
*  Oh my God.
*  Show you homos how to drive.
*  They just bounced off the curves.
*  Oh my God.
*  But I really believe that growing up like that
*  is good for you.
*  I think spending my high school years in Massachusetts
*  was really important.
*  It's really important to shovel snow.
*  Like that was one of the ways we made money.
*  Like you get pumped when it snowed out
*  because you could charge people.
*  So you would go to this lady's house
*  and you knew she couldn't shovel
*  this fucking long ass driveway.
*  And you'd make a negotiation.
*  Like when I'm looking at it,
*  I would try to figure out like,
*  try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try.
*  I'm trying to do my math.
*  Math's always terrible.
*  Oh wow.
*  So you're a kid and you're going like,
*  that's a valuable trait.
*  Yeah, I'm like 14.
*  I'm trying to figure out how long it's gonna take
*  to dig up two feet of snow from 40 feet of driveway.
*  I'm like, hmm.
*  You're never right.
*  I would love to hear my daughter's price point on that.
*  Some people were great.
*  Some people were really generous.
*  They didn't even give you a tip.
*  They pay you like maybe $100
*  to do a whole long ass driveway.
*  But bro, it would take you all day.
*  When someone has one of these motherfuckers
*  that goes up to their house and you gotta,
*  and it's like two feet of snow,
*  you don't even realize how much work that is.
*  Dude, I would come home wrecked, just wrecked.
*  Dude, we were at a yurt at 7,000 feet
*  in fucking Idaho, right?
*  And low on oxygen.
*  We've been riding snowmobiles,
*  drinking beers all the way up to this yurt.
*  And I get there and the whole fucking deck is covered
*  and there's a fire pit.
*  I'm so excited as a Florida kid.
*  I go, I'm gonna shovel the deck.
*  Everyone's like, hey man, you're gonna have
*  a fucking heart attack.
*  And I go, no, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
*  I've been so excited about shoveling snow
*  my whole life, right?
*  I've never done it.
*  It sucks dick.
*  It sucks the most.
*  Within, I gave it to my buddy, John Sales.
*  I go, you gotta finish, man.
*  I can't do this shit.
*  I was like, I'm a Florida kid, man.
*  I'm gonna put on my flip flops.
*  Dude, do you know how many old ladies hurt themselves
*  trying to shovel their way out of their house every year
*  in cold climates when they don't have someone
*  like a support system, like a son
*  or someone to come visit them and help them?
*  A lot of guys that I know that are East Coast guys
*  that live in the neighborhood of their family
*  or anywhere near their family,
*  it's almost like understood.
*  When it snows out, you go over to your mother-in-law's house
*  and you dig her out, because she's stuck.
*  That's real shit, man.
*  You have to, I think that it's dangerous
*  and it's definitely an added fucker of life
*  where you come to California,
*  you're like, thank God there's no snow.
*  And that's how I was when I first moved here.
*  I'm like, thank God there's no snow.
*  But part of me is like, man, I learned from that snow.
*  I learned a lot of shit, dude.
*  That taught me a lot about perseverance
*  because I used to deliver newspapers, so I drove every day.
*  I drove every fucking day, every day.
*  365 days a year I was driving, for years,
*  because it was the best way to not have a job
*  while you have a job.
*  The job was, I just had to go somewhere
*  and get the newspapers and then follow the route
*  and throw them out the window.
*  But while I'm doing that, no one's looking over my shoulder,
*  no one's telling me what to do,
*  and it's not the worst pay in the world.
*  It was pretty good pay.
*  Thrifty Nickel.
*  I used to deliver the Thrifty Nickel in Tallahassee.
*  Oh, Sean Simmons, he got me the job.
*  He was like, hey man, the pay is good.
*  It was like 400 bucks.
*  All you had to do was one Thursday.
*  But you woke up at the crack of dawn,
*  they filled my jet of front seat, back seat,
*  and trunk with Thrifty Nickels,
*  and I had to run around.
*  What is a Thrifty Nickel?
*  It was like a savings magazine, like a savings newspaper.
*  Oh, okay.
*  The movie Singles had just come out,
*  and so I was listening to the soundtrack of Singles.
*  What was that movie?
*  It was Matt Damon.
*  No, no, Matt, Matt, who's the good looking Matt
*  that we grew up with, that was in Beautiful Girls?
*  Matt.
*  Oh, that guy.
*  Matt Dillon, Matt Dillon.
*  I can't, I see him, I saw his face.
*  Matt Dillon, it was Matt Dillon.
*  Stay Gold Pony Boy.
*  Yeah, oh.
*  Do you know how many times I've said that in my head
*  in an airport bar?
*  Stay Gold Pony Boy, one more.
*  Woo!
*  Dude, and so it was a Cameron Crowe movie.
*  Singles, there it is.
*  Man, that whole soundtrack.
*  Keir Sedgwick.
*  Eddie Vedder.
*  Matt Dillon.
*  That was such, and I listened to that, that whole.
*  He's preposterously handsome.
*  He's a, dude, I saw him in person, he's striking.
*  We bumped into each other, and he did the Matt Dillon hello.
*  A guy like that almost has a curse.
*  Too handsome.
*  We were trying to buy Coke at the Formosa Cafe.
*  Shh.
*  It's past, I think we're good.
*  I don't know, man, maybe he doesn't want people
*  to know he buys Coke. No, not me and him,
*  no, not me and him, me and my friends.
*  Not me and Matt Dillon.
*  By the way, if we had, I would have fucking ratted him out.
*  He was with the little guy from Beautiful Girls,
*  she goes, hey guys, Sambuca, and he goes,
*  what Meg, too early or too late?
*  Like the little, you know the little guy from those movies?
*  He was so good.
*  Beautiful Girls is one of the greatest fucking movies ever.
*  Is that him with Chris Cornell?
*  Yeah, that's him with Chris Cornell.
*  Who's on his right?
*  She was famous, she's someone's daughter or something.
*  Bridget Fonda?
*  Chris Cornell was one of the biggest bummer suicides.
*  Was that from, it was from Xanax, right?
*  I don't know what it was from.
*  I don't know what it was from.
*  I mean, I think there's a bunch of different.
*  Sonny Garcia was the one that fucked me up.
*  Big surfer from LA, or from Hawaii.
*  I didn't know about that one.
*  Oh dude, that bummed me out so bad.
*  Because I'm a, despite not knowing how to surf at all,
*  I'm a huge surfing fan.
*  And so, and Sonny Garcia was like the first dude that,
*  first dude I remember seeing, him and Christian Fletcher
*  had tattoos, like when you were like,
*  bro they got tattoos, what did their parents say?
*  Forever, forever.
*  Keep it for life.
*  God, and then, but yeah, he committed suicide
*  in like Portland or something.
*  I think I remember reading that now.
*  I didn't know about him,
*  but I think I remember reading it now.
*  Poor Dane was the hardest one for me.
*  I wish I had met him.
*  That was one of the ones where I'm like,
*  you know, you always think, like,
*  God was so smart, I wish I could have talked to him.
*  He was so smart, you know?
*  Sometimes people can, they can get in a bad way.
*  They can get in a bad way.
*  But you can pull out of that bad way.
*  Sometimes you need to know.
*  You need to know that there's a,
*  there's a light at the end.
*  You gotta, I don't know what it was.
*  I don't know if it was chemical or emotional.
*  I don't know what it was, but he had so much to offer.
*  His perspective was so unique.
*  He was such an interesting guy.
*  Like a genuine, and just, you could feel the chaos in him.
*  He was a fun guy to discover, you know?
*  Like when you first found him.
*  Because I think a lot of people found him on their own,
*  where they were like, dude, this fucking show,
*  No Reservations is awesome.
*  Dude, I would have loved to see him, you and him
*  get drunk together.
*  Because he made me tap out.
*  Dude, we went camping.
*  We went pheasant hunting in Montana,
*  and then we went camping.
*  And boredangles hard in the paint, son.
*  He went hard in the paint.
*  And I found, I couldn't find any weed.
*  I thought I had weed, but I had a vape.
*  I had a vape pen.
*  So we bust out the vape pen.
*  And they're passing around the whiskey.
*  And we were barbecued, and he keeps going.
*  He just, he kept going.
*  He would just keep going.
*  He wanted to go to the Netherlands.
*  He wanted to pass into the next dimension.
*  He wanted to escape.
*  You know, he would go hard.
*  I would have loved to have partied with him.
*  He was so interesting.
*  I just really enjoyed his company.
*  You know, he was just, I didn't,
*  I never knew anyone like him.
*  He was a very, very different guy.
*  And I always was like happy that he liked me.
*  Cause I was always like, that a guy like that could,
*  like I come off the wrong way sometimes to people.
*  You know?
*  You think you do?
*  Yeah, well you did too.
*  I'm fucking shirtless.
*  Are you kidding me?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I know, yeah.
*  I come off the wrong,
*  I come off wholeheartedly the wrong way with intention.
*  People go, that guy is a fucking idiot.
*  I was telling Jim Norton this this morning.
*  When Showtime did my special machine,
*  Helen, I keep saying Helen, that's her name.
*  She works at Showtime.
*  She made a very, very wise tactical decision.
*  She said, I think you shirtless is a bad idea.
*  I said, really?
*  And she goes, I just think that a lot of people
*  are gonna change the channel.
*  And man was she right.
*  I had the lowest rated special out of all of them
*  for the whole year.
*  It was the lowest rated special.
*  And then when I did, when that story went viral,
*  it was because my shirt was off that people recognized it.
*  And I think, I was saying this,
*  I think it's the thing where like,
*  when big government puts an entity in front of you,
*  like when Showtime puts that in front of you
*  and you have the remote, you go, ah, fuck that guy.
*  Like thumbs down.
*  But when you discovered on your own online,
*  and you go, shirtless guy, what's that?
*  The onus is on you, so you're more forgiving.
*  And you'll listen.
*  I think that's the cool thing about podcasts.
*  And what we do is that,
*  I remember discovering your podcast.
*  Isla, you and Tommy, this must be episode three.
*  You and Tommy were doing a podcast.
*  Isla was a baby.
*  She saw Tommy Buns on the screen and clicked it.
*  It was on Twitter, or maybe Myspace,
*  but clicked it and it was snowflakes.
*  And I came in and Isla was watching you and Tom
*  on my laptop.
*  And I sat with Isla in my lap and I started watching it.
*  And from, it must've been like episode three, four,
*  maybe even before you started calling
*  to Joe Rogan experience.
*  I was fucking hooked.
*  And I was a ride or die motherfucker,
*  like because I found it.
*  But if you put podcasts like, when these podcasts say,
*  people sign big deals with podcasts
*  and then podcast company goes, new podcast.
*  It's like, I gotta find it.
*  When you find it yourself, you fucking love it, man.
*  And I found Bourdain.
*  Sitting in my bed, no reservations came on.
*  I didn't know what it was at all.
*  Didn't know anything about Travel Channel
*  other than man versus food.
*  And I fucking, he did this monologue that I was like,
*  dude, that's what every guy hosting television wants to do.
*  Yeah, his monologues are brilliant.
*  It's brilliant.
*  He was a great writer. He wrote them.
*  He was a great writer as well.
*  He's just super unique.
*  When he got into jujitsu, I was so happy.
*  I was so happy.
*  That was a fucking shift.
*  Also, I was like,
*  I'm gonna be closer friends with him now.
*  Because he's into jujitsu.
*  Yeah, you're like his knock-on.
*  Well, yeah, in a way.
*  What's his name?
*  John Dudley.
*  Yeah, John Dudley is like, he gets a call from you
*  and he's like, ah, Rogan's calling, I'll take it.
*  What do you need to know about Bo Set-Up, brother?
*  With him, it was like such an interesting shift.
*  Because when I'd known him before,
*  he was smoking cigarettes.
*  And then I met him,
*  no, actually I met him after he had stopped smoking cigarettes.
*  I knew of him when he was smoking,
*  when he was on his television show.
*  And then he had his daughter
*  and when he had his daughter, he stopped smoking.
*  But I remember reading that he decided to take statins
*  rather than clean up his diet.
*  Because it was just so important to him to eat well.
*  And he wasn't exercising at the time
*  and he was drinking a lot.
*  But it was so important for him,
*  I mean, for what he does and what he loves,
*  just to be able to eat well,
*  just eat the most delicious artistic creations
*  of master culinary assassins.
*  And so that's what he decided to do.
*  And then when he got into jujitsu,
*  he didn't need the high blood pressure medication anymore.
*  Or what was it, high cholesterol medication anymore.
*  He didn't need it anymore.
*  His whole body transformed.
*  He seemed so much more, when he was on CNN,
*  he seemed so much more grounded and healthy.
*  Yeah, but in some ways, but to me, in some ways not.
*  In some ways I was watching him age very rapidly,
*  physically, how he looked.
*  I love this guy to death.
*  Towards the end, I would see images of him
*  and I was like, wow, he looks like he's struggling.
*  His body is aging a lot.
*  And it could be just because he's traveling so much
*  and he's drinking so much.
*  It could be many, many, many, many, many.
*  Traveling with drinking is very different
*  than living at home drinking.
*  It's rough, it's all rough.
*  It's all rough on the body.
*  And then probably all the demons he was battling
*  that he succumbed to in the end anyway.
*  There's something about that.
*  But there was something about that fucking look that he had
*  when he was at that place that was like,
*  you just wanted to talk to him
*  because he knew he had some shit to say.
*  God, man, what a fucking brilliant mind too.
*  My wife was, before I started watching him,
*  my wife read Kitchen Confidentials.
*  Is that his?
*  Was that his?
*  And my wife's like, this guy's fucking amazing, Bert.
*  And I was in bed with Isla and it came on TV.
*  Yeah, he was awesome.
*  You met some fucking fascinating people.
*  Yeah, he was one of the first to ever do the podcast too.
*  One of the first real guests,
*  famous people that came in.
*  Do you remember when, back in the,
*  this is like a throwback,
*  do you remember when Ari was the most fascinating person?
*  Or like Brian Redband?
*  Like, you remember the,
*  I talk about the podcast back in the day
*  when you had that landline that would ring
*  for no reason at all?
*  Yeah, I kept having to pull it out of the wall.
*  Who was the first guest you got on the podcast
*  where you were like, shut the fuck up?
*  Graham Hancock.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  We went and grabbed Graham Hancock.
*  And I believe it was Graham and Duncan and I.
*  And we sat down.
*  This was way, way, way, way, way early on.
*  And I had picked up one of Graham's books.
*  I believe it's, I always say footprints of the gods,
*  but it's really fingerprints of the gods, I'm pretty sure.
*  And the book was about ancient civilizations.
*  And it was all about how there's some,
*  there's a massive amount of evidence
*  that points to the possibility
*  that Earth experienced some sort of a cataclysmic disaster
*  somewhere in the neighborhood of 12,000 years ago.
*  And that all the stuff that we see
*  in these older civilizations,
*  it's really complex and confusing.
*  The reason why it happened,
*  and there's just like this down period and this up period,
*  again afterwards, is because a giant percentage
*  of the population was wiped out by an asteroid
*  that they can prove hit.
*  And he's been proven more and more and more correct
*  as time went on.
*  For me, just as a fan of that subject,
*  because just what we're experiencing now with this pandemic
*  and just with life in general,
*  we love to think that things are static and nothing static.
*  And there's nothing sadder than someone who doesn't recognize
*  that they're not static anymore.
*  There's nothing sadder than a woman who's in her 80s
*  who still puts on too much makeup,
*  or a guy that's that age
*  that's still doing pushups on the front lawn
*  and flexing for the neighbors.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Come on, Ms. Mary.
*  There's nothing sad about people that don't recognize
*  that things aren't static.
*  And he's like the guy who sounded the wake up call
*  in my consciousness.
*  Look at that.
*  What year was that, man?
*  September 25th, 2011.
*  Wow.
*  So wait, how long has this podcast been going on?
*  10 years now.
*  Yeah, it started in 2010.
*  Duncan has not changed one fucking bit.
*  2009, and it went to December of, yeah.
*  Duncan looks exactly the fucking same.
*  He's the same.
*  But we had these,
*  look, there's a flashlight over my left shoulder.
*  I was just telling Whitney about those days.
*  But that was, listen, man, you could only have done
*  that podcast the way we did it if you did it that way.
*  But meaning that no one has to be watching, no one cared.
*  It didn't mean anything.
*  And we were blasted out of our minds
*  for the first 80 or 90 episodes, maybe even more.
*  I was so high during every episode.
*  Oh.
*  Remember when we do the volcano shots?
*  I remember that big fucking volcano.
*  And it would sit right next to you,
*  and it would just keep smoking the entire time.
*  So if you had to sit next to Red Band on the right,
*  it would just burn the whole time.
*  Sometimes we'd be in the middle of the conversation,
*  and I'd be like, have we started the podcast?
*  Dude, I remember that time so vividly.
*  It was like a shift in the fucking universes of like,
*  I remember going to your house.
*  I always say, this is one of my favorite stories.
*  The way I met you is the last way you should meet Joe.
*  I went up to your house, you were at the door already,
*  and you were like, hey man, I go, hey man, big fan,
*  I gotta see the deprivation tank, your dog,
*  and the pool table, then we need to get high,
*  and then I'm ready to do this.
*  And you were like, caught off guard.
*  You're like, okay.
*  You took me back, I met Johnny Cash.
*  You took me down to the deprivation tank.
*  We played around a pool, went out to that back
*  where the swing set and the chickens ended up being.
*  Smoked a joint, Red Band showed up.
*  It changed my fucking life.
*  You said, hey man, you gotta tell that machine story
*  every time you get on stage.
*  If you hadn't done that,
*  I don't know what the fuck I'd be doing.
*  If you know that, that's what happened
*  that first night, right?
*  So I tell the machine story to your podcast,
*  and you go, it's one of the best stories.
*  It's one of the best stories I've ever told.
*  You go, ladies and gentlemen, you go,
*  you tell that on stage?
*  I go, no.
*  You go, you gotta start telling that on stage.
*  Hey everybody, and you talk to the, you go,
*  he is from now on known as the machine.
*  You yell the machine every one of his shows
*  until you make him tell it on stage.
*  So I go to Columbus the next week.
*  I go do my first show Thursday,
*  man, you know, like maybe 120 people not sold out,
*  and they start chanting the machine.
*  And I go, hey guys, it's not a stage story.
*  This dude in the front row, desk quad, ride or die.
*  Desk quad, covered, head to toe, goes,
*  hey Bert, we understand it's not gonna be funny,
*  but you gotta tell it if you're gonna want it to be good.
*  So go ahead, man.
*  Come on guys, right, right, right?
*  And everyone started cheering.
*  You can do it, Bert, you can do it.
*  I told it, I told it, and at the bar they're like,
*  you know, we had to fake laugh a couple times,
*  but I think it's a good story.
*  We had to fake laugh a couple times.
*  Cut from that to me and Tom
*  doing our weight loss challenge, right?
*  The first time we did our weight loss challenge,
*  and that machine story went viral that week.
*  That week, that machine story went viral.
*  The week you guys did, began the challenge
*  or finished the challenge?
*  The weigh-ins, when he shaved my beard,
*  the machine story went viral that fucking week.
*  I say, they go, you know,
*  I always say I'm the luckiest dude in the world.
*  I think I work hard, but I'm very, very, very lucky.
*  I'm more lucky than anyone in the world, right?
*  Just, I stand by luck.
*  But man, the luckiest I've ever been
*  is making friends with a group.
*  I remember you telling me,
*  I remember you coming out and saying,
*  I didn't wanna make friends.
*  You came out with this shit, we were at the Ice House,
*  we were doing Death Squad Chronicles.
*  Came out with a shot and a beer.
*  You say, hey, you're a good guy.
*  I go, oh yeah, thanks.
*  You're like, you know, we're all trying to be your friend,
*  man, and I was like, no, I got it, I got it.
*  And you're like, no, like, you just gotta let us.
*  And I was like, no, I understand.
*  You're like, no, no, no, that means like,
*  when we call you, call us back.
*  And I'm like, yeah, and you're like,
*  no, I don't think I understand what you're saying.
*  You go, me, Joey, Ari, Tommy,
*  we're all trying to be your friend, Bert.
*  Well, we have to tell you,
*  I don't wanna throw anybody under the bus,
*  so as I explain this, I'm gonna be very careful.
*  The reason why we're saying that,
*  is because we know you had been friends with a tyrant.
*  Hey, you were fucking, you were shell shocked.
*  We're like, Bert, we're your real friends.
*  We like you.
*  We're not trying to tell you what to do
*  or fucking scream at you or belittle you.
*  We actually like you.
*  We're gonna bust your balls,
*  but we bust everyone's balls.
*  That's half the fun.
*  That is a fucking fun.
*  I felt like you were like a beaten kid.
*  We're like, Jesus Christ, we gotta lighten this.
*  Press your guy up.
*  I remember you guys call one Saturday.
*  You go, what are you doing?
*  I go, I'm on the treadmill, and you go, nah.
*  Come over to the ice house.
*  And I said, oh, I'm good, and I hung up, right?
*  And then Tommy called me back, and Tommy goes,
*  hey man, you gotta let us try to be your friend.
*  Fucking come to the ice house.
*  Just come to the fucking ice house.
*  And I went, and then I heard you on the, get over here!
*  And so I fucking went over to the ice house.
*  We had a fucking blast, dude.
*  Had a fucking blast.
*  I knew it, but you know,
*  that's how it is in this fucking weird business.
*  Half the fun is finding a group of people
*  that you can enjoy it with.
*  It's half the fun.
*  It's all the fun.
*  In my opinion, you used to tell me
*  about how traveling with Joey and Tom and Ari
*  and how much fun it was.
*  Changes the game.
*  Dude, I travel with a group of guys now,
*  and it's so much fun to get,
*  we've been doing push-up challenges every night.
*  You get wasted and go, fuck it, let's go, tens of tens.
*  Josh, Tommy's guy that he has open for us.
*  Josh Potter.
*  Josh Potter is fucking hilarious.
*  He's really funny, man.
*  Hilarious.
*  He opened for Tommy.
*  I happened to be in Vegas
*  maybe like the last get out of the year.
*  I was in Vegas for the UFC,
*  and just coincidentally, Tommy was performing at the Mirage.
*  So I came to hang out with him.
*  We all went out.
*  We had steaks.
*  We fucking had a great time on Friday night,
*  and then we went to see his show.
*  And then we went to see his show.
*  That was the first time I ever saw Josh.
*  He murdered, man.
*  He's awesome, dude.
*  He's really funny.
*  From Buffalo, we used to,
*  Yeah, you'd run into him every now and then,
*  Tommy's a legit,
*  I gotta say, Tom Special's probably streaming right now
*  if you're watching this.
*  It's streaming on Netflix.
*  It's called Ball Hog.
*  He'll be on the podcast, I'm sure, this week.
*  He's tomorrow.
*  He's tomorrow?
*  Tommy's on tomorrow.
*  Yeah.
*  And what's good for the goose is good for the gander.
*  We got a podcast, Two Bears, One Cave.
*  Check out his-
*  Two bears, one cave.
*  Say it so people can understand it.
*  Two bears, one cave.
*  You don't have to shove it in there.
*  It's an old host habit.
*  What is it about saying things fast?
*  Okay, okay, okay.
*  Two bears, one cave.
*  Dude, I get my brain'll wrap.
*  I'll get verbiage in my head.
*  Like, body stats world tour.
*  I just run off so far.
*  Do you know who Mac Lethal is?
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, you ever listen to him rap,
*  double, triple fast rap?
*  Yes, yes.
*  His rapping confuses the fuck out of me.
*  I don't even understand how someone's lips can move
*  that fast. How about Eminem?
*  Did you hear Eminem when he did that Eminem challenge?
*  You saw it, Jamie, I'm sure.
*  Because me and you were both children.
*  But Mac Lethal's probably the fastest.
*  I don't know, this Eminem challenge,
*  I wish you could play it.
*  Well, I heard some Eminem shit recently
*  and it was really fast too.
*  Really fucking fast.
*  Really fast too.
*  But I kinda think Mac Lethal's on another level.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, if I had to put the two of them in a fast rap off,
*  I got my money on that Lethal fella.
*  Ladies and gentlemen, a fast rap off.
*  In the section of the song he says,
*  16, or 99 words in 16 seconds.
*  Eminem does?
*  Yeah.
*  99 words in 16 seconds.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  When you were younger, did you ever think
*  there was a celebrity that would love your comedy?
*  When you were younger and you were like-
*  No, man, one of the weirdest things ever
*  was looking in the audience and seeing famous people.
*  It took forever to get used to that.
*  Like who?
*  Gene Simmons.
*  Gene Simmons, fuck that guy.
*  Gene Simmons, I know, you hate that guy.
*  Ah!
*  He blocked me on Twitter.
*  Did he really?
*  Yeah, fuck Gene Simmons.
*  Oh, that's hilarious.
*  I really wished I could be the consigliere
*  that brought you two together at this time.
*  He was a big comedy fan though.
*  Yeah, he-
*  He used to go to a lot of comedy shows.
*  His son, I think, liked my comedy.
*  His son's cool as fuck.
*  And his son brought his whole family
*  on New Year's Eve at the Improv one weekend.
*  Yeah.
*  One year rather.
*  Yeah, it was weird.
*  It was weird.
*  I was like, Jesus Christ,
*  Gene Simmons in the fucking audience.
*  When I was a kid, I loved Kiss.
*  They were awesome.
*  When I was a kid, god damn, man.
*  It was like my favorite band.
*  It was a weird band.
*  Oh, bro.
*  They would mock you if you loved them.
*  I was obsessed.
*  Do you remember the movie they did?
*  Where they took over a fucking theme park?
*  Phantom of the Park.
*  Phantom of the Park.
*  Yes, I remember that.
*  Bro, the power went out in the middle of me watching
*  and I cried.
*  Wait, how old were you?
*  Because I remember how old I was.
*  I don't know, I was probably like 11 or something like that.
*  I was at Pat Feigen's house, I must have been seven.
*  And I was like,
*  oh my god, this is the greatest movie ever.
*  My parents came and they were like,
*  time to go home.
*  I go, we're not done, we're not done.
*  I didn't really cry, but I might as well.
*  I was like, god damn it, fucking power's off.
*  My dad would wake me up
*  and he'd wait for the 7-Eleven commercials
*  where they were on Slurpees and he'd crank it up.
*  He'd go, shout it, shout it, shout it out loud.
*  And I'd hop up, I'm ready to go to school, first grade.
*  I'm ready to go to school, dad.
*  Every kid that was into Kiss identified
*  with a particular member.
*  My friend Javier was really into Peter Chris.
*  Oh my god, I was hardcore into Peter Chris.
*  I met Peter Chris.
*  There were certain dudes that thought they were Paul Stanley,
*  certain dudes that, I was a Gene Simmons fan.
*  I was in between Peter Chris and Ace Freely.
*  I bought Ace Freely's solo album in high school.
*  I didn't ever think that I would be spiritual enough
*  to be tuned into Ace Freely
*  because Ace Freely was the spaceman, right?
*  He was the dude who was mellow with the guitar,
*  with the crazy guitar.
*  He had a really good solo album.
*  Remember they did the solo album with their faces on it?
*  Yeah.
*  Back in the New York groove.
*  Yeah.
*  I loved that song.
*  Dude, they had some amazing, like the branding of Kiss.
*  You remember them in the suits?
*  Yeah.
*  The picture of them in the suits?
*  Yeah, Dressed to Kill.
*  Yeah, that was a fucking, dude.
*  Wasn't it Dressed to Kill?
*  I hate that I hate Gene Simmons.
*  Like I wanna love him so bad.
*  Oh, that's so sad.
*  It's so hard to-
*  I don't remember the story,
*  but I saw it one day, someone sent it to me.
*  One of my friends sent it to me,
*  us talking about you hating Gene Simmons.
*  I'm like, God, I kinda forgot about this.
*  I had a bad interaction with him.
*  There it is, Dressed to Kill.
*  That's such a badass, and clogs.
*  He's wearing clogs.
*  I know.
*  They were different kinds of people back then.
*  God.
*  I feel like there's no way we would ever be able
*  to understand what life was like being a bunch of dudes
*  who were world famous wearing makeup,
*  mocked, openly mocked by so many members
*  of the music community, whether it's radio stations,
*  they wouldn't play, they thought they were a joke,
*  and you were a fool if you liked their music,
*  and then they take their makeup off for a little bit.
*  Remember that?
*  Kiss unmasked.
*  I remember that.
*  And then nobody was into it.
*  They were like, fuck it, we're going back,
*  we're putting it back on.
*  I was at Pat Fagan's house,
*  and he's like, you wanna see what Gene Simmons looks like?
*  I was like, hard pass.
*  But they wore everybody out.
*  They wore everybody out.
*  They stayed in the game.
*  I mean, they replaced two members,
*  Ace Freely and Peter Chris,
*  they kinda rotated in now,
*  and eventually they replaced him with new people
*  that played the same characters.
*  This is a new dude who's the cat dude,
*  and a new dude who's the space dude.
*  And for a while they tried to do it differently.
*  They added a fox, one guy was a fox.
*  And people were like, get the fuck out of here.
*  You don't remember that?
*  I don't remember that.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, when Peter Chris was gone,
*  they put in some new dude instead of a cat.
*  He was like a fox.
*  It was a real problem.
*  And the hardcore Kiss fans were like,
*  this is fucking bullshit.
*  You know who's a hardcore Kiss fan?
*  Who?
*  Kevin James.
*  No, that makes sense.
*  Me and Kevin James, two nights in a row,
*  went to see Kiss in LA.
*  I think it was at the Forum during their comeback tour,
*  because we thought they were never gonna come back again.
*  So this is me and Kevin James,
*  and man, I don't know what year that was,
*  but it was in the 90s.
*  Who was that guy?
*  That's the fox.
*  Eric Carr, yeah, he's a fox.
*  Eric Carr, yeah.
*  Yeah, get the fuck out of here, bro.
*  Nice guy, great musician, don't get me wrong.
*  But no, you can't add new characters.
*  Kevin James and I could not be more different.
*  He's a great guy.
*  He's a great guy.
*  Me and Gary.
*  You would love him.
*  I know Kevin.
*  But I mean, if you really knew him like I knew him,
*  I'm tight with him.
*  I hooked him up with my manager.
*  We have the same manager we have from the very beginning.
*  I've known Kevin for fuck, 29 years maybe.
*  Gary and I were tight.
*  Gary Valentine and I.
*  I was tight with Gary too.
*  I love Gary Valentine.
*  He's a great guy.
*  Gary Valentine, one of my favorite stories ever.
*  One time we're at the Improv and he goes,
*  Burtzky, shot?
*  And I go, yeah, Gary?
*  And he grabs, he grabs two shots and he hands me one
*  and then he grabs his and he takes his back
*  when the Improv had candles
*  and he does a shot of a candle,
*  wax all over his lips, he goes, I took the wrong one.
*  Okay, gaga.
*  Gary Valentine is the fucking funniest human being, man.
*  Drank a shot of candle.
*  It just splashed on his lip and he goes,
*  I drank the wrong one.
*  I can't be good.
*  Yeah, the, is it interesting?
*  What are their, their real name is not,
*  don't be giving up their real name, you fuck.
*  Fuck, yeah.
*  Jesus Christ, Burt Kreischer, causing trouble.
*  Yeah, they both got different names,
*  but they're brothers and sisters, whatever.
*  Brothers.
*  Kevin's a, he's an interesting cat.
*  He really is.
*  Yeah, very interesting guy.
*  Very quiet, we sat one time at his house,
*  me and Gary and a couple other guys,
*  and I was getting wasted
*  and he was just sitting there looking at me
*  and he was like, hey, what are you partying for?
*  I go, I was just enjoying it and he goes, what?
*  And I go, all your success.
*  And he goes, he's like, huh?
*  I said, Kevin, I would be doing it so different
*  if I was you.
*  He was, he was so, I remember he drove like a,
*  I wanna say a Jeep Cherokee
*  on his third season of King of Queens.
*  He had like, he was very conservative, never.
*  Yeah, well, he's a guy who plays the cards
*  close to his chest, you know?
*  Such a sweet dude, he introduced me to guacamole.
*  The only reason why I've ever been in any movies,
*  I did some terrible movies that nobody saw before,
*  but like the movies that I did
*  once I didn't need to do anything anymore
*  anymore in terms of acting was his movies.
*  I did two of his movies.
*  I did Zoo Keeper and I did Here Comes the Boom.
*  And the only reason why I did them was because I love Kevin.
*  He's such a great dude.
*  Zoo Keeper was fun too, it was so ridiculous.
*  I had to learn how to dance.
*  It's like, it took months and months of my time.
*  It was really interesting.
*  I saw that dance, you can actually dance.
*  It was so ridiculous, man.
*  Sebastian Maniscalco can dance.
*  In all fairness, some of what you see is not actually me.
*  Some of it is me, but there was this dude
*  who was a professional dancer who was like a stand-in,
*  who was amazing, he was amazing.
*  So the stuff where it's clearly me,
*  I definitely did a lot of the stuff.
*  All the stuff with me and Leslie Bibb,
*  where I had a holder and all that stuff,
*  that was me, 100%.
*  But this dude was so much better than me.
*  Where you couldn't tell, they stuck him in.
*  He was built like me and it was perfect.
*  It was like, nobody could tell,
*  because he was really good.
*  When you see how hard it is to actually dance,
*  you go, my god.
*  When you see a real professional,
*  it's one of the most dismissed things with people.
*  We dismiss it.
*  Like, oh, what a frivolous pursuit.
*  Not any how to dance.
*  But if you can really dance, it's so impressive
*  when someone has full control of their body.
*  That's what Tom said to me,
*  because I'm a better dancer than him.
*  Dude, I did, I did, fuck Tom.
*  Let me tell you something.
*  That cocksucker,
*  my daughters, my daughters said,
*  my daughters saw Tom's video and they looked at it
*  and they're like, wait, Tom can dance.
*  I go, you didn't say that when you saw my video.
*  And they go, well, you paid someone to teach you how to dance.
*  I go, so did fucking he.
*  You think he did that on his own?
*  They go, it looks like it.
*  It looks like he figured it out on his own.
*  I tried to do that Irish dance for the release of the special.
*  But you gotta appreciate the fact that Tom did it
*  in a Steven Seagal outfit with a carrot.
*  Don't ever, like,
*  I swear to God, if you watched the video of me watching that
*  for the first time, it's a love letter.
*  It's a man reading a love letter from his boyfriend.
*  When Tom, I said, he goes, how do you feel?
*  I said, like, privately, I go,
*  made me feel very honored that you did that.
*  And he goes, it's because I love you.
*  When he put that out, it meant so much to me
*  because I thought I put out my dance video
*  and everyone made fun of it.
*  We watched it, we giggled.
*  But the fact that it inspired Tom to drop 80,000,
*  whatever he spent, 80,000, 100,000, 110,000.
*  The fact that he made a reply video
*  made me so fucking excited.
*  Well, he went so deep.
*  He went so fucking, Joe, Joe, Joe.
*  You realize what he did?
*  He made me, he told me, he goes,
*  I sat and did facial recognition for him.
*  Yeah, we talked about it.
*  He fucked you hard, bro.
*  Bro.
*  You have no idea.
*  The times I stay up in bed going,
*  this is how I'm getting Tom.
*  I swear to God.
*  When the guy had the machine shirt on.
*  We sell those, we sell those now
*  and they're fucking going crazy.
*  They're all at my shows, just machine.
*  Oh my God.
*  It's fun to watch our fans, like our fans go back,
*  go back and forth with us and bust balls with us
*  because that's all we do.
*  Yeah.
*  I know it is, it is fun.
*  It's cool that our specials are airing back to back
*  because I think, look, I want his special,
*  I want his special be number one trending on Netflix
*  without a doubt.
*  But don't worry about all that.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
*  because I know that mine,
*  I know that mine will be number two if he's the one.
*  Don't worry about number one and number two.
*  Look at this fucking.
*  So sad.
*  God.
*  It looks like you ate Joey Diaz.
*  Poor guy.
*  That's a real person.
*  Well, that gentleman should take this time
*  to better himself.
*  We can all do better.
*  I can.
*  Sometimes people just go off the rails.
*  That guy went off the rails.
*  His diet, man, diet.
*  Diet's everything.
*  It's everything.
*  But I'm not on the carnivore diet during all this craziness
*  because I'm just eating.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm eating calories because I like the supply chain
*  and the way things are is no way I can justify
*  only eating meat unless I'm only eating my meat,
*  like the elk meat that I eat.
*  And I'm giving a lot.
*  I got a lot for you.
*  Freezer bags for you.
*  Fuck yes.
*  I like to, I love giving it away too, man.
*  I love when people cook it.
*  But other than that, it's like, I need to eat food.
*  Like I'm not concentrating on weird diets
*  or make sure I,
*  I mean I could eat only meat,
*  but I'm not even thinking about that right now.
*  What I'm thinking about right now is just like
*  making sure that I make the right decisions
*  with everything that I do from here out
*  because I think we're in unsung territory.
*  We're in Neverland.
*  How long do you think you can go?
*  I don't know.
*  But here's the thing.
*  This is what I really feel like.
*  We all gotta do this together.
*  Like it's not, the problem is even thinking
*  how long can you last.
*  Part of the problem is even thinking that.
*  Well how long can we last?
*  How long can all of us last?
*  And I think this is, if the power goes out,
*  that's when we're really forced to cooperate.
*  And I don't want the power to go out.
*  I want us to figure it out before that happens.
*  I want us to take this plunge into the apocalypse
*  and baby steps.
*  Here's my question.
*  Would you host a shitty game show if it,
*  hold on, if it meant giving money to people
*  who really need a money in this time?
*  They go, hey Joe, we want you to host,
*  who wants to be a millionaire?
*  Hey but why would I do that that way
*  when I could do it right here?
*  No I'm just saying, I'm just saying.
*  I would never do it anywhere else.
*  No. Yeah.
*  No, I don't want a boss.
*  You can't do it.
*  I can't, nothing you do, you could do
*  if someone was looking over your shoulder
*  telling you what to do.
*  Some corporate guy who just wants to make sure
*  that he can keep paying his mortgage
*  and funding his lifestyle.
*  And you know, he's got a lot of experience
*  producing television shows.
*  He just let me handle this stuff
*  and you do your job and I'll do my job.
*  Bert, we gotta have a talk.
*  You drink too much, you're getting too fat,
*  your belly's out all the time
*  and networks don't like it.
*  The next thing you know,
*  you're some fucking different thing.
*  So how, I just can't do it.
*  You can't be a travel channel.
*  And I'm sure you appreciate the gig
*  that you got at Travel Channel,
*  just like I appreciate the gig I got at Fear Factor.
*  But it's not that it's not a great job.
*  It is a great job.
*  It's just like everything in life.
*  If you have higher expectations of yourself,
*  if you want to express yourself
*  in the most accurate way,
*  the best at being comfortable in your own skin,
*  the only way you can do that is by yourself.
*  You can't have some fucking giant bank rolled machine
*  with hundreds of employees,
*  all with their job riding on whether or not
*  you say the N word, Jesus Bert!
*  They're like fuck!
*  The scream in the TV,
*  hundreds of people in the corporation,
*  fuck, he's drunk!
*  You can't rap lyrics!
*  You can't!
*  You can't say those words!
*  Do you realize how many times
*  if there was a corporation behind Bert Entertainment,
*  they would be like, what the fuck are you doing?
*  Well, that's the irony, isn't it?
*  The irony is look how successful it is
*  without any of that intervention.
*  If you just are yourself,
*  if you just are authentic,
*  and that's what you are, and that's why it works.
*  That's why all podcasts work.
*  They work precisely because
*  there's not a machine behind them.
*  There's not a giant corporation behind them
*  that counts on them.
*  They work because they're independent.
*  That's the only way you get real people.
*  The fucking thing that you get
*  when you make people behave in this weird way,
*  it's not a good thing.
*  You're not getting an accurate representation
*  of what it is to be a person.
*  You can't count.
*  They're just lying to you.
*  That's why politicians in political speeches are so strange.
*  They almost universally act
*  like no one you've ever met.
*  Yeah.
*  When they're doing those speeches,
*  when they're standing in front of a podium,
*  doing that thing with their thumb
*  and doing their best Barack Obama impression,
*  you're literally putting on an act.
*  Yeah.
*  You're putting on an act of no idea who you are.
*  You might be a morning DJ from fucking Cincinnati.
*  Hey, here we come, coming at you with a hit.
*  It's Kid Chris. 19 to six.
*  Here, you're up to early people.
*  You're the people getting it done.
*  All right.
*  I mean, how many of those guys were interchangeable?
*  How many of those guys were interchangeable
*  and you could put them in a strip club.
*  They could be a strip club DJ.
*  They could be a regular DJ.
*  Top 40, there was a voice.
*  Now, when someone's talking in that voice,
*  you have no idea what their real thoughts are.
*  You have no idea.
*  You've got a clue.
*  And that's most of what we got with like the Today Show.
*  Like if Matt Lauer had a podcast
*  and it turned out that he was just a pig.
*  How great would that be?
*  People would be like, I knew that guy was a pig.
*  They'd be like.
*  Oh, that would be so fucking awesome
*  if he leaned into it.
*  Well, if he was just who he actually was, right?
*  Like when you're doing a show like that,
*  like something like the Today Show,
*  one of the reasons why people are so angry
*  is because you've been pretending.
*  You're this like wholesome character all this time.
*  Yeah.
*  You've been pretending.
*  How great would it be if Matt Lauer did his Matt Lauer voice
*  but he was talking about porn he jacked off to?
*  He was like, has anyone seen Tentacle Born
*  and back right now from eight o'clock hour?
*  It's Matt Lauer.
*  We're going up again.
*  Wouldn't it be better if you figured out
*  how to not be that guy that you are on TV
*  and just be who you are when the TV's off?
*  I don't think he knew who he was ever.
*  I think he was the, I think what defined Matt Lauer
*  was being famous.
*  Ooh, he just hit a fucking nerve.
*  It defined a lot of us getting into this business
*  and then I think a lot of it shifted.
*  I think the good ones stuck to what they wanted to go,
*  what they wanted to be and I think a lot of people
*  still just want to be famous.
*  I think it just, it really.
*  Well you know why, one of the reasons why
*  is because it's hard to be.
*  What?
*  It's hard to be famous.
*  So when there's a thing that's out there
*  that's hard to get, like how the fuck do I get that?
*  You ever seen like some people,
*  they're into like exclusive things.
*  You know, you know what I mean?
*  Like you only want one, like if there's only four
*  of these bags in North America, I've gotta get it.
*  You know, girls would get like certain bags.
*  Shoes, guys get shoes.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Travis Scott's.
*  Oh yeah, there's a lot of dudes that are into Jordans,
*  like specific old school Jordans, I'm looking at you.
*  What, right at me, excuse me?
*  Well you're into sneakers, you're a sneaker head, right?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Have you bought any sneakers since the pandemic?
*  About one pair last night.
*  Oh, you are horrible.
*  They're on sale for like 100 bucks.
*  I get it man, I get it, I get it.
*  I get it in some ways.
*  But you were saying, people that are into elite things,
*  correlating it to famous people?
*  Yeah, it's hard to get that bag,
*  and it's hard to get famous.
*  So when you're not famous,
*  it looks like a thing that would be cool to have.
*  Like, oh look, look at this bitch,
*  walking on that red carpet, god damn,
*  look at those shoes.
*  That bitch, she paid $300,000 for that outfit.
*  Oh, look at her chain, oh my god.
*  Look at this, look at that car she got out of.
*  That's a million dollar Bugatti.
*  Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
*  Right?
*  There's something about it, it's hard to get, man.
*  If you're driving around town
*  in a fucking 2001 Honda Accord,
*  and you see someone step out of a Bugatti Veyron
*  that you know costs a million dollars,
*  it's like, holy shit, god damn, look at Gucci Mane.
*  You know, there's certain things that you see
*  that you just get really jealous of,
*  not because you would actually want them,
*  but because they're so unattainable.
*  You know?
*  And people fuck up with that.
*  That's why girls get asses that are too big.
*  Right, they get crazy,
*  and they get this bizarre diaper ass
*  with these little skinny legs,
*  and the two things don't work together.
*  Why?
*  It's because they overshot the mark, right?
*  You painted your house pink.
*  Slow down, okay?
*  You had a bad idea, and you ran with it.
*  I think it looked good from here.
*  Keep going, paint the whole fucking house.
*  I saw some guy who built something on his house
*  that was basically a fuck you to his neighbor.
*  He built a middle finger somehow.
*  I forget what, oh, it was three chimneys.
*  He had three chimneys together like this
*  to build a fuck you to his neighbor
*  because he hated his neighbor.
*  That is such a fucking investment to fuck you.
*  I don't have that kind of money.
*  See if you can find that guy.
*  That is literally fuck you money.
*  I think he got in trouble for it.
*  I think maybe he said something about it or something.
*  Johnny, that's a- Look at those fingers.
*  That's to you.
*  I wrote that because I fucking hate you.
*  Johnny Depp has a big gorilla
*  flipping off his neighbor, I think.
*  A gorilla?
*  Like a huge fucking gorilla.
*  But Johnny Depp has like 18 houses.
*  But he wanted the last one on the block.
*  Oh, and someone to buy it?
*  And the guy wouldn't sell it.
*  Oh, that's right, he owns like a whole block.
*  He owns a whole block.
*  I spent the night at his house one time.
*  Okay, let's slow down.
*  Dude, I have a voicemail from Johnny Depp
*  I haven't deleted.
*  I enjoy talking to him, man.
*  He is fucking awesome.
*  I was drunk on margaritas in Hawaii
*  and Stan Hope put me on the phone with Johnny Depp.
*  And I was like, man, how weird is my life?
*  I'm sitting here talking to Johnny Depp
*  while I'm hammered in a lawn chair in Hawaii.
*  Dude, him and Stan Hope called me one night
*  and I let it go to voicemail.
*  I regret it so much, but I got it on voicemail.
*  But Johnny, I'm a dog.
*  You know, me and Tom are working on a script with Johnny Depp.
*  Are you really?
*  Yeah.
*  Good, good for you.
*  We based it on the podcast and I was like,
*  and then all of a sudden everyone got interested
*  and I was like, fucking, I'll write it.
*  I'll tell you what, I enjoyed talking to him.
*  He's a very wise guy.
*  He's a very, when you talk to him, he's there.
*  He's a dude experiencing something that
*  a small fraction of all the humans who have ever lived
*  have been able to experience.
*  He's experienced fame on the most preposterous
*  and staggering level imaginable.
*  And then he's experienced that
*  it's almost like he owes people something.
*  So he's being held to these standards
*  that none of us would ever want our own lives to be held to.
*  And some weird fucking legal battle between
*  who did who to what to what happened
*  and his recordings and all this chaos.
*  Like, goddamn, like living this out in the open like this.
*  It's all like this, it's sad because you look at him
*  in a different way because of that.
*  Not when you watch the pirates movies.
*  He's brilliant, man.
*  He is so good in those movies.
*  Like so good on so many levels that I've seen them all
*  and we just, the first week of Pandemia,
*  we just watched all of them all over again.
*  Donnie Brasco.
*  Donnie Brasco is fucking amazing.
*  He's so good.
*  In Blow, he's fucking out of this world.
*  He's one of the best actors we've ever had.
*  One of the best American actors that have ever existed,
*  for sure. Without a doubt.
*  And Keith, I'm telling you, as someone who talks
*  to crazy people all the time and talking to him,
*  he's as remarkably put together as you could ever expect
*  a person to be that's as famous as he is.
*  He's a really good guy.
*  Like you talk to him, he's there.
*  He's talking, he's just talking to you.
*  There's no, he's there for you, he's talking.
*  He's a good guy.
*  He's just experiencing something
*  no one is prepared for.
*  He's Johnny Depp.
*  Johnny Depp?
*  He's Johnny Depp.
*  How many Johnny Depp's are there?
*  This one bitch, this one.
*  This one fucking Johnny.
*  This seven billion people on this planet.
*  He's experiencing some weird shit.
*  He's not a bad guy.
*  Dude, Edward Scissorhands.
*  Dude, he's done everything.
*  I mean that guy is-
*  How many movies has he done?
*  How many movies?
*  Let's ballpark it.
*  I'm gonna say 50.
*  Yeah, I think you're right.
*  I'd say 40.
*  Didn't you say before, wasn't that 21 Jump Street?
*  Yes, yeah you're right.
*  21 Jump Street.
*  Was he on Fame?
*  I don't know about that.
*  I don't know about that.
*  I'm gonna live forever.
*  I'm gonna learn how to fly.
*  I'm gonna make it to heaven.
*  Yeah, you got killed in Freddy Krueger.
*  Oh, you got killed in Freddy Krueger?
*  Yeah, yeah, you got your head pulled through a thing, right?
*  Isn't that funny?
*  And he comes back and it's like,
*  let's find a way to have a guy with claws for fingers,
*  but he's a nice guy.
*  What's up with that, Edward Scissorhands?
*  After you got killed by the worst guy
*  with claws for fingers.
*  Dude.
*  There's three guys historically in film
*  with claws for fingers.
*  Wolverine.
*  But his was different
*  because they came out of his knuckles, right?
*  They always confused me
*  because they get broken off, but still came back.
*  But Freddy had them on his fingers.
*  Look at them.
*  God damn.
*  My God, look at that belly.
*  Amazing that he came together so well.
*  That's a fucking teen belly.
*  He was beautiful.
*  He was a beautiful man.
*  Like that's not a normal development.
*  Congratulations to him
*  for making it to be as normal as he is.
*  But he was always with this guy
*  who was one of the worst with the claws for fingers.
*  And then he becomes Edward Scissorhands
*  who's just kind of confused.
*  What a stretch as a character too
*  to play that as this like confused.
*  Hmm.
*  Hmm.
*  Hmm.
*  My nickname in college is Edward Penis Lips.
*  You know another weird thing he did?
*  You know what I really enjoyed?
*  What?
*  The Lone Ranger.
*  The more recent Lone Ranger.
*  I never saw it.
*  He played a Comanche.
*  And there was a, this is like,
*  I kind of got into this when I was reading
*  Empire of the Summer Moon,
*  there's a book about Comanches.
*  I bought it on audiobook.
*  It's amazing.
*  I say reading, I'm lying.
*  I listen to it on audiobook too.
*  But then I started reading things about it online.
*  And one of the things I started reading about it
*  is that Johnny Depp played a Comanche in this movie
*  and actually did some weird shit.
*  Like he had a stuffed bird on his head
*  which apparently some of the Comanches
*  and some different Indian tribes would actually do.
*  Like Crazy Horse even did that.
*  He had a stuffed hawk on his head.
*  But he played this really weird character, man.
*  Like.
*  Tonto.
*  Yeah, he played, but it was a really weird Tonto.
*  It was out there Tonto.
*  It wasn't the.
*  It was like super fucking natural spiritual Tonto
*  who brings the Lone Ranger back from the dead.
*  He brings it back from the dead in that movie.
*  But it's a dope movie.
*  But you're interested in it because of Johnny Depp.
*  It's part, I mean the character's so ridiculous.
*  This Native American guy that brings someone back to dead.
*  But Johnny Depp plays it so hardcore.
*  He plays it so to the bone that it's like,
*  you really believe that this guy
*  brought him back from the dead.
*  That Tonto, the original Tonto.
*  Is bullshit.
*  He's gotten a lot of fucking trouble towards the end
*  of his life for playing Red Face.
*  Oh, did he?
*  Yeah, they called it his Red Face.
*  It's like he was shunned.
*  Wait, wait, wait, is he not really Native American?
*  I think he was.
*  Is that what you're saying?
*  Or is it that he was Native American,
*  but that he played Native American in movies?
*  I'm a little high.
*  I think he's Mexican.
*  Oh no, how dare, well.
*  Well maybe he's like part Mexican, part Native American.
*  Well here's the thing.
*  The fact is that he talked like,
*  oh, me so horny.
*  Not me so horny.
*  Fuck, that's me being.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Here's the chimney thing.
*  Yeah, there it is.
*  It was a cactus on the side of a house.
*  That's it.
*  It's his chimney.
*  Oh nice.
*  Did you find Johnny Depp's?
*  The outside of it is cactus?
*  No, that's a cactus.
*  It was like painted to look like a cactus.
*  Oh, you said it was in a chimney.
*  Correct, yeah.
*  Oh, so it's just cactus?
*  It's found to be true though.
*  Like he did this to piss off the councilman neighbors.
*  Yeah, he didn't like them.
*  But I'd be like, oh my god, this guy's hilarious.
*  Imagine the amount of effort he put into.
*  Look at that right in his backyard.
*  So ridiculous.
*  And that's a councilman, that's why.
*  And so that's why he brought it up.
*  That's his try-sand effect.
*  Utah, yeah.
*  More people are gonna pay attention.
*  That guy hates you.
*  See if you can find Johnny Depp's gorilla.
*  I swear. He has a gorilla?
*  A gorilla, I think I saw it.
*  He owns a gorilla?
*  No, no, no, like a big inflatable gorilla
*  flipping off his neighbor.
*  I think I touched it.
*  Damn, how much do you drink?
*  There it is. There it is, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  What does it say?
*  Johnny Depp and his home gorilla in congratulatory for.
*  So he has this sculpture in his yard.
*  Right into his neighbor's backyard
*  because he wanted to buy the house
*  and they wouldn't sell it.
*  Wow, he needs to let that go.
*  I love his hats.
*  Be a good neighbor.
*  I love his hats.
*  He's a guy who can pull off hats.
*  Great jawline.
*  It's almost like he's apologizing
*  for being so good looking, so he dresses goofy.
*  I would love to get to that place
*  where I started wearing fucking outrageous outfits.
*  You could do that.
*  Just lose a lot of weight, like from here on out.
*  What if you come out of this better than anybody?
*  Like, maybe that's one thing we should do.
*  What's that?
*  Maybe all of us should get together
*  and have a quarantine challenge.
*  Maybe we should get together.
*  Bro.
*  Yeah, while this is all going down.
*  It's like you're playing with my balls
*  under the table with your foot.
*  Come on, man.
*  What'd you say?
*  Open-ended.
*  Open-ended.
*  What, are you scared of an end?
*  No, I'm not scared of a finish line.
*  I'm so into this.
*  Yes.
*  You know this is how my brain works.
*  I'm thinking, like for all of us,
*  like what better way to turn this into a positive
*  than to like just make some sort of healthy competition
*  out of it, a la Sober October.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I love it.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I gave myself a break tonight, today with Booze.
*  I brought weed just in case.
*  Listen, we're doing a podcast, Berth.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm sure you got a big comedy special out on Netflix.
*  We gotta have fun.
*  It was a success.
*  We did exactly what I wanted us to do.
*  This is perfect, dude.
*  Perfect.
*  Everything, if you had told me in college,
*  hey man, you know that guy on news radio?
*  You're gonna party with that dude.
*  I'd be like, fucking, do I have to fuck him?
*  And he's like, not Andy Dick, not Andy Dick.
*  It's Joe Rogan.
*  Hilarious.
*  I mean, this is like, my life's worked out pretty good.
*  Oh, all of our lives have, man.
*  You know, for me to be me is one of the weirdest things to,
*  you know, that I could wrap my head around.
*  I have a hard time wrapping my head around it all the time.
*  And do you, like, and I, not to draw back to this,
*  but like, it brings back perspective of like,
*  honestly, just like how fucking lucky we are.
*  I think immediately I go, wait, staff at the fucking store.
*  You gotta help, man.
*  Like, I'm like overwhelmed by that.
*  We need to do like a comic relief or something big
*  on our platforms that we can do where we can raise money.
*  We could definitely do that.
*  We should definitely donate as well.
*  You know, I'm donating.
*  I'm waiting for them to set something up,
*  but I think we should continue to donate.
*  And I think that particularly with the people that we,
*  you know, we have a system of all of us.
*  There's the wait staff, there's the management staff,
*  there's the kitchen staff in all these places,
*  and they've all taken a big hit.
*  And it's far worse for them
*  than it would be for the same amount of money for us.
*  So I think we could pick up some slack.
*  I think we all do that together,
*  and we figured out like a good system within all the clubs.
*  We could keep everybody okay.
*  I think that's doable.
*  I don't think that's bad.
*  I think that would be great for all of us.
*  I think that would be great for all of us as a community.
*  You know, we'll realize, like, hey, we can all chip in.
*  We can help each other.
*  You know, I have a lot of meat that I've been giving out
*  a lot of my comedian friends.
*  I'll be taking some of that.
*  Yeah, man, it's the best.
*  That makes me real happy to be able to do that.
*  You know the girls when I got into Bow and Arrows.
*  Good, beautiful.
*  Do you have a target in your yard?
*  In the new house, yeah.
*  Beautiful.
*  We're not gonna be able to rebuild the new house anymore,
*  but we can get a great backyard.
*  You can just go there and use the backyard
*  from your old house.
*  We use the backyard for the new house,
*  and we live in the old house.
*  You know, it's not gonna last forever,
*  and this is gonna be a, I hope not at least,
*  this is gonna be an opportunity.
*  It's gonna be, this is the best thing you could say.
*  It's an opportunity for us.
*  Like, no one can say it's going to be this
*  or it's going to be that.
*  And I've heard a lot of people that try to either
*  comfort people or they try to push their point across
*  almost as if they can win this argument,
*  then it's more likely to be true and it's comforting
*  in some sort of a weird way.
*  But no one knows.
*  No one knew that it would go to,
*  no one knew four months ago, no one knew four months ago
*  that four months later we'd be here.
*  No one, zero people knew that.
*  So if we didn't know that,
*  like we don't know what's coming in four months from now.
*  It can compound.
*  This is still right now, even in quarantine,
*  the best time that humans have ever had, ever on Earth.
*  Obviously not for the people that are the victims
*  of the disease.
*  But we can be okay coming out of this.
*  And it could be a wake-up call for people
*  to stop living these lives that are unsatisfying
*  and figure out a way where we stop chasing bullshit.
*  It's my whole fucking life.
*  Stop chasing bullshit.
*  It's amazing, man.
*  Just perspective.
*  And I think, I don't know,
*  if I walk away with any fucking perspective,
*  then I'm a better man, I think.
*  Because man, I was on the tour every week,
*  every week, fucking burn it.
*  I remember, I keep going back to this conversation
*  with Allie Wong.
*  She's like, you're touring like it's going away.
*  And I was like, yeah, right?
*  That's such an Allie Wong way of putting it.
*  She pulled me aside in the hallway in front of the ROR
*  and goes, hey, you're touring a lot, huh?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  You're touring like it's going away.
*  That's hilarious.
*  I go, yeah.
*  Ultimately, you were right.
*  You should call her up.
*  See?
*  This is what I was talking about, lady.
*  Fucking, fucking did go away.
*  Where the fuck?
*  It's gone, Allie.
*  It might be gone for six goddamn months.
*  We have no idea.
*  I mean, I don't know.
*  I mean, they might have,
*  I mean, I literally know nothing
*  about when the window of a vaccine is.
*  I've heard elaborate numbers from 12 months to 18 months.
*  I do not know.
*  I've heard all sorts of different stuff
*  about promising medications.
*  This is within the first couple months.
*  Do not know.
*  There might be something they come up with
*  in a month or two.
*  Who knows?
*  Do not know.
*  The cool thing about the news cycle is waiting for hope.
*  Like waiting for, like to get online and get excited
*  and go, oh, breakthrough today.
*  But that's where like, you goddamn, man,
*  once the shit goes sideways,
*  that's when you need a really good leader.
*  You really do.
*  You need someone who is honest.
*  When all the bullshit goes away,
*  when everyone's worried about an invisible monster
*  that wants to kill your grandma,
*  wants to sneak into her lungs and shut them down,
*  when people are worried about that kind of shit,
*  you really want someone who has their character in order.
*  You know, and this is one of the things
*  that we should really take deeply into consideration
*  when we talk about someone being a president
*  or any politician, anyone who's a leader.
*  How are they gonna react when shit goes sideways?
*  How are they gonna keep it together?
*  Are they gonna make you feel good about this,
*  the reality of this world?
*  Or are they gonna just freak you out with bullshit?
*  Are they gonna make you feel less connected to it
*  because you know that their words are not honest
*  and that they're not accurate, they're not heartfelt?
*  It's just spitting out bullshit and you're like,
*  fuck, this goddamn car's going sideways down the highway
*  and no one knows what to do.
*  That's why we need to vote for The Rock.
*  I'd vote for him.
*  I'd vote for him, San Andreas.
*  I would get behind him 100%.
*  I would.
*  I'm all in for The Rock.
*  As good as he is about everything else in life,
*  he'd be great a president.
*  But no one should be president.
*  Yeah, but The Rock could.
*  What you need is a figurehead to let you know
*  how today's gonna work out.
*  Yeah, as both persons.
*  Those inspirational speeches mean a lot.
*  Yeah.
*  And The Rock could give us every morning
*  from the Iron Jungle, just like guys, big day legs.
*  Hey listen, the economy's doing good.
*  Yeah, but right now everyone loves The Rock.
*  If he became president, 40% of the people
*  would immediately start hating him.
*  No.
*  Yes, 100%.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  100%, bro.
*  Unify the country.
*  Impossible, can't be done.
*  We love it.
*  Oh, they'd start digging into his past?
*  Yes.
*  Oh, I'd love to know what's in The Rock's past.
*  And being mean, just be mean.
*  Talk about how dumb he is.
*  He doesn't read, he doesn't do this.
*  Yeah, he's got biceps.
*  Say a bunch of mean shit to him.
*  And then attribute to his decisions
*  what the economy's doing and what this is doing and that.
*  If he's not like that, why would he do that?
*  Why don't you just keep doing Jumanji movies
*  and everybody fucking loves him?
*  Jumanji movies are so fucking good.
*  So good, so good.
*  Aquafina in the latest one.
*  Aquafina was the fucking home run.
*  Yeah.
*  When she came out.
*  She's hilarious.
*  Dude, I texted her like on.
*  Oh, you know her that well?
*  Well, I kinda, yeah.
*  Oh, someone's name dropping.
*  No, no, no.
*  Most highly name dropping.
*  I called her out on like Instagram going,
*  hey, this is fucking amazing.
*  Aquafina's amazing.
*  My daughter's love Aquafina, love her.
*  She replied, she was like, hey, thank you.
*  Dude, when she played Danny DeVito.
*  Amazing!
*  Stole the fucking, like I'm sitting here
*  watching Kevin Hart doing a Jewish accent going,
*  what the fuck's going on?
*  When Aquafina came in, I went, I got chill bumps.
*  She even had like a Danny DeVito slump
*  that she was walking around with.
*  She was aw, she stole the movie at that point.
*  But dude, the Rock, when the Rock goes off brand
*  and he goes, listen, you weak ass bitches.
*  Listen, motherfuckers, I get my heart skips a beat.
*  When he pours a tequila and you're like,
*  wait, it's the middle of the afternoon.
*  This is why I love The Rock!
*  Yeah, no, when he was playing Danny DeVito,
*  it was hilarious.
*  Dude, they were, oh, that's right,
*  Kevin Hart was playing a 21, or a lethal weapon.
*  Danny Glover.
*  Danny Glover, yes.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Kevin Hart's funny as fuck.
*  And The Rock was playing Danny DeVito.
*  It's so ridiculous.
*  Those Jumanji movies do not let down.
*  The second one was just as good,
*  if not better than the first one.
*  The first one, Ice came out of the movie theater
*  and I said, girls, this is the best movie
*  you'll ever see in your entire life.
*  I'm 47 years old, you'll never see a better one than this.
*  It was a perfect movie that you could take your family to.
*  And the second one was the same way.
*  It's a great movie if you're looking for a family movie
*  to watch on lockdown right now
*  and you haven't seen Jumanji 2, it's excellent.
*  It's really good.
*  It's fun, man.
*  Kevin Hart is a talent, he's a special talent.
*  So.
*  And that redhead who throws kicks, that chick is badass.
*  And Jack Black's back.
*  It's fun to watch him be not something other than Jack,
*  like what he's good at.
*  The dude who plays the football player, Fridge,
*  he's awesome.
*  Fridge, yeah.
*  Yeah, the Instagram influencer, she's awesome.
*  It's a great cast, man.
*  It's an amazing fucking movie.
*  It's funny to know Kevin Hart,
*  like my daughter the other day said something
*  about Kevin Hart and I said something,
*  she goes, well, you act like you know him.
*  I go, yeah, yeah, I know Kevin.
*  She goes, you don't know Kevin Hart.
*  I go, the fuck, I don't know Kevin Hart.
*  I know every, like, what are you talking about?
*  Do you know Kevin Hart's brother
*  is like a legit professional pool player?
*  Kevin Hart's brother is in the front row
*  at the DC Improv one night.
*  And I'm making jokes, I'm fucking some fucking horrible joke.
*  And he's laughing hard and I say, you look like fucking,
*  you look like a dirty ass Kevin Hart or something.
*  And he goes, I'm his brother.
*  And I went, sure you are.
*  And he goes, no, I'm his fucking brother.
*  I go, no, you're not.
*  And he goes, I'm his fucking brother.
*  He pulls out his idea, I go, oh fuck, he's his brother.
*  I told him all the Kevin Hart stories I had.
*  He's a legit professional pool player.
*  For real?
*  Yeah, like really good.
*  Yeah, I watched videos of him play.
*  And I was like, oh, this guy plays like a pro.
*  Like he plays like, if you're watching
*  any real professional play, if you ever catch
*  ESPN nine ball events, like Johnny Archer
*  playing Earl Strickland or Shane Van Boney,
*  he plays like those guys, like legitimately.
*  Really?
*  Plays like a pro.
*  Yeah, I watched him play, I was like,
*  oh, he's like a real pro, wow.
*  Did you watch that documentary,
*  Don't Fuck This Up with Kevin Hart?
*  No, I didn't.
*  He had like legit back surgery.
*  Yeah.
*  Like cut down his spine.
*  What did they have to do?
*  I don't know, I drove by the fucking accident
*  driving to work one day.
*  What is this?
*  Yeah, that's his brother.
*  Yeah, his brother plays really good.
*  Like really good.
*  Like as a person who's been playing pool,
*  I've been playing pool for almost 30 years.
*  When I watch him play, I was like,
*  I'm like, oh, okay, he's like,
*  like watch this, he's doing this drill.
*  Watch, he's going across and he's making room
*  for the ball to the side.
*  He's legit good.
*  Oh yeah, no, like a real professional pool player.
*  And he has these videos that he'll put out
*  of instructional drills like he's doing right here.
*  This is a positional drill that he's doing
*  to try to get in line for each ball.
*  Well, he fucked up here, he's got a bad wrist.
*  Oh, he goes the other way.
*  Once you pass the side pocket, then you go the other way.
*  Oh, that's interesting.
*  So the whole idea is just drilling,
*  cutting balls in off the rail.
*  It's very difficult to do.
*  And he's doing it like a guy like Mika Eminen
*  or something like that, like a real professional.
*  He's really good.
*  Like I watched him play and I said,
*  Kevin, a text message, I go, dude,
*  your brother is fucking legit.
*  Like he's a real pool player.
*  His brother is legit, holy shit.
*  Yeah, dude, he's really good.
*  Like he's a guy that looks like he could win.
*  Like he's playing Darren Appleton.
*  Darren Appleton is like, he was a top snooker player
*  in England and then came, or played America,
*  actually I think he played English eight ball too.
*  But then he came over to America
*  and started dominating in pool.
*  And so that guy's playing guys like that.
*  So Kevin Hart's brother's playing like top notch
*  world beaters in pool tournaments.
*  Whatever their dad did is good.
*  Created two fucking monsters.
*  Oh, their mom.
*  Oh, I think they both, you like how I.
*  Sex is piece of shit.
*  It's just the dad's come that did everything.
*  No, no, no, it's the dad ignoring them
*  all through their childhood.
*  Isn't it funny that men always think that,
*  whatever his dad.
*  It's daddy issues.
*  It's all daddy issues.
*  Good genes.
*  His dad must have been a fucking savage.
*  But I'll do that though.
*  It's all dad issues.
*  That's why you succeed.
*  It's because you want to please your dad, I think.
*  I don't know.
*  That's, that kid could be, that could be.
*  It's not, see that whenever we try to make
*  your motivation for anything or your reason for success
*  a binary thing, a one or a zero, it's like,
*  there's a lot of factors.
*  A lot of factors.
*  Heartbreak could lead people to success.
*  Some guys get their heart broken.
*  That's me.
*  And they just go, oh, okay, I'm gonna show you.
*  Time to teach everyone who didn't wanna fuck me
*  that they wanted to fuck me and they didn't know it.
*  Time to teach someone who says that you're a loser.
*  Someone who used to love and they chastise you
*  and say you're a loser and you're like, oh, you think so?
*  Okay, well, I'll check in with you in about six years
*  and we'll see how this works out.
*  There's girls I wanna give trophies to.
*  Trophies?
*  And go like, hey man, you did it.
*  You told me I wasn't gonna make it
*  and I wanna thank you so much.
*  So people can do that to people in those emotional moments.
*  I can say the most mean shit
*  because they know that it's gonna hurt.
*  Sometimes it works.
*  That's the thing about it, it's just like fat shaming.
*  Sometimes it works.
*  I didn't even know I was fat until Tom told me I was fat.
*  I thought I was good looking.
*  I swear to God, I look at those videos, I go.
*  It's hilarious.
*  Ugh.
*  Like I'm fine.
*  Something's so picky. I thought I was perfect.
*  I was like, I don't know what you're talking about.
*  I grew a beard, I can't see it anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  It's funny, like fat shaming feels bad.
*  But sometimes you have to feel bad to make changes.
*  But so sometimes fat shaming could be like
*  the most valuable thing anybody could ever do to you.
*  But you don't want anybody to do it to anybody.
*  I don't want anybody to do it to me.
*  I don't wanna do it to anybody.
*  However, it's very valuable.
*  If it happens, if it happens, it helps.
*  It's like a gold that can make you rich
*  but it could also burn your hand.
*  Should you pick it up?
*  I think you probably should, you'll heal from the burn.
*  I listened to this app when I run, it's called Aptiv
*  and there's this guy Akeem and he'll sometimes,
*  his coaching, we were talking about coaching.
*  My wife losing weight, she got a trainer.
*  Sometimes coaching can get to the heart of what you need.
*  And there's a part of this fucking run I do with Akeem
*  where he goes, you know all those people
*  that talk shit about you?
*  And I go, Tommy.
*  Tell them they're wrong.
*  I go, Tommy.
*  He goes, been pushing this next one.
*  I always crank it up a little higher.
*  I go, do you have any regret for underperforming
*  in the sober October?
*  Do you have any regret?
*  Yes, horrifically, yes.
*  Why didn't you get after it earlier?
*  I couldn't, I never could.
*  I never could.
*  It fucked in my head, my OCD fucked up.
*  Oh, every time.
*  Every time it fucked my head up.
*  But there was so much trash talking.
*  Everybody wanted to beat you.
*  Everybody just wanted to get ahead of you.
*  I got so overwhelmed by our sober Octobers,
*  like so overwhelmed.
*  That it would like.
*  The first one was easy.
*  At one point, Tom talked me off a ledge
*  and he goes, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
*  Remember, you're just a comedian.
*  I went, for real?
*  He goes, you are not an athlete.
*  You're just Burt and you're a comedian.
*  Don't lose sight of that.
*  Cause I would get like, I would get over fucking whelmed.
*  Every first sober October, easy peasy.
*  We all did 15 sober, whatchamacallit, hot yogos.
*  Easy.
*  Easy.
*  What happened was, the next one I rolled into,
*  like no big thing.
*  And you did a hike with Marshall
*  and I did a hike without a dog
*  and I pretended I lost my dog.
*  But the whole joke was that I lost my dog,
*  but I was like, Joe, you do one mile, I do two.
*  You do two miles, I do four.
*  And then I was like, I'm here with my dog Priscilla.
*  Priscilla, Priscilla.
*  And then I pretended to lose Priscilla, right?
*  It was a joke.
*  And that's when I watched the fire igniting you
*  that I had not seen since high school.
*  And I was like, oh fuck.
*  And then I started getting like overwhelmed.
*  And I wasn't sleeping.
*  I was like getting up to run.
*  And my sciatica was hurting.
*  It was so fucking aggressive
*  that all the fun that I rolled into
*  when Tom and I did the weight loss challenge
*  and I just drank the whole time and lost like 40 pounds,
*  all that fun got so lost in the Sober October,
*  I was like, I gotta fucking win, man.
*  I gotta fucking win.
*  Yeah, I haven't experienced anything like that
*  since I was about 20 to 21 years old.
*  That was the last time I experienced that kind of
*  obsession with something physical.
*  It leaked into the marathon.
*  We were in here talking about the marathon.
*  And then all of a sudden, look, me and Tom
*  and Ari were at the NCAA championship game for the payoff.
*  I was like, I entered the LA marathon.
*  And Tom goes, why?
*  I said, I'm gonna run a marathon.
*  And he goes, you don't have to.
*  And I went, I already decided.
*  You don't have to, that's such a Tom thing to say.
*  He's like, yeah, you don't have to.
*  I don't know why you're doing it.
*  I said, because you guys said I couldn't.
*  And he goes, no, no, we don't care.
*  And I was like, I'm gonna do it.
*  I was lost.
*  I ran the LA marathon.
*  I remember, but there's an attachment I have
*  to whatever that focus is, where I go,
*  I do it for specials where I get so dialed in,
*  it's really unhealthy.
*  But it's not, because that's how you create something great.
*  When you do a special, I know how much energy
*  you put into it and how much you think about it.
*  You have to, you have to get obsessed.
*  Obsessed.
*  Obsessed because I go, with this special,
*  I was like, I don't wanna be the guy
*  that does the same special three times in a row.
*  I wanna grow.
*  I wanna create, I wanna show,
*  my big fucking white whale was that Starbucks bit I do
*  where I go, did you see that one?
*  I got you mentioning your name.
*  And I go, that's, for me, and this is way overthinking it,
*  that guy walks into a bar.
*  It's like, I was in homage to an old school joke,
*  but present in mind the way I tell stories.
*  And it defines me laughing at jokes,
*  and it calls my friends,
*  it was like my favorite joke I've ever written.
*  I love, but that obsession's not healthy, man.
*  It's not healthy to be a regular dude.
*  It's not that it's not healthy.
*  I don't agree with that.
*  I just think it has to be balanced out.
*  But I think it is healthy because you know that,
*  like that bit, when it came out, it was fucking killer.
*  And it needed that, you know,
*  it needed all that obsession for it to grow.
*  That's how a bit, that's a great bit.
*  We have a bit that you really enjoy.
*  It really cracks when you get up there
*  and people really laugh hard.
*  It's hard to make one of those.
*  And I think there's, it's worth it for you
*  giving into that obsession so that the audience
*  can experience like a really well-crafted,
*  really rocking joke.
*  It's fun.
*  There's no other way to make them, man.
*  I can't, I don't know another way.
*  Dude, I don't think there is another way.
*  Every special that I've ever put out,
*  I've always fucking hated immediately afterwards.
*  No. Didn't know what I was doing
*  while I was doing it.
*  I just can't believe people like this crap.
*  When you edit it, man, you sit and listen to it
*  for hours and hours and hours.
*  You fucking hate it by the time it's over.
*  Josh Potter said to, or Nadav,
*  for Two Bears One Cave, our guy, goes,
*  hey man, I loved your special.
*  And I went, I went, really?
*  He goes, he goes, it's brilliant, man.
*  Your gun bit's awesome.
*  And Josh Potter's sitting with me,
*  he's like, your gun bit's awesome.
*  And I'm looking at Tom, I go,
*  Tom, did you think it was awesome?
*  He goes, we all thought it was awesome.
*  And I was like, for reals?
*  Like I, dude.
*  I know you hate it because you see it too much.
*  God.
*  You gotta realize, if you're seeing a special
*  over and over and over and over and over again,
*  all the surprise is gone, right?
*  So you're just analyzing the mechanics of the bits
*  and maybe I did this one's better in the first show
*  but that one's better in the second show.
*  But you're not experiencing what it's like
*  to not know where you're going.
*  The audience is the only one that gets to experience that.
*  So it's so hard for you to get a,
*  and then the one thing I always say,
*  I'm gonna say it again, because it's just true.
*  I know what you're gonna say, go ahead.
*  You're in the audience watching a special,
*  you're getting 100%.
*  If you're at home watching on Netflix, you might get 70.
*  I don't think you really get 70, you probably get 60.
*  Probably get 60% of what it's like to be in the room.
*  Because as a human, there's something about laughing
*  in a room full of 2,000 other people that are laughing
*  and you're a little buzzed, you're like, baah!
*  Dude.
*  You get on stage and you take your shirt off
*  and they go, yeah!
*  And everybody's into it.
*  It's like this, it's a big part of what stand-up comedy is.
*  Is like doing it, so you're almost just getting
*  a reference point.
*  It's like Google Maps when you're watching it in real life.
*  Or watching it on YouTube or something like that.
*  Or watching it on Netflix.
*  It's like Google Maps.
*  Because it's not like being there.
*  Like if you stood there on the ground,
*  you're like, oh, this looks different on the ground.
*  Like you hiked in, you're like,
*  oh, okay, the mountain's this way.
*  And I was looking at Google Maps.
*  I couldn't tell because I'm looking down on this thing.
*  That's what it's like when you're in the audience
*  of a comedy club is like being there
*  versus watching it on Netflix, which is like Google Maps.
*  It's way better than not being there.
*  Google Maps is dope.
*  You can go visit the fucking rainforest.
*  Just go look in there, spread it out, move it around.
*  Look at that.
*  Get pictures of what the fucking ground looks like
*  from the sky.
*  But it's not gonna be like going to the Amazon.
*  One of the obsessions I had with my last,
*  not this one, the last one,
*  was I had one experience with Tig.
*  Tig Notaro?
*  Tig Notaro, man, taught me one of the biggest lessons
*  I ever learned in standup.
*  We did premium blend together.
*  And she went first and she,
*  for the first time in her life probably sucked a dick.
*  Like literally sucked a dick.
*  Was so bad on stage.
*  And she'll admit it, she'll admit it.
*  And I went up after and I murdered.
*  I, 1,300 people, I murdered.
*  I watched the taping, Tig destroyed.
*  Because her jokes were amazing.
*  She didn't play for the room,
*  she played for the people in the audience,
*  the people on television.
*  And I went, that's so interesting.
*  Here I am like raising my voice,
*  like going like, what's up UCLA?
*  Like everyone at home is like, dude, dial your shit down.
*  I learned so much after watching Tig that I went,
*  don't play for the people in the room.
*  Play for them in the room, but make sure, be cognizant
*  that you're making this for a television show.
*  I don't know whether she meant to do that on purpose or not,
*  but man, I watched her set on that premium blend
*  and she murdered and I bombed on TV.
*  And I was like, yeah, don't go in and go,
*  what's up Jacksonville?
*  Wait a minute, so you murdered in person,
*  but bombed on TV?
*  Bombed on TV because my energy was so high.
*  But if you murdered in person?
*  Because it was 1,300 people.
*  Who convinced you that you bombed on TV?
*  Did you convince yourself?
*  You can pull up that premium blend.
*  But you did well in front of the crowd.
*  But I was playing louder on the mic.
*  Did you smoke too much weed today?
*  I might have.
*  You're making no sense.
*  I just had a good Tig Notaro sucking dick joke.
*  I was trying to slide it.
*  I understand what you just did there.
*  Congratulations on that.
*  Thank you.
*  Especially in this era.
*  I wonder if people are gonna get less concerned
*  about politically correct things.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Do you think that, like, Jamie and I were talking about
*  gender pronouns, it's probably not really this.
*  Call me whatever you want to call me
*  as long as you have toilet paper.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's just be nice to each other and fucking relax.
*  I think that's part of what we're going through
*  as a culture, the outrage culture,
*  is because there wasn't anything real to fight against.
*  No.
*  There was nothing real that was a real problem
*  as opposed to every other single era of humanity.
*  Which is like filled with strife and trouble.
*  This is the only one.
*  Look at guns.
*  The gun control shit, that's not a conversation anymore.
*  It's out the window.
*  I know so many left-wing people lining up to buy guns now.
*  Oh, everyone.
*  Including my friend's wives who used to get mad.
*  If they even heard talk about guns, they would get mad.
*  And now they're asking the husband to go get a gun.
*  No bullshit.
*  No bullshit.
*  Asking me about what kind of gun, what do you have,
*  where do you keep it, that kind of shit.
*  Like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
*  Dude, so that's off the board.
*  Yeah, that's off the board.
*  People, listen, once refrigeration goes,
*  that's when you see what's up.
*  Once power goes, that's when you see what's up.
*  We live in a ridiculous way.
*  We live in a way that's only sustainable
*  if the super fragile system stays in place.
*  I mean, it's robust in terms that it handles
*  millions and millions of people.
*  But it's fragile in the sense that
*  one gigantic solar flare could wipe it out.
*  One earthquake could wipe it out.
*  Power surges.
*  Something crazy that, you know,
*  an asteroid shower that hits Earth wipes out everything.
*  Yeah.
*  We're not sustainable.
*  We're only sustainable under certain conditions.
*  A big part of those conditions is the power grid.
*  I wonder how much this is gonna change
*  the way people behave, meaning
*  I hope it does.
*  gardens, chickens, rabbits.
*  We should have community, little patch of garden
*  in every community.
*  You know, just have an area.
*  You know, you have five houses, have one empty lot.
*  For five houses.
*  That would be brilliant.
*  Brilliant, right?
*  One empty lot the size of a lot
*  that a house would be built on.
*  And then you just grow vegetables and have chickens.
*  Even if you're a vegetarian, folks, listen to me.
*  Chickens, you don't hurt them when you eat their eggs.
*  There's no hurting them at all.
*  If you're feeding them well,
*  their eggs will be nutritious.
*  They're real easy.
*  As long as there's no coyotes around.
*  That's the number one problem that I have
*  is coyotes would target the chickens.
*  But other than that, you just let them go out in the yard,
*  man, they find bugs to eat and worms to eat,
*  and then their eggs are delicious
*  and you're not hurting them.
*  And they prefer being in the chicken coop.
*  They go in the chicken coop for safety.
*  You shut them in there, you let them out in the morning.
*  They were like my little friends.
*  It's the best thing your wife ever did in my entire life
*  affecting me was convince my wife to get chickens.
*  Dude, because you get healthy food almost every day.
*  You get several eggs.
*  Like we had at a high point, we had 22 chickens.
*  And we would get like 10 eggs a day.
*  Every day, 10 eggs.
*  And I'd eat six eggs for breakfast.
*  Really good, delicious, just fucking nutrient rich,
*  protein rich, and no one gets hurt.
*  I got double yolks one time.
*  My favorite in the world.
*  The problem is if you want milward chickens,
*  then you're gonna have to have roosters.
*  Roosters are cock suckers.
*  They're assholes.
*  They scream in the morning.
*  They wake up everybody.
*  They piss off your neighbors.
*  Everybody wants them dead.
*  Dude, a chicken laying an egg is loud.
*  I had David Tell in my man cave doing a podcast with Tommy,
*  and a chicken started letting.
*  Bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk,
*  bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk.
*  It's really aggressive.
*  And the tells goes, where the fuck are we?
*  A guanabalo village?
*  Oh!
*  I wanna hear his new set of thoughts.
*  Imagine if humans did something like that
*  where every day a fucking egg came out of your twat.
*  We could eat it.
*  Psh.
*  It would be so ridiculous.
*  Cause chickens can eat their own eggs too.
*  And you have to keep them from finding that out.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  If they find out, they'll start pecking eggs.
*  Especially eggs that aren't theirs.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, so if an egg falls and breaks,
*  you gotta be really careful
*  that the chickens don't find out about it.
*  Cause once they find, look,
*  they're little dinosaurs, bro.
*  Little dinosaurs.
*  You know, one of them tried to bite my youngest daughter
*  when she was, she was very young at the time.
*  I wanna say she was somewhere in the neighborhood
*  of four or five when this chicken started pecking her toes.
*  And my wife's like, oh, she probably thinks
*  her toe is a worm.
*  I go, no, she's trying to eat the baby.
*  That fucking cunt chicken is trying to eat the baby.
*  She doesn't think she's a worm.
*  How come she doesn't think I'm a fucking worm?
*  She just thinks that that thing is slow enough
*  and young enough, she might be able to eat it.
*  Cause chickens can tell when things are vulnerable.
*  Cause they're little predators, man.
*  You've seen chickens with mice before, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Have you ever seen them in real life with a mouse?
*  No, not in real life.
*  I've seen it several times.
*  Rats run amok in our chicken coop.
*  Yeah, well those chickens will turn on that rat
*  if they can catch them.
*  They can catch that motherfucker in the corner,
*  they'll tear him apart.
*  Yeah, I've been thinking about hunting rats
*  with my pellet gun.
*  Rats, anywhere you live in California
*  where there's hills and people, you're infested.
*  And fruit trees.
*  We have an orange tree in our backyard
*  and it's fucking infested.
*  They were just garbage cans on a regular basis.
*  Garbage cans outside.
*  And ways inside, the thing you find away inside your house,
*  I used to live in Encino.
*  I had a place that I was renting
*  that was totally infested with rats.
*  It was foul, man.
*  They were big rats.
*  Here running around in the fucking,
*  inside the walls.
*  Also, I set a trap once and I went out,
*  I saw there was a rat and I was lazy,
*  so I went back to bed.
*  I'm like, I'll clean it in the morning.
*  I went out there in the morning, they had eaten it.
*  The rats had eaten it?
*  The rats had eaten the other rat.
*  It was a big rat too, dude.
*  A big fat boy, like a pregnant squirrel.
*  Like a fat rat, a big rat.
*  And this rat trap killed him.
*  I was like, holy shit, but I was tired.
*  I was like, I gotta be at the set in the morning.
*  So I left that rat in there.
*  I went out in the morning to go look at it.
*  I was like, oh shit.
*  I had a whole wild menagerie in my house at that time.
*  I think about it.
*  I got rats eating each other in the garage.
*  I got a feral cat that I'm locked in a room with.
*  I got two pit bulls.
*  I got a fluff ball cat.
*  I had it surrounded with weird animals.
*  I think about it, I remember hearing you talk
*  about those times where you'd come home
*  and the dogs would have fought over something.
*  It happened twice.
*  Came home and the dogs tore each other apart.
*  It was horrible.
*  What drew you to those?
*  It was one female that I got from the pound
*  that I got because of Brian Callen.
*  Brian Callen called me up and he's like,
*  dude, you gotta see this little puppy pit bull.
*  She's so adorable.
*  You're gonna see her.
*  You're gonna fall in love with her.
*  You gotta see her.
*  He was at the LA Animal Shelter.
*  I'm like, god damn it.
*  I'm like, okay.
*  So I went down there.
*  I was a moron.
*  So I went down there and I saw this little thing
*  and she was trapped in.
*  The LA Animal Shelter, at least at the time,
*  the place that I'm thinking about,
*  I'm not sure if I'm getting the name right,
*  was a no-kill shelter.
*  So they operated on donations.
*  They can keep an animal alive for a long time.
*  So she had been inside this place for several months
*  and she was really kind of weirded out
*  by being in jail for that long
*  and not getting a lot of human contact
*  and so when I took her home
*  and I would pet her and love her,
*  she would get really aggressive with the other dogs
*  to keep them away from her
*  because she didn't get enough love when she was younger.
*  So now that she's finally getting love,
*  love was so valuable that other dogs,
*  she didn't think of other dogs as being her friends.
*  She thought of them as love thieves.
*  So they would come near her.
*  Yeah, so there was a couple different instances that happened
*  and one of them happened
*  when the pool guy had apparently come over
*  and then the pool guy was petting both dogs
*  and one dog attacked, my female, my little female,
*  attacked the bigger male
*  to keep him away from getting petted.
*  She didn't want him to be petted.
*  She wanted all the pets.
*  Yeah, it was just a matter.
*  Look, and I had a bit about it that I did for a little bit,
*  but it's basically I had a prison dog.
*  I mean, I brought home a prison dog.
*  This dog had been a prisoner
*  for a giant chunk of its little life
*  and by the time I got it home,
*  it just was not tolerating any bullshit
*  and it had this attitude no matter what.
*  You couldn't, it loved people.
*  No fear at all about it being mean to people,
*  but around other dogs, it was very dangerous, very dangerous.
*  You never knew.
*  It thought of other dogs as being thieves.
*  It thought of love as being a very valuable commodity
*  and other dogs as stealing her love.
*  God, man, that's crazy.
*  Yeah, because my other two dogs
*  were not like that at all, at all.
*  One of them, I had him since he was a puppy
*  and the other one, I got her right around the time
*  that he was a puppy and she was only maybe a year old herself
*  and she was another rescue dog I got
*  and they were like best friends.
*  So they were fun together.
*  How many dogs have you had in total?
*  Five at one time.
*  I had five at one time altogether.
*  It was tremendous.
*  You had five at one time?
*  So much barking.
*  What are you, Whitney Cummings?
*  She done loved dogs, man.
*  I love dogs.
*  Whitney loves dogs.
*  I love them.
*  If I could have 20 dogs, I'd have 20 dogs,
*  but it's not fair for the dog.
*  Dogs need, they're like family members, man.
*  They need love.
*  This dog, Marshall, is just different
*  than any dog I've ever had
*  because there's zero challenging in him.
*  There's, he's all, he's not barking at anybody.
*  He's not growling ever.
*  He's growling like to play.
*  Like he'll come up to you with like a toy in his mouth,
*  he's like, grrr.
*  And I'm like, dude, you got that toy.
*  What do you got?
*  Grrr.
*  But his tails wagging, like there's no aggression to him.
*  He's just all love.
*  What was the thought behind the Jeremy Shepherd?
*  Or a gold retriever?
*  Well, I never had one before, but I heard they're great dogs.
*  I've always heard they're really good family dogs.
*  I had a lab, a black lab, Abigail,
*  which was fucking the greatest dog.
*  She dived to the bottom of the pool and grabbed rings.
*  Yeah, I mean, those are dogs that people used to hunt ducks.
*  You know, those kinds of dogs, there's task-oriented dogs.
*  You can teach them to do things.
*  Like Marshall, whenever he comes over to like,
*  like in the morning, I'll get up in the morning
*  and I'll say, what's up, bro?
*  What's up?
*  And he's like, woo, woo, woo.
*  He always grabs a toy.
*  Always grabs a toy and brings it to you.
*  Like he never just comes to you and pets you.
*  He comes to you and shows you a toy that he's got
*  because his genes are retrievers.
*  So it's like a bird hunting dog.
*  Like someone would shoot a pheasant or something like that
*  and he would grab it and bring it back or whatever.
*  Yeah.
*  Whatever bird it was.
*  And that's like what he's doing.
*  And he holds it in his mouth and brings it to you to show you.
*  Like he rarely tears his toys apart.
*  Super soft mouths.
*  Yeah, they just carry him around.
*  He's the sweetest.
*  Has he go swimming yet?
*  All the time, bro.
*  Loves it.
*  I want to get my Izzy as our new bull master.
*  If I want to get her in the pool,
*  cause you can tell she wants it.
*  How old is she?
*  Six months.
*  You gotta get her in soon.
*  Yeah.
*  Priscilla fell in the pool.
*  This old fuck.
*  And does she know how to swim?
*  Yeah, she got out, but we didn't know she fell in.
*  She just came in and you can see this in this dog's eyes.
*  Like just you have no fucking idea what happened.
*  Soaking wet and we're like, how did you get wet?
*  And then you see she fell in off the steps
*  and then found her way out.
*  But man, you think you got to teach the dog
*  the way out of the pool.
*  Yes, you got to teach them the way out of the pool.
*  And hopefully you got to have like a dog friendly pool.
*  There's more than one ladder somewhere where you can,
*  you know, you don't want to have a pool
*  where you have to take the dog out yourself.
*  No.
*  Yeah, those are not good.
*  You want to want somewhere, cause it's hard for dogs too,
*  when they get their paws up on the concrete
*  to get their whole body up.
*  It's not easy.
*  That's not easy for them like it is for us.
*  You know, you get your hands on the concrete
*  on the side anywhere, you can just push yourself up
*  and you sit on the side.
*  A dog can't do that.
*  Dogs gotta go up steps.
*  Unless it's like some super dog or something.
*  But yeah, man, if it was up to me, I'd have like 20 dogs.
*  I want to get Priscilla and Mona,
*  as the two dogs, the older or older dogs,
*  when they pass, we'll have this fucking idiot dog Izzy.
*  And then...
*  It's an idiot?
*  How old is it?
*  Like fucking six, seven months.
*  She's beautiful.
*  Beautiful coat.
*  You got to teach them.
*  Oh yeah.
*  She just is like...
*  It's not going to learn?
*  Man, this dog has so much fucking...
*  It's almost like just blind-eyed to you.
*  Like, huh, what?
*  What are you talking about?
*  Like she's on crank all day.
*  All fucking day.
*  What kind of dog is it?
*  Bull Mastiff.
*  Yeah, that's why those are great protection dogs.
*  Oh.
*  So much energy.
*  She has got, man, something goes down in the backyard,
*  this bitch is on it.
*  Yeah, right out there, Priscilla heard.
*  She's raised for something to do.
*  That's like when a regular person gets a Belgian Malinois.
*  And so it's bringing that goddamn thing around everywhere.
*  Like, oh, look at you, you little fucking demon.
*  You little black-haired demon.
*  What's a Belgian Malinois?
*  Designed to take out prisoners.
*  Is that the fucking...
*  It's like a...
*  German Shepherd looking dog?
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Exactly like a German Shepherd looking dog.
*  But they look so fierce, man.
*  Those dogs, we use them a bunch of times on Fear Factor.
*  Look at the fucking athleticism of this thing.
*  Look at this fucking animal.
*  Look at that thing go to the roof.
*  Look at it take this guy down.
*  They're wild dogs, man, in terms of their athleticism.
*  Look at that thing fly up.
*  Shut up.
*  Look at that grabble.
*  Have you seen the one where there's a treat
*  or a ball hanging from a tree?
*  And so this Belgian Malinois jumps,
*  runs up the side of the trunk of the tree,
*  and then leaps sideways like 20 feet in the air
*  to snatch this ball.
*  Look at this.
*  Look at this thing walking on tightrope
*  across two buildings.
*  Bro, you don't want nothing to do with this dog.
*  That is a dog that was clearly not trained in America.
*  It's going backwards now.
*  You don't want jack shit to do with this dog.
*  You just do not.
*  Look at that thing go after people.
*  Yeah, you can't let that motherfucker go.
*  They're amazing.
*  Look at that.
*  Oh my God.
*  Dude, how about that?
*  How about it jumping over this guy's back
*  and jumping into the bed of that truck
*  as it's speeding down the street?
*  Look at the fucking athleticism these things have.
*  And you really only get that kind of athleticism
*  with a dog that's that size.
*  It's not a giant dog.
*  Yeah.
*  Like coyotes.
*  How much do you think that weighs?
*  I don't think they're very big at all.
*  60 pounds?
*  Yeah, probably 60 or 70 pounds for a good size one.
*  Although we were just talking the other day
*  about someone who had one that was really young
*  and it was already 90 pounds.
*  Somebody had one that was like, who was that
*  that was saying that?
*  That was one that was like six months old
*  and it was already 90 pounds.
*  Was it Andy was talking about somebody?
*  Is their average?
*  Yeah, so the average is like 75 pounds for a male.
*  That's on the high end.
*  So this guy had one that was already 90 pounds
*  that was six months old.
*  So they also had double canines.
*  The ones that he was showing us.
*  Like great whites?
*  Like on each side, they have two canines on the top.
*  So if you could find that image,
*  double canines Belgian Malinois.
*  Fuck.
*  That's the thing they're breeding.
*  They're making hybrids.
*  They take a grapefruit and they mix it with orange.
*  Didn't they do something stupid like that?
*  Grapple.
*  Yeah, grapple, right?
*  A grapefruit and an apple or something.
*  Grape and an apple together is a grape,
*  taste an apple.
*  Look, it's got double canines.
*  Shut up.
*  Some of them have two canines.
*  I couldn't live with the dog.
*  I almost bought a doggo Argentino
*  and the guy was like, right before I bought it,
*  he was like, hey, you gonna have this dog in bed with you?
*  And I go, yeah, of course.
*  And he goes, I'm not selling it to you.
*  And hung up on me.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, because you got it.
*  There's certain dogs where you have to become the master.
*  Like doggo Argentinos are like bullmastiffs,
*  but pit bulls on steroids.
*  Yeah.
*  And the guy was like, yeah, man,
*  once it gets in bed with you, you've lost the house.
*  I was like, all right, good call, man.
*  Thank you for stopping me.
*  So it fucking tells you, no, I'm running this house, bitch.
*  Yeah.
*  I sleep in this bed.
*  Who the fuck are you?
*  Who the fuck are you, bro?
*  He's fucking my wife.
*  I'm like, hey, I didn't know we were gonna share her.
*  Imagine he starts growling at you
*  while he's humping your wife's leg.
*  You're like, oh no, what have I done?
*  I let this giant beast get too comfortable in my house.
*  200 pound murderous dog that wants to fuck your wife.
*  Look at the build in that thing.
*  That's the most beautiful dog I've ever seen in my life.
*  It looks like it, the clown, if it was an evil dog.
*  It does look like it.
*  It does.
*  Go back to that picture.
*  It looks like, go back to that picture.
*  It looks like Pennywise.
*  Jamie, that's the picture you were just on.
*  Go back to the one you were just on.
*  It looks like, that's one.
*  That's Pennywise the clown, bro.
*  Oh, fuck.
*  That's fucking Pennywise.
*  I'm so glad I didn't get one now.
*  It looks like Pennywise, doesn't it?
*  Look at that fucking dog.
*  Oh my god, the muscle in that thing are preposterous.
*  When was the last time you got attacked by a dog?
*  I've never been attacked by a dog.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  That looks like the rock if it was a dog.
*  Look at the build on that thing.
*  Look at that, man.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  That's probably 130 pounds.
*  That's a girl too.
*  That's a female dog.
*  Try to grab onto any part of that dog
*  to stop it from killing you.
*  Good luck, bitch.
*  There's not one part of you.
*  That looks like a demon, like a sweet-faced demon
*  that you got wandering around your yard
*  looking to kill burglars.
*  That's the dog I wanted.
*  Woo, look, build on that fucker.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Look at those dead eyes.
*  That is a crazy dog to have around your house.
*  You gotta really be on top of things.
*  Jesus.
*  Look at the head.
*  Look at that head with the collar.
*  Look at that one in the middle.
*  Oh my God.
*  Look at that jaw.
*  Look at the fucking head.
*  God damn it.
*  Look at the fucking head on that thing.
*  Oh my dick's almost hard.
*  That dog's so pretty.
*  Oh my God.
*  Bro.
*  Fuck.
*  That's a polar bear.
*  That's like having a polar bear.
*  How's that any different?
*  How's that any different than that dude?
*  Those and Connie Corso's are fucking,
*  that's the shit with dogs.
*  If my wife leaves me, I'm moving to Malibu,
*  I'm getting a Connie Corso and a doggo Argentino.
*  Yeah, those are.
*  Good fucking, oh, look at the fucking muscles
*  in the chest of that thing.
*  Come on, man.
*  That's just too weird.
*  I feel like if you have a dog like that also,
*  it's like you have this obligation
*  to work that motherfucker out.
*  Every day.
*  Every day.
*  You have a super athlete.
*  You just can't have that thing in your yard being bored.
*  Like that's a different kind of dog.
*  That's why he was like,
*  you're not letting him in bed with you.
*  I was like, oh, of course I am.
*  Why?
*  He was like, wrong guy.
*  He'll start running shit, son.
*  You gotta keep those motherfuckers on a leash
*  and train them well from the time they're really young.
*  Or get one that's trained.
*  But even then, when I've heard about Belgian Malinois
*  in particular, you gotta be the boss.
*  That thing has to respect that you're the boss.
*  Is that what Kal or Shob got?
*  He did for a little bit.
*  And then he gave it back.
*  He did for a little bit.
*  He went out of town and wouldn't listen to his wife at all.
*  It was like, fuck you, bitch.
*  And she's like, oh no, I got this crazy dog in my house.
*  It's not listening to me.
*  Yeah, but if a dog thinks you're not the boss,
*  then it becomes the boss.
*  He decided Brendan was the boss.
*  Look at this big motherfucker with a deep voice.
*  He's six foot five or whatever he is.
*  His friends is gigantic.
*  And so he's around this dog.
*  He's like, hey bro.
*  And the dog's like, okay, big guy.
*  Okay, big guy with the food.
*  I'll be cool with you.
*  And then the wife's around like, who the fuck are you?
*  Who are you and where's the big guy?
*  I think I'm the big guy, motherfucker.
*  That's why you have to get a dog when it's a puppy.
*  When you get a dog when it's a puppy,
*  then you're the daddy.
*  When I get up in the morning and Marshall's waiting for me,
*  I'm like, bro!
*  That's what I say to him, bro!
*  And he's like, woo!
*  And he goes running around in circles and shit.
*  It's a healthy relationship.
*  For his whole life, he's associated me
*  with going on runs and getting belly rubs and playing.
*  So it's like, you get a dog when it's fully grown.
*  You have no idea what was going on.
*  You don't know what was going on.
*  You weren't there.
*  You don't know what was going on.
*  You get into a two year old dog that's trained.
*  And trained how?
*  By who?
*  Were you there?
*  I mean, you can assume from some guys,
*  because you trust their reputation,
*  they're really good at raising dogs.
*  But it's not the same relationship
*  as when you raise a dog from the time it's a puppy.
*  No, puppies are, man, there's nothing better.
*  The dog we have now got me because I was in Phoenix
*  doing a show, my wife's on the road with me.
*  She goes, hey, there's a puppy like 20 miles from here.
*  And I went to the house, walked in,
*  and this fucking dog climbed up in my lap,
*  laid her head on my shoulder and just went to sleep.
*  And I went, bitch, you're going home with us.
*  They're too adorable.
*  Puppies are the cutest thing that you ever get to experience
*  other than a baby.
*  And maybe even more than a baby,
*  because you're not as concerned about them being vulnerable
*  so you can appreciate them more sometimes.
*  Unless it's your baby.
*  Once your baby, you're just so full of love.
*  You don't know what the fuck to do.
*  But other people's babies are pretty cute.
*  But other people's puppies are always cute.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Much other players are always puppies than their baby.
*  Way more.
*  Way more.
*  They're universally adorable.
*  There's something about a puppy,
*  even the way they move, they move kind of funny.
*  And they're big ass heads and they go playing,
*  like, ah, look at you, bro.
*  When they do that front paw jump right, left, like,
*  gah-gah.
*  Yeah, they're just having fun.
*  And what sucks is where we're at now with this puppy,
*  where it's still a puppy, but it's big.
*  And you're like, yo, you cannot just jump up
*  on the fucking bed and fucking just, like, she just.
*  Have you ever given it lessons?
*  Do you give it lessons on how to?
*  I haven't been home for a while,
*  but I think I'm gonna start giving
*  this fucking dog some lessons.
*  You can't just have the dog make the rules, man.
*  You gotta make the rules.
*  Oh, she is, she's fucking hilarious.
*  But man, she gets up, like, just gets up on your lap.
*  You should have rooms where the dog's not allowed to go in.
*  Okay.
*  Dude, I'll be taking his shit
*  and this dog will walk in the closet,
*  grab his shoe and just walk out, look at me and go,
*  oh, sorry, I didn't know you were here.
*  You can't grab on your shoes.
*  Just walk right out.
*  Oh my God, it's so funny.
*  Fucking dog has no rules.
*  She learned how to open the trash can,
*  like, pull the cabinet and just stick her head in the trash.
*  You go, Izzy, and she'll go, huh, what?
*  Doesn't even say no, just, yeah.
*  You gotta train her, Bert, before it's too late.
*  It might be too late.
*  It might be.
*  This might be, you might need to bring in
*  Cesar Millan for this one.
*  I ran into Cesar Millan the other night.
*  You need to run into him, it was fate.
*  Where was I?
*  God damn.
*  You were on Destiny Boulevard.
*  Jesus.
*  Cesar Millan was there to stop you
*  from being a future episode of his show.
*  What the fuck, man?
*  Yeah.
*  You can't do that, Bert, that's ridiculous.
*  I ran into, where was I?
*  Man, I met Cesar Millan.
*  Where were you, that's a good question.
*  Fuck, I must've been somewhere, like some sort of event.
*  I don't know, but you need to have him help you
*  fix your fucking dog.
*  Yeah, this fucking dog's all over the map.
*  Dude, it's already 3.30.
*  Are you serious?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh shit, we've been going for what, three hours?
*  We've been going, three and a half hours.
*  Ridiculous.
*  This is awesome, man.
*  Awesome, the best.
*  I love doing this podcast.
*  I love doing it, so I'm so glad that with all this craziness
*  we can still do something like this.
*  Fuck yeah, dude.
*  Social distancing.
*  Yes, just we're not making out anymore,
*  and I hope you guys at home listen,
*  and stay safe, and Bert Kreischer,
*  Hey Big Boy is available right now.
*  Let's break the internet, you fucks.
*  Please.
*  Right now on the Netflix.
*  Go there, enjoy, and that's it.
*  Bert Kreischer on Instagram, Bert Kreischer on Twitter.
*  Do you even use Twitter anymore?
*  Yeah, I do.
*  Do you pay attention to the mean people?
*  No.
*  I read it without my glasses,
*  so I can't see what they're saying.
*  That's a good move.
*  I just love in her tweet.
*  All right, well thank you brother, I love you man.
*  I love you too man, it's good hanging out with you.
*  Always fun.
*  Bye everybody, we'll see you soon.
