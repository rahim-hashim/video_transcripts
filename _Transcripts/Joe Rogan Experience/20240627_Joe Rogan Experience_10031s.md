# Joe Rogan Experience #1961 - Peter Attia
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6.0s)]
*  The sign is made by this company, Rogue House Relics. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=10.0s)]
*  So they make these beautiful neon, cool-looking, funky signs. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=15.0s)]
*  And my buddy Brigham actually bought it for me when I moved here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=21.0s)]
*  And I was like, wow, what a cool sign. Wouldn't that be nice if it was in the studio behind me? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=25.0s)]
*  And so it wasn't on purpose. It wasn't by design at all. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=29.0s)]
*  And so once he did it. But the UFO was his idea. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=32.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was before we even decided to call it the mothership. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=36.0s)]
*  But I'm easy to figure out. I mean, I got a fucking Bob Lazar UFO on the desk. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=40.0s)]
*  I got fucking stars on the ceilings. I have an alien head in the sky. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=45.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a dork. It's easy to... I mean, it's not like, wow, how did he know you like UFOs? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=50.0s)]
*  I'm fucking obsessed. I'm absolutely obsessed. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=56.0s)]
*  I think it's the only thing that's going to save us. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=61.0s)]
*  So outlive the science and art of longevity. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=64.0s)]
*  This is a big one, buddy. Look at this. Look at all this. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=68.0s)]
*  There's a lot of information in this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=71.0s)]
*  Not a lot of pictures. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=73.0s)]
*  No pictures? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=74.0s)]
*  No, there's some. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=75.0s)]
*  I need pictures. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=76.0s)]
*  There's some. There's some. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=77.0s)]
*  No, it's... Is it out now? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=78.0s)]
*  Out today. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=81.0s)]
*  Today. Beautiful. How long did it take you to write this? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=82.0s)]
*  Six years. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=85.0s)]
*  Wow. Six years. And I know that's like six years of actual work, too. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=86.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I rewrote it twice. So there's kind of version one, version two. This is version three. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=93.0s)]
*  What did you change? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=98.0s)]
*  So the first version got basically thrown out by the publisher because they said, this is way too technical. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=99.0s)]
*  There's no narrative. There's no story. It's being written to just a very tiny sliver of the world. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=106.0s)]
*  Basically, it's like the book you would write to scientists or maybe physicians. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=113.0s)]
*  So then there was kind of version two. So that version is completely gone. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=117.0s)]
*  I don't think there's anything from that that made it into version two. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=123.0s)]
*  Version two was the skeleton of this book, but it was about 50% longer. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=125.0s)]
*  I mean, it was a massive book. And that's the kind of version that I'd say was circa 2020. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=132.0s)]
*  And this version is just basically better because it's shorter. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=139.0s)]
*  A lot of stuff got taken out of it that I think was not absolutely necessary. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=143.0s)]
*  And I just sharpened my thinking. I mean, I think that's what writing is. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=148.0s)]
*  I think writing just makes you ask the question, like, is this actually necessary? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=151.0s)]
*  And does this help the reader understand something and if not, get it out? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=157.0s)]
*  So the expression is kill your babies. You've got to be able to read something that you've worked really hard on [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=160.0s)]
*  and put a ton of time into and say, I got a new kit. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=166.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's with everything. Yeah, totally. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=169.0s)]
*  It's fiction, with comedy, with it. I'm sure it's that way with music. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=173.0s)]
*  You just there's a certain point in time you have to edit things and get the with comedians. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=176.0s)]
*  It's a real issue because some comedians like like certain parts of a bit. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=181.0s)]
*  And like, well, that bit fucks your bit up. I know it gets like a little bit of a laugh, but it fucks it up because this like, yeah, I kind of like doing that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=185.0s)]
*  I'm like, listen, don't look at it like it's yours. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=192.0s)]
*  Look at it like if you were outside of you, like I edit the shit out of my stuff. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=195.0s)]
*  If you look at it like it's outside of you, like how would you approach that? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=200.0s)]
*  But that's very hard to do because if you write something, I mean, six years, right, three different versions, just a lot of you invested in this book. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=204.0s)]
*  So it's like it's very difficult to just like chop stuff up and, you know, just fucking throw it away all the time and all the thinking and. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=213.0s)]
*  And there was a whole appendix that never made it in. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=225.0s)]
*  So one of the things I wanted to do was pick like the 20 most important drugs, hormones, supplements that I think are relevant and write just quote unquote ten pages on each. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=228.0s)]
*  And I didn't I didn't go into it thinking it would be ten pages. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=240.0s)]
*  I thought I'm just going to write the essentials on these ten things, you know, kind of rapamycin metformin, you know, nicotinamide riboside, you know, those sorts of things. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=243.0s)]
*  But then it turned out I was taking me like, you know, eight to ten pages per and the publishers like you. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=252.0s)]
*  There's no way you can have a 200 page appendix on a 450 page book. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=257.0s)]
*  So like all of that work gone, just scrap. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=261.0s)]
*  Oh, no. Have you thought about making that like a separate guide? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=265.0s)]
*  Yeah, maybe down the line. I'll just publish it on my website. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=269.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I think. Yeah. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=273.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it seems like it's very valuable information, though. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=274.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's I'm sorry. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=277.0s)]
*  I'm ready to put the book aside for a minute. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=281.0s)]
*  Burnt out. Yeah. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=283.0s)]
*  Although my wife says like the last few weeks, she's like, it feels like the weight of the world is off your shoulders. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=285.0s)]
*  You know, yeah. Well, it is when you have something that's a big project, it's very difficult to not let it consume your entire life. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=291.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. You know, I was watching this clip of you and Huberman. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=300.0s)]
*  It was really fascinating because you were talking about self talk, the way you talk to yourself and about how you adjusted that. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=304.0s)]
*  I thought that was very, very interesting that you would you would get so you know, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=313.0s)]
*  one of the problems with people like yourself, I guess myself, too, people that get like really into things is you get obsessed and then you get very hard on yourself if things aren't going well or if it's not going exactly the way you want it to go, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=318.0s)]
*  the way you know, if you're not using proper technique, if you're not doing and then for you, you had a real problem where you like very hyper critical of yourself. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=336.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I mean, it was actually out loud. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=345.0s)]
*  I mean, I would just verbally berate myself whenever I made mistakes. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=348.0s)]
*  And I don't I don't remember not experiencing this. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=352.0s)]
*  Right. So this is something that's your whole life. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=358.0s)]
*  Yeah. This is like seven year old Peter was doing this, too. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=360.0s)]
*  Wow. Where'd you get that from? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=363.0s)]
*  I mean, I know it had to do with sort of, you know, various defects in my, you know, my life as a child. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=366.0s)]
*  And I think there was just I think everybody responds kind of differently to the word trauma is a bit loaded. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=374.0s)]
*  So I want to be kind of careful using it. But I think we all experience trauma. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=380.0s)]
*  We adopt we're highly adaptable. Right. So everybody adapts to trauma very well, I think, for the most part. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=384.0s)]
*  But there are mal adaptations. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=389.0s)]
*  And I think one of my, you know, issues, I think growing up was just a total inferiority complex. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=392.0s)]
*  Right. This feeling like not good enough. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=399.0s)]
*  You know, look down upon constantly, you know, all that sort of stuff. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=403.0s)]
*  Like a lot of this is very typical immigrant stuff, by the way, like when you're kind of the only nonwhite person in your middle class neighborhood, you're you're different than everybody else. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=406.0s)]
*  Look, I think that's what drew me into sports like boxing and martial arts at such a young age. Right. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=416.0s)]
*  It was kind of like the I'll be different. I'll be better. I'll be tougher. All those things. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=420.0s)]
*  So somehow I just think that that that narrative got harsher and harsher as I got older and older. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=424.0s)]
*  And it didn't matter, you know, what sort of accolades came with it, because because it does produce good results sometimes. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=432.0s)]
*  You know, you do get better. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=440.0s)]
*  But I think, you know, where I got to is just the benefits were no longer close to compensating for the costs. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=443.0s)]
*  And I think the biggest costs were the costs, not just on me, which were there all along, but it's how it kind of spreads into your relationships with other people, most most importantly, your family. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=451.0s)]
*  Yeah, I realized at an early age that there's zero benefit in being hard on yourself because I'm I am no matter what, I'm a perfectionist and I get very angry at myself. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=461.0s)]
*  There's zero benefit to self-talk that's negative. So I cut that out of my life like very early on. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=474.0s)]
*  How did you do that? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=482.0s)]
*  Well, one of I mean, from, you know, age 15 on, I was very, very active in martial arts competition. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=484.0s)]
*  Right. So the my whole focus was on that. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=493.0s)]
*  And my whole focus was on getting better and anything that would somehow or another get in the way of me getting better. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=497.0s)]
*  I cut it out, whether it was partying, drinking, spending too much time with girls, whatever it was. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=505.0s)]
*  I'm like, that's got to go because that's getting in the way. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=511.0s)]
*  And I found that negative self-talk gets in the way because there's the reason why you have negatives are I had negative self-talk was because I was insecure and I was very ambitious. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=514.0s)]
*  And I really wanted to be really good. And I wanted to be really good immediately. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=528.0s)]
*  I didn't want to wait. But I realized somewhere along the way that the negative in any way, shape or form, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=532.0s)]
*  I didn't need it because I was so driven like that. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=538.0s)]
*  The negative is just getting in the way. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=542.0s)]
*  It was like I thought that it was helping me because I was like, come on, you fucking idiot, like, get going. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=544.0s)]
*  But then I realized like, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=549.0s)]
*  Like, that's not that is there's no benefit to that because all the you already have like this crazy desire to get better. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=552.0s)]
*  So just don't ever be shitty to yourself and instead concentrate all your energy on what you're doing wrong and technique. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=560.0s)]
*  And that's why my technique got so good so quickly is because I didn't I didn't spend any time with self-loathing. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=570.0s)]
*  Like I didn't spend any time after losses loathing myself. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=578.0s)]
*  All I wanted to do is get back to the gym. But I just figured it out on my own. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=581.0s)]
*  And I don't know how. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=586.0s)]
*  You know, there's like there's been some moments in my life and in comedy and in martial arts where I realize I have a very I had an error in thinking and I made adjustments. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=588.0s)]
*  And that was one of those adjustment that I made like as a teen as a young teenager. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=599.0s)]
*  I made that adjustment. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=604.0s)]
*  That's fortunate. I mean, I look I'm forty seven. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=606.0s)]
*  I'm fifty now, but I was forty seven when I figured this out. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=608.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I didn't necessarily figure it out on my own. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=611.0s)]
*  I mean, it had to be sort of made apparently clear to me. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=614.0s)]
*  So, you know, if I'd figured this out when I was 17, I would have saved myself and everybody else a lot of pain. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=617.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard, man, because if you're if you're ambitious, if you have goals, if you're very into what you're doing, you're very focused on whatever the endeavor is. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=622.0s)]
*  Whenever you have a setback, it's it's really frustrating and it's infuriating. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=634.0s)]
*  And you can you can get very angry yourself, especially if you're doing something that you know better, like if you make an error, whether it's with archery or whether it's anything that you do that you're really interested in. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=642.0s)]
*  If you you know that it was a lapse of concentration or you're tired or you just weren't focused on it entirely and you fuck something up, it's like, God damn it, you fucking dumbass piece of shit. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=656.0s)]
*  Like, it's so easy to do that, but you can't let that happen because it's a bad use of fuel. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=669.0s)]
*  It really is. It's a bad use of fuel. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=677.0s)]
*  I mean, I'll still occasionally yell if I fuck some like fucking fuck, but I'm not mad at myself. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=680.0s)]
*  It's just energy. I just have to fucking get it out. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=687.0s)]
*  You know, I'm just just got to fucking let it out. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=690.0s)]
*  But I think thinking of yourself as a fucking loser is never good, like zero time. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=694.0s)]
*  There's no benefit in it ever. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=701.0s)]
*  You're always going to have frustration. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=703.0s)]
*  You're always going to be after also understand the process like in the while things are going poorly. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=705.0s)]
*  It's very difficult to recognize that it's part of the process. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=713.0s)]
*  It's so hard. It's so hard when things are going poorly, whether it's a standup comedy or martial arts or anything. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=717.0s)]
*  When things suck, when things aren't going well, it's so difficult to see past that moment. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=724.0s)]
*  But you just have to. And over time, with many, many different instances of this taking place, you recognize like it's OK. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=731.0s)]
*  I know you feel like shit. I know you feel like the world is ending, but it's not. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=740.0s)]
*  Not only is it not ending, this is like totally inconsequential. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=744.0s)]
*  And this is actually good for you because this frustration will add to your motivation and will add to your inspiration. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=747.0s)]
*  And you'll eventually get better. But tell that to a 16 year old. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=753.0s)]
*  It's fucking so hard, man. So hard. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=756.0s)]
*  I actually I tell you, in me, it got worse over time, like as bad as it was when I was young. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=760.0s)]
*  And when I was young, I mean, I was it was so I can't imagine what my parents went through. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=764.0s)]
*  Like, I don't think I went one month without putting my fist through a wall at home. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=768.0s)]
*  I mean, I got I got so good at doing drywall. I'm serious. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=772.0s)]
*  Like, because that's like my parents were like, well, you're going to fix that. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=776.0s)]
*  So it's like I basically became like a tradesman on the side. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=779.0s)]
*  Why did you get you a punching bag? I did. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=782.0s)]
*  I mean, I had every punching bag. I mean, I didn't care. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=784.0s)]
*  Because if I got pissed while I was in my bedroom, there was a punching bag there. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=787.0s)]
*  Like, wow. I mean, how many like even even in college, like, you know, writing computer programs and like I screw up some line of code, like I would break my mouse or break my keyboard or whatever. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=790.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just like so pathologically destructive. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=801.0s)]
*  And, you know, it just it just got so much worse. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=805.0s)]
*  You know, it just which is really frightening. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=810.0s)]
*  Do you think it got so much worse because you accomplished so many things in your drive just increased with the amount of success that you had and the the the different things you accomplished in your life? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=812.0s)]
*  Whereas when you were younger, it was almost like you you experience fuck ups and success. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=826.0s)]
*  Whereas as you've gotten older, when a fuck up does happen, it's just so infuriating because you you should be past it. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=833.0s)]
*  That's a good question. I that might be the case. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=840.0s)]
*  My thinking is a little bit different, which is there is an addiction at play here. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=844.0s)]
*  Right. So so if you if you shift the thinking of this to that addiction mindset and it's hard to sometimes think of perfectionism as an addiction because it doesn't produce immediately the same negative consequences as the addictions to, you know, alcohol, drugs and gambling and sort of the less socially acceptable addictions. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=849.0s)]
*  But I think what happens with most people who are addicted to something is their appetite for that addiction gets higher and higher. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=868.0s)]
*  And so, you know, if you're addicted to alcohol, like an alcoholic habituates to a certain amount of alcohol, they have to drink more and more and more. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=875.0s)]
*  And similarly, the need for achievement grew more and more and more. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=885.0s)]
*  And one of my therapist explained this to me so well. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=892.0s)]
*  And I was like, that is the most frightening, brilliant analogy I've ever heard. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=895.0s)]
*  She said, you know, your entire self-esteem is based on performance. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=900.0s)]
*  And any time you turn to one of your performance, you know, addictions and you don't get performance back, you lose your mind. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=905.0s)]
*  Right. So you everything you have to do feeds your sense of self-worth. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=916.0s)]
*  So if you go out and shoot the bow, it's got to be great. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=920.0s)]
*  If you go out and drive the car or get in the simulator, it's got to be great. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=923.0s)]
*  If you're trying to, you know, prepare for a podcast, it's got to be great. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=926.0s)]
*  Like all of these things, you have to be great. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=929.0s)]
*  And when you don't, it's sort of like an alcoholic who walks into a bar, asks for vodka and gets water. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=931.0s)]
*  Right. They're asking for vodka. They need the thing that feeds their addiction, but they're being given water instead. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=938.0s)]
*  So I want I'm demanding great performance because that's how I validate my existence. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=944.0s)]
*  And instead I get no performance. I get lousy performance. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=949.0s)]
*  But because my appetite has grown, it gets hard. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=952.0s)]
*  That's why I think over time it just got worse and worse. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=955.0s)]
*  So what did you do to correct that? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=959.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think there's two things. Right. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=962.0s)]
*  There's the underlying belief system has to be completely shattered. Right. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=964.0s)]
*  So that's, you know, I spent a total of five weeks in residential care. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=967.0s)]
*  Two weeks in 2017 and three weeks in 2020. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=973.0s)]
*  So that's, you know, that's as bad as it gets. Right. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=976.0s)]
*  That's you're doing 12 to 13 hours a day of therapy, seven days a week. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=979.0s)]
*  And that's where you're kind of going back to the root of the problems. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=984.0s)]
*  Like, what is it that is creating or has created this belief system in you? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=988.0s)]
*  So you have to go back and look at that. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=994.0s)]
*  You then have to figure out what are the strategies and tools to break these habits and behaviors? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=996.0s)]
*  And so to the latter, there was a very tangible tool put forth by one of the therapists, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1002.0s)]
*  which was every time you do something that creates this ire and rage in you, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1009.0s)]
*  instead of defaulting into your normal state, which is yelling at yourself or breaking an arrow over your thigh or whatever it is you would do, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1018.0s)]
*  pull out your phone and audibly speak as though it's your friend that made that mistake. Right. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1026.0s)]
*  So if I'm shooting horribly and I really feel like I'm going to lose my mind, I pull up my phone and I pretend it's you that's shooting horribly. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1032.0s)]
*  What would I say to you? I wouldn't yell at you if you're shooting poorly. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1040.0s)]
*  I'd be like, Joe, look, man, it's a little windy today. Let's be honest. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1044.0s)]
*  We're not making excuses. But when it's 20 mile an hour wind, it's hard to shoot well. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1048.0s)]
*  Maybe you're tired. You know, you probably just lifted right before you came out here. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1053.0s)]
*  That always makes it harder for you to stabilize the bow. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1056.0s)]
*  And look, maybe it's just a bad day. Like, let's come out and do it again tomorrow. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1059.0s)]
*  And so I would record that and I would send that to my therapist every single time. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1063.0s)]
*  And this would happen like multiple times a day. And just doing that four or five times a day after four or five, six months, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1068.0s)]
*  what I called my inner Bobby night, which was the name I had for that guy that would scream at me. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1077.0s)]
*  Like, I just couldn't hear him anymore. Wow. That's fascinating. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1082.0s)]
*  So you fixed a lifelong problem in just a few months, which if you had told me upfront that was possible, I would have said it's not. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1087.0s)]
*  You can't. I was like, there's no way you can undo something. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1096.0s)]
*  I thought so terminal. But, you know, this this speaks to plasticity, right? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1100.0s)]
*  The brain is a pretty plastic thing. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1107.0s)]
*  It's interesting to think of what what started you on this path and why you didn't course correct. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1109.0s)]
*  I'd love this thought process that it's an addiction and you're addicted to great performance, which totally makes sense. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1117.0s)]
*  Because I could feel myself. I could like I definitely could have succumbed to that same sort of thinking and behavior. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1127.0s)]
*  And it is a dangerous addiction. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1134.0s)]
*  Perfectionism is a dangerous addiction in the sense that a lot of people will reward it. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1136.0s)]
*  Society generally rewards it. Yeah. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1142.0s)]
*  And in that sense, another fear I had was because I mean, it's not like my it's not like people around me didn't know I was a mess. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1145.0s)]
*  But anytime someone tried to suggest, like, back off, I would look at them and say, Are you an idiot? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1154.0s)]
*  Like, if I back off, I won't be as good. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1161.0s)]
*  Like, if I don't, you know, like when I was in residency, I had this obsession with wanting to read every single textbook written in surgery. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1164.0s)]
*  And, you know, this is we're already working like one hundred and fourteen hours a week. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1172.0s)]
*  It's not like I had a lot of free time. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1176.0s)]
*  And my wife was like, You're so dogmatic in this. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1179.0s)]
*  Like, you insist on reading twenty six pages of tiny, fonted textbooks every day. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1182.0s)]
*  And and she's like, like, you don't need to do this. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1188.0s)]
*  And I was like, Are you kidding? Like, of course I need to do this. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1192.0s)]
*  Like, what else will my legacy be if I don't do this? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1194.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just like this very polluted sense of self-worth. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1196.0s)]
*  But again, it's rewarded because then you know, you know a lot. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1200.0s)]
*  You know a lot. Right. And so you people people are happy with how much you know. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1205.0s)]
*  So it feeds on itself in a very destructive way. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1209.0s)]
*  There's nobody that's looking at the guy who's losing all his money gambling and saying, Good job. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1212.0s)]
*  Like, keep doing that. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1216.0s)]
*  Legacy is the strangest thing to aspire to because you will never experience it. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1219.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's such a ridiculous, isn't it? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1225.0s)]
*  You're not even going to be here. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1228.0s)]
*  So weird. I'm really glad I don't have any worry about my legacy. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1230.0s)]
*  I've zero thought about my legacy. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1234.0s)]
*  And I am so glad that I couldn't care less about it now as well. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1236.0s)]
*  It is such a crazy. It's such a remarkable freedom. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1240.0s)]
*  It's the driving force behind many people's lives, though. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1244.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I actually like feeling like kind of a good for nothing. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1247.0s)]
*  Whatever. Like, I mean, you certainly are not that. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1252.0s)]
*  No, no, no. That's why you like feeling like good for nothing, because you clearly are not. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1255.0s)]
*  Well, I think it's just that I realize, like, outside of my kids, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1258.0s)]
*  I'll tell you an interesting story. It's sort of a sad story, but it's it's so profound. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1263.0s)]
*  Right. So I had a friend who his wife was pregnant with their first kid and he's a successful guy. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1268.0s)]
*  So he prior to his wife having kids, I think he goes through the same sort of thoughts everyone is going to go through, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1275.0s)]
*  which is like, how is this going to change my life? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1280.0s)]
*  And the day his wife has the baby, he, you know, it's like the next day, I guess, he's still in the hospital. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1282.0s)]
*  He steps out to go buy some food and he still remembers this to this day. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1290.0s)]
*  He's like he bought a banana and he's walking back to the hospital with the banana that he just bought. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1294.0s)]
*  And he thinks to himself, I wonder if I'm going to be the kind of guy who now thinks the most important thing in his life is his family. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1299.0s)]
*  Or is it still going to be, you know, being a venture capitalist? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1307.0s)]
*  And he's thinking about it. He's thinking about it. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1311.0s)]
*  And he goes, you know what? I actually think it's just going to be my family. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1313.0s)]
*  I think all this other stuff is going to be bullshit and life is going to be my family. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1317.0s)]
*  And I'm not making this up. He gets back to the room and his wife is dead. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1322.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. She had had a pulmonary embolism and she died one day after delivering their first child. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1326.0s)]
*  And I was just having dinner with him like two weeks ago. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1335.0s)]
*  And he was like, you know, it's so ironic that I kind of just immediately have that realization just as everything gets taken away from me. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1339.0s)]
*  But he feels that way even more now. Right. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1348.0s)]
*  And I was like, you know, I think that is exactly the right distinction to make. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1352.0s)]
*  It's like this is life. These are the things that are life. Everything else is bullshit. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1356.0s)]
*  Yeah. The problem is that getting acceptance and getting appreciation for success is all is a drug. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1361.0s)]
*  It really is a drug. Right. And it becomes a thing that you aspire to. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1371.0s)]
*  And it seems like the only thing in life when the really the the the goal to life really is harmony. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1377.0s)]
*  That's the real goal. Like the goal to life is not never being uncomfortable or always being uncomfortable. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1385.0s)]
*  The goal to life is not never being upset versus always being upset. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1393.0s)]
*  The goal of life is like this balance. It's like enjoyment in the things that you do, but also in your occupation, having hobbies, but also having a family, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1399.0s)]
*  having love and friendship, but also having enough people in your life that you've encountered that suck to understand why you appreciate the people that you care for so much. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1412.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think all those are important. Like even the people that I know that suck. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1425.0s)]
*  I value those experiences because they've taught me how really cool my other friends are. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1431.0s)]
*  You know, when someone is a fucking psycho narcissist and they fucking ruin everything they touch and like it's good to see that person. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1440.0s)]
*  It's really good to see this one person that doesn't give a shit about anybody with themselves and go, wow, what a weird way to live. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1449.0s)]
*  You know, and then it makes you appreciate this other friend that's like super generous and helps everybody's always smiling like, I love you so much now. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1457.0s)]
*  I appreciate you, you know, like appreciate like that you have this energy because we could all be that guy. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1464.0s)]
*  We could all be this fucking psycho who thinks about nothing other than themselves or this psycho thinks about nothing other than success, which I've been in my life before. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1471.0s)]
*  You know, I really liked I almost wish I could go back and meet myself when I was 21 because I'm so different from that person. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1481.0s)]
*  And then I'm almost like I have a distorted understanding of like who I was and really would like to see that person. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1489.0s)]
*  I'd like to see that person operate. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1495.0s)]
*  You know, I can just like and you wouldn't worry about because of course I played this game all the time. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1498.0s)]
*  Right. Everything happens for a reason. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1503.0s)]
*  You are where you are. You are who you are. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1505.0s)]
*  Like if you went back and talked to the 21 year old you, would he even listen to you? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1507.0s)]
*  That's question. I wouldn't talk to him. Oh, you just want to know. I just want to watch. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1512.0s)]
*  I'm not going to change. Yeah, I got it. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1516.0s)]
*  I would not want to change anything about about my youth because I think that it turned me into who I am. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1518.0s)]
*  And I think whatever combination of life experiences and bad feelings and positive feelings, whatever positive feedback that I got from performance and from accomplishments, they drove me to become who I am. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1525.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1539.0s)]
*  But it's also it's like there's also a lot of like being fortunate, right? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1540.0s)]
*  Like being fortunate that you found a great occupation and a great group of people and I have a great family. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1545.0s)]
*  It's like to be happy in life is fucking complicated. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1552.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's amazing luck involved. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1557.0s)]
*  I mean, you and I were talking about this the other day, right? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1560.0s)]
*  Like winning the wife lottery, like marry the right person. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1561.0s)]
*  Everything. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1564.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1565.0s)]
*  And I think I just feel like so lucky that your wife's amazing. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1566.0s)]
*  You really are lucky. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1571.0s)]
*  And so am I. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1572.0s)]
*  And a lot of other people are too. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1573.0s)]
*  But you also didn't fucking marry some dumb bitch. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1574.0s)]
*  You know, she and her on her case, she didn't marry some fucking dumb asshole. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1579.0s)]
*  It's like you get lucky, but you also I've dated some monsters, you know, and I got out of it, luckily, but just Jesus Christ. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1584.0s)]
*  There's monsters out there. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1594.0s)]
*  There's people and these people are just human beings and you're catching them at whatever stage of their existence where they've had like terrible upbringings and bad family members and just fucking alcoholic dad, abusive mother who's constantly criticizing them. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1595.0s)]
*  And then they they become this thing. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1613.0s)]
*  And then you run into him at the bar. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1616.0s)]
*  Hi, nice to meet you. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1618.0s)]
*  I'm Peter. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1619.0s)]
*  Hi, I'm Debbie. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1620.0s)]
*  And then Debbie just fucking what's let me look at your phone. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1621.0s)]
*  Who are you texting Peter like, oh, no. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1624.0s)]
*  But if Debbie's hot, that's the problem. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1628.0s)]
*  You know, your genes are like, listen, listen, shut the fuck up. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1631.0s)]
*  Look at her tits. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1635.0s)]
*  Look at that ass. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1636.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1637.0s)]
*  And then next thing you know, Debbie's pregnant. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1638.0s)]
*  Next thing you know, Peter has a baby with some monster. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1640.0s)]
*  And that can happen. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1643.0s)]
*  And it's happened to my friends, to good friends of mine. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1644.0s)]
*  It's fucking awful to experience. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1647.0s)]
*  I've had good friends of mine that got wrapped up in horrendous relationships. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1650.0s)]
*  I think I was thinking about this the other day. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1656.0s)]
*  I mean, the role of luck in anyone's life is profound. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1658.0s)]
*  The thing that I think it's underappreciated is the luck we have being born where we are. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1661.0s)]
*  Like, so my parents are immigrants, right? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1667.0s)]
*  So I was born a couple of years after they moved to Canada. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1669.0s)]
*  And I was talking with my parents two months ago. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1672.0s)]
*  They came out to visit. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1675.0s)]
*  And I said, like, was there any chance you guys were not going to move? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1676.0s)]
*  You stayed in Egypt, right? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1680.0s)]
*  Like, was there any chance? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1681.0s)]
*  And I think, you ever think how different my life would be if I was born in Cairo? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1683.0s)]
*  And the answer is, like, beyond different. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1689.0s)]
*  Beyond. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1692.0s)]
*  Beyond different. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1693.0s)]
*  There is no single stroke of luck that has impacted my life. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1694.0s)]
*  And by the way, like, if we had been born in Egypt, if I had been born in Egypt, you know, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1699.0s)]
*  because we're not Muslim, I mean, it's not a great place to be if you're not a Muslim in a country that's obviously majority Muslim. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1703.0s)]
*  So, you know, there just would have been discriminated against. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1711.0s)]
*  I mean, it would have just been I wouldn't have had the same educational opportunities, which wouldn't have had any of the opportunities that I had growing up in Canada. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1715.0s)]
*  So, you know, something is completely out of my control, but probably had a greater impact on the arc of my life than anything else. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1721.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's just dumb luck. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1728.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1730.0s)]
*  You just hit the birth lottery. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1731.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1733.0s)]
*  I think that way, too. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1734.0s)]
*  I also think that, you know, we are extremely fortunate in human history to be born when we were born. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1735.0s)]
*  I'm a little older than you. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1743.0s)]
*  I'm 55. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1744.0s)]
*  You're 50. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1745.0s)]
*  So, you know, you were born in the 70s. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1746.0s)]
*  I was born in the late 60s. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1748.0s)]
*  And what we were born. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1750.0s)]
*  Yeah, just go 100 years earlier. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1752.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1754.0s)]
*  Which in evolutionary time is still nothing. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1755.0s)]
*  Right. That's like blank. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1757.0s)]
*  Blank. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1758.0s)]
*  But yes, 100 years sooner. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1759.0s)]
*  We're fucked. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1761.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're fucked. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1762.0s)]
*  We're fucked. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1763.0s)]
*  Everyone's dying of infections. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1764.0s)]
*  And on top of that, we have experienced a very unique time in human history where the birth of the Internet has happened while we were adults. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1765.0s)]
*  And not too young for us. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1776.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1778.0s)]
*  So it's like we got to grow up. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1779.0s)]
*  I hate to say it. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1781.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1782.0s)]
*  Like normal, right? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1783.0s)]
*  Yeah, like normal. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1784.0s)]
*  Like a normal human. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1785.0s)]
*  I mean, when I was a kid, I remember the answering machine being a big deal. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1786.0s)]
*  We were like, whoa. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1791.0s)]
*  We never had one at our house. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1792.0s)]
*  Someone could call you and leave a message? [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1793.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1795.0s)]
*  No, that was advanced. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1796.0s)]
*  That was way too advanced. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1797.0s)]
*  I think I was in high school when it happened or somewhere around then. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1799.0s)]
*  And I remember we got one at my house. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1804.0s)]
*  I was like, whoa. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1805.0s)]
*  And you would come home and you'd see like a little light flashing that showed you had a message. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1807.0s)]
*  I was like, this is crazy. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1811.0s)]
*  I remember when we got our first push phone. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1813.0s)]
*  When you didn't have to write or redire it. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1815.0s)]
*  And I was like, it is so much faster now. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1817.0s)]
*  And you don't go crazy. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1820.0s)]
*  Talk about punching a wall. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1821.0s)]
*  If you get through all those digits, then you fuck up the last one like, ahhhh. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1822.0s)]
*  Like I remember hating to call people that had eights and nines in their numbers. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1827.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1831.0s)]
*  They took a long time. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1832.0s)]
*  Forget about that. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1833.0s)]
*  Nines took forever. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1834.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1835.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1836.0s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1837.0s)]
*  People will never know that. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1838.0s)]
*  They think it's novel. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1840.0s)]
*  It's like people who like using typewriters. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1841.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm a novelist. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1843.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm an old timey person. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1844.0s)]
*  With the fucking white out on the paper. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1846.0s)]
*  The fuck out of here, stupid. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1849.0s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of amazing. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1851.0s)]
*  Typewriters existed forever. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1854.0s)]
*  Then all of a sudden there's a word processor and it like says, didn't you mean this word? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1856.0s)]
*  You're like, oh, my God. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1860.0s)]
*  Yeah, I did mean that word. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1861.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1862.0s)]
*  It's like you barely even like when I write in Microsoft Word, I am stunned at how often it just like corrects for me. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1863.0s)]
*  Or I could just hit tab and like I'm halfway into the word and offers a suggestion. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1871.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1876.0s)]
*  Yep, that's it. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1877.0s)]
*  Like I get four letters in and it's like suggestion. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1878.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1881.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1882.0s)]
*  Well, and Gmail does it now for the whole sentence. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1883.0s)]
*  Yes, that's wild. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1884.0s)]
*  When you get an email and it gives you a potential response like, oh, boy. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1886.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, the government is like completely reading everything you say. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1891.0s)]
*  Everything you say. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1896.0s)]
*  Did you see that Tucker Carlson said that the the NSA got into his signal? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1898.0s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1904.0s)]
*  Yeah, his signal app, because he was about to have a conversation with Putin. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1905.0s)]
*  They were trying to set up a conversation with Putin and the government called him up. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1909.0s)]
*  And then I can't we know you're setting up a conversation with Putin. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1914.0s)]
*  We saw through your signal app and he was like, what? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1917.0s)]
*  Like, I didn't even fucking know they could do that. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1920.0s)]
*  That's what he was saying. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1923.0s)]
*  I assume they could do that because I had a conversation with Gavin De Becker and he essentially said that through Pegasus software, it's Pegasus 2.0. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1924.0s)]
*  He said Pegasus one, you needed to click a link and that's how they got Bezos. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1932.0s)]
*  That's how what's the guy's name from Saudi Arabia got Bezos. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1936.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1941.0s)]
*  But Pegasus two, they just need your phone number. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1942.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1946.0s)]
*  Like your all this idea of encryption like, oh, you use an encryption. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1947.0s)]
*  That shit doesn't mean anything. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1956.0s)]
*  They could just read whatever they want. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1958.0s)]
*  It's really crazy. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1960.0s)]
*  It's the the violation of privacy that's available right now to, by the way, just regular people. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1962.0s)]
*  Here's the thing about it. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1967.0s)]
*  Like, who are these people that work for the government? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1969.0s)]
*  They're people. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1970.0s)]
*  They're just people that make a decision to just look into other people's stuff. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1971.0s)]
*  It's not like these are they're not priests. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1976.0s)]
*  They're not some monk that spent 10 years meditating on a thought on a mountaintop and they've achieved an extraordinary level of consciousness. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1979.0s)]
*  No, these are just fucking regular dorks who jerk off in the bathroom on their lunch break. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1989.0s)]
*  And these guys have access to all your emails. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1994.0s)]
*  And it's a real problem. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1997.0s)]
*  It's a real problem that I don't think most people are even available or aware of. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=1999.0s)]
*  It's a giant issue that we experience right now with this like this whole digital world. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2004.0s)]
*  And I don't know how much you fucked with chat GPT at all. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2010.0s)]
*  Quite a bit. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2014.0s)]
*  I mean, I've been trying to get onto GPT four now because I'm told that it's a significant upgrade. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2016.0s)]
*  Significant upgrade. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2022.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2023.0s)]
*  Because I was not impressed with chat GPT on questions that required like I'll give an example. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2024.0s)]
*  Like I asked it between Sugar Ray Leonard, Marvin Hagler, Tommy Hearns and Roberto Duran. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2031.0s)]
*  Explain who you think is the best boxer of that era. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2040.0s)]
*  I can't remember, but it was so dumb, Joe, that I was like, this is not a helpful answer. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2043.0s)]
*  Like it basically said, well, you know, Tommy Hearns beat Roberto Duran and like it just basically recited a bunch of facts, but it couldn't come up with anything. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2051.0s)]
*  I then asked it. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2060.0s)]
*  This was actually really odd. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2061.0s)]
*  I said, what was so special about the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix? [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2064.0s)]
*  That's the one where going into the final race Verstappen and Hamilton were tied even winner take all for the championship that year. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2070.0s)]
*  And it was very controversial ending. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2078.0s)]
*  It was the safety cars. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2080.0s)]
*  So basically, Lewis is leading, Max is in second and then with like a few laps to go. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2082.0s)]
*  Who spun out? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2089.0s)]
*  I think Nikkas Latifi hit the wall, which needed a safety car. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2090.0s)]
*  And in the process, there's a rule that says every lapped car should be able to un-lap itself for the restart, but they only let the cars between Hamilton and Verstappen un-lap themselves. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2094.0s)]
*  So Verstappen had already pitted. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2109.0s)]
*  He got soft tires. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2111.0s)]
*  What is un-lap? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2112.0s)]
*  So the lead by the end of a race, usually the leaders have actually lapped the back markers of the field. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2113.0s)]
*  So un-lap means they get to go ahead of the leader to un-lap themselves and catch the tail again because the cars are all going so slow under a safety car. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2119.0s)]
*  I see. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2128.0s)]
*  And anyway, the point is it was super controversial. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2130.0s)]
*  If not for the way the stewards had interpreted the rule, Hamilton probably would have won the race. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2134.0s)]
*  But instead Verstappen won because he was on better tires. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2140.0s)]
*  So even though he was behind, it wasn't it was like he smoked Hamilton in the last lap. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2143.0s)]
*  So he had newer tires. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2147.0s)]
*  He had new tires. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2149.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2150.0s)]
*  He had switched his tires at the beginning of that crash. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2151.0s)]
*  So I asked chat GPT to sort of tell me what it was. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2153.0s)]
*  I didn't want to allude to it. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2158.0s)]
*  I just said, what was special about that race? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2159.0s)]
*  This is the part that blew my mind. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2161.0s)]
*  Not only did it not know, it confabulated the whole thing. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2163.0s)]
*  It literally made up nonsense. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2167.0s)]
*  Oh, it got some things right. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2170.0s)]
*  This was the last race of the twenty twenty one season. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2172.0s)]
*  And going in, you know, Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton were even on points. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2174.0s)]
*  And then it went off the rails, dude. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2179.0s)]
*  It was like it just in the middle of the race, there was a safety car that did this. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2180.0s)]
*  It's like, no, there wasn't. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2185.0s)]
*  And it actually got it wrong. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2186.0s)]
*  It's had Lewis one. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2187.0s)]
*  And in doing so became the first ever eight time world champion. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2189.0s)]
*  And I'm like, wow, wow. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2193.0s)]
*  It's like the confidence with which you spewed all of those lies is amazing. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2195.0s)]
*  So this is three point five. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2200.0s)]
*  This was so I did this probably like a month ago. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2202.0s)]
*  So I don't know what must have been three point. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2205.0s)]
*  Yeah. Was that what it was? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2207.0s)]
*  Was it three or three point five a month ago? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2208.0s)]
*  Because it changed multiple times for the newer version within like the last two weeks. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2210.0s)]
*  But no, not everyone can use it still. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2216.0s)]
*  I'm not good enough to use it because I've tried. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2218.0s)]
*  I can't get it. You can't get it. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2220.0s)]
*  Why not? I don't know. Every time I try, they don't like it. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2222.0s)]
*  Yeah, clearly not. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2224.0s)]
*  You must talk some shit. I must. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2225.0s)]
*  Maybe they heard you talk about three point five. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2227.0s)]
*  They're like, so what? No, four for you. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2229.0s)]
*  It's you would never be able to get that was that's an interesting thing. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2231.0s)]
*  That's an interesting thing. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2235.0s)]
*  Like when it comes to the boxing analogy or the question, like how would you quantify like because experts like you and I love boxing. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2236.0s)]
*  But if we had a conversation about who's better, like who would you say? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2245.0s)]
*  Of that era? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2248.0s)]
*  Tommy Hearn, Sugar Ray Leonard or Roberto Duran? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2249.0s)]
*  I put Hagler first. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2251.0s)]
*  Me too. Yeah, I agree. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2252.0s)]
*  I think he was the best because he he beat everybody. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2254.0s)]
*  And the only reason why I wouldn't put Duran ahead of Hagler is that Duran. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2258.0s)]
*  Duran was fighting. Duran wasn't a natural middleweight. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2264.0s)]
*  He was a hundred thirty five pounder. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2266.0s)]
*  Yeah. If you go back to like Ken Buchanan, when he fought Ken Buchanan at 135, he was a fucking monster. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2268.0s)]
*  He was a he was a beast all the way up to welterweight. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2274.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, insane. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2276.0s)]
*  And even in welterweight. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2277.0s)]
*  And then, you know, the second fight with Sugar Ray Leonard really. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2278.0s)]
*  No, no, no. Hearn's won that fight. That's a disaster. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2284.0s)]
*  No, no. Leonard and Duran. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2286.0s)]
*  Yeah. The second fight's a disaster because Duran got fat and was partying and he had a fucking lion that was on a chain. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2290.0s)]
*  He was walking up Panama. He was out of his fucking mind. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2298.0s)]
*  And he just partied too much and they gave him like six weeks to prepare for an enormous fight. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2301.0s)]
*  Didn't he lose like 40 pounds in six weeks or something? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2307.0s)]
*  Well, he looks like shit, too. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2310.0s)]
*  Like you look at his body, the difference is the way his body looked in the first fight. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2311.0s)]
*  The first fight, he was like a live wire. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2314.0s)]
*  I mean, he was just an animal. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2317.0s)]
*  I mean, he attacked with such ferocity, such fucking technique and just rough Leonard up and battered him and did to Leonard what nobody anticipated. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2318.0s)]
*  You know, and Leonard, for whatever reason, decided to try to stand with them, which is crazy. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2329.0s)]
*  So Leonard have a far better approach in the second fight. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2334.0s)]
*  But he also was facing a Duran that just really fucked up. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2336.0s)]
*  And that does the days he had to weigh in the day of the fight, too, which is crazy. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2341.0s)]
*  And I thought I'll tell you, I don't think Leonard beat Hearns in the second fight. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2346.0s)]
*  That was a draw. I mean, I think that was an awful. Yeah, I think so, too. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2351.0s)]
*  And I don't think I beat Hagler. No, I don't. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2354.0s)]
*  I've scored that fight 115, 113 for Hagler four times across 20 years. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2356.0s)]
*  Like I watch it about every four years and I keep coming back 115, 113. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2360.0s)]
*  And it bums me out like it just just I always think like Hagler doesn't quite get the do. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2366.0s)]
*  I think Hagler was, you know, I think Hagler, Monzahn, you know, Hopkins, Robinson. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2371.0s)]
*  I mean, they're the greatest middleweights of all time. Yeah. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2378.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would agree. Yeah. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2380.0s)]
*  I think I mean, Hagler has a special place in my heart because did you ever meet him? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2382.0s)]
*  No, I wish I did. God damn it. No, no, he's one I really wish I met. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2386.0s)]
*  Yeah, me too. He was such a hero of mine. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2391.0s)]
*  Like as a kid, like I was so obsessed with him when I was 13. Me too. Same thing. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2393.0s)]
*  For me, it was his discipline. Yep. Never got out of shape. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2398.0s)]
*  Shows up in camp in shape at weight. Yeah. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2401.0s)]
*  And you wear that hat. It's his war on it. Yeah. Oh, God. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2404.0s)]
*  He scared everybody. And also he had the greatest chin. Greatest chin. Amazing counterpuncher. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2408.0s)]
*  Yeah. The one roll down knockdown is horseshit. No, that's a fake knockdown. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2413.0s)]
*  It wasn't a knockdown. He got kind of pushed down. They call it a knockdown. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2417.0s)]
*  He took a shot better than anybody that's ever existed. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2420.0s)]
*  He took a shot from John the Beast Mugabe that snapped his head back and he's like, yeah, whatever. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2423.0s)]
*  And just fucking stayed on him. Look at the first round of Hagler-Herns. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2429.0s)]
*  Oh my God. And the Herns just threw missiles at him. Just boom, boom. I watched that again just two days ago. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2432.0s)]
*  No way. Yeah. I don't think I've watched that fight in about five years. God, I need to go back and watch it. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2440.0s)]
*  It's so crazy to see two guys at the very top of the heap, the best in the world, just throwing caution to the wind and winging punches at each other. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2446.0s)]
*  It was so crazy. And Hagler just forced Herns into a dogfight. Yep. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2458.0s)]
*  Because Hagler knew, like, you know, do you know Hagler had extraordinary musculature on the side of his head that was so thick that it was almost like he was built with head gear on? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2463.0s)]
*  No, I didn't know that. Yeah, it's crazy. Like, see if you can find an article on that. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2475.0s)]
*  But they did an MRI on Hagler's head while he was alive. And one of the things that they said is like the amount of like the mandible muscles, the muscles that like, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2478.0s)]
*  or temporalis muscle. Yeah. Is that what it is? Yeah. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2488.0s)]
*  That they're so thick, they're like three times normal size. They're like, it's crazy. It's like he was born to fight. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2491.0s)]
*  But it's also his his will and the conditioning. His conditioning was legendary. Yeah. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2498.0s)]
*  Who'd run with combat boots on the winter on the beach. I mean, he was just I just did everything to emulate Hagler when I was a kid. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2505.0s)]
*  It was just and when he quote unquote lost to Sugar Ray Leonard, I was in eighth grade and all the girls in my class to tease me, put bags of sugar on my desk the next day. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2512.0s)]
*  Oh my god. It was just like, you know, those dirty bitches. I was so pissed. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2524.0s)]
*  I always felt when I watched that fight like Hagler was holding back. Yeah. So as you know, right, like Leonard bought the fight. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2533.0s)]
*  Right. So basically, and this is the only thing I just wish I could undo in history. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2540.0s)]
*  Hagler was so adamant about making more than Leonard in that fight that he conceded on three things that he shouldn't have conceded on. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2546.0s)]
*  So Leonard is, you know, I don't think Leonard deserved more money than Hagler. Right. He was coming out of retirement. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2553.0s)]
*  He had just been knocked on his ass by Kevin Howard a few years earlier. Right. Like, I don't know why he should be top bill. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2559.0s)]
*  Hagler was undisputed middleweight champion in the world. But nevertheless, because he's Leonard, the promoters were going to give him more money. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2564.0s)]
*  And Hagler was like, oh, hell no. I get paid the most. And in exchange, he conceded to the following bigger gloves, larger ring, twelve instead of fifteen rounds. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2570.0s)]
*  Leonard got three out of three things that he wanted. Now, just imagine any one of those things is undone. I thought they had already stopped doing 15. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2582.0s)]
*  No, this was the this would have been the end of it. So it was the summer of 87 when the IBF switched to 12 rounds. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2589.0s)]
*  So that's right after Duk Koo Kim died. No, Duk Koo Kim died in 82. Really? Yeah. So one of the federations, one of the three had already thought that was when they ended it. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2596.0s)]
*  No, one of them had switched to 12. But because Hagler was undisputed, this still could have been a 15 round fight. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2607.0s)]
*  And so just think about how that fight's different with three more rounds. Yeah. Or with smaller gloves or with a smaller ring. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2613.0s)]
*  Smaller gloves made a big impact. Were they were they 10s? I can't remember if they were 10s instead of 12s or eights instead of 10s. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2619.0s)]
*  But it was, you know, it can't be 12s, right? I don't remember. I used to know every detail of this. 12s is so big. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2626.0s)]
*  Yeah. Especially when I think of MMA with four, you know, MMA's have those little tiny little gloves on. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2634.0s)]
*  They're doing a lot of fights in one FC now where they have kickboxing matches with MMA gloves. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2642.0s)]
*  It's wild. You ever meet Benny the Jet, your Ketus? No, I have not. That's another dude. Yeah. That was my kickboxing idol. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2649.0s)]
*  Yeah, mine as well. I'd like to get him on the podcast. I've talked about getting him on. I got to reach out. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2655.0s)]
*  I met his cousin, Blinky. Blinky Rodriguez. When I was living in California, when I first moved there, there's two places that I had to go to. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2660.0s)]
*  One was a comedy store and two was the Jet Center. And I went to the Jet Center when I moved there in 94. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2671.0s)]
*  And it was right after the big earthquake. And the building that the Jet Center was in got fucked up by the earthquake. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2677.0s)]
*  And the problem was when the rain season came, the building was a mess because it just started leaking everywhere. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2684.0s)]
*  It got really cracked open and they had to move. So then they moved to North Hollywood. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2690.0s)]
*  And I trained there for a while, too, but it just wasn't the same. The Jet Center in Van Nuys was where it was at. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2695.0s)]
*  And Blinky, who I believe had lost his son to gang violence. I hope I'm not fucking this up. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2702.0s)]
*  But he, because of that, had this sort of outreach program where he would work with all the gang members. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2711.0s)]
*  And so I was sparring with these hardcore gang members and I was good. So it was a real problem. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2717.0s)]
*  So I was like, you know, I was still 26 at the time, somewhere around then. So it was only like a few years, five years removed from me fighting. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2725.0s)]
*  And so I was still sparring and I was still training on a regular basis. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2735.0s)]
*  And I'd get in there with these like hardcore gang members with like just covered in tattoos. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2740.0s)]
*  But they had no skills. And, you know, I just be real nice to them. Just like, please don't fucking shoot me after this. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2746.0s)]
*  You know, I remember dropping this guy with a body shot and going, oh, no. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2753.0s)]
*  And then he got up and he's like, yeah, it's a good shot. Good shot. I was like, thank you. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2758.0s)]
*  But he he would have these guys come in that were, you know, like right off the street and try to give them some focus and give them something that they could they could do to, you know, channel their aggressive energy and also give them some self-esteem, like develop like some skills. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2765.0s)]
*  And, you know, and they had a real idol in Blinky like Blinky Rodriguez. I don't know if you ever saw him fight, but he was a bad man. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2781.0s)]
*  He was the first guy to knock out Jean-Yves Theriot. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2789.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2792.0s)]
*  Yeah. When Jean-Yves Theriot was what a blast from the past. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2793.0s)]
*  Yeah. Jean-Yves Theriot was the fucking man. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2796.0s)]
*  And Blinky knocked him out with a left hook. I mean, flatlined him. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2799.0s)]
*  See, we can find that Blinky Rodriguez, K.O.'s Jean-Yves Theriot. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2803.0s)]
*  It was in the pants days, the pants kickboxing days. We had to wear pants. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2809.0s)]
*  Yeah. It wasn't like the I love the panties. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2813.0s)]
*  Remember Bill Wallace? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2816.0s)]
*  Yes. But he was a fucking man. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2817.0s)]
*  Is he still alive? Yes, he is. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2820.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's still throwing kicks. So here it is. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2821.0s)]
*  Like, look how bad the fucking the VHS is. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2824.0s)]
*  Yeah. Look at this. So Jean-Yves Theriot. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2827.0s)]
*  Oh, that looks like a leg kick. Was that a leg kick? It's hard to tell. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2831.0s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about like the 1980s. Yeah, it was a leg kick. Interesting. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2836.0s)]
*  That's interesting because they're leg kicking with pants on. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2841.0s)]
*  Really unusual, right? But so this fight, I don't remember. Yeah, they're throwing. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2847.0s)]
*  Oh, there it is. Look at that. So he threw a low kick with the right and then left hooked him. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2855.0s)]
*  Show that one more time. So watch this. It's a beautiful setup. Boom. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2861.0s)]
*  So he spun him around with the low kick and then flatlined them. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2867.0s)]
*  And Jean-Yves Theriot went on to be like a absolute destroyer. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2871.0s)]
*  I mean, he was like one of the very best kickboxers of that era and just would fucking kill people. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2876.0s)]
*  He was so good. But that fight, Blinky Rodriguez flatlined him. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2883.0s)]
*  And Blinky was kind of like, you know, he was a legend in the kickboxing world. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2888.0s)]
*  And he did a lot of commentary, too. I remember listening to a lot of commentary he did for kickboxing. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2892.0s)]
*  But that gym was, you know, like if you talk about like all time famous kickboxing gyms in the United States, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2896.0s)]
*  that's probably number one, right? I think so. Yeah. I mean, when I was a kid, that was like that. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2905.0s)]
*  And that seemed like the only place to go. Yeah. Yeah. Benny was I mean, his fucking style was amazing. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2911.0s)]
*  He was so aggressive. He was so he had such an incredible technique, too. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2919.0s)]
*  And he was like one of the first guys that like was that entered into kickboxing that got he was so good that he got people paying attention. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2924.0s)]
*  It wasn't a lot of people paying attention to kickboxing back then. Yeah. Unless you're dorks like us. Yeah. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2934.0s)]
*  Unless you're dorks like us. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't even know about Muay Thai. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2939.0s)]
*  I didn't know anybody that fought Muay Thai until I was doing regular kickboxing in 1988. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2944.0s)]
*  And there's this dude who I was friends with who was training at this one gym where this guy was going back and forth to Thailand. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2951.0s)]
*  I was like, why is he going to Thailand? I was like, he goes over there and fights. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2958.0s)]
*  He goes over there and trains and lives there for a few months and fights. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2962.0s)]
*  And I thought this guy was the craziest guy I'd ever met. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2965.0s)]
*  This dude from Massachusetts who just would go over to Thailand and he would train for many months at a time. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2967.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, in 1988, I was like, what is he doing? [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2973.0s)]
*  Like, yeah, he sleeps on the floor, lives in Thailand and goes to a temple every day. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2977.0s)]
*  I'm like, fuck. I spent two years doing Muay Thai in college and absolutely loved it. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2981.0s)]
*  But man, it's a different level of pain. Oh, yeah. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2988.0s)]
*  It's a totally different level of pain. Leg pain is not fun. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2992.0s)]
*  And then the next day. Yeah, it's I mean, basically, I was like the thing I had going for me is I had a really good spinning back kick. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=2996.0s)]
*  Right. So you could bring that from Taekwondo. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3006.0s)]
*  And so it kept the opponents a little bit less eager to get that close. Right. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3008.0s)]
*  And so but of course, as you know, like you have to be you have to be able to keep that front foot so light. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3014.0s)]
*  Otherwise, it's just going to get ripped off. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3019.0s)]
*  Well, that's the thing about MMA is that like you can't like very few people have that Thai style. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3021.0s)]
*  And then, I mean, Khalil Rountree is probably the very best example, especially in the Eric Anders fight. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3028.0s)]
*  He went to Thailand, went over there, like became after Johnny Walker knocked out, became obsessed with Muay Thai and came over. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3034.0s)]
*  And then when he fought Eric Anders, everybody was like, Jesus Christ, look at Khalil. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3043.0s)]
*  He was like he looked like a Thai fighter, like is like really light on the front leg and like these crazy kicks. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3047.0s)]
*  He just became obsessed with Muay Thai. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3052.0s)]
*  But most fighters, they're they're like they're doing things to mitigate leg kicks, like switching stances or throwing a lot of feints. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3054.0s)]
*  But because of the takedown defense and because of also the takedowns themselves, like you've got to kind of incorporate a different stance. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3061.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, yeah, because because it's a very exposed stance, right? [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3069.0s)]
*  If a guy is not going to fight that style, right? [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3074.0s)]
*  Because you have to be kind of front facing to be able to stay light on that. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3077.0s)]
*  Especially wrestlers. I mean, if a guy fights with a Thai style with a very light front leg of the wrestler, he's just going to fucking power double him into the corner. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3080.0s)]
*  And that's a that's a wrap. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3090.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's so interesting to me like watching MMA, like how people are trying to incorporate all these different techniques. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3092.0s)]
*  And there's all these adjustments that have to be made when new new techniques come into play, like the calf kick, like the calf kick has kind of changed most of MMA because it's so devastating. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3102.0s)]
*  It's like one of those techniques where you get a couple of those and all sudden your leg is screwed up. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3114.0s)]
*  Like you can't really move good anymore. Even if it looks like you can move good, you you're really kind of hobbling on that one. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3119.0s)]
*  You're you're masking it with, you know, switching of stances and moving. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3125.0s)]
*  But you're in agony. You're in agony. Your left leg is just completely fucked. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3129.0s)]
*  And I feel so fortunate that I somehow escaped 10 years of getting hit without more damage. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3133.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that too. I mean, I don't know how much damage I actually have, though. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3139.0s)]
*  Sometimes I wonder about like how many concussions do you ever get? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3143.0s)]
*  Do you know? Oh, I've had a lot. I have no idea. I have no idea. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3146.0s)]
*  I got one skiing a couple of years ago, my last time skiing. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3151.0s)]
*  I'm like, I'm done. I fucked my knee up and I fucking banged my head hard. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3154.0s)]
*  Some lady who was like really new and she didn't know what she was doing. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3161.0s)]
*  And she's like kind of sliding into the middle of the trail. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3165.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, Jesus Christ, I came around this corner. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3169.0s)]
*  And as I come around this corner, this lady is just like sliding into the trail. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3172.0s)]
*  And these either kill her or fall down. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3176.0s)]
*  And so I went to try to get around her. I knew I was going to fall anyway. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3180.0s)]
*  I couldn't. There's no way I just couldn't adjust quick enough. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3183.0s)]
*  And I fucking skis went out from under me, banged my head, back of my head off the ground. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3185.0s)]
*  And then the whole rest of the day, I was just like confused and like I couldn't. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3191.0s)]
*  My coordination was off. Everything was screwy. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3196.0s)]
*  Like I went to get on the chairlift and I fell like an old man and I couldn't get back up. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3199.0s)]
*  The lady had to help me up. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3204.0s)]
*  And I was like, what is wrong with me? And I'm like, hey, stupid, you have a concussion. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3207.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, OK. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3210.0s)]
*  I had a really bad one in 93. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3213.0s)]
*  And it actually it was so bad that you could see the cerebral contusions on my head. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3217.0s)]
*  I had a CT scan and I was for two to three months. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3222.0s)]
*  I had a headache. It wouldn't go away for two to three months. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3228.0s)]
*  How did you get it? [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3231.0s)]
*  Sparring. Yeah, I used to do this dumb thing where I was a middleweight. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3233.0s)]
*  So I would fight. I would spar two rounds with a welterweight, two rounds with a middleweight, two rounds with a light heavyweight. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3238.0s)]
*  So I wanted to kind of so each the opponent would be fresh for two rounds. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3245.0s)]
*  So I was getting more and more tired as the opponent is getting stronger but slower. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3249.0s)]
*  Were you competing? No, I had stopped competing by this point. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3253.0s)]
*  So there was literally no reason for me to be doing this. This was so dumb. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3256.0s)]
*  This is like I was in college at this point. Right. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3259.0s)]
*  So I'm a college student who would still train really, really hard. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3261.0s)]
*  And on the fifth round, so the first round with that guy who's a light heavyweight, I remember his name was Mike. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3265.0s)]
*  And this was a even by the standards of a light heavyweight, he hit like a mule. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3272.0s)]
*  He just was he was he was he's such a hard shot. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3276.0s)]
*  And I just on that particular day, I was just not feeling good. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3279.0s)]
*  But I just didn't listen to myself. Right. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3283.0s)]
*  I was like, you're going to finish these six rounds no matter what, even though I felt horrible. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3284.0s)]
*  And he got me with straight right after straight right after straight right. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3288.0s)]
*  And at the end of those six rounds, I went down to cool off on the speed bag. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3293.0s)]
*  And just, you know, for people watching who don't know what that's like, like hitting a speed bag, you shouldn't feel anything. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3299.0s)]
*  Like there's no weight to the dumb thing. Right. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3304.0s)]
*  But just the impact of the side of my hand on the speed bag made it feel like I was getting kicked in the head. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3306.0s)]
*  Oh, God. And, you know, I went home that day, passed out, had no recollection of anything, got up the next day to run, couldn't run. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3312.0s)]
*  I mean, so finally two days of this. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3321.0s)]
*  And I told sheepishly told my parents, I'm like, I think something's wrong. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3324.0s)]
*  You know, so anyway, we go to the hospital, I get a CT scan. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3328.0s)]
*  They're like, you've got, you know, contusions on your brain. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3331.0s)]
*  And they were like, wait a minute, you're an engineering student? [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3335.0s)]
*  Like, what the hell are you doing? Yeah. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3339.0s)]
*  And I was like, dude, I've been doing this for like 10 years. I know what I'm doing. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3341.0s)]
*  They're like, you're an idiot. Yeah. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3344.0s)]
*  I know quite a few students who were in college who were also actively sparring in MMA and I'd watch them get after it. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3346.0s)]
*  And I knew that, you know, they relied on their brain and this was just for fun. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3354.0s)]
*  I was like, God, it's such a risky endeavor. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3359.0s)]
*  It's so dangerous because you're going to get hit. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3361.0s)]
*  It's not like anything like even in skiing, like falling down and hitting your head like that is kind of rare. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3364.0s)]
*  Like it only happened to me once or all the years years ago skiing. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3369.0s)]
*  But getting hit in the head happens every time you spar, unless you're like so exceptional and Willie Papp, your fucking Purnell Whitaker out there. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3372.0s)]
*  Wilford Benitez. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3382.0s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. I was watching. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3383.0s)]
*  Well, even Wilford Benitez got stopped, you know, I was watching Willie Papp. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3385.0s)]
*  There was a documentary or a YouTube video rather on Willie Papp and he actually was fine and lucid as he was older, which is really interesting. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3389.0s)]
*  Like that guy had more than 200 fights. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3400.0s)]
*  Isn't it amazing? Like how much those guys fought back? Oh, my God. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3404.0s)]
*  But you look like Sugar Ray Robinson when he was older. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3407.0s)]
*  So sad. It was such a shame. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3410.0s)]
*  Henry Armstrong was OK at the end of his life, wasn't he? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3413.0s)]
*  Was he? I think so. That guy was amazing. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3415.0s)]
*  George Foreman seems fine. Yeah. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3417.0s)]
*  It's crazy. You know, you know, of all those old timers, if I could go back and meet any of them, I'd like to have met Dempsey. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3419.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah. I bet it was like you meet a wolf. Yeah. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3427.0s)]
*  I bet he was like a wolf. He just seemed so savage. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3430.0s)]
*  Like I when I was young, I was obsessed with the historical boxing. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3434.0s)]
*  Like I would sort of track down the old VHS of like Jack Johnson, Jack Dempsey, Joe Lewis, all that stuff. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3438.0s)]
*  I had not all of their fights, but quite a few of their fights on crappy old black and white VHS. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3444.0s)]
*  But like Dempsey was in a different world. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3450.0s)]
*  Like when you think about how much he changed the sport, he fought Jess Willard. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3454.0s)]
*  That was an overnight change in boxing that never went back. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3459.0s)]
*  Because remember, prior to that, very different style. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3462.0s)]
*  Right. You look at Jack Johnson. It was like they never threw combinations. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3465.0s)]
*  Right. It was like one punch, one punch. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3468.0s)]
*  Well, they also fought like a hundred rounds. Yeah, exactly. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3470.0s)]
*  Which is crazy. They had to like preserve their. Yeah. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3473.0s)]
*  It was it was easily a 45 round fight. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3476.0s)]
*  They're fighting in like Cuba in the summer. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3479.0s)]
*  But then you ever see the video when Jack Johnson fought for the title where they converted? [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3482.0s)]
*  I think it was Reno. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3488.0s)]
*  They converted the town just to have that event there and all the guys with their hats on. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3490.0s)]
*  So men used to wear those very specific hat. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3496.0s)]
*  It's really weird to watch those old videos. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3500.0s)]
*  And he was he was unbelievable. Oh, my God. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3503.0s)]
*  Again, again, like Jack Johnson was a total step up in size and strength. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3506.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then Dempsey, not that big, but just ferocious. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3511.0s)]
*  Yeah. Dempsey only weighs like 190 pounds. I know. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3516.0s)]
*  So he was like six foot one hundred and ninety five. Rocky Marciano. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3519.0s)]
*  Rocky was probably five, nine. Yeah. Yeah. Five, nine, five, ten. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3522.0s)]
*  He weighed one hundred and eighty five pounds. Yeah. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3526.0s)]
*  And just flatlining people as a heavyweight, which is crazy. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3528.0s)]
*  Now it's different heavyweight, right? Yeah. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3531.0s)]
*  I mean, it's it's people are different than they didn't have food. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3533.0s)]
*  I mean, Jack Johnson, who was they called him the Galveston giant. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3538.0s)]
*  He was six, too. Yeah, he was huge. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3541.0s)]
*  He was huge. I mean, but back then that was a big deal. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3543.0s)]
*  Look at him. Yeah. Look at all those folks with the hats on. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3546.0s)]
*  That's what drives. I mean, that's so weird that that style was so [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3549.0s)]
*  it was so prevalent. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3555.0s)]
*  It was everywhere that wearing that hat, that stupid fucking hat. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3557.0s)]
*  It's night daytime, too, though. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3561.0s)]
*  Maybe they needed it because they didn't have sunglasses. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3563.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Right. Probably. Yeah. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3566.0s)]
*  Yeah. I definitely think that played a part, but they also had one of those hats. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3568.0s)]
*  It's so interesting to think like, you know, when you think about what the world was like in terms of how racist it was and how much the establishment hated Jack Johnson. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3572.0s)]
*  And, you know, as you know, I mean, basically after he finally lost, they were like, OK, that's it. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3582.0s)]
*  No more black heavyweights. And even when you get to fight for the it looked a lot like he threw that fight. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3588.0s)]
*  I know. If you notice his hand, they're shading himself from the sun. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3593.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. You never know. They might have been threatening him. Right. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3597.0s)]
*  Exactly. They were probably there. That was it there at the bottom. I saw that picture. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3600.0s)]
*  Yeah. That one. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3606.0s)]
*  So that's Jess Willard standing over him and he kind of looked like he was like, yeah, I mean, yeah. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3608.0s)]
*  It's it's very likely in a lot of people's eyes that he threw that fight. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3614.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, when you get to a certain point in time, we're just tired of fighting off all these fucking white racists. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3619.0s)]
*  Maybe just take the money and lay down and just just fade off in the distance. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3626.0s)]
*  You just wanted to end. You know, I mean, the guy was persecuted his entire life. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3630.0s)]
*  The level of hate that he experienced, we will probably never be able to understand it because, you know, you're really only a few decades removed from the Civil War. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3635.0s)]
*  And this guy's the heavyweight champ of the world, the first ever black heavyweight champion. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3645.0s)]
*  And also and how big was boxing at the time, like the significance of being a champion of the world? [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3648.0s)]
*  It was everything. And he looks unbeatable. That was the other thing. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3653.0s)]
*  It wasn't just that he was the first black heavyweight champion. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3656.0s)]
*  He was the first black heavyweight champion, but he was like Mike Tyson in his prime. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3660.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's like a whole new level of heavyweight. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3665.0s)]
*  And of course, you know, I mean, we could debate that forever and ever is Ali or Lewis, who is the best heavyweight of all time. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3669.0s)]
*  But I think for I mean, I don't know. I I'm always I always have such sadness over the fact that we never got to see Ali fight from sixty seven to seventy one. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3678.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's true that those three years where he protested the Vietnam War in many ways that cemented Ali's legacy because he was such a cultural icon that he was like, you know what? [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3687.0s)]
*  Fuck you. I'm not going to Vietnam. You guys are out of your fucking minds. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3698.0s)]
*  And that no Viet Cong ever said anything bad to me. I'm not going to Vietnam and killing people. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3702.0s)]
*  Fuck you. And they just removed him from boxing. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3706.0s)]
*  They wouldn't let him box for years. And by the time he boxed again, people were so happy to see him again because they knew he was right. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3710.0s)]
*  They knew that war was bullshit. They knew it was wrong. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3719.0s)]
*  And he he became who he was. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3723.0s)]
*  The last when he fought Cleveland, big cat, William, I was just about to say, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3727.0s)]
*  that is the greatest display of in any division, any weight at any time. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3731.0s)]
*  Just watch Ali versus Williams November 1966. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3737.0s)]
*  You can find that full fight on YouTube. It's a pretty decent resolution. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3742.0s)]
*  We've played it multiple times on this podcast. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3745.0s)]
*  It is insane. I'll tell you a funny story. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3747.0s)]
*  So I have I used to have in my old office in San Diego, a big art print on the wall of that fight. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3749.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. So of the knockout punch. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3755.0s)]
*  So one day it was a Friday afternoon. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3758.0s)]
*  One of my analysts was in my office and we were at the time he's probably like 25 years old. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3761.0s)]
*  Right. And we're doing something. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3766.0s)]
*  And I don't know what made me think this, but I looked up at the picture and I was like, hey, do you know who that is? [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3769.0s)]
*  Who? You know, and he's like, is that Muhammad Ali? [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3774.0s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, that's Muhammad Ali. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3779.0s)]
*  Like, isn't it interesting that you wouldn't immediately recognize that? [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3781.0s)]
*  And I explained the significance and I said, that's him knocking out this guy named Cleveland Williams. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3785.0s)]
*  And this is the whole story of Cleveland Williams. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3789.0s)]
*  And I said, let's pull up the fight and we watch the fight. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3790.0s)]
*  You know, it's a three round fight. The next day, Ali died. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3792.0s)]
*  Wow. So I text I emailed him the next morning because I found out that morning. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3795.0s)]
*  I was like, hey, Dan, just so you know, Muhammad Ali died last night. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3799.0s)]
*  How weird is that? That is where he was a cautionary tale. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3802.0s)]
*  Right. Because the amount of punishment that he endured late in his life and to see him with Parkinson's. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3806.0s)]
*  When you know, I remember having this argument with someone who said, no, no, no, he's got Parkinson's. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3812.0s)]
*  He says nothing to do with boxing. I was shut the fuck up. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3816.0s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. You don't know what you're. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3819.0s)]
*  Why? How? What are you examining him? [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3821.0s)]
*  Like why you saying you just don't want it to have anything to do with you. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3824.0s)]
*  You watch his fight with Larry Holmes. Tell me. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3827.0s)]
*  Tell me you don't think that he endured brain damage in that fight. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3830.0s)]
*  Watch. Watch his fight with who else? [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3834.0s)]
*  So basically everything. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3837.0s)]
*  Trevor Burbick. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3838.0s)]
*  Yeah, Trevor Burbick, even Leon Spinks. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3839.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3842.0s)]
*  And certainly Holmes. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3843.0s)]
*  I mean, he never should have fought after his. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3844.0s)]
*  He should have retired after Foreman. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3847.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3849.0s)]
*  Because the beatings he took thereafter. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3850.0s)]
*  And in fact, going into the Holmes fight, I mean, his doctor, by that point, Fertipocheco had left. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3853.0s)]
*  He couldn't stand it anymore. So Fertipocheco was no longer his doctor. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3858.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3861.0s)]
*  No, no. He was like, this is so unethical. I cannot be involved. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3862.0s)]
*  What you guys are doing to this man is inhumane. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3865.0s)]
*  And of course, you know, what was what was his manager's name at this point? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3868.0s)]
*  Herbert Mohammed. Remember, the son of Elijah Mohammed was still his manager. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3872.0s)]
*  And they had pumped him so full of T4, levofiroxine, thyroid medication to speed up his metabolism. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3876.0s)]
*  Like he went into that fight basically with exophthalmos. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3884.0s)]
*  I mean, his eyes were like basically bulging out of his head. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3888.0s)]
*  He was so hyperthyroid in that fight. Like they could have killed him. Right. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3890.0s)]
*  Like they could have just killed him because he would have had an arrhythmia. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3893.0s)]
*  Why did they do that? Was he overweight? Why did they do that with T4? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3895.0s)]
*  They just had this belief that, oh, he needs more thyroid hormone to speed up his metabolism. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3899.0s)]
*  And of course, he's always going into camp overweight at this point and needs more energy. Right. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3904.0s)]
*  So the thinking is, well, more thyroid hormone will make him make him have more energy. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3908.0s)]
*  But I mean, I remember reading one of the biographies of Ali. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3913.0s)]
*  I think it was Thomas Hauser's biography where he goes into pretty good detail [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3917.0s)]
*  on the state of his medical care at the end of his career and just how horrible it was. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3922.0s)]
*  God, it's a story as old as time. The fighter that keeps hanging on. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3929.0s)]
*  That's the other thing I kind of respect about Hagler. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3935.0s)]
*  As much as I just hated the fact that he retired and didn't come back and smoke Leonard, he just said, that's it. I'm done. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3937.0s)]
*  Yeah. But that's also what fueled the conspiracy theorist in me because he went to Italy. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3945.0s)]
*  Because I'm like, hold the fuck on. So his managers and his trainers were the Petronelli brothers. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3950.0s)]
*  That's right. Goodie and Pat. Yeah. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3956.0s)]
*  They're boxing trainers who are fucking Italian shit. The odds of them knowing someone in the mob are quite high. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3958.0s)]
*  OK. And then you have this fight with Leonard where, man, even to me watching it, because I watched it. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3966.0s)]
*  That was back when they had closed circuit. Yeah. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3974.0s)]
*  So for people that don't know what that means, you would go to the movie theater or you would go to any kind of a theater that would have a large screen. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3977.0s)]
*  And you would pay money to go watch the fight in an audience. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3984.0s)]
*  And so I actually watched quite a few fights like that. I watched Tyson Spinks like that. Oh, wow. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3988.0s)]
*  How good a use of money was that? Wow. Yeah. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3993.0s)]
*  Ninety one seconds. Whatever it was. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3996.0s)]
*  But watching that live, I was like, I feel like he's not trying to hurt him. It was weird. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=3999.0s)]
*  It was like the punches didn't seem the same. It almost seemed like he was like taking something off the punches. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4006.0s)]
*  Certainly the first four rounds. The first four rounds, I didn't understand where he was being tentative. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4014.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, because he woke up in round five. Yeah. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4020.0s)]
*  In a 12 round fight. You know, he's like I said, I still believe he won. Yeah, I believe he won seven rounds. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4024.0s)]
*  I was shocked at the decision after it's over. But I remember going home thinking, God, just seemed like he didn't have any pop on his punches, which for Hagler is crazy because Hagler was a fucking murderous puncher. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4031.0s)]
*  It just seemed like he didn't didn't try to hurt him. It seems crazy. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4043.0s)]
*  But then the decision comes and then Hagler just disappeared and went to Italy and became a movie star. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4049.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, well, what a great deal. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4055.0s)]
*  How else does he become a fucking movie star in Italy? He goes into Italy, does the worst movies you've ever seen in your life. You ever watch those movies? Never. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4060.0s)]
*  Yeah, here's some of them. They were so dumb. These movies were so dumb. Like, look at this. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4068.0s)]
*  And never fought again, but never fought again. I mean, just he did these cornball movies and, you know, was like the Jean Claude Van Damme of Italy. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4078.0s)]
*  They were horrible movies. I mean, I don't even know if you ever learned Italian. He just had a good fucking time. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4090.0s)]
*  Look at these punches. People are flying through the air. These are so bad. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4099.0s)]
*  You got to remember, like Italy, that was where they punched right through his chest. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4105.0s)]
*  Italy was where they did all those. You're so handsome. Oh, my God. So handsome. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4110.0s)]
*  And, you know, really never never was compromised from his fighting career. Incredible. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4116.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was hospitalized after he got vaccinated. Tommy Hearns put it on his Instagram that he was in the hospital because of a side effect of the vaccine. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4124.0s)]
*  It's one of those things it's like not really talked about because no one's no one's sure if it's that is that what happened? [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4131.0s)]
*  I remember the day he died seeing that. And then I actually was just sort of weird. Like a couple of months ago, I was just thinking about it again. I went to his wiki page. No mention of it. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4138.0s)]
*  Well, that's pretty obvious what's going on there. You know, that's the amount of people that had have had issues with the vaccine versus the amount of people reported. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4148.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know what the real numbers are. I don't think anybody does because there's a lot of reluctance to talk about it. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4158.0s)]
*  It's very interesting. You know, I've had friends that have vaccine injuries and went to the doctor and the doctor didn't want to report him in the various. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4166.0s)]
*  It's the whole thing is very weird. But Tommy Hearns wrote on his Instagram, I think, believe it was his Instagram that to pray for Marvin because they're still friends even after that Marvin was in the hospital because of a side effect of the Vax. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4174.0s)]
*  Again, I don't know if that's true. I don't know if Tommy was wrong. You know, I don't know if he was incorrect. Yeah, but something happened. And he died. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4188.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would have loved to met him. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4197.0s)]
*  But what a great way to end a career. Just go. That's it. Done. See you. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4202.0s)]
*  So many guys just hang out too long. You know, there's so many guys just get battered. Did you watch the Benevita's plant fight this weekend? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4207.0s)]
*  I have stopped watching boxing altogether. I don't know anything about the sport, Joe, to be honest with you. It's really weird for someone who was so obsessed with the sport growing up. Basically, around 2000. I just stopped. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4215.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah. How come? [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4232.0s)]
*  I think part of it is being in residency. I just didn't have the time. Like basically all the things I love. Like I didn't watch Formula One. You know, I kind of stopped watching Formula One at that time. No, I think by 97 was the last year I watched F1 until I got back into it again, like a decade later. Stopped watching boxing. Didn't watch a single Super Bowl, let alone a single football game. Yeah, I just went completely off the grid for a decade. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4234.0s)]
*  I guess that makes sense though. You kind of have to just to focus. You don't have the time for that kind of recreation. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4255.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, I used all my rec time to train. I mean, it was sort of like I was going to sort of swimming was the thing I was doing. So that not takes up so much time. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4263.0s)]
*  Do you still watch UFC? I never have. Never have watched the UFC. I mean, I would love to go with you. You've extended me the invitation many times. I will go at some point. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4272.0s)]
*  You should go to Miami next weekend. I can't. I'm going to see Taylor Swift. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4281.0s)]
*  That's the most opposite UFC thing ever. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4286.0s)]
*  It's so funny that you're a Swifty. You've become a Swifty. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4290.0s)]
*  I'm enjoying embracing and supporting my daughter's obsession with Taylor Swift. We're going to see two shows actually. We're going to Houston and Arlington. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4295.0s)]
*  Oh my goodness. Well, because we got lucky, right? [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4304.0s)]
*  Lucky, right? Like, you get lucky. No, no, for me, stop it. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4306.0s)]
*  What would you rather do? Let me ask you this. Oh, I'd probably rather go see Taylor Swift. Really? Yeah. Interesting. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4315.0s)]
*  I think it's going to be an unbelievable show. I mean, I'm sure it is. Well, what did what did your girls say? Well, they loved it. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4322.0s)]
*  You wouldn't go? If I had to, I'd go. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4329.0s)]
*  It's not that I don't think Taylor Swift is a talented artist. She's very talented. I like some of her songs. It's not my thing, though. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4333.0s)]
*  Would you have Taylor on the podcast? Sure. Sure. She's brilliant. Yeah. And she's also an amazing songwriter. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4340.0s)]
*  I love her dedication and the fact that like, you know, I mean, she's at the top of the heap. Anybody that's a top. She's so talented. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4346.0s)]
*  Like, she's she blows my mind, actually. Like, five years ago, when my daughter was into her, I was like, whatever. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4353.0s)]
*  Like, that didn't. But if you I mean, not to get too down the rabbit hole, but if you look at the progression of her music and how it's grown up with her, you know, you think about what like what she was doing in, you know, circa 2008, 2007 versus what she's doing today and the lyrics. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4360.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm super impressed. And and also just like her commitment to her fans is pretty amazing. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4375.0s)]
*  Well, my wife and my daughter went to see her at the giant Raiders Stadium in Vegas. And she sent me a video of what the place looks like. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4380.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, my God. Sheppelle and I have talked about doing a gig there. That would be wild. Doing a gig in front of 60,000. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4388.0s)]
*  Have you done like what? The comedians play huge things like Wembley and stuff like that. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4396.0s)]
*  The biggest place Dave and I have done is twenty five thousand. We did. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4401.0s)]
*  We sold out the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma. That was we broke the attendance record for the Tacoma Dome. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4404.0s)]
*  And that was like twenty five thousand something people. That's nuts. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4412.0s)]
*  This is why hearing laughs from twenty five thousand people is so surreal. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4415.0s)]
*  It's so surreal. Like, I remember one time in the middle of one of my bits, you know, I hit a punch line. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4420.0s)]
*  Everybody's laughing and I just start laughing. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4427.0s)]
*  This is so crazy because the laughs are so loud. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4430.0s)]
*  It's so you're looking around and we're in the round to write sort of just like this circle and we're moving around. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4434.0s)]
*  And at the end, Dave and I go up and we do this Q&A thing where we just fuck around. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4440.0s)]
*  He loves to do that after shows. I like to do it. It's very fun. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4447.0s)]
*  Where but you know, so he I go up, I do like forty five minutes. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4450.0s)]
*  He goes up, he does like an hour and also Donnell Rawlings was on the show. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4455.0s)]
*  Ian Edwards was on the show. We had is a long show. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4461.0s)]
*  And then we go up afterwards and we're just standing talking to people. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4466.0s)]
*  And I was like, there is not enough security in the world for this to be safe. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4471.0s)]
*  This is so wild that there's all these people here and we're in a people are yelling shit out and Dave is riffing on things. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4476.0s)]
*  And it's just so many people. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4483.0s)]
*  So to have that times like two and a half, that's crazy. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4486.0s)]
*  Do you remember when MTV or I don't know if it was MTV, they used to do the Where Are They Now things? [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4493.0s)]
*  Yeah, of musicians. And it was always the same story. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4498.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. VH1. Right. So it's always the same story, which is started out with nothing. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4501.0s)]
*  Became really famous. Too much drugs. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4505.0s)]
*  You know, everything went to hell in a handbasket trying to make it back. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4508.0s)]
*  Like there was the same story. You just you just plugged in a different musician every time. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4511.0s)]
*  But I remember my roommate and I in college or whatever, we'd watch some of this and we'd be like, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4515.0s)]
*  like, imagine this was like a Metallica concert. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4520.0s)]
*  Like you're like, look at Metallica in its heyday. Yeah. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4523.0s)]
*  Like there's 90,000 people out there screaming in unison as you're singing. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4527.0s)]
*  It's like we were like, I couldn't fathom what that's like. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4534.0s)]
*  Well, B-Real was on the show. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4537.0s)]
*  And when he talked about Cypress Hill playing, was it Woodstock? Woodstock. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4539.0s)]
*  Half a million. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4545.0s)]
*  And he played a video for us where he showed them on stage singing Insane in the Membrane. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4547.0s)]
*  Can you even see the limit of people? [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4552.0s)]
*  Can you see where it ends? You kind of can. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4554.0s)]
*  You kind of can. But it's like looking over a large lake. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4556.0s)]
*  Wow. It was so nuts. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4559.0s)]
*  Half a million people and they're on stage. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4561.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. Yeah, those kind of numbers are nuts, man. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4564.0s)]
*  I mean, it's like it's just a spectacle of it all. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4568.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, when they have ACL here and you go to some of the bigger shows here, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4571.0s)]
*  it's like part of what you're going to is the spectacle of it all. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4576.0s)]
*  Yeah, look at that. 1994. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4580.0s)]
*  Look how crazy that is. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4586.0s)]
*  I mean, that is when you see them on stage and you see a shot from behind them, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4589.0s)]
*  so you get to see them and like facing the crowd. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4594.0s)]
*  It is so big. Wow. Look at the I mean, there's not enough security in the world to protect you [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4598.0s)]
*  if they just all just rush to stage. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4604.0s)]
*  See all this year, seeing the chili peppers from behind stage was amazing. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4610.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was fun. Yeah, I enjoyed that. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4613.0s)]
*  First time I've ever seen them in concert. Oh, really? [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4615.0s)]
*  Yep. I mean, I've been a fan forever. I've never been to a concert. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4617.0s)]
*  I've never seen them in concert. I mean, Rick's given us, you know, yeah. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4620.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're cool, man. That's it's fun to watch, you know, and if you look at Anthony dancing around like that, [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4624.0s)]
*  like he's 60 years old, he's got a fucked up knee afterwards. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4632.0s)]
*  He's icing his knee and draining and his ankle to his leg. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4636.0s)]
*  I mean, they're they dance around so much. There's so much going on. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4640.0s)]
*  Like so many of those guys, you don't think of them as athletes, but as they get older, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4644.0s)]
*  like all those years of repetitive stress like Maynard from Tool, he had to get a hip replacement [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4649.0s)]
*  because of stomping on the ground like while he's on stage. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4655.0s)]
*  That's what did his hip in. I mean, did you see Flea still does a flip? [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4659.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, wild. He's 60 years old. I know. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4663.0s)]
*  It's hard to believe Anthony is 60. Yeah, he just doesn't look 60. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4666.0s)]
*  No, he looks great. He looks great. I mean, I don't know what he's doing. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4672.0s)]
*  He should be writing a longevity book. He does look great. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4676.0s)]
*  I mean, he's obviously lean. He's taking care of himself. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4680.0s)]
*  He obviously exercises, but his knee is pretty fucked up. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4684.0s)]
*  So I had a conversation with him about stem cells and all the different things that I've done to sort of mitigate [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4687.0s)]
*  some of the knee problems that I've had. But his knee is like pretty bad. Looks pretty bad. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4691.0s)]
*  But the dudes out there just fucking jumping around and dancing around. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4696.0s)]
*  And so many people wind up getting fucked up. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4700.0s)]
*  Steven Tyler had to get knee replacements. You know, Ted Nugent got knee replacements. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4703.0s)]
*  He told me he was jumping off amplifiers and destroyed his meniscus. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4709.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you don't think of those guys as athletes, but they're doing so many shows [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4713.0s)]
*  and they're on the road so many days a year stomping on the ground and jumping around and all that energy. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4719.0s)]
*  It's like your body doesn't like it. So many guys I know from Jiu Jitsu. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4725.0s)]
*  I just was having a conversation with a friend of mine last night about it who needs two shoulder replacements. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4730.0s)]
*  I'm like, Jesus Christ. It's like these hidden epidemic of injuries that you don't realize. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4735.0s)]
*  Is the shoulder the most susceptible joint? [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4741.0s)]
*  The back. The back and knees. Shoulder too, though. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4743.0s)]
*  I don't think there's any one that's more susceptible, but those are the ones that blow out. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4747.0s)]
*  It's kind of like everything that can go goes because you think about what Jiu Jitsu is. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4751.0s)]
*  It's like it's martial art where you're trying to break people's joints. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4756.0s)]
*  You know, you're trying to destroy people's joints or strangle them unconscious. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4759.0s)]
*  So like the joints all get ripped to shit like everybody's shoulders are fucked. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4763.0s)]
*  Everybody's elbows are fucked. Everybody's knees are fucked. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4767.0s)]
*  Their necks. You're always like fighting off chokes. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4771.0s)]
*  And if you don't exercise your neck, you know, your neck becomes very vulnerable. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4774.0s)]
*  So many people have bulging discs in their back, lower back in particular. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4780.0s)]
*  Neck and lower back, cervical and lumbar. Those are the two ones, the major areas. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4784.0s)]
*  You know, occasionally thoracic, but there's a lot of disc issues in Jiu Jitsu. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4789.0s)]
*  And a lot of guys are turning to stem cells now and doing stuff in Columbia and Tijuana where they can just fucking experiment on you. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4794.0s)]
*  Just fucking jam them in there. But shoulders are a big one. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4801.0s)]
*  And a lot of times guys don't want to stop training. So they train injured, you know, and then they wind up destroying it even more. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4807.0s)]
*  And then it can't be repaired and they need a replacement. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4814.0s)]
*  So you have some mechanical shoulder. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4818.0s)]
*  You know, the good thing is shoulder replacements have come a hell of a long way. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4822.0s)]
*  They're there. You can function pretty well post shoulder replacement now in a way that you could. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4826.0s)]
*  Athletically, like you could do Jiu Jitsu again. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4832.0s)]
*  That's a good point. I don't know that you could do that. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4835.0s)]
*  I bet you could still do archery though. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4838.0s)]
*  Yeah, I bet. Michael Bisping from the UFC, the former UFC middleweight champion, he got both of his knees replaced post fighting. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4841.0s)]
*  40 years old. His knees destroyed. Just destroyed. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4849.0s)]
*  Did you see Shaq got a hip replacement recently? [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4854.0s)]
*  Oh no, did he really? [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4856.0s)]
*  A week ago and this is him walking back into the gym. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4857.0s)]
*  God. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4861.0s)]
*  The biggest hip of all time. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4862.0s)]
*  Oh my God. Imagine like designing that guy's hip. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4863.0s)]
*  They probably they probably had to make a new kind of hip. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4866.0s)]
*  It's like completely different size. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4869.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4872.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, speaking of hip replacements, you know, the one that always bums me out is that Bo Jackson. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4873.0s)]
*  Oh, you know, ends up getting a vast, you know, that I don't. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4878.0s)]
*  Ends up getting what? [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4884.0s)]
*  He ended up getting a vascular necrosis when he like so when his hip dislocated, it tore the blood supply to the to the femoral neck and the acetabulum. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4885.0s)]
*  And I mean, he ended up getting a hip replacement. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4894.0s)]
*  But it's like if they had seen if they had the problem is, I think he was too tough, right? [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4898.0s)]
*  Like because they didn't do an MRI on his hip for months after that injury. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4905.0s)]
*  It's kind of crazy when you think about how the NFL would work today. Right. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4910.0s)]
*  If your star running back is complaining of hip pain after a game and has to miss the game like after that tackle, he was out of the game. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4913.0s)]
*  Like they could have done an MRI and a CT scan that day. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4919.0s)]
*  I think they could have salvaged his hip like that's that's like one of those athletes where I just think like we got really deprived. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4922.0s)]
*  What would they do with the hip? [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4928.0s)]
*  I think today you could you could actually go and repair it. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4929.0s)]
*  You could you could put an X fix on him and what's an X fix external fixator on his hip. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4932.0s)]
*  And what is that? [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4937.0s)]
*  It's just like a way to actually fix the bone externally. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4940.0s)]
*  So you put like screws into the femoral neck right away out of the gate as opposed to kind of letting it bleed off and lose its blood supply. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4943.0s)]
*  I talked to an orthopedic surgeon about this like a little while ago. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4954.0s)]
*  Who's a hip guy? [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4957.0s)]
*  And I said like if if Bo Jackson had that injury today, how likely is it that he would have had had a hip replacement? [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4958.0s)]
*  He was like if they had scanned him right away, they probably could have salvaged that hip. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4964.0s)]
*  That's a dude I would love to meet. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4969.0s)]
*  He's so obsessed with archery. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4972.0s)]
*  You know, he can't pull a bow back anymore. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4974.0s)]
*  No, I didn't know. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4976.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's a crossbow now. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4977.0s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4979.0s)]
*  Yeah, his shoulders are fucked. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4980.0s)]
*  Again, it's just I mean that fucking sport. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4983.0s)]
*  You want to talk about sport that's hard on you. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4988.0s)]
*  Getting tackled by 300 plus pounds super athletes. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4990.0s)]
*  I mean, the the the size of football. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4995.0s)]
*  I had Derek Wolf in here a couple of weeks ago. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=4999.0s)]
*  How much does he weigh? [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5001.0s)]
*  Three hundred. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5002.0s)]
*  He's a literal Viking. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5004.0s)]
*  Like he should be at the front of a boat blowing a fucking conch shell, letting everybody know he's going to start raping and murdering. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5006.0s)]
*  Oh, what's amazing, too, is at 300 pounds. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5015.0s)]
*  At 300 pounds, they can run faster than most hundred and fifty pound people. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5019.0s)]
*  Like their speed is insane. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5022.0s)]
*  Well, the muscle. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5024.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just there's different kinds of people out there. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5025.0s)]
*  You know, it's just the world's not fair. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5029.0s)]
*  You don't think we're all equal? [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5032.0s)]
*  Not in that way. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5036.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5037.0s)]
*  I think we're all we're all equal in the eyes of the Lord. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5039.0s)]
*  I agree. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5043.0s)]
*  Equality does not exist physically, which is just, you know, just a fact. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5046.0s)]
*  That's why we have weight classes. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5052.0s)]
*  That's why we should have the difference between females and males competing against each other, which is why I get, you know, this trans athlete thing fucking blows my mind. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5054.0s)]
*  How many people go along with this? [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5068.0s)]
*  It just blows. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5070.0s)]
*  Didn't the ruling just come down on powerlifting? [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5071.0s)]
*  I'm sorry on weightlifting that that you you cannot compete in. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5073.0s)]
*  Like if a male transitions to a female, he can't compete as a female. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5079.0s)]
*  Well, that if the transition occurred after puberty. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5083.0s)]
*  Yes, that certainly should be the case. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5085.0s)]
*  It certainly should be the case. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5088.0s)]
*  I think there is some ruling that just came down like that. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5089.0s)]
*  But swimming, I mean, that Leah Thomas is still the number one swimmer in the world. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5092.0s)]
*  And it's a biological male. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5097.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5098.0s)]
*  Period. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5099.0s)]
*  End of discussion. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5100.0s)]
*  It's madness. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5101.0s)]
*  And not only that, hasn't even gotten penis removed and has sex with women, apparently. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5102.0s)]
*  Just the whole thing is so crazy that you can call yourself a woman and then you're a woman. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5107.0s)]
*  And like this has nothing to do with trans rights. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5111.0s)]
*  It just has to do with humans. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5113.0s)]
*  Like with there's a reason why make a distinction why men are not allowed to compete in the women's division. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5115.0s)]
*  But if you could just decide you're a woman and you compete in the women's division and no one's even allowed to regulate like what that means. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5120.0s)]
*  And if you have any any problem with that, you're transphobic. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5127.0s)]
*  Like has nothing to do with transphobic. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5133.0s)]
*  We're talking about fairness and sports. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5135.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5137.0s)]
*  It is absolutely crazy that this is still going on and that, you know, here goes similar ruling in swimming. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5138.0s)]
*  Ah, they vote to restrict transgender women from elite swimming. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5146.0s)]
*  What is the F.I.N.A.? [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5150.0s)]
*  Fina is the ruling body of swimming. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5152.0s)]
*  OK, so is so they voted just Sunday, but that says June 19th, [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5154.0s)]
*  Thomas's wiki. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5159.0s)]
*  But that's the problem is that she's doing it through and see to. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5161.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a different thing. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5165.0s)]
*  What is it? Yeah. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5167.0s)]
*  And see to a she wanted to go. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5168.0s)]
*  Although didn't she graduate? [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5169.0s)]
*  Yeah, she's done with that. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5170.0s)]
*  So she want to go to the Olympics. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5171.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5172.0s)]
*  It was basically saying she can't compete. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5173.0s)]
*  Correct. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5174.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you know, it's just what they've done to those other girls that are competing against her is just a fucking crime. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5175.0s)]
*  It's horrible. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5182.0s)]
*  Imagine if you're a biological woman. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5183.0s)]
*  You are working your ass off. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5185.0s)]
*  You are fully dedicated to being the best of the best. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5187.0s)]
*  You're dotting all your eyes and crossing all your teeth. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5190.0s)]
*  You are watching your diet. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5193.0s)]
*  You're watching your recovery. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5195.0s)]
*  You are fucking trying. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5196.0s)]
*  And this person who just decides they're a woman with testosterone flowing through their body for their entire life just dominates you. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5198.0s)]
*  It's fucking maddening and it's fucking maddening that we have gotten into this ideological battle. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5209.0s)]
*  This this this cultural end of the road ideological battle where we're allowing that and where people will step up and virtue signal and defend this. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5215.0s)]
*  That it like is as if it has anything to do with being compassionate and considerate and and trans rights or LBGTQ plus AI whatever the fuck it is. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5225.0s)]
*  Rights. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5236.0s)]
*  It's nonsense. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5237.0s)]
*  It's we are a society that needs a real problem and we are fixating on these fucking very strange issues and deciding that we're going to correct all the inequities and inequality in the world by allowing these people to express their truth. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5238.0s)]
*  And you're encouraging mental illness. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5257.0s)]
*  You're encouraging virtue signaling. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5259.0s)]
*  You're encouraging mass ideology. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5261.0s)]
*  This ideological capture of an entire culture where people know things aren't true. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5264.0s)]
*  You know it's not right. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5271.0s)]
*  You know it's not accurate. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5273.0s)]
*  You know it's not scientifically true. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5274.0s)]
*  And yet people have to espouse these certain things because if they don't they'll be labeled transphobic. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5276.0s)]
*  It's fucking wild. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5282.0s)]
*  And I never thought it was going to happen. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5284.0s)]
*  I think the worst example is when male prisoners can somehow weasel their way into women's prisons. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5286.0s)]
*  There's a shit ton of them in California. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5292.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5294.0s)]
*  California like there's more than 40 of them that have made their way into prisons and there's hundreds of them that are under review right now. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5295.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5302.0s)]
*  Get they go to prison and get women pregnant so that not only are they saying that they're females but they don't have to do anything other than say they're females. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5303.0s)]
*  They don't have to take estrogen. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5312.0s)]
*  They don't have to get their balls cut off. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5314.0s)]
*  They don't have to do anything. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5316.0s)]
*  They don't have to do anything. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5317.0s)]
*  Because I'm a female. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5318.0s)]
*  Oh well we don't want to fuck with you. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5319.0s)]
*  We definitely want you to go to the place where you're you're you're allowed to live your truth. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5321.0s)]
*  Peter I mean Patricia get in there get in there and start fucking. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5327.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5332.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5334.0s)]
*  And one of them was a guy who is a fucking murderer. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5335.0s)]
*  You know the thing about these these people that identify as females like they did this study on inmates that identify as female and want to be moved over to female prisons. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5339.0s)]
*  There was a large number of them that were sex offenders. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5354.0s)]
*  Yeah that's. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5357.0s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5358.0s)]
*  So sex offenders and I mean how many of them have fucking fake names. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5359.0s)]
*  How many of them are in prison for fraud. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5366.0s)]
*  How many of them have a fake Rolex. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5368.0s)]
*  And meanwhile the real woman can't question that criminal aliases. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5370.0s)]
*  That's beside gender is everything gender gender gender. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5376.0s)]
*  It's just like the fucking trump card of the world is gender. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5381.0s)]
*  It's just like what is happening. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5384.0s)]
*  What is going on. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5386.0s)]
*  It's such a weird time. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5388.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5390.0s)]
*  No it's. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5392.0s)]
*  It's. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5393.0s)]
*  It's. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5394.0s)]
*  It's. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5395.0s)]
*  It's a it's a it's an interesting time to be raising kids too. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5396.0s)]
*  And you see what they come home kind of hearing. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5398.0s)]
*  I mean I feel pretty fortunate where we are that. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5401.0s)]
*  Yeah it's a little different in Texas but not totally different. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5403.0s)]
*  You know my daughter was going to school with this one girl who would get angry if you did not call her they or them. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5407.0s)]
*  And she wore makeup and you know she looked like a girl. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5414.0s)]
*  But if you said her it's like you're playing games here. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5419.0s)]
*  This is a game. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5422.0s)]
*  Yeah it's like and even if a person says look I'm going to do my best to remember this if it really makes you feel better. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5423.0s)]
*  But you can't override like your entire lifetime of regular pronouns and remember that you're a they not a she. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5429.0s)]
*  Also you're a biological female and you're wearing makeup and a dress. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5436.0s)]
*  So this is all nonsense. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5440.0s)]
*  So we're playing a stupid pronoun game. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5442.0s)]
*  You know who would have ever thought if I came to you 20 years ago and dude in 20 years pronouns going to be a real issue. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5444.0s)]
*  You'd be like fuck is wrong with you. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5450.0s)]
*  That doesn't even make any sense. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5452.0s)]
*  I can safely say I would say I'm going to take the under on that one. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5454.0s)]
*  Pronouns. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5457.0s)]
*  That's going to be the problem. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5458.0s)]
*  I remember when Fallon Fox first started fighting women in MMA and then it turned out that for the first two fights she was saying that she was a biologist. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5460.0s)]
*  She wasn't telling them that she was biologically male. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5471.0s)]
*  She just said that that wasn't important that you or you shouldn't have access to her medical information. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5474.0s)]
*  This is a medical issue. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5480.0s)]
*  There's no no one's business but hers. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5483.0s)]
*  And I was like that is a straight bullshit like that is so crazy. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5485.0s)]
*  And the pushback I got on that I was like whoa what is going on. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5489.0s)]
*  And this was like 2015 2016 something like that. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5493.0s)]
*  I never would have imagined we would get to the point where this is like a public issue throughout the entire world and that you're dealing with trans athletes wanting to compete in and then dominating female sports breaking records. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5497.0s)]
*  I mean someone someone quoted the like there was there's these two trans athletes that were competing as females in Connecticut. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5514.0s)]
*  And they were saying that if you looked at their times like that they're there that their times like if you take like an elite female runner like was that woman's name Jackie Joyner Jackie Joyner Kersy. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5525.0s)]
*  Yes it was like one of the elite of the elite female runners high school boys beat her time all the time. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5542.0s)]
*  That's why. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5550.0s)]
*  That is fucking wild. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5551.0s)]
*  So imagine if you're a girl and you're saying this is soccer right. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5553.0s)]
*  Like yeah a good high school soccer team would crush the women's the US team. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5556.0s)]
*  Have you seen that Australian biological male who competes in rugby. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5562.0s)]
*  No 240 pounds giant dude competing with women. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5567.0s)]
*  Yeah giant dude with lipstick on just running women over. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5571.0s)]
*  It's happening all over the world. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5575.0s)]
*  And it's I'm just I mean at some point there has to be a lawsuit when one of these women gets hurt. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5577.0s)]
*  Well there should be lawsuits that they're getting denied their ability to compete in a fair field that they're on a level playing field. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5582.0s)]
*  It's not fair. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5589.0s)]
*  It's not fair. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5590.0s)]
*  And people make this stupid argument like oh well you know there are differences in the spectrum of athletic ability and females. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5591.0s)]
*  Yeah there is. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5599.0s)]
*  But the difference between the highest end of the spectrum of athletic ability and females and the lowest end of the spectrum of professional athletes and males is fucking enormous. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5600.0s)]
*  It's a fucking grand canyon size gap. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5610.0s)]
*  It's like these dorks that have never competed in anything before. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5615.0s)]
*  Those are the ones that are proponents of this because they think of it as like social justice and social change. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5620.0s)]
*  And like you don't even know what the fuck you're asking for. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5628.0s)]
*  You're literally asking for people to cheat because that's what they're doing. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5631.0s)]
*  They're cheating. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5636.0s)]
*  Yeah they're sandbagging. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5637.0s)]
*  They're sandbagging like we get sandbagging all the time in martial arts. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5639.0s)]
*  You'd get someone who entered into the white belt division and you're like that guy is not a fucking white belt. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5643.0s)]
*  Like because people like to win. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5647.0s)]
*  They just want to win. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5649.0s)]
*  It's all the time. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5650.0s)]
*  You know in pool you know what people would do in pool. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5651.0s)]
*  Not only would they because there's like these rating systems. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5654.0s)]
*  So there's certain people that are such pieces of shit. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5658.0s)]
*  They will enter into tournaments and lose over and over and over and over again on purpose and play like shit on purpose so that their rating is really low. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5661.0s)]
*  And then they could enter into a tournament and then they get a handicap against someone who's a player of their caliber. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5671.0s)]
*  So in certain leagues like say if you and I were playing in a league there's a bunch of different ones now. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5677.0s)]
*  I'm not sure how the Fargo rating goes but there's a there's other leagues that like I used to play in a league back in the day and say if I was better than you because my number is higher than you I would have to either give you games on the wire or like say like if we're both going to like race to seven. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5683.0s)]
*  I would have to go to seven but you would have to go to five or you know something along those lines and some places you actually have to give a spot. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5699.0s)]
*  But so people would lose on purpose just so they can get that and so they can maybe win a tournament because they want to win. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5707.0s)]
*  People are gross. They like to cheat. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5715.0s)]
*  And the idea that that isn't factored into this at all. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5718.0s)]
*  The possibility that people just want to win and want a sandbag. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5722.0s)]
*  And then also that no one's factoring in the psychological reality of people getting extraordinary attention for doing this for transitioning and then for competing and being so brave. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5726.0s)]
*  And yeah they get hate. Oh but people love to concentrate only on the hate. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5739.0s)]
*  They get a lot of love. They got a lot of love from a lot of fucking insane liberals out there who are literally out of their mind and don't understand sports and don't understand competition. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5743.0s)]
*  And are just saying things because Twitter said it. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5755.0s)]
*  Didn't the swimmer at Penn get like athlete of the year or something. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5759.0s)]
*  Wasn't I could have sworn she was like female athlete of the year at Penn or something like that. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5764.0s)]
*  But didn't the Biden administration give like woman of the year to some person who's a biological male. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5769.0s)]
*  Like it's a. Well we're living in a weird time man because there's things that people do today that they're not doing it because it makes sense. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5774.0s)]
*  They're doing it because they know it'll get attention. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5784.0s)]
*  They knew they're doing it because they know that a certain very rabid very vocal very aggressive group of people will support it. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5786.0s)]
*  It's very strange but it's also psychologically when you look at it like oh this makes perfect sense. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5796.0s)]
*  I see why they would do that. You know and you see the people that are doing it like I just love it when it falls apart like that fucking wacky person who's non-binary. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5803.0s)]
*  Who's working for the White House who's stealing women's clothes. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5813.0s)]
*  Do you know about that person. You know the president. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5815.0s)]
*  No Sam Brinton was in charge of was it nuclear waste disposal something for the Department of Energy. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5817.0s)]
*  And this person who has a shaved head and a fucking goatee and a beard also wears makeup and women's dresses and was stealing women's luggage multiple times from airports. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5825.0s)]
*  So would go to the airport and then would grab somebody else's bag take it and take their clothes out just start wearing it and got caught doing this and said oh I didn't know. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5839.0s)]
*  But meanwhile I'd taken the clothes out of this the luggage and left it in the hotel room and then they got him on camera stealing luggage from another airport and then like how's that. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5848.0s)]
*  We see there's a fucking pattern here. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5859.0s)]
*  And then there was a woman who was a designer from Houston that saw him wearing her dresses at an event and she's a designer is very specific one of a kind clothes and there's photos of him wearing those dresses and her wearing those dresses like it's like they're just playing this weird diversity and oppression game. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5861.0s)]
*  It's very strange. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5879.0s)]
*  Can you imagine going back to our earlier discussion about like 100 years ago. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5881.0s)]
*  If I mean what the problems were then right. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5885.0s)]
*  Again I think you know one of the things I think about is like it's easy to say because I don't have any other reference for it that we're living in the weirdest time. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5890.0s)]
*  But I don't know if that's true right. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5900.0s)]
*  Like I don't know if political discourse is as bad today or as worse today than it was in the past. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5901.0s)]
*  I think it's different right. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5908.0s)]
*  But but you know subjectively is it worse. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5910.0s)]
*  I'm curious. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5913.0s)]
*  I want to believe it's not. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5914.0s)]
*  Have you ever had George Friedman on the podcast. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5915.0s)]
*  No he's actually from Austin. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5917.0s)]
*  I don't know him but I'd like to meet him at some point. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5919.0s)]
*  He's an author and he wrote this book called The Storm Before the Calm. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5921.0s)]
*  Super interesting. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5925.0s)]
*  He lives out here. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5927.0s)]
*  Yeah he lives out here. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5928.0s)]
*  I actually have reached out to Lawrence Wright who also lives here to see if he can introduce me to him. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5929.0s)]
*  But but it's a it's a fascinating book. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5934.0s)]
*  He's Hungarian I believe. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5937.0s)]
*  But but you know has lived in the US for many years. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5940.0s)]
*  And this book is the name of the book again. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5942.0s)]
*  The Storm Before the Calm. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5945.0s)]
*  And I read it like about six months ago and was beyond blown away. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5947.0s)]
*  And he writes about these macro cycles that lead to enormous transition in US history. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5952.0s)]
*  Because again we're such a young country right. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5958.0s)]
*  Two hundred and fifty years old or barely that right. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5960.0s)]
*  And basically there were two cycles and I believe one cycle. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5963.0s)]
*  So there's like a political cycle and a social cycle and one of them occurs roughly every 50 years. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5966.0s)]
*  One of them occurs roughly every 80 years. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5970.0s)]
*  And he goes through each cycle. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5972.0s)]
*  So what's the what creates the tension the pressure the breakpoint the rebuild. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5974.0s)]
*  But what he writes about in this book is look this is the first time we're coming up to both cycles happening around the same time like roughly 2030. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5978.0s)]
*  And so what he's saying like everything that we're going through right now politically and socially and economically is actually pretty pretty clear. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5986.0s)]
*  Here's what's interesting. He wrote the book I believe pre 2020. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=5996.0s)]
*  So a lot of what he said was kind of going to happen is already happening. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6000.0s)]
*  It's super interesting and the implications for 2024 2028 in terms of you know kind of presidential stuff is interesting because obviously a lot of it has to do with different administrations and things like that. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6005.0s)]
*  So what is he predicting is happening. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6016.0s)]
*  So he thinks we're coming to the end of a cycle where basically the current political and social structure has exceeded its utility. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6018.0s)]
*  Right. So politics as we I don't think anybody would disagree that politics has basically lost its service. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6025.0s)]
*  Right. Like the people aren't benefiting from their politicians anymore. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6032.0s)]
*  So why is that. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6035.0s)]
*  Well so so let's go back to the last cycle. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6037.0s)]
*  So he said the last cycle was Jimmy Carter into Ronald Reagan. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6039.0s)]
*  Right. And so Carter was the last of that cycle which was kind of super big government and then Reagan ushered in you know obviously small government but also lots of military spending. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6042.0s)]
*  And you know what he says is actually I'm trying to think I don't think he actually predicts exactly what's going to happen in the next cycle. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6056.0s)]
*  But what he says is all of the kind of discourse that we're seeing now we're basically there's nothing that's really bipartisan anymore. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6063.0s)]
*  That's going to lead to kind of a breakdown of the system where I think how he describes it much more eloquently than I can. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6072.0s)]
*  The gist of it is then he says that the next president to be elected will be kind of the last of the cycle. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6082.0s)]
*  So whoever's elected in 2024 he thinks is kind of the last of the current system we have. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6088.0s)]
*  And we will. Again it's hard for me to imagine this is true. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6093.0s)]
*  But what he's basically saying is it will no longer be kind of the elite class running the country because you know that's obviously what we do right now. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6097.0s)]
*  Right. We have a pretty elite class that runs the country. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6107.0s)]
*  How is that possible. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6109.0s)]
*  I can't fathom how it's possible. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6111.0s)]
*  How would it be possible that they would relinquish their grasp on power and control because it seems like everything they're doing is indicating that they're moving towards greater and greater control and more and more. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6113.0s)]
*  They're taking advantage more and more of the situation to reap financial benefits. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6127.0s)]
*  You know when you look at just the fucking insider trading that they're allowed to do and no one's stopping just that it's just unbelievable that there's not more pushback against that. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6132.0s)]
*  There's jokes about you know Nancy Pelosi and what a great stock trader she is. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6142.0s)]
*  But if you just look at the entire list of Republicans and Democrats that are involved in stock trading that do way better than some of the very best traders in the world. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6147.0s)]
*  Like it's really clear that this is a fucking money grab and that it's dirty and it's no one's stopping it. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6159.0s)]
*  No one's voting to stop. There's no one who's speaking out. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6167.0s)]
*  And the problem is the people that would be involved in putting forth legislation to make this illegal or benefiting from it being legal. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6170.0s)]
*  Like they would never do that. And their constituents aren't fired up about it. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6179.0s)]
*  It seems to be I guess that's part of the issue. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6183.0s)]
*  Right. I think that's part of the question is like how much longer does that continue. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6185.0s)]
*  Yeah. Where the where the voting class sort of says like yeah enough's enough. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6189.0s)]
*  Like we're going to put people in who are going to kind of change things. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6193.0s)]

*  But now the media conveniently leaves out anything that it doesn't want to be at the front and center in terms of like things that people concentrate on and talk about. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6215.0s)]

*  But January 6th looms large. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6288.0s)]
*  How about the fact that the guy who is the president right now can't form a fucking sentence. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6291.0s)]
*  He makes up words and stumbles through things. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6296.0s)]
*  No one says a goddamn thing about it. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6298.0s)]

*  If you're buying it you're going to cost more sometimes right. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6317.0s)]
*  It depends on the watch. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6319.0s)]

*  That one says four hundred. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6387.0s)]
*  Is that same watch. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6392.0s)]
*  Looks different. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6394.0s)]
*  BRV 192. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6395.0s)]
*  Click on that. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6397.0s)]
*  That's also possible. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6398.0s)]
*  They're just telling you that's what the watch. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6399.0s)]
*  Yeah that's not the same watch. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6400.0s)]
*  That's definitely not the same one. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6401.0s)]
*  That's it right there. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6403.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6404.0s)]
*  But is that it. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6405.0s)]
*  Is that the same thing. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6406.0s)]
*  Not necessarily. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6407.0s)]
*  Not necessarily. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6408.0s)]
*  Just definitely not that coat of arms. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6409.0s)]
*  Let me see that image again. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6410.0s)]
*  Go back to that. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6412.0s)]
*  So I'm looking at that and then scroll that. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6413.0s)]
*  No no no. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6415.0s)]
*  Yeah there you go. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6416.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6417.0s)]
*  That might be the watch. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6418.0s)]
*  But what I'm looking at. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6421.0s)]
*  Then why would you take it off. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6422.0s)]
*  I'm looking at those circles. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6423.0s)]
*  Go back to that image please. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6425.0s)]
*  I'm looking at those. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6426.0s)]
*  Is that. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6427.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6428.0s)]
*  Doesn't look like there's something at the bottom of it. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6429.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6433.0s)]
*  Wouldn't it be funny if it was a tourbillon. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6434.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6437.0s)]
*  Explain tourbillons to people. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6438.0s)]
*  It's a device that basically allows for completely equal rotation of the gears of the watch independent [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6441.0s)]
*  of the angle of the wrist. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6448.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6450.0s)]
*  People don't understand that a watch like what I'm wearing. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6451.0s)]
*  I'm wearing an Omega Seamaster. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6454.0s)]
*  It's very accurate but it's more accurate in certain positions in terms of like how the [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6457.0s)]
*  mechanical winding of the watch works. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6463.0s)]
*  And a tourbillon doesn't matter where you're at. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6467.0s)]
*  It's perfect. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6469.0s)]
*  I saw a Grand Seiko tourbillon that was like a quarter of a million dollars. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6470.0s)]
*  That looks like the same watch right. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6474.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6476.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6477.0s)]
*  That is probably the watch. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6478.0s)]
*  So yeah that is a lie then because that's like a. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6479.0s)]
*  That's like a two thousand dollar watch. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6481.0s)]
*  That looks like the watch. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6483.0s)]
*  Doesn't it. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6484.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6485.0s)]
*  That's Bell and Ross. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6486.0s)]
*  Something else right there. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6487.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6488.0s)]
*  That's it. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6489.0s)]
*  That's a Bell and Ross. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6490.0s)]
*  Yeah that's it. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6491.0s)]
*  So it's like a two thousand dollar watch. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6492.0s)]
*  It's a very nice watch but it's you know it's not an eighty thousand dollar watch. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6493.0s)]
*  I took mine. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6499.0s)]
*  It's still funny that he took it off. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6500.0s)]
*  You took yours off. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6501.0s)]
*  Well you weren't looking. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6502.0s)]
*  I took my arm under the table and took it off. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6503.0s)]
*  What do you wear Speedmaster? [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6506.0s)]
*  Speedy. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6507.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6508.0s)]
*  That's hilarious that he did that though. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6509.0s)]
*  Why would he do that? [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6511.0s)]
*  That's a dumb move because it's not even that expensive a watch. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6512.0s)]
*  It's a nice watch but. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6515.0s)]
*  But it draws more attention when you take it off. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6517.0s)]
*  It shows what a cunt he is. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6519.0s)]
*  He's like oh I took this watch off. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6521.0s)]
*  Then he decided he had to take the watch off. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6523.0s)]
*  It's fucking funny. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6526.0s)]
*  That's funny. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6527.0s)]
*  But meanwhile you know go to CNN. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6528.0s)]
*  Are they talking about that? [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6530.0s)]
*  Go to CNN and see if CNN is showing the pro. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6531.0s)]
*  Go to the front page of CNN and see if they're showing front instead of the massive protests [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6534.0s)]
*  in Paris or the massive protests that are in Israel right now. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6539.0s)]
*  There's a shooting today so they're talking about that. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6542.0s)]
*  Of course they are. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6544.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6545.0s)]
*  Oh that's horrible too. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6548.0s)]
*  There was some Christian school. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6550.0s)]
*  Is there anything in there about the protests in Israel? [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6552.0s)]
*  Or is it all the shooting? [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6556.0s)]
*  No it's actually it's the Israel protests right on top. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6557.0s)]
*  Like updates. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6559.0s)]
*  Israel protests. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6560.0s)]
*  What about France? [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6561.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6569.0s)]
*  Amid violent protests. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6570.0s)]
*  Pension protests. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6571.0s)]
*  King Charles State visit to France to postpone the violent pension protests. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6572.0s)]
*  I am so much happier not paying any attention to the news. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6580.0s)]
*  Until it bites you in the ass. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6585.0s)]
*  The problem is like you want to know when the dam's gonna break. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6587.0s)]
*  You don't want to be sitting around going when's the dam breaking. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6591.0s)]
*  I feel like I'll hear about it when it gets that bad. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6594.0s)]
*  Oh god. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6596.0s)]
*  I think that way sometimes too. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6598.0s)]
*  But I can never pull myself to actually not think about it. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6600.0s)]
*  Because of marijuana. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6604.0s)]
*  Because marijuana makes me paranoid. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6607.0s)]
*  When I get paranoid I start paying attention to the news. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6609.0s)]
*  I'm like oh my god these monsters. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6612.0s)]
*  What are they doing? [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6614.0s)]
*  They're gonna fucking ruin us all. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6615.0s)]
*  So you prefer to smoke right? [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6617.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6619.0s)]
*  Or vape? [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6620.0s)]
*  I eat it too. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6621.0s)]
*  Yeah I do all of it. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6622.0s)]
*  And does one vehicle give you more paranoia than the other? [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6623.0s)]
*  They seem to all get me. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6627.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6629.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6630.0s)]
*  I mean I don't think any of them make me more paranoid now. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6631.0s)]
*  But is there a dose response though? [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6635.0s)]
*  Do you have to get past a certain threshold to feel it? [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6638.0s)]
*  Yeah I don't feel it with a little bit. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6640.0s)]
*  The problem is I like being paranoid. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6642.0s)]
*  I really enjoy it. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6645.0s)]
*  I enjoy the fear. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6646.0s)]
*  I really do. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6648.0s)]
*  I know people don't believe that. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6649.0s)]
*  I really do. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6651.0s)]
*  I like getting the fucking shit scared out of me. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6652.0s)]
*  Because at the end of it I always learn something. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6655.0s)]
*  I always learn like oh I didn't even know that was bothering me. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6657.0s)]
*  Or I didn't know that I was really freaking out about this. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6660.0s)]
*  Or I didn't know. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6663.0s)]
*  I think what marijuana does that a lot of people say makes me paranoid. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6664.0s)]
*  It makes me paranoid. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6670.0s)]
*  What it does is makes you hyper aware of perhaps some things that you weren't really thinking about. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6672.0s)]
*  Or avoiding. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6676.0s)]
*  Or things that are maybe in the back of your head that should probably be in the forefront. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6678.0s)]
*  Some issues you need to deal with. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6683.0s)]
*  Or just some realities that you need to confront about the world, about life, about mortality. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6685.0s)]
*  About your loved ones. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6691.0s)]
*  About you know just the world we live in is very temporary. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6693.0s)]
*  And you are very temporary. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6696.0s)]
*  You know I mean a year is not that long. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6698.0s)]
*  We were just in the Elkwood in September. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6701.0s)]
*  And September is just a few months away now. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6703.0s)]
*  Here we are. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6705.0s)]
*  It's basically April. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6706.0s)]
*  You know I mean May, June, July, August, September. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6708.0s)]
*  It's there again. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6711.0s)]
*  And then there will be another year. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6712.0s)]
*  And then you're dead. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6713.0s)]
*  That's really how the world works. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6714.0s)]
*  And meanwhile so many people. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6716.0s)]
*  It goes back to what we were talking about at the beginning of this conversation. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6718.0s)]
*  The focus and concentration on things that are completely important like your legacy. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6721.0s)]
*  Completely unimportant. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6727.0s)]
*  Like your legacy. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6729.0s)]
*  Like it's foolish. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6730.0s)]
*  It's nonsense. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6731.0s)]
*  Like no one's going to remember you. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6732.0s)]
*  Unless you're fucking Socrates. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6734.0s)]
*  And even then who gives a shit. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6735.0s)]
*  Well yeah he's not here to remember. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6737.0s)]
*  No I got this thing. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6738.0s)]
*  I don't know God how many months ago. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6740.0s)]
*  Maybe six months ago. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6742.0s)]
*  Not that long ago. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6743.0s)]
*  You've probably seen these. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6744.0s)]
*  It's your life in weeks. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6745.0s)]
*  Have you seen these calendars? [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6746.0s)]
*  No. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6747.0s)]
*  So it's really cool. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6748.0s)]
*  So I go to this website and I buy. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6749.0s)]
*  I think it's called 4K weeks or something like that. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6751.0s)]
*  So you go in you fill in your date of birth. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6755.0s)]
*  And basically how old you think you're going to live to. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6758.0s)]
*  So I put 88. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6760.0s)]
*  So I'm going to live till I'm 88. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6761.0s)]
*  Again you have to put it. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6762.0s)]
*  You have to draw a line in the sand somewhere. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6763.0s)]
*  And then they send you this calendar with one. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6765.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6767.0s)]
*  So I get this box where. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6768.0s)]
*  So it came for me just before my 50th birthday. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6772.0s)]
*  So it was already filled out to like you know halfway into my 48 or 49th year. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6774.0s)]
*  And every week. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6780.0s)]
*  Like every Sunday I color in a box. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6781.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6783.0s)]
*  So and then what I also put on it is I circled in big red the weeks that each of my kids [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6784.0s)]
*  will go to college. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6791.0s)]
*  Which is as you know like that's pretty much the end of you getting to live with your kids. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6792.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6796.0s)]
*  Which for me is super sad. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6797.0s)]
*  I mean I have a whole shift in mindset around that. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6798.0s)]
*  I'm not quite as sad as I used to be. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6801.0s)]
*  But but then I realize oh my God like the time I'm wasting you know I get asked to talk [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6803.0s)]
*  a lot and I never want to go. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6811.0s)]
*  You know people are like oh will you come and give this talk in Aspen and do this and [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6814.0s)]
*  that. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6819.0s)]
*  And I'm always like no. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6820.0s)]
*  Like I don't want to be away from home. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6821.0s)]
*  Like I don't want to go. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6822.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6823.0s)]
*  You know. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6824.0s)]
*  And I think that's a big part of it. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6825.0s)]
*  It's like I have very I have a tiny amount of time left to eat every meal with my kids [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6827.0s)]
*  and see them off to school and do all that kind of stuff. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6833.0s)]
*  And when you look at it that way and you realize like every week you're coloring in a box. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6836.0s)]
*  Every week you're coloring in one of those boxes. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6839.0s)]
*  And by the way that's best case scenario. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6841.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6842.0s)]
*  Like I could die tomorrow. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6843.0s)]
*  We have no idea. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6844.0s)]
*  And so everybody who sees it in my office is like that's the most depressing thing I've [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6847.0s)]
*  ever seen. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6850.0s)]
*  But I don't feel that way actually. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6851.0s)]
*  I was kind of it took me a couple of years to get it because I was kind of like oh that's [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6852.0s)]
*  going to be really depressing. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6856.0s)]
*  But I'm really glad I did. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6857.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6859.0s)]
*  I don't think it's depressing. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6860.0s)]
*  It's just reality. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6861.0s)]
*  It's depressing if you only concentrate on oh my God one day it's going to be over. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6862.0s)]
*  But if you just look at the reality of the amount of time that you have available to [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6868.0s)]
*  you the amount of time in life it's just that's just what it is. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6872.0s)]
*  And it'll help you prioritize and maybe it'll help you have a more balanced perspective [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6876.0s)]
*  which is I think especially towards people that are high performing ambitious people [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6883.0s)]
*  that are successful. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6889.0s)]
*  It's very difficult to get off that horse. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6891.0s)]
*  Like I got offered something pretty recently that I'm not interested in. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6894.0s)]
*  And this pitch was they were talking to me about money and they just kept talking to [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6899.0s)]
*  me about the amount of money and this and that and this. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6904.0s)]
*  I'm like listen listen listen this is not what I'm that's not my motivation. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6906.0s)]
*  You're not going to get me with this. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6910.0s)]
*  Like I have zero interest in this product of zero interest in this thing that you're [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6911.0s)]
*  trying to promote. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6916.0s)]
*  I'm not I'm doing it in no way. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6917.0s)]
*  And they didn't seem to be able to understand that. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6919.0s)]
*  I'm like there's not enough time in this life and I have too many things that I enjoy [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6921.0s)]
*  doing. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6926.0s)]
*  You're asking me to do something I don't enjoy doing for something that I don't really [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6927.0s)]
*  need which is money. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6931.0s)]
*  Like I don't really need money. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6933.0s)]
*  Like what I what I need is I need I need things that I enjoy. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6935.0s)]
*  That's what I like. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6941.0s)]
*  And I have all these things that I've already cultivated in my life that I do enjoy. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6943.0s)]
*  Like I'm I'm having fun. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6949.0s)]
*  I have great friends. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6951.0s)]
*  I have great hobbies. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6952.0s)]
*  I have great family. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6954.0s)]
*  I have great things that I like to do. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6955.0s)]
*  That's all I'm doing. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6958.0s)]
*  Like I'm not doing this other thing. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6959.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6960.0s)]
*  And it was the most bizarre conversation. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6961.0s)]
*  It was almost like I wanted to say and you should probably not do it too. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6963.0s)]
*  You should probably think about your life too. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6967.0s)]
*  Like you guys are kind of my age and you're talking to me about this stupid idea. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6969.0s)]
*  I don't care how much money you have like this is a stupid idea. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6973.0s)]
*  Like are people going to buy it. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6976.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6977.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6978.0s)]
*  What are you going to. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6979.0s)]
*  What the fuck are you doing. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6980.0s)]
*  I'll tell you what it is afterwards. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6981.0s)]
*  I can't wait to hear. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6982.0s)]
*  Afterwards you're going to go oh yeah. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6983.0s)]
*  What the fuck. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6986.0s)]
*  But it's just life. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6987.0s)]
*  You can get caught up in the momentum of whatever thing you're pursuing and if you're pursuing [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6990.0s)]
*  money it's one of the slipperiest slopes because you can justify all sorts of things. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=6998.0s)]
*  Like that's not that bad. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7006.0s)]
*  Oh a few people are going to. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7007.0s)]
*  But but I'm going to make a lot of money. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7009.0s)]
*  You know and essentially that's how pharmaceutical drug companies push out drugs that wind up [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7011.0s)]
*  having horrible adverse events and that's how they can you know that they can justify [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7015.0s)]
*  it even though some of their studies have shown that this is probably going to be an [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7020.0s)]
*  issue and they still want to. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7024.0s)]
*  They still push it out there. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7026.0s)]
*  I mean that's what they did with Vioxx is they did with many many drugs. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7027.0s)]
*  I mean there's no greater example of that than the opioids though. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7031.0s)]
*  I mean that was just the best. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7034.0s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7035.0s)]
*  It's fucking horrific man. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7036.0s)]
*  The fact that no one went to jail for the rest of their life for what they did. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7038.0s)]
*  It's really horrifying. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7043.0s)]
*  If you think about the things that people go to jail for and the fact that that that [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7045.0s)]
*  family the Sackler family what they did and what the lies that those people who made those [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7050.0s)]
*  drugs told in terms of their addictive properties in terms of you know what what they're going [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7057.0s)]
*  to do to people. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7064.0s)]
*  It's fucking insane. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7065.0s)]
*  How many people have died. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7067.0s)]
*  How many people die every year. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7068.0s)]
*  Well so I did this analysis a while ago looking at what we call deaths of despair. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7070.0s)]
*  So how many people die every year from the big three. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7076.0s)]
*  So suicide accidental poisoning. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7079.0s)]
*  So that's accidental overdosing and alcohol related death. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7082.0s)]
*  So you know drunk driving cirrhosis things like that. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7087.0s)]
*  And that number is going up at about 25 percent a year. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7090.0s)]
*  That's insane by the way. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7094.0s)]
*  Just nothing goes up at 25 percent per year. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7095.0s)]
*  Like not you know bad things in health and medicine go up at like two to three percent per year. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7098.0s)]
*  That number is going up at 25 percent a year and the overdose part of that's going up at about 50 percent per year. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7104.0s)]
*  The suicide and alcohol parts not going up quite as fast. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7110.0s)]
*  In fact suicide of the three is going up at the least clip. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7113.0s)]
*  So we the numbers for 2020 aren't out yet but they should be out very soon. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7117.0s)]
*  In fact they might be out now. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7124.0s)]
*  I haven't looked in a month but it will I suspect be a little bit over 100000 US deaths from accidental poisoning. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7125.0s)]
*  So these are people who are you know they want it. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7135.0s)]
*  So they're either taking a drug that they don't even know is laced with fentanyl. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7138.0s)]
*  Right. So they're taking you know a counterfeit ambient or a counterfeit you know Valium or something like that or a counterfeit opioid itself like you know oxy of some sort. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7141.0s)]
*  You know or people who are just you know taking a drug but take too much of it not knowingly or something like that. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7153.0s)]
*  I mean that's it's hard. It's hard to believe. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7157.0s)]
*  It's hard to believe. It's hard to believe that by up to about the age of 55 close soon it'll be 60. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7159.0s)]
*  This will be the leading cause of death especially for men. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7166.0s)]
*  Why especially for men. Do men take more drugs than women. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7171.0s)]
*  Yeah men are disproportionately affected by deaths of despair. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7174.0s)]
*  Really. Why do you think that is. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7177.0s)]
*  You know it's super interesting. I don't know. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7181.0s)]
*  Did you hear Sebastian Younger on Barry Weiss's podcast the other day. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7182.0s)]
*  No I didn't. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7185.0s)]
*  It was really good. I think Barry's one of the I think Barry's just incredible. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7187.0s)]
*  I think she's great. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7191.0s)]
*  I sent her an email after and I was like how is it that in one hour you can get more interesting information out of a person than I can get in four. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7192.0s)]
*  Her rant with that little fatso Brian Stelter. Do you ever see that rant she did about the world gone mad. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7200.0s)]
*  No. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7207.0s)]
*  It was. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7208.0s)]
*  Was this back when he was so phosphorylated over CNN not being as popular as Joe Rogan. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7209.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7214.0s)]
*  I don't know how I missed that because I heard every I mean I heard everybody's rant on that it was so good. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7215.0s)]
*  He's so gross. But it was the world gone mad and he was like how is the world how is the world gone mad. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7219.0s)]
*  In what way. And she went on this fucking amazing rant. See if you can find it. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7226.0s)]
*  I want to see that. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7231.0s)]
*  It's it's really wild. It's really excellent. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7232.0s)]
*  While he's looking I want to just come back to this point though because answer your question. So let's see. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7236.0s)]
*  I just was waiting for him to. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7242.0s)]
*  Yeah. Go ahead. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7245.0s)]
*  OK. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7246.0s)]
*  Americans who aren't on the hard left or the hard right who feel the world has gone mad. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7247.0s)]
*  So in what ways has the world gone mad. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7252.0s)]
*  Well you know when you have the chief reporter on the beat of covid for the New York Times talking about how questioning or pursuing the question of the lab leak is racist. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7254.0s)]
*  The world has gone mad. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7266.0s)]
*  When you're not able to say out loud and in public that there are differences between men and women the world has gone mad. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7268.0s)]
*  When we're not allowed to acknowledge that rioting is rioting and it is bad and that silence is not violence but violence is violence. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7275.0s)]
*  The world has gone mad. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7284.0s)]
*  When we're not able to say that Hunter Biden's laptop is a story worth pursuing. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7286.0s)]
*  The world has gone mad when in the name of progress young schoolchildren as young as kindergarten are being separated in public schools because of their race. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7292.0s)]
*  And that is called progress rather than segregation. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7303.0s)]
*  The world has gone mad. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7306.0s)]
*  There are dozens of examples that I could share with with you and with you. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7307.0s)]
*  And you often say you say a lot of knows this and you say we're not allowed. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7311.0s)]
*  Who's the people stopping the conversation. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7316.0s)]
*  Who are they. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7319.0s)]
*  People let work at networks frankly like the one I'm speaking on right now who try and claim that you know it was it was racist to investigate the lab leak theory. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7322.0s)]
*  It was. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7333.0s)]
*  I mean I said that at CNN. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7334.0s)]
*  But I'm just saying that when you say aloud I just think it's a provocative thing to say you say you say we're not allowed to talk about these things but they're all over the Internet. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7335.0s)]
*  I can Google them everywhere. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7342.0s)]
*  I've heard about every story. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7344.0s)]
*  So I'm just suggesting of course people are allowed to cover whatever they want to cover. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7345.0s)]
*  But you and I both know and it would be delusional to claim otherwise that touching your finger to an increasing number of subjects that have been deemed third rail by the mainstream institutions and increasingly by some of the tech companies will lead to reputational damage. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7349.0s)]
*  Perhaps you losing your job. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7365.0s)]
*  Your children sometimes being demonized as well. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7368.0s)]
*  And so what happens is a kind of internal self censorship. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7372.0s)]
*  This is something that I saw over and over again when I was at the New York Times. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7376.0s)]
*  L.O.L. dummy. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7381.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7383.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7384.0s)]
*  She's amazing. So anyway she's amazing. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7385.0s)]
*  So Sebastian was on there and they were talking about men basically have a total absence of danger in their lives. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7386.0s)]
*  And he talks about how you I'm sure you've read Freedom which is a book that he wrote kind of his last. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7396.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7402.0s)]
*  Yeah I had him on right afterwards. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7403.0s)]
*  I didn't read that all the way. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7404.0s)]
*  I only read the first few chapters reading but I really love tribe. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7406.0s)]
*  Yeah tribe. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7410.0s)]
*  I mean these are these are amazing things and he talks about how basically look we kind of spent most of our evolutionary lives with real risk. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7411.0s)]
*  And he argues that paradoxically that made us happier like being in being in war even though war itself is bad. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7419.0s)]
*  The sense of camaraderie and the dependence that you have on another person. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7429.0s)]
*  Right. Like you know again I've never been in war so I can't speak to it but just listening to the way others have spoken about it it's like if you and I are in war together I trust you with my life and vice versa. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7434.0s)]
*  And he argues that that is so absent today that a you know you're seeing a lot more thrill seeking behavior that is just basically engineered risk. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7444.0s)]
*  And there's just a lower sense of purpose and I think he argues that women are less susceptible to this in large part because at least historically one of the most dangerous thing a woman can do is give birth to a child. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7455.0s)]
*  I mean the historical mortality of childbirth is enormous. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7466.0s)]
*  And therefore they're probably again these are broad generalizations but certainly the statistics don't lie which is that men are disproportionately subjected to these types of deaths. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7471.0s)]
*  It's interesting what causes people to experience despair because Jordan Peterson sent me a statistic yesterday. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7486.0s)]
*  I'll send it to you Jamie. It's really kind of disturbing. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7497.0s)]
*  It's essentially saying that 30 women that hit the age of 30 that 50 percent of them now are have no children and 50 percent of them will never have children and that 90 percent of them are going to regret it. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7500.0s)]
*  Which is really horrible. Like if you really stop and think about that 90 percent of them regretting it. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7520.0s)]
*  I'll send this to you. The epidemic the not dare. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7528.0s)]
*  Okay. No it's a unfortunately it's a video. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7532.0s)]
*  I'm not going to watch it. It's like an hour and 18 minutes. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7535.0s)]
*  But that statistic alone that 90 percent of them are going to regret not having children. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7538.0s)]
*  You know that there's a there's a series of biological switches that go off in a person's life. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7544.0s)]
*  You know becoming an adult being on your own becoming self-sufficient get finding an occupation finding groups of friends and community and having a family. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7552.0s)]
*  There are those things. There's a thing that people they do and they become a different thing because of that. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7565.0s)]
*  You know you become a different person when you you become a mother or father. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7571.0s)]
*  You know you do. You something happens. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7576.0s)]
*  You you reach like another stage of life. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7579.0s)]
*  It's a different chapter. And for people that never reach that stage for men. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7582.0s)]
*  I've talked about this many times. It's like very depressing. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7586.0s)]
*  There's a lot of comedian friends. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7589.0s)]
*  Which part is depressing. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7592.0s)]
*  I was going to get into that. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7593.0s)]
*  There's it's very depressing when you see a lot of men that do not have children that are in their 60s and 70s and they've never had kids and they're not married and they're just adrift. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7594.0s)]
*  It's really sad because these same guys that like really valued freedom when they were 30 and 40 they find themselves in this like purposeless existence as their body starts to fade and fail. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7607.0s)]
*  And they realize like oh my God I've missed a whole thing in life because I didn't want to take that chance because I didn't want to you know either contribute to overpopulation or I didn't want to lose my freedom or whatever the rationale was. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7622.0s)]
*  And also you find yourself in your late 60s alone. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7637.0s)]
*  No children no wife. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7641.0s)]
*  And you can't have children anymore. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7643.0s)]
*  It's over. Good you do. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7645.0s)]
*  I mean maybe a man can some old men have kids. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7647.0s)]
*  Maybe you know you can do it maybe but you've got to find some young lady who's still got eggs is willing to let you fuck her and increasingly less likely as you get older that they want that you know. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7649.0s)]
*  Yeah I'm amazed at how when my wife and I got married I was not I was I was indifferent towards having kids really. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7662.0s)]
*  I didn't think it was like you know I was like I mean I guess so if that's what you want. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7670.0s)]
*  And of course I feel the same way you do which is like you know most most important thing I've ever done most you know greatest source of pleasure is actually kids but not without pain right. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7674.0s)]
*  I mean it's really hard as you know to raise kids and I you know a friend of mine gave me the greatest piece of advice recently which was something his wife does. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7686.0s)]
*  Now we have two boys right. So we have this experience where they're like and they're feral right. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7697.0s)]
*  Like they're full on out of control much much more difficult than our daughter was and at least three times a day they do something that just makes you want to like kill them. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7700.0s)]
*  And my friend was like anytime you are getting you're getting frustrated with them just close your eyes and imagine you are 80 years old and you have a time machine that is bringing you right back to this moment. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7711.0s)]
*  And this is the only moment you will get with them again when they're young. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7725.0s)]
*  That's great. It's awesome. I mean it's incredible advice. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7729.0s)]
*  That's very good advice. Very good advice. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7733.0s)]
*  And it totally changes everything and you're like oh yeah I'll take this all day long. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7736.0s)]
*  You know it was one of the big shifts with me. It wasn't just it changed who I am as a person. It changed. There's a lot of things that changed raising kids. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7739.0s)]
*  But one of the big things that changed was how I look at other people because I look at other people like oh you used to be a baby. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7749.0s)]
*  I didn't used to do that. I was like I guess I was like in my 30s when I figured that out. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7757.0s)]
*  I didn't figure out that people used to be babies. I know that sounds so stupid. Like where do you think they came from. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7763.0s)]
*  I would see some guy who's like 40 years old as a douche bag. I was like oh he's always been that guy. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7771.0s)]
*  He was static. You're static. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7776.0s)]
*  You're static. You know but it's you. I had I gained a much higher level of compassion and understanding and much more charitable towards people. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7777.0s)]
*  Much more much more forgiving because I go somebody fucked you over. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7792.0s)]
*  Not just somebody but a series of people and life itself fucked you over. And that's why you're a shithead. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7796.0s)]
*  You're a shithead because you met the wrong people. You had the wrong experiences. You had the wrong life. You have the wrong parents. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7801.0s)]
*  All the above. You know it's interesting. I agree with you completely and I'm amazed at how people can't hold to truth simultaneously around this. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7808.0s)]
*  So on the one hand everything you said is correct. And yet on the other hand there have to be consequences for being a shithead. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7818.0s)]
*  Yeah. And that everything you're saying doesn't abolish the fact that if you're a shithead like you're going to live a different life. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7823.0s)]
*  And those two things are concurrently true. And that's OK. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7828.0s)]
*  Yeah. That's very important. And also no one's doing anything. That's the crazy thing right. No one's doing anything to fix shitheads. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7835.0s)]
*  It's just this wild rat race as much as we know about psychology and human development and what can and can't be fixed. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7843.0s)]
*  You would imagine that if you wanted to make the world a better place one of the I mean really you want to make America great again. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7850.0s)]
*  Forget about economics. Although that's important. What you really would want to do is concentrate on the psychology of all of its citizens. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7855.0s)]
*  You would want to concentrate on prospects like your your your prospects for a future healthy happy life. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7865.0s)]
*  And what's the impediment of those prospects. And how do we mitigate all these issues like inner city crime violence grant gangs. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7875.0s)]
*  All that should be of primary concern to anyone who's like if you're running this country and you're saying you know we want to make the greatest country the world's ever known. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7882.0s)]
*  We think we have the greatest country. We can make it even better. And here's how. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7892.0s)]
*  The number one number one would be we've got to fix the ghettos. Number one number one number one we've got to the economic disparity the disparity in terms of the prospects that people have for living a normal healthy life without violence. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7895.0s)]
*  And crime the difference between someone who's born in Baltimore and someone who's born in Beverly Hills are so off the charts different. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7912.0s)]
*  And no one's doing jack shit to try to even that out. Like this idea about like financial equality like that's not you're not going to achieve that because you're not going to achieve effort equality. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7920.0s)]
*  People there's certain people are just going to always work harder than other people. This idea of like we need to redistribute. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7933.0s)]
*  I was watching this maddening conversation with this fucking dork was trying to say that all money over three million dollars that a person makes should be taxed at 90 percent. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7938.0s)]
*  That's great for you to say because you're never going to make three million dollars you fucking idiot. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7949.0s)]
*  But that's so stupid. The idea behind it is so stupid. The understanding where that money goes is so stupid. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7954.0s)]
*  The understanding of incentives. Well what about fucking venture capital money. What about all the fucking money that you need to make an iPhone. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7960.0s)]
*  Do you think anything's going to happen if you tax everybody over three million dollars 90 percent. No. Where's the money going by the way. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7966.0s)]
*  It's just going to some fucking magical fairy who's going to evenly distribute it to everybody else. We're all going to live a great life. The fuck out of here. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7973.0s)]
*  You're just going to empower the government to steal money. That's what you're going to do. It's so dumb. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7980.0s)]
*  But on the other hand like there there has to be something there has to be something better than what we're doing now. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7985.0s)]
*  Yeah I think about this a lot just out of personal curiosity and I have to tell you like this this stacks up in the column of things for which I don't have any intelligent thought. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=7994.0s)]
*  I you know for all I think about this and read about this I mean theoretically I have ideas right. But in terms of what you're asking which is actually the implementation what would you actually do right. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8007.0s)]
*  What do you have to do in East Baltimore to make it different and how much of it is policy and how much of it is not policy. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8019.0s)]
*  Because let's look at some really obvious examples having two parents in the household game changer in terms of difference game changer game changer. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8029.0s)]
*  So if you have a father or you don't have a father in the home totally different. I don't there's no policy that fixes that right. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8037.0s)]
*  There's no policy that fixes that but there are certain things you can take. Well yes you do that can mitigate that. Sure incarceration changes also you know community like having community centers having outreach programs having counselors and people that are available to young boys and girls who don't have a father or don't have a mother or whatever it is. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8044.0s)]
*  Yeah. So I don't know. It's. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8065.0s)]
*  It is upsetting. There's no question. It's very upsetting. It's also upsetting when you see how much money we have to send to Ukraine and like OK whether or not you agree with that or not. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8068.0s)]
*  Like where was all that money to deal with all these inner city problems like where's all that money to fix the south side of Chicago or to fix Detroit. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8079.0s)]
*  Nothing is zero zero effort in that regard which is very strange. But the answer is not like taxing people 90 percent. You're just empowering the government. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8087.0s)]
*  Not only that they suck like to make the government larger and more bloated. You think somehow or another by giving them 90 percent of the money over three million dollars is going to make them efficient. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8100.0s)]
*  No you're just going to get people infuriated. Well I mean the best example of that not to pick on our favorite former state. Have you read Schellenberger's book San Francisco. Yes. Yeah I mean that's that's the case study of how that went wrong right. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8111.0s)]
*  And what that those failures are not happening because there's not enough money. I think the core insight from his his his book is the lack of nuance that goes into the problem right. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8124.0s)]
*  It's sort of using the term homelessness to describe every person who does not live in their home. When reality it's like the woman who had to flee her home because her husband was beating her versus the untreated person with mental illness versus the person who's addicted to drugs. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8134.0s)]
*  Those people are not the same. The solution to help those people is not the same. And yet when we try to treat everyone as the same in that regard you know we end up with San Francisco. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8154.0s)]
*  Yeah. Big government is not the answer and more money to government is not the answer. It's it's just there's too many people that are involved in government that are first of all they're finding legal or illegal ways to siphon off money in one way shape form or another. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8164.0s)]
*  And that's why they're why they're motivated to get into it in the first place. They're motivated to get into it. It's like ugly version of Hollywood. You want attention. They want power and control. And then ultimately once they're in there and they understand the system they realize that there's an incredible incentive to go along with the program. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8185.0s)]
*  And you make extraordinary amounts of money if you do that. If you're one of those congresspeople that does insider trade and you look at how much money they've able to do look at someone like Nancy Pelosi who's making who's worth hundreds of millions of dollars on a six figure salary. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8203.0s)]
*  You're like how how how do you do that. What are you doing. How is that legal. How is that legal. They put Martha Stewart in jail for insider trading and this this what she does is totally legal. You would imagine that a sane world in a sane world you would not be able to know a law is being passed and then make a stock trade based on knowing that that law is being passed that a certain industry would benefit and that industry the stock is going to go up. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8218.0s)]
*  Extraordinarily like you would think that no you have insider information. You can't do that especially because you're a public servant. You're supposed to be a politician that's serving your constituents instead. You're just using this information and you're you're you have advanced knowledge of it. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8248.0s)]
*  You're making insane amounts of money. You're doing better than Warren Buffett and George Soros in the stock market. Fuck you. This is crazy. But but that's the reality. There needs to be something different than what we're doing now. But you know I don't know how to do it. I don't know what the answer is but it seems like there's not a lot of effort or discussion that's being put into trying to figure out what that is or how to do that. The idea of like you know I'm not going to go into that. I'm going to go into that. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8263.0s)]
*  The idea of like you know I know a lot of people love to talk about income inequality but it's like such a bullshit conversation because they always like to pretend they like people always like like for instance they always want to do the income inequality thing with men and women. You know like oh women get paid seventy five cents every dollar a man makes. I had a conversation with a friend of mine about that where he didn't even know that that was about different occupations. Do you understand this different occupations in different hours. Yeah. He was like what. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8290.0s)]
*  I was like yeah you're arguing something that you like saw on you know fucking MSNBC like this is nonsense. Like if you actually look at the real statistics and then there's also you're never going to get income inequality because there's certain people income equality rather because there's certain people that are just always going to push further and harder in sports in art in finance in anything in anything. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8320.0s)]
*  You're not going to get equality with human beings because you're not going to get equality of effort. You're not going to get equality of desire. People have different motivations. What you want is a level playing field. That's what you want where people can do their best with what they have and not be hindered by some shenanigans and bullshit and manipulation. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8350.0s)]
*  That's what you want. If you want to work towards that like a level opportunity field and not a level opportunity to make money. OK. But if you want to say like we need income equality like god damn it there's people that are psychos that work seventy nine hours every fucking week on Adderall. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8371.0s)]
*  You're never going to make as much money as them. You're never going to push as hard as them. You're never going to want it as much. You're never going to pump your fists up in the air when you fucking sign a deal like they do. They're out of their mind. You don't even want to be them. You don't want to be them. It's income equality is not it's not our ultimate goal. Our ultimate goal is happiness for human beings. What makes human beings happy. Well having fucking health care would be nice. Having some sort of like a real health care system in this country that you can absolutely count on not being in massive student [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8390.0s)]
*  debt. Student loan debt is so goddamn crazy that you can get a you go bankrupt and you can never absolve your student loan debt. There's people that are getting their Social Security docked because they owe student loans. You want to talk about getting to the end of the fucking game and you're a loser like that's got to suck. Your student loan debts are taking your fucking Social Security money. Oh my god. That's going to be so depressing. The fact that that's an actual [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8420.0s)]
*  actually true. Those two things. That's a system. That's a fuck system. That's not good. When you get subsidized education they jack the rates up and you can never get out of the loans and then health care like. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8450.0s)]
*  Did you see the thing I posted a couple of weeks ago about this bill we got from when my Jill was with our middle son in San Diego visiting a friend and he was sick. So she had to take him to an ER right. Like we don't our doctor is not there right. Obviously we live here. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8466.0s)]
*  So they did like regular chemistry lab on him. That's like about a twelve dollar blood test and gave him like I don't know 250 to 500 CC of IV fluid. That was it. That was it. What do you think the bill was. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8480.0s)]
*  Twelve hundred dollars. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8495.0s)]
*  I don't remember it because I have to look at the post I put up. I think the bill was six thousand of which we owed two thousand. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8497.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8504.0s)]
*  That's that's problematic. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8505.0s)]
*  That's a real problem. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8507.0s)]
*  That's a real problem. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8508.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8509.0s)]
*  Six thousand dollar bill our insurance somehow picked up maybe thirty five hundred. We were stuck with twenty five hundred. Now juxtapose that with the following fact fewer than 50 percent of Americans today if given twenty four hours can produce twenty five hundred dollars in cash. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8511.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8525.0s)]
*  I think healthcare is the leading cause of personal bankruptcy. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8526.0s)]
*  It's the first second third fourth fifth. Like there's nothing else matters besides healthcare when it comes to personal bankruptcy. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8530.0s)]
*  I mean this this does infuriate me to no end. Like I sometimes think like is there any other problem I would ever be interested to devoting my full attention to besides the problem I work on now. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8536.0s)]
*  That's the only other problem that would tempt me. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8548.0s)]
*  You know it's interesting too if that problem was really tackled by by our government and they did it in an efficient way. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8550.0s)]
*  One of the ways they would have to do it one of the ways they would have to address it in order to be efficient would be to encourage people to become metabolically healthy. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8560.0s)]
*  Of course we have zero encouragement zero. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8570.0s)]
*  Zero. In fact there's actually the opposite. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8573.0s)]
*  There's encouragement for people to have body positivity and to not be fat phobic and to not fat shame. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8576.0s)]
*  You know and if and there's zero discussion about healthy diets and vitamin supplementation and the benefits of that. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8585.0s)]
*  If we if if they just did like imagine if the government was responsible for our health care and they realize hey guys guys guys we got a real problem here. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8593.0s)]
*  We're spending too much money and we're losing money because what if they're the amount of money that they made was dependent upon the percentage of money that was spent on health care. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8603.0s)]
*  Like imagine if politicians if their salary depended on the like. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8617.0s)]
*  See but I fear that that would still get screwed up because then they would just cut costs right. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8623.0s)]
*  Like I feel like what if that wasn't an option though. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8627.0s)]
*  What if we have to we have to cut costs. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8630.0s)]
*  This is the problem right. We're spending we're probably up to ten thousand dollars per capita which is I mean we're actually probably more than that. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8633.0s)]
*  We're probably twelve thousand dollars fourteen thousand dollars per capita. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8641.0s)]
*  So we're at two to five X every other developed nation and what we spend on health care. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8645.0s)]
*  But why. And we get worse outcomes. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8650.0s)]
*  OK so the big reason comes down to made up numbers. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8652.0s)]
*  Look at my ER example. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8657.0s)]
*  The blood test cost the actual cost of ordering that blood test is twelve dollars. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8660.0s)]
*  The bag of IV fluid is probably thirty eight dollars. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8665.0s)]
*  So why do they inflate the cost so much. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8667.0s)]
*  It's because they play a shell game with the insurance company. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8669.0s)]
*  So they say we negotiate different rates with different insurance companies and we're going to we're going to build up the price enormously but we're going to offer you a really big discount. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8672.0s)]
*  And we're going to make you our preferred network. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8683.0s)]
*  We're going to be your preferred network and there's a you know a quid pro quo here which is the price is enormous but you don't actually have to pay that much. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8686.0s)]
*  We're going to discount it to you. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8693.0s)]
*  But if somebody comes in out of network which we were right we were out of network because you know we're probably our network is optimized around being in Austin and not in San Diego. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8694.0s)]
*  You're going to get screwed and of course if you don't have insurance forget about it you're paying the fake money price. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8703.0s)]
*  Especially if there's a real injury. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8708.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8710.0s)]
*  The real injury you need surgery and you're not insured. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8712.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8715.0s)]
*  The other thing is we don't have the same laws around like drug pricing. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8717.0s)]
*  Right. So so drug you know the United States basically subsidizes the rest of the world in drug pricing. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8723.0s)]
*  So we in exchange for getting first dibs on the best drugs we pay a higher price for them and other countries are basically not going to pay that because you also have better purchasing power. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8730.0s)]
*  So if you look at Canada for example like the government is buying the drugs not the not that not that not the payer. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8741.0s)]
*  Right. So it's a it's a totally different system. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8749.0s)]
*  And the challenge is no system is going to be perfect. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8752.0s)]
*  But what really bothers me about the discussion is we're missing the point that there are three variables that need to be optimized around and everybody just talks about their favorite one. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8756.0s)]
*  But you can't talk about one without talking about the other two because if you pull on one lever you've got to let up on one of the other levers. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8766.0s)]
*  So the three levers are. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8773.0s)]
*  Cost. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8775.0s)]
*  How much does it cost to deliver this care. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8776.0s)]
*  The second is quality. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8779.0s)]
*  How good is the care. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8780.0s)]
*  And the third one is access. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8782.0s)]
*  How many people fall through the cracks. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8784.0s)]
*  So if you look at the United States we're very good on quality when we deliver care. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8786.0s)]
*  It's the best. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8792.0s)]
*  There's a reason people come from all over the world here when they need their cancer surgery. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8793.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8797.0s)]
*  We are certainly at or in the you know at or above the best for everything that would be done in medicine. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8798.0s)]
*  On cost we are absolutely the worst. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8804.0s)]
*  There's literally no country that pays more than we do for a given service. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8806.0s)]
*  And on access we're horrible for a developed nation. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8811.0s)]
*  Horrible. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8815.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8816.0s)]
*  The number cost like what is the difference between like say United States and Canada. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8817.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8820.0s)]
*  Two and a half X I would bet. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8821.0s)]
*  Maybe three X. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8824.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8825.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8827.0s)]
*  So it's and that's not like a third world country or something like that. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8828.0s)]
*  So Canada is killing us in cost. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8830.0s)]
*  They're killing us in access because everybody's covered. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8833.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8836.0s)]
*  We have better quality. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8837.0s)]
*  So you have to. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8838.0s)]
*  So that's that's the trade off. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8839.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8840.0s)]
*  I mean I do talk about how my mom is getting largely veterinary medicine in Canada. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8841.0s)]
*  I mean like her health care is horrible as far as I'm concerned. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8846.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8849.0s)]
*  I have many friends in Canada that have complained. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8850.0s)]
*  It's totally unacceptable. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8852.0s)]
*  So they have bad care but at least everybody gets it. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8853.0s)]
*  And it's is it bad care because the physicians are not incentivized to provide better care [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8857.0s)]
*  because they don't make as much money. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8862.0s)]
*  No no no no. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8864.0s)]
*  So first of all I mean at least I don't know if I don't want to speak out of school because [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8865.0s)]
*  I'm so far removed from it. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8867.0s)]
*  But when I was growing up they had introduced salary caps. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8869.0s)]
*  So physicians salaries were capped. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8872.0s)]
*  So when you hit your cap you retire you stopped working for the year. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8874.0s)]
*  So high earning surgeons like would retire not retire but retire. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8877.0s)]
*  So you know I think that's the biggest problem. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8881.0s)]
*  High earning surgeons like would retire not retire would stop working in August because [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8883.0s)]
*  they'd hit their set like let's say the salary cap was three hundred thousand dollars. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8888.0s)]
*  If you earn three hundred thousand dollars by August you weren't going to get paid anymore. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8891.0s)]
*  So they would just sit down and sit out the rest of the year. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8895.0s)]
*  Yep. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8900.0s)]
*  And come back in January. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8901.0s)]
*  It would create this real problem where there was a bottleneck. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8902.0s)]
*  Shortage of docs. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8904.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8905.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8906.0s)]
*  But the bigger issue is just that the government is in charge of what gets done and what does [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8907.0s)]
*  not get done and there's sort of shortages. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8911.0s)]
*  Right. So if you like things that you and I take for granted right if you tweaked your [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8913.0s)]
*  knee at Jiu Jitsu tonight you go get an MRI tomorrow. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8916.0s)]
*  That doesn't happen in Canada. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8920.0s)]
*  In fact in certain provinces it's illegal to have private private clinics where you can [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8921.0s)]
*  go pay out of your own pocket to get an MRI expedited. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8926.0s)]
*  It's illegal illegal. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8930.0s)]
*  I think Ontario is one of those provinces by the really. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8932.0s)]
*  Yep. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8935.0s)]
*  So Toronto in Toronto I do not believe it is legal to have private medical clinics. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8936.0s)]
*  Where you can pay out of pocket. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8940.0s)]
*  So this is where when people say oh we should just be like Canada I'm like no we should [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8941.0s)]
*  do something Canada does. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8945.0s)]
*  We should have universal coverage. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8947.0s)]
*  And then have the option. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8948.0s)]
*  And then you have the option to bolt on. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8950.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8952.0s)]
*  But would that be sort of like public defenders versus a really good attorney like. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8953.0s)]
*  No I don't think it would be. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8958.0s)]
*  Yes of course. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8959.0s)]
*  No I think I think one of the things you have to do is provide primary care and emergency [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8960.0s)]
*  services for free. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8965.0s)]
*  Because that's where 90 percent of your care would be delivered. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8969.0s)]
*  And is the problem that because of these made up numbers you discussed earlier that these [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8974.0s)]
*  people in this country at least are accustomed to charging these exorbitant fees like six [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8978.0s)]
*  thousand dollars for a bag of IV. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8984.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8986.0s)]
*  Like I mean I had I had my I got a colonoscopy every three years so I had my last one last [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8987.0s)]
*  this time a year ago. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8992.0s)]
*  And you know because it's funny that one should have been covered. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8993.0s)]
*  I don't remember the details on it but because I was over 45 at that point so it's counted [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=8998.0s)]
*  as a screening colonoscopy. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9002.0s)]
*  But I've historically always had to pay cash for my colonoscopies because I started doing [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9003.0s)]
*  them when I was 40. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9006.0s)]
*  And the cash cost of getting a colonoscopy at like one of the best guys in New York City [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9007.0s)]
*  who I've always gone to is two thousand dollars. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9013.0s)]
*  That's the fully loaded cash cost. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9016.0s)]
*  That means that's covering the facility fee the anesthesia his fee. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9018.0s)]
*  His fee etc. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9022.0s)]
*  The one I got here in Austin where I did it through insurance the fee was six thousand [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9024.0s)]
*  dollars. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9031.0s)]
*  I got the bill and you know my insurance picked up. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9032.0s)]
*  Maybe this is the one I'm anyway. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9036.0s)]
*  My point is my cash out of pocket was almost as bad as the cash I paid for just a full [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9038.0s)]
*  up cash one. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9043.0s)]
*  It had a whole bunch of made up numbers. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9044.0s)]
*  I actually called my gastroenterologist the guy who did it and I was like you got to walk [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9045.0s)]
*  me through this because like I'm struggling to understand these costs. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9049.0s)]
*  And he couldn't really explain it. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9054.0s)]
*  He's like I mean I don't know. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9056.0s)]
*  I don't really understand it. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9060.0s)]
*  He's like but but you know like everybody has sort of a different amount. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9061.0s)]
*  You know it's like being at like a bizarre where it's like oh I have special price for [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9065.0s)]
*  you today. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9068.0s)]
*  But it's it's one of those things where health care is you would think that in a healthy [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9070.0s)]
*  community healthy like psychologically healthy community where you really respect your [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9076.0s)]
*  citizens and care about them. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9081.0s)]
*  It's a basic human right. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9083.0s)]
*  Like you if we're considering ourselves a country for considering ourselves a community [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9085.0s)]
*  of people that all live together on a certain patch of dirt being able to exist and to be [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9090.0s)]
*  able to be treated if you get injured or if you get ill it should be like a primary concern. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9098.0s)]
*  No I think it would be one of the most important rights that we should have. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9104.0s)]
*  That's one. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9109.0s)]
*  And the other one should like what is the negative about educating everybody. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9110.0s)]
*  There's zero negative. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9116.0s)]
*  It's only positive. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9117.0s)]
*  You're only going to get more contributors to the economy. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9119.0s)]
*  You're only going to get more people that are excelling in life and pushing the boundaries [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9122.0s)]
*  of whatever their occupation is whatever they're doing. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9127.0s)]
*  You're going to get more people that have this this opportunity to thrive in life. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9131.0s)]
*  You have a country with less losers. [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9136.0s)]
*  You have a country with more people that are successful with investing in that seems like. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9137.0s)]
*  But instead we do the opposite. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9142.0s)]
*  We we make it so you can never get out of your debt. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9143.0s)]
*  We charge you a fucking insane amount of money for your education that you often are not [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9146.0s)]
*  even going to use. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9151.0s)]
*  You know I mean it's there's so many things wrong with it and it just continues over and [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9152.0s)]
*  over and over again. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9158.0s)]
*  And then there's the indoctrination of children into these fucking leftist ideas that they [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9159.0s)]
*  promote to very you know easily manipulated and you know kind of naive young people and [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9163.0s)]
*  these people that have never existed out there in the real world at all and have only existed [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9170.0s)]
*  in academia are now teaching your kids and influencing your kids and your kids are finally [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9174.0s)]
*  free of their parents. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9179.0s)]
*  So they're going to spread their wings and adopt these fucking loony tunes ideas from [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9180.0s)]
*  these douchebags and you know and then they have to go out in the world and go oh my god [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9186.0s)]
*  what did I learn and learn nothing and I owe 90 thousand dollars. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9191.0s)]
*  What the fuck. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9194.0s)]
*  And I can never get out of it. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9195.0s)]
*  And every year it goes up. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9197.0s)]
*  Yeah it is amazing when you look at the sort of inflation of administration within the [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9199.0s)]
*  universities and how much it is driving up cost and not driving up outcomes. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9206.0s)]
*  Because again it all comes down to the ROI right. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9213.0s)]
*  Like if if you have to spend 100 thousand dollars to get an education but the education [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9215.0s)]
*  is so good that you get a job that pays you two hundred thousand dollars a year. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9219.0s)]
*  Well then it was worth it. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9223.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9224.0s)]
*  I mean that's how I feel about my education. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9225.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9226.0s)]
*  Like you know my med school probably cost me two hundred thousand dollars or something [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9227.0s)]
*  ridiculous. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9230.0s)]
*  But you know I was able to earn it back right. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9232.0s)]
*  You're you're if you're going to law school if you're going to business school if you're [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9234.0s)]
*  going to these schools it's different. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9236.0s)]
*  But yes it's when you're you know an art major in college that it's hard to justify. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9238.0s)]
*  You're a quarter million dollars in debt for gender studies. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9243.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9246.0s)]
*  Congratulations. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9247.0s)]
*  But going back to your point I mean I think the biggest problem with why that system of [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9248.0s)]
*  incentivizing based on health would would would be difficult is you know think about [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9253.0s)]
*  what all the variables are that you have at your disposal to be healthy. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9259.0s)]
*  There's basically five as far as I can tell. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9262.0s)]
*  Maybe a sixth. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9265.0s)]
*  So what you eat your exercise habits your sleep habits how you manage emotional health [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9266.0s)]
*  and stress what drugs supplements hormones you take and then kind of call it the grab [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9273.0s)]
*  bag like sauna avoiding air pollution like all the other stuff that you could do that [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9278.0s)]
*  can have a positive impact on your health. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9283.0s)]
*  And what's interesting too about the emotional health is it's very much tied to isolation [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9285.0s)]
*  like people that are isolated. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9292.0s)]
*  That's a gigantic issue. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9294.0s)]
*  People that don't have good friends and people that are sad and alone. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9296.0s)]
*  What is the statistic on that isn't it. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9300.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9302.0s)]
*  If you're single yeah you have a higher mortality if you're if you're not in a relationship [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9303.0s)]
*  for sure. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9307.0s)]
*  But it's higher. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9308.0s)]
*  It's as high as it's more high than people that are alcoholics and it's more high than [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9309.0s)]
*  people smoke 15 cigarettes a day. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9313.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9315.0s)]
*  There's probably some break something. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9316.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9317.0s)]
*  There's some break up. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9318.0s)]
*  But isn't that fascinating that we we we are such social creatures that your your your [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9319.0s)]
*  your actual physical vitality depends upon your interaction with other human beings. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9326.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9330.0s)]
*  Look I mean none of us not not not one of us could survive in the wilderness indefinitely [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9331.0s)]
*  and that's you know part of that I think is the obviously the physical part of that but [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9336.0s)]
*  I think emotionally emotional. [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9340.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9342.0s)]
*  Well that's that's one of the reasons why we're so terrified about those people that [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9343.0s)]
*  decide to do that. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9347.0s)]
*  Like you get a Ted Kaczynski who's out there in a fucking shack in the middle of Montana. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9348.0s)]
*  Those people are terrifying because there's something so wrong with them that they want [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9353.0s)]
*  to be alone. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9358.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9359.0s)]
*  So go back to those six things I talked about right or whatever. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9360.0s)]
*  How many of those did we learn in medicine. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9363.0s)]
*  One. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9368.0s)]
*  Just the drug bucket. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9369.0s)]
*  And by the way we didn't even learn that bucket fully because we didn't learn anything about [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9371.0s)]
*  hormones. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9375.0s)]
*  We didn't learn anything about supplements. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9376.0s)]
*  We basically learned the drug bucket. [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9377.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9379.0s)]
*  And that's not an exaggeration. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9380.0s)]
*  I mean I literally had zero education in nutrition zero education and exercise. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9381.0s)]
*  So even if a doctor knows the literature which says OK you know stuff you and I have talked [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9387.0s)]
*  about many times before if your VO2 max is this it's three times you know more beneficial [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9394.0s)]
*  to your lifespan than not smoking is all that kind of stuff. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9400.0s)]
*  So even if they knew that fact they don't know how to tell you to train. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9404.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9408.0s)]
*  They don't know what workout to tell you to do. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9409.0s)]
*  And yes a good doctor should know that you're better off being a normal weight than being [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9411.0s)]
*  overweight. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9416.0s)]
*  But if you actually ask them what should I eat how should I achieve this goal. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9417.0s)]
*  Eat less exercise more. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9423.0s)]
*  Yeah yeah I get that. [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9424.0s)]
*  But give me more specificity. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9425.0s)]
*  Like tell me what to do. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9427.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9429.0s)]
*  I can't. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9430.0s)]
*  Yeah they can't. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9431.0s)]
*  There's a system where let's just say the average doctor might get you know 10 to 15 [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9432.0s)]
*  minutes with a patient a day. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9437.0s)]
*  And then they're constantly cycling new people and you know they have to pay insurance and [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9439.0s)]
*  they have to pay the lease on the billing they're at. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9444.4s)]
*  They have to. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9447.0s)]
*  They're probably still in debt from their medical bills. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9448.0s)]
*  Sure. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9450.0s)]
*  And they're and they basically have to hit certain billing codes to get paid. [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9451.0s)]
*  And the billing codes include diagnosis right. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9454.0s)]
*  You only get paid when you can say this is the problem. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9457.0s)]
*  This is the problem. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9459.0s)]
*  This is the problem. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9460.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9461.0s)]
*  That's why I think like it's a this is one of those problems where I think at the you [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9462.0s)]
*  have to sort of take individual responsibility at this point. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9468.0s)]
*  I don't think you can wait for the system to fix itself. [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9470.0s)]
*  You certainly have to take individual responsibility but there's so many people that don't even [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9473.0s)]
*  know what that means. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9476.0s)]
*  You know for you and I as people who have concentrated on health most of our lives that's [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9477.0s)]
*  you know we kind of have an understanding of the territory. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9483.0s)]
*  There's a lot of people out there that literally don't know where to begin. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9486.0s)]
*  And so it's such a daunting thing. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9489.0s)]
*  They're they're intimidated. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9491.0s)]
*  They don't know how to start. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9493.0s)]
*  They don't know. [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9495.0s)]
*  They don't understand the benefit of it. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9496.0s)]
*  I mean there's so many people that are intelligent people that I know. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9497.0s)]
*  They're intelligent. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9501.0s)]
*  They're very smart. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9502.0s)]
*  Their body is a fucking trash bag of disaster. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9503.0s)]
*  Like how how did you how are you how are you existing like this. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9507.0s)]
*  You're you can't be really happy with this body. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9511.0s)]
*  It's not with the way it looks. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9517.0s)]
*  No I understand. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9519.0s)]
*  How you feel. [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9520.0s)]
*  Functioning. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9521.0s)]
*  There's no way. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9522.0s)]
*  There's no way it functions well. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9523.0s)]
*  It's like you have sugar in your gas tank man. [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9524.0s)]
*  Like you're fucked. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9526.0s)]
*  This is not good. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9527.0s)]
*  And yet they don't even think about it. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9529.0s)]
*  They just they're just going through life. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9532.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9536.0s)]
*  But again I think when I say personal responsibility I don't mean to I mean what I mean is the [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9537.0s)]
*  system will not fix that problem. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9543.0s)]
*  The system will not. [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9544.0s)]
*  The system will not. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9545.0s)]
*  Well one of the great benefits of the time that we live in today is that someone could [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9546.0s)]
*  read your book or listen to your podcast or Huberman or you know many of these people [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9550.0s)]
*  have these really really educational shows that can you know Huberman's fucking all this [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9557.0s)]
*  list of different topics that he covers. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9564.0s)]
*  We went over it when he was here last week. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9566.0s)]
*  It's like what a resource. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9568.0s)]
*  What a great thing to be able to have something like that. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9569.0s)]
*  And that that this exists today and that I think more people who are seeking out this [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9572.0s)]
*  information have a greater understanding of what's required and what works and what doesn't. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9577.0s)]
*  Yeah I just I hope I mean one of the things that does worry me I agree with you completely [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9583.0s)]
*  but there's also so many imposters right. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9586.0s)]
*  Have you seen this V shred idiot. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9589.0s)]
*  No. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9591.0s)]
*  Oh dude. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9592.0s)]
*  I have seen that more plates more dates has been he did an evisceration of him. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9593.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9598.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9599.0s)]
*  I don't know who this guy is. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9600.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9601.0s)]
*  It's funny based on what Derek said. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9602.0s)]
*  Derek said that YouTube is mostly targeting people who know nothing. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9604.0s)]
*  That means I know nothing because this guy gets served up to me every YouTube video I ever watch. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9608.0s)]
*  Really. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9613.0s)]
*  And I've never watched a YouTube video where he is not getting served up to me. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9614.0s)]
*  That's interesting. [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9617.0s)]
*  That's algorithms are fascinating right because I don't get served up him at all. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9618.0s)]
*  Oh yeah I get served him up. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9623.0s)]
*  I mean for the last two years I've been served him up on nine out of ten videos I watch. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9624.0s)]
*  And what is his deal. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9628.0s)]
*  I mean just the total huckster. [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9630.0s)]
*  I've not looked into it. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9631.0s)]
*  He's a really good looking guy with a great physique who has no idea what he's talking about and is selling supplements and craziness. [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9632.0s)]
*  At least he's a good looking guy with a good physique. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9640.0s)]
*  I know some hucksters that look like shit. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9643.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9645.0s)]
*  I'm like who's buying this fucking dork with his fucking goofy glasses on with those red blocker glasses on like there's a lot of those guys out there. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9646.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9654.0s)]
*  That look like shit and they're promoting they're like health experts. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9655.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9658.0s)]
*  So there's the challenge right. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9659.0s)]
*  It's like we do have really good signal. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9660.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9662.0s)]
*  With the signal comes the noise. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9663.0s)]
*  There's a lot of and so you've got to get that signal to noise ratio figured out. [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9664.0s)]
*  And I think you're right. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9668.0s)]
*  That's like what would be my advice to somebody who doesn't have the time to figure out like is this person reputable. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9669.0s)]
*  Is this a person who I can who I can trust. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9675.0s)]
*  And unfortunately I think the best thing you can do is rely on other people you trust and say OK like that guy. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9678.0s)]
*  He listened to Huberman. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9684.0s)]
*  I trust that person and that person seems reasonable and he's telling me Andrew has good things to say. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9686.0s)]
*  OK. By proxy I'm going to believe that. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9692.0s)]
*  Well that is also what's happening with mainstream media. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9694.0s)]
*  Like there's so many hucksters and bullshit propagandists on mainstream media that people are turning to alternative media sources that they know are reliable and people they can trust. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9697.0s)]
*  You know it's one of the great things about having a podcast like mine is that I can turn someone on to you that I can turn someone on to to Huberman or to any of these fascinating people or these independent people like Crystal and Saga from breaking points that have independent news podcasts or Glenn Greenwald or whoever it is.

*  Barry stuff. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9730.0s)]
*  Barry wise. [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9731.0s)]
*  There's some but that people trust me because they know I'm not full shit. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9732.0s)]
*  They know I'm not going to lie to them. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9735.0s)]
*  I'm not I'm just I'm not going to do that. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9736.0s)]
*  So if I might be wrong but if I tell you something it's because I believe it if I'm wrong and if I find out I'm wrong I'm going to tell you that too. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9739.0s)]
*  But that there's a benefit in that there's a benefit in that that didn't exist before there was no media outlet like that before where you could find out about people who are reliable and are giving you accurate information and provide a real benefit. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9746.0s)]
*  That's that's that's one of the cool things about this weird time where you got these V shred guys and a lot of hucksters out there. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9761.0s)]
*  Yeah it's it's a bummer because you I don't know what he's charging but I think it's a lot of money for so little value. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9769.0s)]
*  Well hopefully people pay attention to Derek you know from more plates more dates his his fucking show has blown the fuck up just from quality. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9776.0s)]
*  I mean literally the guy is standing in front of a wood paneled wall with an air conditioning but you know behind him it's like the most quality set up ever. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9785.0s)]
*  But he's so brilliant and his the quality of his information is so good he's his research is so good that he's blown up because of that. [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9794.0s)]
*  And also like very humble very honest really you could tell. [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9803.0s)]
*  And I've had him on a couple of times and you can you really get a sense of who the guy is. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9808.0s)]
*  Thank God there's people like that out there that expose like the liver king. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9813.0s)]
*  That wasn't that's another one of God for the longest time I was telling people listen to me there's no fucking way that guy's natural. [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9816.0s)]
*  Not possible there's some freaks out there that are natural there's some real athletic freaks in this world. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9823.0s)]
*  Absolutely 100 percent. [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9828.0s)]
*  That's not one of them. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9830.0s)]
*  That's not one of them. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9831.0s)]
*  And for the longest time that guy was getting away with it. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9833.0s)]
*  But Derek exposed him fortunately. [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9836.0s)]
*  You know it's one of the great things about this time is that yeah there are bullshit artists and there's a lot of noise. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9839.0s)]
*  There's also a lot of solid signal. [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9845.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9847.0s)]
*  And one of those is outlive the science and art of longevity. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9848.0s)]
*  How well that was time. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9852.0s)]
*  I'm a fucking professional in some strange way. [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9854.0s)]
*  I've become a professional Hugh Jackman Wolverine. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9857.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9860.0s)]
*  Look at that Wolverine gave you a fucking quote. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9861.0s)]
*  Nice. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9863.0s)]
*  Pretty sweet. [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9864.0s)]
*  You did the audio book as well right. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9866.0s)]
*  I did. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9868.0s)]
*  I'm really glad I got a baby Jesus. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9869.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9871.0s)]
*  You have to. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9872.0s)]
*  People know you. [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9873.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9874.0s)]
*  Plus you're a great speaker. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9875.0s)]
*  Yeah but I'm not a great reader. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9876.0s)]
*  It was I had to get a coach for it actually because it's really funny that everyone was like yeah you're going to do it. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9877.0s)]
*  I was like no no I'm really bad. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9881.0s)]
*  And they said oh so Rick Rubin when he was staying with me this summer and he was recording his audio book he had the setup he had the booth like he had a recording studio set up in our house. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9882.0s)]
*  And one day he's like just go down there and just read a chapter and my engineer will mix it in blah blah blah. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9891.0s)]
*  So I said OK I'll do it. [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9896.0s)]
*  So I went down there read two chapters. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9897.0s)]
*  They his engineer mixed it up sent it to me. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9899.0s)]
*  I sent it to my publisher and they were like oh you weren't lying. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9901.0s)]
*  You're horrible. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9906.0s)]
*  You are so bad at this. [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9908.0s)]
*  So then they panic. [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9910.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9911.0s)]
*  Because they're like oh maybe he probably shouldn't read it. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9912.0s)]
*  So you had a voice coach. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9914.0s)]
*  I got a reading coach. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9915.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9917.0s)]
*  Reading coach. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9918.0s)]
*  This woman named Stacy Snow and she came over to my house one day on a Sunday and for three hours she coached me. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9919.0s)]
*  And the single I mean she said a lot of things that everything she said mattered. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9925.0s)]
*  One of the things she said was slow down. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9929.0s)]
*  You're trying to read at the speed you speak. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9932.0s)]
*  You can't do that. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9935.0s)]
*  You can't do that in an audio book. [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9936.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9938.0s)]
*  You have to go way slower. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9939.0s)]
*  Most people listen to audio books like I listen to them at 1.8x. [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9940.0s)]
*  I've never listened to an audio book at regular speed. [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9943.0s)]
*  I can't. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9945.0s)]
*  They sound too slow. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9946.0s)]
*  But she's like that's how you actually have to read it. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9947.0s)]
*  And the second thing she said was you are so sick and tired of this book because it's all you've read. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9948.0s)]
*  Over and over and over again for six years. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9954.0s)]
*  But you are going to have to be so mindful and present that you have to read every sentence like it's the first time you've read it. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9956.0s)]
*  With that level of surprise. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9964.0s)]
*  She fixed you in three hours though. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9966.0s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9968.0s)]
*  What those women did for me. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9969.0s)]
*  Great. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9970.0s)]
*  The fact that someone could fix you in three hours. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9971.0s)]
*  And now she was also my director. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9974.0s)]
*  So then I spent two weeks reading it in a studio here in Austin. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9976.0s)]
*  And I just had her in my ear the whole time. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9980.0s)]
*  And she was great. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9982.0s)]
*  That's fantastic. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9983.0s)]
*  Well listen brother I'm very happy that you got this done. [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9984.0s)]
*  And I'm very happy it's out. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6cADLXp3c&t=9988.0s)]
