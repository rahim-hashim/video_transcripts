# Joe Rogan Experience #1541 - Bridget Phetasy
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [September 24, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYpotjw_KTw)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Oh, hello Bridget.
*  Hello.
*  We're going to save the world.
*  Yeah, that's what I heard.
*  Right now.
*  I'm sorry for being late for the most California reason ever.
*  I really, I thought I was meditating for 20 minutes and I was 45 minutes in.
*  I was like, what happened?
*  Last time we talked, you hadn't even started meditating yet.
*  So tell me about this journey.
*  I would do it occasionally.
*  But most of the time I was getting in the tank, which is kind of like meditating.
*  But you know, the tank is its own thing.
*  But yeah, I've been doing, I had this guy James Nestor on.
*  He's the author of Breathe.
*  Breath, breathe, breath, breath, breath, breath.
*  The book is Breath.
*  I always forget which one has the E at the end.
*  But I really got into breathing exercises afterwards.
*  And so I mean, I'm calling it meditating, but I'm really doing both.
*  I'm meditating and doing while I'm doing these breathing exercises, I'm just concentrating on breath.
*  It is the best fucking stress reliever.
*  It just goes away.
*  I've got yoga.
*  And I always said if you could, if you had to choose like all the different parts of that practice, if I had to tell somebody just to do one, it would be the breathing exercises are the best.
*  There's something about it, too, that like you don't realize how shallow your breath is most of the day until you sit down.
*  You do these big I do six in six out of six seconds and big.
*  And then and I did it for forty five minutes today.
*  Just in and out. And by the end, my skin is tingling.
*  I'm like, I feel high.
*  Yeah, it's wild.
*  It's wild. I know.
*  That's why I love that.
*  I was mentioning the last time I was on Sam Harris's meditations because they have you reflecting on your own consciousness.
*  It's like, notice, you know, pay attention to where you're paying attention or what it's so trippy.
*  And I'll get in my head.
*  And next thing you know, I'm like, this is like taking acid.
*  I love Sam Harris terrified of the covid though.
*  Is he? Yeah, he's not doing anything live.
*  Really? Oh, Sam.
*  He's the one who had me so scared.
*  I feel like I'm like, come out and play, Sam.
*  But he knew somebody, though, that got it early in Italy and got really sick.
*  Yeah. But then upon questioning, I was asking him a bunch of things like the guy was drinking, like the guy was partying and then he was skiing and he caught covid.
*  So the people that I know that have got it and got it bad were all compromised.
*  They were all beaten down, worn out.
*  And then it got him. That's where it gets scared.
*  Or you don't know.
*  We had a friend whose boyfriend's brother died of it and he got it, but he was sick for two weeks and his wife was like, please go.
*  And he didn't because he's a dude.
*  And then he went and found out that he had like diabetes or something.
*  He didn't even know he had it.
*  And so he was compromised and it was really tragic and sad.
*  Well, a nurse was telling us she was how harsh is she?
*  Yeah, she's hard.
*  She's great.
*  I love her. But anyway, when she's doing the test, she's telling us about all these kids that vape that are dying.
*  Yeah, I've been hearing this fucking getting pneumonia and dying from vaping.
*  Here's a fun story.
*  I was talking to my physical therapist and he is married to an Italian woman.
*  So they were hearing all the stories from Italy and then all the whole thing about hydrochloroquine came out.
*  Hydroxychloroquine.
*  The hydroxychloroquine, however the hell you say it.
*  And he had been hearing from the people in Italy that this was kind of working and it was helping.
*  So after Trump said it was helping, he was trying to get some on the West side.
*  And he's like, all these motherfuckers who are talking shit about it, you couldn't get anywhere on the West side of L.A.
*  Every rich person in L.A. went out and bought it and then was like, oh, we shouldn't be listening to this.
*  He's like, but you couldn't get it anywhere.
*  Well, my doctor told me that people are not taking it because they hate Trump.
*  Oh, wow.
*  He learned Shob got it.
*  They asked Shob what your political leanings are.
*  And he's like, what?
*  And he's like, well, hydroxychloroquine has been proven to be very effective in the early stages of the virus.
*  He goes, fucking give it to me.
*  What are you talking about?
*  Imagine if you're like, fuck Trump, I'm going to die.
*  Literally.
*  I'm going to die on this hill.
*  Fuck Trump.
*  People have lost their minds.
*  Lost their minds.
*  It's a, I saw a tweet yesterday and was like, I'm so tired.
*  I'm so tired.
*  I'm like, what are you, this whole idea of everybody being like, I'm so exhausted.
*  I'm like, you're sitting on your fucking ass.
*  You're watching Netflix.
*  You're on your couch.
*  You're waiting for Postmates.
*  Like, what are you fucking tired from?
*  You're exhausted from tweeting.
*  You know, like it's so hard educating all these people, all these fascists online all day.
*  What are you fucking exhausted from?
*  I don't understand.
*  Educating fascists.
*  Everybody who disagrees with you is a fascist.
*  Everyone.
*  That's just how it is.
*  Everyone.
*  And it's, I was talking to Colin Quinn for my podcast and we were talking about this.
*  I was like, do you not get shit for like, he's like, I feel like we're kind of in the same place.
*  And I was like, don't get shit for being like both sides.
*  And he was like, isn't that insane though?
*  Like the people who are like trying to see things reasonably are the ones who are like getting attacked.
*  He's like, no, the middle used to be the people looking at the zealots being like, you're fucking crazy.
*  And now they're looking at us and they're like, you guys need to be stopped.
*  The middle needs to be stopped.
*  All of this reason needs to be stopped.
*  Well, because you make them confront their own biases.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what the problem is.
*  When you're, if you're a reasonable person, especially if you're someone like you or I who has a platform and you're reasonable and there's a lot of people listening and then people like, well, she's actually got some good points.
*  No, she doesn't.
*  She's a fascist.
*  Look, I'm no Alyssa Milano.
*  I don't have a platform like you guys.
*  But well, it's a real shame that her platform is a third of mine.
*  That's like really, really delusional.
*  I want to.
*  This is the two plus two equals five math.
*  Yeah, that math is that's like Hollywood math.
*  When they tell you movie didn't make any money.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's really wild watching the hatred that people who are even.
*  So the other day I saw I'll say something like I've heard because I put out an article and it was like why don't why I'm not voting for the president.
*  Like, fuck this amount.
*  And I got all these emails, like 900 emails in two days from people who are conservative voting for Biden from people who are Democrats.
*  And I'm saying I'm like I'm hearing a lot of people saying that they've never voted for Trump or considered it and they're going to.
*  And they're like, that's propaganda.
*  I was like, so anything you don't want to hear is propaganda.
*  Like, I'm just reporting what I'm hearing anecdotally from people.
*  And you're telling me it's propaganda.
*  It's really the opposite of propaganda.
*  The problem is the media overwhelmingly is liberal.
*  Right. Overwhelmingly.
*  Like there's Fox News and what's that A.O.N.
*  Oh, oh, oh, whatever it is.
*  There's one.
*  There's one crazy network.
*  That's like a network.
*  Full.
*  Yeah.
*  Right on the edge of the cliff with a fucking eagle tattoo in their back.
*  And then you have everything else.
*  I mean, everything else is liberal, whether it's whether they pretend to be or not.
*  They lean liberal, whether it's NBC, CBS, MSNBC, of course, CNN.
*  CNN is CNN's atrocious.
*  This is what they're so bad.
*  They used to be my favorite source of news.
*  And now I see when you see Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo talking about white people and how like white people have every advantage.
*  Like, why don't you have an education?
*  Why don't you have a loan?
*  Yeah.
*  Like and Chris Cuomo's just standing there like letting Don Lemon say this.
*  I'm like, what are you guys talking about?
*  They're parodies.
*  Have you ever been to Appalachia?
*  No, they haven't.
*  Do you know about really poor white people?
*  They're there.
*  There's poor white people all over the world.
*  I tweeted something about it.
*  It's so crazy.
*  They're like, Don Lemon's calling out celebrities and I'm here for it.
*  And I was like, Don Lemon is the arsonist standing in the house asking for everyone else to put out the fire.
*  Like what this guy has been so divisive.
*  What are you even talking about?
*  All generalizations, all of them do nobody any good.
*  No, but they're fun.
*  But I just made one.
*  I know, but they're so fun.
*  They are very fun.
*  I mean, we're comics.
*  We live in the world of generalizations.
*  I said this waitressing stereotypes don't exist in a void.
*  Like as a waitress, it was 10% waitressing, 90% trying not to profile people.
*  That was the hardest part of my job.
*  Anti-bias training.
*  It's just like, all right, these white ladies aren't going to be a pain in the ass.
*  These white ladies.
*  Fuck.
*  But the fact that you could say that on CNN, you could say something ridiculously biased and in a gross generalization on CNN, as long as you're saying it about the right people, whether you're mocking all Trump supporters and being dumb.
*  Do you remember when he did that?
*  And then there was this whole thing where they said, I was not mocking them.
*  I heard a joke.
*  Like the red neck voice.
*  Yeah.
*  He was like fake laughing.
*  Yeah.
*  It was like it was so not funny.
*  I was like, what is this?
*  It was like when you go to one of those alt rooms and someone's laughing at some shit that you know nobody thinks is really funny.
*  Like, what is happening here?
*  What is this weird voodoo in the air is forcing people to comply.
*  I think one of the things that really was surprising to me that I'm hearing from a lot of people and in my next column, I kind of talk about this is like the mainstream media inadvertently red pill a huge sector of America during the pandemic.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  They were like, lock up.
*  This is for the best.
*  Shut your business down.
*  Don't bring your kids to school.
*  Miss funerals, miss weddings, miss graduations, miss sports, miss comedy, miss everything.
*  Miss trick or treating.
*  Did you see that shit in LA?
*  And then they were like, oh, but protests are okay.
*  And everyone in, you know, how many people protested?
*  Like what percentage was it like 1.01%?
*  Enough to spread the virus.
*  Good solid number.
*  How about de Blasio?
*  He said the only protests you could do are Black Lives Matter protests.
*  Like, hey, motherfucker, this is America.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't do that.
*  No, you can't say.
*  De Blasio is a parody, though.
*  How is he even real?
*  He can't be real.
*  He can't be.
*  He's a South Park mayor.
*  We are living in a South Park.
*  We are.
*  And so, yeah, I keep hearing this from people that that was, you know, I don't even think it was a protest because I think most people are actually on board, especially around George Floyd.
*  Everyone was pretty united.
*  Like, this is horrific.
*  Yes.
*  We need to address this.
*  Police brutality is a problem.
*  Someone should have stepped up, though.
*  Some mayor should have stepped up and said, I am with you.
*  But we are going to have a real problem with health if we just all gather in a street like this.
*  And it's not even in the street.
*  It's the making posters beforehand at your buddy's house, you know, and like getting together afterwards and having drinks.
*  Everybody was still getting together in apartments and houses before and after these protests.
*  And it's interesting.
*  It's just that the thing I keep hearing is not even it's not even the protests.
*  It's the rioting.
*  And when you are standing in front of a burning building and you're saying these are mostly peaceful, people fucking have eyes.
*  Right.
*  Like you are lying to their face.
*  And I just think they overplayed their hand.
*  I think you're right.
*  That CNN piece that said how the riots are being misconstrued by right wing media while they're most mostly peaceful.
*  Right.
*  And they made that with a photo of a building on fire.
*  It is so crazy how gaslighty that is.
*  It's not the biggest gaslighting event of our time.
*  It's actually just demanding that you swallow the lie.
*  It's even worse than gaslighting.
*  It's just demanding you comply with the lie that they're presenting.
*  Now, we get this on the right to yes, where it's like you'll directly contradict something that is clearly on video that you said.
*  Climate change.
*  Climate change is the biggest one on the right.
*  Where they just full on try to deny climate change.
*  And it's a part of the narrative of the ideology of the right.
*  There's a lot of people that just deny the narrative of climate change.
*  There are young Republicans who are changing this though.
*  And you should have some of them on because they're young.
*  Give me some names.
*  I will. There are some young kids who are really pushing back against.
*  They don't like that.
*  They believe that we should conserve our parks, that we should conserve, that it's important.
*  And they hate that it's become this kind of partisan thing and that it's now Republicans are anti climate is this messaging.
*  And so there are some young people in that space.
*  They just don't have a big enough voice really yet.
*  But they're out there and they're pushing back against that.
*  And they have some really cool things that are going on.
*  Well, that's good because there does need to be some pushback.
*  The problem with the narrative on the right is that they're so pro-business that they're willing to sacrifice some environmental standards.
*  And people see the repercussions of that.
*  They're like, hey, listen, I understand that you want people to be able to work.
*  You want people to make a living and you want to raise the standard and trickle down economics and all that shit.
*  But you can't sacrifice the fucking environment.
*  That should be a no brainer.
*  First, do no harm like a doctor.
*  First, do no harm.
*  And you're doing harm.
*  You can't make money while you're polluting.
*  That's not good for anybody's future.
*  Yeah, they're seeing this in areas where I think it was reading like the Louisiana Belt.
*  There's tons of instances of more covid mortality and like chemical alley where all those fucking chemical plants are.
*  And that's the kind of untold cost and cause and effect that we need to pay more attention to.
*  And this is why I hate when these things like the climate shouldn't be.
*  We should be able to have a conversation about this.
*  And I think with the right wing, it's more that it's used as a cudgel to silence everybody.
*  And you're supposed to just get on board.
*  And there's so many things that are a lot of them will agree that we might be having some effect on it.
*  But what is the best way to to try and make those changes?
*  So that nuanced conversation is what needs to happen.
*  And everything is just partisan.
*  Everything, even the mask thing like all of it.
*  And you want to be able to come from a place of facts.
*  It's the same with police brutality.
*  All of these things. If we can start with what the actual facts are, that would be awesome and productive.
*  But we don't start there. We start with the police brutality thing.
*  All you get is videos of horrific actions.
*  You know, I saw a video. There's a really terrible video that's going around right now that people are using as evidence that cops are racist
*  because they didn't shoot this white guy who wound up shooting and killing a cop in Oklahoma.
*  Did you see it? Oh, I haven't seen it.
*  I've been blissfully offline.
*  Every time I drink coffee with cream, I say I'm not going to do that again because I do it on the podcast.
*  Then I get phlegm and I have to. That's all right.
*  It makes you human, Joe. It's not for people listening.
*  It's annoying, bro. But it's a bad video.
*  They pull this guy over. They mace him.
*  They hit him with the pepper spray. They tase him.
*  They do everything. And he's just drugged up or a psycho.
*  Who knows? And they get into some sort of a wrestling exchange and he gets the cop's gun and unloads into this guy's body.
*  You hear the cop from the cop's body camera.
*  You see him get shot and you see him scream.
*  This is the fucking thing about our dystopia that I hate.
*  I've seen someone die like every day for the past two weeks online.
*  You know, but here's my point.
*  People are looking at this thing. Oh, the cops are racist because if that was a black guy, they would have shot him.
*  My position is, okay, these are two totally different cops.
*  And maybe they didn't shoot him because they would have never shot anybody.
*  Maybe these cops never would have shot a black guy or a white guy or Asian guy or anybody.
*  But the point is, this is how dangerous it is to be a cop.
*  And this is why non-lethal... There's two cops on one guy and they can't control this motherfucker.
*  And this is why non-lethal methods are... The cops are reluctant to use them sometimes.
*  And this is also... It just shows you how fucking hard it is to be a cop.
*  You get this crazy dude and you can't tase him. You can't pepper spray him.
*  He still gets your gun and shoots and kills one of you.
*  It's fucking nuts.
*  It is nuts. I mean, it's... And I think you can't really jump to, oh, this is racism with no evidence of racism.
*  Right. In that case, there is no racism, right?
*  What they're saying is... As far as we know.
*  If this was a black guy, they would have shot him.
*  I understand why they feel like that because there are all these videos of black guys getting shot by cops.
*  And it is horrible. But this situation is two totally different human beings.
*  That's the problem. It's in the generalization. The problem is in stereotypes.
*  The problem is in... The real problem is that these fucking cops exist at all that would shoot a guy that's black just because he's black.
*  And those guys are real. Those cops are... And there's so many cops out there that have PTSD.
*  So many cops out there that they just don't know what is going on. They'll just shoot. There's a lot of that.
*  Yeah. And I mean, I've had people writing me saying, I work with cops and they need better training.
*  100%.
*  Cops themselves will say, we need more training. And to act like some of them aren't racists is delusional as acting like all of them are.
*  Exactly.
*  I think you have to take it on a case by case basis. Honestly, the thing that Sam... Did you listen to Sam Harris's hour-long thing that he did?
*  Everyone should listen to that.
*  It's very good.
*  It's based very much in what we know as far as facts because he's super reasonable.
*  And I sent it to my dad, who's super... My center left people in my life. And he was like, that was very good.
*  I don't think he hears that perspective.
*  Right. Well, Sam's a brave man. Sam Harris is a brave man because he's already been attacked so many times for having these unconventional but very reasonable positions.
*  And yet he still puts them out there. And he knows before he puts them out there that he's going to get some flack and get some... But he deleted his Twitter from his phone.
*  He doesn't have Twitter on his phone anymore.
*  Yeah, I don't have it on my phone.
*  Yeah, doing things like that can have a big impact. I was talking to Shob today. He's deleted all social media from his phone. He doesn't have any social media in his life anymore.
*  Yeah, I really only use Twitter and I only have it on my desktop so that if I can only check it when I'm in front of a computer, I don't have it.
*  That's even worse though because then you should be writing.
*  Yeah, I mean, that might be a problem too. I might just need to delete it completely.
*  I think I'm going to get a computer that doesn't connect to the internet. I think...
*  Like from 1982?
*  Yeah, they have those. Like Snowden has one that has like a switch. You literally shut the Wi-Fi off.
*  I might need that.
*  So you can't get tempted. So like while you're working, the Wi-Fi is off. I mean, you can always go to the Wi-Fi and do the fucking thing.
*  But it seems like a switch.
*  They have apps for that too.
*  A fucking app. I want a button, like a click.
*  You could just unplug the Wi-Fi.
*  No, it's just too tempting because this...
*  I mean, you're a writer. You know as much as anybody. The temptation to procrastinate.
*  Yeah.
*  It's so hard to avoid.
*  I mean, I actually want to know how many words I've written on Twitter and I've deleted.
*  I always kind of just delete. I'll have a mood where I'm like, I'm deleting everything and then I'll just delete every tweet.
*  And so I was thinking like, God, it's really a shame how many books I've written on Twitter.
*  I really like the great American novel.
*  Twitter's also given you a very large following.
*  That's how I mean, I knew you from the store, but I really got into your shit because of Twitter.
*  Yeah, no, I think you can tell pretty quickly about someone on Twitter.
*  I think it's the best social media for seeing who someone is because everyone, no one's afraid to be kind of their piece of shit self on Twitter.
*  You know, it's really the most honest, I think, of social media is because it's primarily a battle of the wits.
*  And it's not so much like Instagram, which I can't stand.
*  I don't know how people... I don't know how anyone does Instagram.
*  Are you on it?
*  I'm on it, but I never use it. I hate it.
*  I go on it.
*  What do you hate about it?
*  It's so fake. It's so curated.
*  Because all the people on Instagram showing me their lives, they call me with all their problems.
*  I'm like, I know what's going on in your life, bitch. It's not looking like this.
*  It's so true.
*  And so I think it's just as like phony to me. And I go in there and I'm like, I can't.
*  And all the women are just... how does anyone feel okay about themself on there?
*  I spent five minutes on there. I was like, I'm old. I'm ugly. I'm getting chest wrinkles.
*  How do I get rid of chest wrinkles?
*  I got to call Whitney.
*  Call Whitney. Yeah, she'll get you an NAD drip.
*  Yeah, this filter thing that everyone's using is so bananas.
*  That one that you posted about your daughter, that your daughter's filter made you the pretty lady?
*  How weird is that? You know, that was used in a class at Texas Tech.
*  That's terrifying.
*  That's terrifying.
*  Yeah, it is terrifying. But that's what girls are dealing with.
*  They look at themselves in the mirror and then they look at like the Courtney or Chloe. Which one?
*  None of those people are real.
*  But which was the one where she had a totally different head?
*  Oh, maybe the old... I don't know any of them. The old one?
*  Jamie? Which one? Which one? Chloe. Chloe.
*  Okay.
*  You know what she looks like. She looks one way. And then the picture was like, okay, who's this?
*  And it wasn't her. I mean, they're doing stuff. They're moving their frame around and changing.
*  Yeah, but they're also doing stuff in real life.
*  But this one was so bad that she photoshopped one side of the chain on her neck off.
*  So she's wearing a chain. She's got like a little chain.
*  But she didn't realize it's a very thin chain that she had accidentally photoshopped.
*  One side of the chain was gone, was not in the image.
*  Like, look at it.
*  Oh, wow.
*  But look at the chain, like half on the right hand side.
*  The chain is missing.
*  Oh, yeah. Is that even her body?
*  I mean, I guess maybe.
*  That is so crazy.
*  But it's so damaging.
*  That's so much pressure for young girls.
*  And her as well. She's got to go outside.
*  I'm not worried about her. But...
*  I'm worried about her too. I am. I'm worried about her.
*  She's a human being. She is.
*  You stop. But...
*  That's how you get people off your case.
*  You attack other people.
*  No, I'm not attacking.
*  No, I'm attacking you. What you're doing is problematic.
*  It's terrible. I can't... She's a person. She's a human being.
*  You're dehumanizing a Kardashian.
*  It's really bad. It's not cool.
*  I don't feel bad for them. They're rich.
*  Wow. But that's a problem when you say things like that.
*  Because they suffer from mental illness as well as anybody.
*  We all suffer.
*  We do. But it's easier when you're rich.
*  Can we just agree on that?
*  I think that's the same... I think that could be the same picture.
*  Oh, well, how do they do the face smile?
*  I don't know.
*  That doesn't make sense.
*  I don't mean the exact same photo. Sorry. But like the same photo shoot.
*  Oh, wow. That's crazy.
*  I don't know. They have a lot done to their bodies too.
*  I think someone could probably do that at a doctor's office.
*  Could make her look like that too. That's what's really crazy.
*  I mean, if I had enough money maybe.
*  You think so?
*  Get crazy?
*  We'll see when I have money.
*  I'll be like, hey, I'll come in and look completely different.
*  I'll be like, where's Bridget?
*  And who are you?
*  I'm Bridget. I just got rich and now I have tons of work.
*  Yeah.
*  I've reconstructed my entire being.
*  Remember when Renee Zellweger did some stuff?
*  Yeah. It ruins her life.
*  You can't... We know what you look like.
*  Who was the original one who did this?
*  Jennifer Grey. Yeah.
*  She said it ruined her life.
*  She was known for her nose and then she got the nose job and it ruined her ability to get booked.
*  To work.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, wow.
*  I think she said that. I might be making that up.
*  That makes sense.
*  She kind of stopped working.
*  Yeah. And she was hot.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean...
*  Yeah. I mean, a nose that's not perfect does not make you unsexy.
*  It just doesn't.
*  It comes from within.
*  Let's not get crazy.
*  She had a beautiful body.
*  She had a great personality.
*  She was pretty.
*  She just had a non-perfect nose.
*  It's funny.
*  But guess what?
*  So do I.
*  A lot of people do.
*  I was just joking about this the other day.
*  Someone was asking me how I stay sane and COVID and what I'm doing.
*  I'm like, I focus on the only two things that matter in life, being hot and rich.
*  Try to get hotter and richer.
*  That's the run.
*  I get mad on Twitter.
*  I do push-ups.
*  Well, the temptation to alter your face like that is, I guess, if you see some of the success
*  stories, like some of the other Kardashians that have done it and it worked out awesome.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of pressure.
*  For sure.
*  I was not too into any of it.
*  And then I started being a little bit more of a fan of the show.
*  I was like, I'm going to do this.
*  I'm going to do this.
*  I'm going to do this.
*  I'm going to do this.
*  I'm going to do this.
*  I'm going to do this.
*  I'm going to do this.
*  I'm going to do this.
*  I'm going to do this.
*  And then I started being on camera more with all these media hits.
*  And I was like, oh, man.
*  Somebody did a screen cap for one of the interviews I did.
*  I was like, does the person doing this hate me?
*  Why would they choose that?
*  I looked like I was eating sheet cake for breakfast.
*  Did they catch you with eyes half closed with a mouth open?
*  I was like, how many chins do I have?
*  After this, the last time I was on your show, I just kept getting emails, stop eating bread.
*  Wow.
*  People are saying that to you?
*  So rude.
*  Yeah.
*  Calling me, texting me and emailing me friends.
*  Friends are saying that.
*  Stop eating bread.
*  Yeah.
*  This is the kind of pressure that Hollywood puts on you.
*  You just be funny.
*  Yeah.
*  Someone just be funny.
*  I mean, patching mean work.
*  It does work.
*  That's the problem.
*  It's worked on me.
*  It's worked on me.
*  When I went on that carnivore diet, one of the reasons I got up to like 205 pounds, which
*  for me is kind of fat.
*  I was getting a belly.
*  I was getting these love handles and we did this weigh in thing for sober October and
*  people like, look at your belly.
*  I'm like, fuck, it is kind of sticking out.
*  I got there for that episode at the worst time because I'd eaten and I eat like a wolf.
*  I eat like there's no food coming forever.
*  I'll eat like two steaks, like a bowl of pasta.
*  You must love Texas.
*  I love it out here.
*  Yeah.
*  I could eat barbecue for breakfast.
*  Which places have you gone to?
*  What's the one where Matthew McConaughey, it's the one where Matthew McConaughey set
*  his favorite famous line in Dazed and Confused.
*  It's good.
*  They use.
*  Terry Blacks.
*  No, it's spit fire spit.
*  There's so many out here.
*  You can't be bad and stay open.
*  Yes.
*  Oh, so good.
*  It's the place.
*  So good for a place that has like 2 million people living in it.
*  They have like 150,000 barbecue spots.
*  There he is right there.
*  Yeah.
*  Hey, all right.
*  It's not painted like that anymore.
*  All right.
*  All right.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That place is amazing.
*  I went to the other one that's really big.
*  The really famous one that's kind of out.
*  Franklin's.
*  No, I haven't been there yet.
*  I heard it's amazing.
*  La Barbecue.
*  No, it's.
*  It's too many.
*  We can do this all day long.
*  It'd be a real problem.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like an hour.
*  A lot of us just naming barbecue places.
*  Yeah.
*  I found out through Adam Curry that that actually was Germans came here and they had like a smoked
*  meat tradition from Germany.
*  And they brought that and it became Texas barbecue.
*  Have you been down to green?
*  Green.
*  Yeah.
*  Green Texas.
*  It's not far, but there's like a old it's a dance hall kind of common.
*  We went the other night.
*  It was awesome.
*  There was just a guy.
*  I have a video.
*  I we were you can't dance because everybody has to kind of social distance in there.
*  And he was just sitting on stage playing the guitar.
*  And I don't know.
*  It was just that it's a tiny little town, but I think it's there is a German founded
*  town.
*  Yeah, it's interesting.
*  Fredericksburg is very German.
*  And that's a place that's like got a lot of like craft places and wineries and yeah, there's
*  tons of history here.
*  I was I was in Georgetown and there was a protest in front of the city hall because
*  of the there's a Confederate statue.
*  It was a small protest.
*  How many people?
*  It was mostly white people.
*  And do you think they got there because of a Russian troll account?
*  I don't know.
*  The guy we I spoke to like one of the Confederate like dudes after supporters.
*  Well he's a descendant of these fighters and he was trying to explain that they just don't
*  want them to desecrate that.
*  We wouldn't go down to green and desecrate their soldiers and they were Union soldiers.
*  And we just think you don't desecrate soldiers.
*  That was like his whole argument for it.
*  And he's like of the lineage.
*  And so I was just chatting with him and and he was saying I'm a descendant of Mao and
*  you know the way I feel is like leave Mao alone.
*  And he was like you know you just don't come and like desecrate the statues and whatnot.
*  But he he said they came every Tuesday and they left it dark and it seemed like they
*  were reasonable conversation.
*  It seemed pretty you know reasonable.
*  It wasn't like screaming on one side and another.
*  It was like pretty chill.
*  It is a good question.
*  Right.
*  Like if there's something that's openly racist and represents one of the worst aspects of
*  our country's history like what how do you treat it.
*  Do you just leave a statue up or should we have like maybe we should have like a graveyard
*  for Confederate statues and you could you could go and this one was actually in Huntsville
*  Alabama.
*  It was actually in front of the courthouse until last year.
*  Isn't that crazy.
*  And like you could go on a tour.
*  Like instead of taking them down and smashing them wouldn't it be interesting if there was
*  a place you can go we could see all of them.
*  But then people would go that we need to put these back.
*  Put them back where they belong.
*  Well I feel kind of like yeah we don't need them.
*  You know and some I but the problem is there's a process that we usually go through to take
*  them down.
*  So I would generally err on the side of going through the process.
*  But yeah but the process doesn't work sometimes.
*  Yeah exactly.
*  And sometimes people just feel like they just want to pull them down.
*  This is another thing that's going on right now.
*  This is the perfect storm.
*  The convergence of all these different things that are happening at the same time.
*  And one of them being the covid lockdown.
*  Yeah.
*  The covid lockdown.
*  The polarization of our country with Trump.
*  And then you know this this weird thing where everybody has to pretend that Biden isn't
*  dying.
*  Like this is all happening together at the same time.
*  Like everyone has to pretend he's going to do a great job.
*  I'm going to vote for him.
*  We just need to get Trump out of office.
*  Like oh my god.
*  Like yeah can we freeze this.
*  Yeah.
*  We freeze this and rethink this.
*  Do you guys have anybody else on deck.
*  No one.
*  I mean I guess Harris is on.
*  She's wearing Timbalands.
*  I guess she's one of us.
*  I seriously love the tweet.
*  Whoever it was it was like oh I found the undercover cop.
*  But like anyone who sees anyone wearing these in a club this brand new is the undercover
*  cop.
*  But Charlamagne on Instagram was like you know because they were saying that she's bringing
*  back Timbalands and he was like what the fuck are you talking about.
*  Like he's a he's in New York.
*  Like dudes in New York have been wearing Timbalands forever.
*  They've been wearing them since the 80s or whenever they started wearing them.
*  They never stop wearing them.
*  Like she's bringing back Timbalands.
*  It's like some guy saying I'm bringing back Chucks.
*  You know I'm bringing back Converse All-Stars.
*  Fuck you you are.
*  They never went away man.
*  You can't bring back something that never went away.
*  And Timbalands in New York especially never went away.
*  Yeah you're not allowed to go back to Biden.
*  You're not allowed to say that.
*  You're problematic.
*  Yeah I'm a problem.
*  But I've been getting canceled for that for six months now.
*  I said in that column I said something like he may or may not be slipping into dementia.
*  I mentioned about why I'm not voting.
*  And then someone from the New York Times said that is a widely debunked conspiracy theory
*  that he's slipping into dementia.
*  And I said OK I said may or may not.
*  And can you post like cite your source for where this has been debunked so that my like
*  people reading this thread can see it.
*  And this New York Times researcher writer says well I've seen him speaking and that's
*  just what I gather from like you see something.
*  Well you're a bad predator.
*  It's not widely debunking a situation.
*  That's not you.
*  OK so you see something and have a different opinion and other people have a different
*  opinion.
*  That's not widely like oh well I've seen it and that's it.
*  Could you imagine let's pretend that Kamala Harris was the Democratic nominee and Biden
*  was a Republican.
*  Could you imagine how savage they would be attacking his mental incompetence.
*  Yeah no no that's actually a really interesting experiment.
*  Bizarre bias comes into play and this is where everybody's getting gaslit because they're
*  pretending that everything's OK because all they want to do is get Trump out of office.
*  But in doing that you're exposing this very bizarre tendency that people have to comply
*  and to go along with these lines of thinking and behaving and talking.
*  And I can't get into that man because that's cult shit.
*  That's religious shit.
*  I mean that's where these things come from.
*  They come from everybody not saying what they really feel because there's an agreement
*  that's been made.
*  You're going to be on the right team aren't you.
*  You're going to do the right thing.
*  You're going to do the right thing aren't you.
*  Or we'll burn your fucking house down.
*  We have to stop these fascists or we'll burn your house down.
*  Some guy offered me an interview with someone who I probably could get an interview with
*  him anyway and he said if you vote for Biden I will get you this guy as an interview.
*  Come on we have to save the country.
*  What?
*  Those those real message I got.
*  Like hey bro.
*  Jamie's laughing.
*  That's so.
*  Yeah that's just I understand where you're going with this.
*  It's so crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  It's fucking insane.
*  Come on we have to save the country.
*  Are you sure?
*  What about what about it do you want to save the country.
*  What part is going to save.
*  What is it.
*  What's going to happen.
*  When I was on I did one of Brett's unity campfires and did you.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know I was asking I was like everyone is saying that the other side is the existential
*  threat and then Brett was kind of like well we need to come together because this that
*  is the existential threat.
*  But everyone but isn't that.
*  I'm like why is everyone on flight 93.
*  You know like everyone's scared.
*  Of course.
*  It's also I guess maybe I have optimistic faith in America.
*  Like I don't really see how Trump or Biden like.
*  How can me.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I hope that it either one of them can't destroy America in four years because that means America
*  is already fucked.
*  Yeah well we're kind of fucked.
*  I don't like saying.
*  I know my my 16 year old nephew and all his friends listen and I don't want to give these
*  children no hope for the future.
*  They have hope for the future but we're fucked.
*  Do they.
*  Yeah we do.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Listen we're not in the dark ages.
*  No.
*  The Mongols aren't coming over the hills with horses and flaming arrows.
*  This is what I always say.
*  Like people are like there's a civil war.
*  I'm like we're too.
*  America's too fat for a civil war.
*  Who's fighting.
*  What does that even look like.
*  There will be more armed conflict.
*  Right.
*  That's that's going to happen.
*  When you have things like the Kenosha guy who shows up you know with an A.R. and guys
*  try to take his gun.
*  Yeah.
*  They'll shoot.
*  All this stuff is crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  All of it's crazy.
*  Like the more that stuff is going to happen if you have more of these conflicts.
*  And they're Seattle.
*  Well the guy in Seattle is not a kid.
*  Well was it Seattle or Portland where he shot.
*  Shot that Portland right.
*  Portland.
*  It's not the Trump supporter.
*  Yeah it was Portland.
*  Yeah that guy was not a kid.
*  Yeah.
*  Just a fucking sociopath.
*  Yeah.
*  Who found a team that he could get with.
*  Yeah.
*  Did you see the interview with him with Vice.
*  Before they killed him.
*  Yeah before they killed him.
*  Before the cops killed him.
*  What an idiot.
*  Did you ever see documentary now that show where they made fun of Vice.
*  They parodied Vice.
*  That interview with that guy reminded me exactly of the documentary now parody of Vice.
*  It was like this can't be real.
*  Well they interviewed a guy after he killed a guy in the street with a gun and then was
*  justifying it with like here's my face.
*  Here I am.
*  I definitely did it like admitting that he did it and the way he did it was in this weird
*  culty way like what he was saying.
*  I wasn't going to let him kill one of my friends of color.
*  That's what he said.
*  But it was it was so clear that this is a person who's like saying the things that he
*  thinks you're supposed to say to signal that you're on this team.
*  I think they believe it though.
*  Oh yeah.
*  If you believe Trump is literally Hitler.
*  All of that behavior makes sense.
*  Yeah.
*  Because what lengths would you go to stop Hitler.
*  But it's the same thing in not calling out Joe Biden.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Not saying that Joe Biden is having mental issues is the same thing because it's all
*  you're what you're doing is you are you're saying things that don't necessarily have
*  to make sense but they align you with a group.
*  Right.
*  You're compliant.
*  You're fitting into the words that need to be said that it's a cult.
*  It's on both sides.
*  Right wing and left wing.
*  Trump devotion syndrome.
*  Oh my God.
*  It's crazy.
*  Trump derangement which is real and there's Trump devotion syndrome which is the MAGA
*  side and it is.
*  It's real.
*  Oh I we made fun of him on dumpster fire just because he said something like completely
*  retarded and deserves to be.
*  All politicians deserve to be mocked.
*  What happened America?
*  We used to make fun of all of our politicians.
*  And so I think that in that same episode I had made fun of like Ben and the whole Cardi
*  B thing where he went viral.
*  What else was he?
*  Which was hilarious by the way.
*  If you listen to the whole.
*  It's actually a gynecological condition.
*  If you listen to the whole 10 minutes it's a pretty good bit.
*  It's pretty funny.
*  And so he went.
*  He's funny.
*  Oh yeah he's really funny.
*  He's a smart funny dude.
*  He's funny.
*  He retweeted it and my cousin calls me she's like our comments on YouTube are like insane
*  people defending Trump.
*  They couldn't get past two minutes of us.
*  The next segment we make fun of Biden and then proceeded to make fun of Nancy Pelosi
*  and everything else but they could not get past two minutes of us making fun of dear
*  leader.
*  Yeah well there's an issue.
*  I mean it works on both ways.
*  Trump tweeted a thing recently with me and Matt Taibbi talking about Biden where I said
*  that Biden.
*  Oh the flashlight.
*  That's a great joke.
*  Thank you.
*  Well I'm a comedian and I was making a joke but on the same podcast we talked about Trump
*  being a sociopath.
*  We talked about all his lies.
*  He just fucking lies.
*  Like it was not a Trump supporting podcast.
*  But Trump's like good enough.
*  Snip.
*  Post it.
*  Raa.
*  Maga.
*  And everyone's like yeah.
*  Joe Rogan's Maga.
*  This is the world we live in.
*  We live in this world with no nuance.
*  It's very culty.
*  I wonder how many of those Trump supporters that you get on Twitter are bots because a
*  lot of them a lot of them are.
*  No the devotion is real.
*  The devotion is real.
*  I mean I know people in real life who are borderline QAnon and they're they cried watching
*  you know the RNC.
*  For sure.
*  They're the devotion and I understand.
*  Look I get it too because he he rose out of the domination of the mainstream media the
*  culture the domination of academia Hollywood all all of it.
*  And he was like a fuck you vote by many people and they feel like he is defending them.
*  And the thing I hear from them over and over again is he will stand up.
*  He'll stand against this tide of insanity coming from left he'll stand up for us.
*  That's why smart people are voting for him.
*  That's a silent vote right now.
*  Yeah that's a side that's gonna be just like 2016.
*  This is propaganda Jeff.
*  What?
*  What?
*  I thought everybody felt the way I feel.
*  How?
*  This is another thing I keep hearing which is hilarious.
*  People who told me that he could never win in 2016 and that it was impossible are telling
*  me again it's impossible he can't win.
*  I'm like you're telling me the thing that already happened that you thought was impossible
*  is impossible.
*  What kind of logic is this?
*  It doesn't even they're so crazy.
*  And when you know the thing about Russian meddling when people talk about Russian meddling
*  I love this shit.
*  But here's the real thing about Russian meddling.
*  The real thing is these trolls like they do affect people.
*  Yeah they do.
*  It really does work.
*  Like if you get enough of these troll accounts that they literally hire to post pro Trump
*  things and anti Biden things and memes and all these things.
*  Like it catches people up in the wave and they want to be a part of that group of people
*  that's piling on against Biden and piling on for Trump.
*  And a lot of it like there was one there was a protest.
*  I think it was in Austin.
*  I forget where it was.
*  But it was a protest against white rage.
*  This is a protest.
*  And this dude traced the IP address back to Russia.
*  He's like this is crazy.
*  But they're organizing protests.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  She did this whole study of it and it was it's really fascinating.
*  It is.
*  Because she found hundreds of thousands of these posts.
*  Oh yeah.
*  That were all from this Internet Research Agency in Russia.
*  They're funny.
*  I know.
*  I love it when something's trending on Twitter and someone will be like it's 9 a.m. in Russia.
*  You know the bots have like something random.
*  You're like why is this trending?
*  And it's something anti Biden or sowing dissent and it's like always spelled wrong.
*  It's just like go Russia's logged in for their workday.
*  We do it too.
*  This is what's fucked up about it.
*  It's like we're talking about meddling in our elections.
*  But like you know what that's like.
*  That's like someone who's a fucking thief saying someone's been stealing from me like
*  what they're stealing some shit you stole.
*  Yeah. What are you talking about?
*  Yeah. We do that with other countries.
*  Yeah. If we're upset that China is fucking with us you don't think we fuck with China.
*  Come on.
*  It's it's like the American supremacy kind of mentality where it's like how dare these
*  countries who we've historically meddled in their elections meddle in our elections.
*  Don't you understand?
*  This is outrageous.
*  We're the police of the world.
*  Yeah.
*  No it's it's been it's it's a wild you know I had a funny experience kind of observing
*  how people will engage with these bots.
*  And my nephew who's probably too young to be on Twitter has kind of recently got on.
*  He's like they call me D.
*  He's like look D I had a tweet that went pretty big and it was like him making some comment
*  about they were coming after Lizzo and he made this kind of they were coming after Lizzo
*  for some reason and he made some comments about it that was smart but it wasn't necessarily
*  like you know A to B logic because he's like 12 and people adults were commenting and yelling
*  at him and I'm like oh this is why I'm never going to argue with someone I don't know on
*  Twitter again because they might be 12.
*  It might be 12 year old.
*  Very likely either 12 or what is this report Arizona teens paid to file social media posts
*  for campaigns.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  This is a Washington Post report of to see yesterday.
*  Apparently they're being paid and then when asked this is the quote from the CEO of the
*  company.
*  Real kids operating the real social media profiles and promoting mainstream American
*  values.
*  Well Jake Hoffman president and CEO of Rally Forge said in an emailed statement Wednesday
*  that the posts were nothing more than in his quote real kids operating real social media
*  profiles and promoting mainstream American values.
*  He said what these young Arizona activists are doing is honest and sincere political
*  in the 21st century in the age of Covid 19 whose firm was linked by the post to the
*  turning point project.
*  Oh it's turning point.
*  Yeah it did not.
*  I was wondering.
*  Neither turning point action nor the affiliated turning point USA responded for request.
*  Turning point is a conservative youth outreach organization that's founder Charlie Kirk was
*  a featured speaker at the Republican National Convention.
*  Yeah so it's like a sweatshop.
*  So they're paying kids.
*  Yeah we're trying to figure out how much they're paying to see like if this is like a job.
*  Like it's these little political activists kids.
*  Imagine if there was a lot of money in it.
*  If you got like real writers.
*  People like you start.
*  So I would wonder like if kids are getting.
*  Oh I could sow some serious dissent.
*  Everybody on both sides should be happy I'm not on either one of these fucking sides and
*  you too.
*  For real right.
*  They should be thanking us that we're not picking a fucking side because I will bury
*  the other side.
*  I know right.
*  I've thought of that before.
*  I thought of like starting an anonymous account and just saying all the things I really feel
*  and just going to war with people on Twitter.
*  I've never done it.
*  I won't do it.
*  I really won't do it because I feel like the problem with that being deceptive like here's
*  what I'm 100 percent committed to.
*  If I say something it's because I mean it.
*  Yeah.
*  I have to do that.
*  Yeah.
*  That's got me here.
*  And we might be wrong.
*  I'm wrong.
*  Oh all the time.
*  But I'll tell you I was wrong.
*  But you can trust that the words that come out of my mouth are what I really think.
*  Well I think and I could be wrong but I think we share a somewhat desire to explore honesty.
*  You know honestly what I'm feeling.
*  And sometimes I have to push back against myself.
*  Sometimes I'll say things so that I can get push back and see the blind spots.
*  I'm not going to know what my own blind spots are unless I put my opinion out there and
*  hear back from people.
*  Not all of it is great.
*  But I think some of it's really reasonable criticism that I can take in from people I
*  respect.
*  You know not even people who maybe I am completely if someone is not even my friend but they
*  critique something in a respectful way I'll hear that.
*  You know I don't I feel like it's necessary to just I try really hard to be honest.
*  I can't.
*  It's not lucrative for me.
*  To be honest.
*  No.
*  I think it is.
*  No money in nuance kid.
*  I don't think that's true.
*  No I mean.
*  I think it is ultimately.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Ultimately there is there's there's a future in that ultimately.
*  But we're this is one of the reasons why I'm so steadfast today is because we're in the
*  most polarized the most ideologically based time ever in terms of like you have a side
*  you stick with it you battle against the other side.
*  And I see this from smart people and it drives me crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Because I'm like I know you're smart because I know you're educated I know you know a lot
*  of facts but you are so fucking stupid about human nature.
*  Yeah.
*  To behave like this because you're denying the very thing that literally has made us
*  racist.
*  The very thing that's made us go to war tribalism.
*  Yeah.
*  This is what it is.
*  All of it stems from people who look like me or people who think like me or people from
*  the patch of dirt that I'm from.
*  Those are on my team.
*  Yeah.
*  We stick together and we got to all agree.
*  Yeah.
*  That that's nonsense.
*  That's nonsense.
*  And we know it's nonsense.
*  We know that in 2020 that we don't have to think like that.
*  It's not smart.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean I think that our founders really understood human nature and they had this insight which
*  I still don't know how they managed to have it.
*  It's a miracle.
*  Amazing.
*  I mean Jonah Goldberg wrote this amazing book Suicide of the West and he talks about all
*  of this essentially how the Enlightenment and we just stumbled on this miracle.
*  And in the end he has the appendix.
*  I'm like if anyone in America should read anything it should just be the appendix of
*  his book which is all the stats of how much humanity has been lifted out of the dirt.
*  You know and we've lifted up even in developing world like everybody's do.
*  Yeah there's problems obviously but everybody overall it's never been more convenient and
*  easier for humans to just exist.
*  And I sometimes feel like is this just humans because they're not fighting and trying to
*  like survive they're self-destructing and having to create that reality for themselves.
*  Is life just too easy?
*  There's a lot of that.
*  There's a lot of the existential risk the real risk of humanity up until now has been
*  war, murder, death, constant.
*  It's so hard to live.
*  So hard and that was what people concentrated on.
*  But now because of I mean who was discussing this with me the other day?
*  Was it Douglas Murray?
*  Maybe or was it I don't forget who it was.
*  So many yes.
*  Anyway so many yes.
*  Yeah.
*  But this is this is part of the problem with social media is like the problems that you
*  have today are big to you because you do not have big problems.
*  Right.
*  When you have big problems if you have someone in your family that you love.
*  That's that's dying or sick.
*  Someone calling you a fuckhead on Twitter doesn't mean anything to you.
*  But when you don't have that and then you're like hey fuck you.
*  You know like then you that Twitter comment is the thing that gets you.
*  Yeah.
*  And that gets you out of bed and you check the comments and see what else did they say.
*  Oh and I said this.
*  Let's see.
*  I got them now.
*  Yeah.
*  You know this is your conflict.
*  This is you with a catapult.
*  It's shadow boxing though.
*  It's crazy because it's like I know women on the East Side in New York who are online
*  all day battling and they're like I'm so tired.
*  This is so exhausting.
*  I am in so much distress.
*  I mean it's mental illness.
*  It's in there.
*  And I'm like you're doing this to yourself.
*  You are all doing this to yourself.
*  It's not a lot of the conflict.
*  And I was saying this on Twitter the other day.
*  I'm like I'll be worried about America when no one can tweet like you're all tweeting
*  and you're online bitching about something or other when you have like you said when
*  you have somebody for instance a cancer diagnosis.
*  I mean I think I've seen it in my life recently.
*  I thought they were diagnosed with cancer.
*  They weren't.
*  For that 24 hours you realize that is your life now.
*  Well that's how I felt at the beginning of COVID.
*  The beginning of the lockdown I really thought it was going to be like September 11.
*  Like when September 11 came around everybody joined up.
*  We all got together because we all realized like hey all this petty bullshit is not important.
*  What's really important is we got to fucking band together because we're going to run out
*  of toilet paper and food because there's a disease coming that's going to kill everybody.
*  And that didn't happen.
*  It's like it ramped up the other way.
*  Everybody just got crazier.
*  Hey it just goes to show you how hilarious it is that people were talking about toilet
*  paper.
*  You're like maybe.
*  Tom Green had a great point though.
*  Tom Green's point was when you go to the supermarket toilet paper is a light item but it takes
*  up a lot of space.
*  Yeah.
*  And you only have so much shelf space.
*  And he goes.
*  It was just people seeing other people stockpiling.
*  Yeah when they take it and then it's missing.
*  Dude I don't have one now.
*  Like that's not the first thing I would think of that I've also worked in farms and like
*  shit in the woods.
*  So yeah.
*  So you can you know that's not my first thought in the apocalypse.
*  That's what I need to stockpile.
*  I like water.
*  Yeah exactly.
*  It shows you how disconnected we are with real.
*  They're like oh what am I going to do.
*  I'm not going to be able to wipe my ass from all this food that I'm binge eating while
*  I'm locked down and Netflixing.
*  Like that's not a real crisis guys.
*  And drinking constantly.
*  Drinking went up like some.
*  Oh yeah.
*  It was like 20 percent more while the bars were closed.
*  Alcohol consumption rose like 20 percent.
*  I am on a I had to it was hard for me because I'm sober and I'm on threads with my very
*  Irish Catholic family and for the first couple of weeks there was just pictures of their
*  their booze stockpiles which I 100 percent would have done if I was back in my drinking
*  days before even water.
*  It would have been it would have been booze.
*  Yeah.
*  I always tell this joke or like it's something that's just funny in our family.
*  It was like police.
*  It was police vickers liquors and then fire on the emergency contacts.
*  That's real.
*  My grandmother had that in our growing up and we're like let's be real fires don't really
*  start till after we drank.
*  Oh my God.
*  It's so funny.
*  Yeah.
*  It was it was I think it's just interesting to see when I remember when it first started
*  I was I was kind of eerie like no one was out in L.A.
*  That was it was rainy and those first days I went down to the beach there was no one
*  on the beach.
*  There's no one even driving and I walked by this guy.
*  He was kicked back in a sofa.
*  He had his television on.
*  He had a beer.
*  He was on his phone just with a nice little throw and I was like this is apocalypse light.
*  You know not really.
*  Like I've never seen a more perfect picture of what the modern apocalypse looks like.
*  It's not fighting for.
*  I just remember remember Katrina when it got really bad down there and people were fighting
*  for food and it got it got savage really really quickly in those.
*  And I think it was in like the Superdome.
*  Have you ever read the book blindness.
*  No I couldn't read fiction for two years after I read that book.
*  It's all about a pandemic of blindness hits people and they all get put in quarantine.
*  They get quarantine together the people who are getting this blindness and then the wife
*  of the guy who gets he is like stricken with blindness.
*  She fakes it so she can be with her husband and she's witness to all the shit that goes
*  down once all these people are out of society and in this quarantine and it's like rapes
*  and murders and steal and just how quickly it kind of the veneer of society deteriorates.
*  Who wrote it.
*  Oh God he won a Pulitzer for it.
*  I'm going to blank on it.
*  Thank you.
*  He's a great writer.
*  It's amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  So I think that we're you know it's pretty under the circumstances.
*  The other thing that I've been kind of surprised about is like you were saying there's going
*  to be more armed conflict.
*  I was like I'm pretty amazed at how restrained people are amazing.
*  Very amazing.
*  Like 300 million guns maybe probably 400 million now in more than people.
*  Yeah guns and people.
*  Yeah.
*  And just a few shooting pretty restrained.
*  Yeah pretty restrained especially especially considering the videos of cops shooting black
*  people especially when you think about how crazy it could have gotten.
*  There's been some horrific incidents.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it was in Baltimore this white guy walking on the street and for no reason this
*  black kid runs up behind him and hits him in the head with a brick.
*  Yeah.
*  The guy face plants and the people that are filming it are in a car and they're laughing.
*  Yeah.
*  While the brick hits the guy and the guy face plants on the concrete.
*  So much violence.
*  But for no reason right.
*  Yeah.
*  It's crazy but so little of that comparatively.
*  Yeah.
*  To what it could be.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of people that thought a real race war was going to happen in this country
*  but I think most people the vast majority of people are not racist.
*  The vast majority.
*  The vast majority of cops I think are not racist.
*  I think the vast majority of people are not violent or evil.
*  The vast majority.
*  That's why you can just go places.
*  Yeah.
*  That's why it's not a fucking shooting gallery everywhere you go.
*  Yeah.
*  The vast majority of people are not violent or evil.
*  You know.
*  You have human beings living together in a very imperfect scenario.
*  Yeah.
*  You know we were talking about this the other day.
*  You don't hear about the planes that land.
*  You just there are so many people doing so many good things all the time.
*  That's a great point.
*  You don't hear about the planes that land.
*  And so you're only hearing even in police shootings it's like we focus and a lot of
*  this I blame on the media is like it would be like only focusing on planes that crash.
*  It's not even the media anymore.
*  A lot of these things are just online videos that go viral.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But I think that so much of the division and that like picking narratives there are they're
*  driving narratives and I and people are obviously kind of partaking in this.
*  But I still think that it's we when I first like you said about the early days of the
*  pandemic I thought the same thing because you would go out and there was you have this
*  kind of like you'd like you have your mask on or whatever you walk and people were out
*  walking because they can go to the gym or anything and there would be that you kind
*  of look at each other with that solidarity.
*  There's that feeling of like yeah we're in this.
*  Yeah.
*  And it was only two weeks later before people are crossing the street angrily.
*  I got mass shamed by a guy.
*  We were walking and I had my bandana just around my neck and he was very far away and
*  he was like no mask no mask screaming at us.
*  And I'm bright red.
*  You're a bad person.
*  You don't have a mask on.
*  But he's I'm like dude you're gonna have a heart attack before covid ever kills you just
*  yelling at people who don't have masks and he's not going to I would have to spit in
*  his mouth for him to get covid from me.
*  He's not going to get it from me from a block and a half away just yelling.
*  And this is where I think people are driving themselves insane.
*  Well the unhinged have never had a better time.
*  This is their time because they have so much company.
*  You know if you're an unhinged person like you're on team unhinged like like oh look
*  at all the people on my side.
*  Weren't you the one who had that tweet that was like we have a mental health problem that's
*  a we have a gun something about guns and mental health.
*  Yeah.
*  I feel like a mental health problem disguised as a gun problem and a tyranny problem described
*  as a security problem.
*  Yeah that's a great tweet.
*  I think about that all the time because man has that played out.
*  Because now we're just seeing the mental health in the tyranny.
*  Well we legitimately have a gigantic mental health problem in this country.
*  Look I am a person who I've I've done a lot of things.
*  I have a family.
*  I'm happy.
*  I have good friends.
*  I'm successful.
*  And I have mental health problems.
*  Yeah.
*  We all have mental health problems.
*  Yeah.
*  And my mental problems are very minor.
*  I just want to be real clear.
*  They're very minor.
*  But I get weirded out sometimes.
*  We all do.
*  We all we all get in funk sometimes.
*  We all have issues.
*  We all have issues.
*  Yeah.
*  And something challenges us.
*  And we don't have character.
*  And we don't have a history of overcoming issues.
*  And we don't have tools in terms of like whether it's exercise or meditation or yoga or whatever
*  you do to alleviate tension.
*  And then you have the fucking gasoline which is social media.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're throwing gasoline on your fire instead of figuring out a way to put out the
*  coals.
*  You're just going to have madness.
*  And there's so many people that are unhinged right now.
*  Unhinged.
*  And they've been alone and isolated.
*  And it just shows how much you need that social interaction.
*  Because people I feel like are losing their manners.
*  I've heard from many people and my sister texted me she said I just saw a real life
*  Facebook fight at dinner.
*  And it was like and someone else texted me and he said I just saw a real life Twitter
*  interaction in the grocery store.
*  So this behavior that generally is relegated to the way we are when we're anonymous or
*  not anonymous online with each other that you would never necessarily be if you were
*  face to face because everybody's been online.
*  It's like they're starting to behave that way in real life.
*  That's not good.
*  Well that's what everybody's afraid of was afraid of when it comes to like video games.
*  Yeah.
*  People are afraid that like violent video games are forcing people or we're going to
*  cause people to be violent in real life.
*  I don't think that's real.
*  I think they've done studies that that's not real.
*  They've never proven that.
*  I think there's actually violence that has gone down.
*  Yes.
*  I think it's the opposite.
*  But I think that there's something about the way human beings are just interacting with
*  other human beings.
*  Those video games you're not shooting a real person.
*  You're shooting of an avatar.
*  You know you shoot a thing and it's fun.
*  The thing about interaction with people is you're really hurting someone's feelings.
*  And then you get used to doing that.
*  And then you don't you're not around people a lot.
*  Most of your interactions are just this way.
*  And then when you are around people you behave in the same way that you would if people were
*  in front of you.
*  I mean I think about how much like how many mental health tools I need.
*  I don't I'm like you.
*  I have mental health problems.
*  I've had anxiety in my past.
*  I had debilitating hypochondria that I overcame.
*  How did you overcome it?
*  Man, I should really write a book about it.
*  I should write Kill Your Hypochondria Before It Kills You because it was debilitating.
*  It was debilitating.
*  And it was I.
*  People don't get past that.
*  My therapist was like, you how did you do this?
*  But it was basically I took.
*  OK, so it was kind of a three prong attack because I'm like, I can't live like this
*  because hypochondria truly makes you feel insane.
*  And you know, you can objectively know I'm crazy, but your mind gets stuck.
*  It's like OCD.
*  And so it's it's kind of based in OCD because you get stuck in a loop.
*  Like I would just get stuck in a loop.
*  For instance, like there's something wrong with my lip.
*  There's something wrong with my lip.
*  There's something wrong with my lip.
*  There's something wrong.
*  I don't know. I just get stuck in that loop or I have throw cancer.
*  I have throw cancer.
*  I have, you know, I would just be like stuck in this crazy loop.
*  It's it's insane.
*  Did it come slowly or did it?
*  It got worse.
*  Did you always have it?
*  No, I think I come from like a long line of hypochondriacs.
*  So now because my mom used to have, you know, do you remember those books
*  before the Internet where it was like, if you have this, it was like a choose
*  your own adventure, but it was like, if you have this symptom before the Internet,
*  there are these books where you could be like, if you have this symptom,
*  go to page 233 and if you have this.
*  And I remember my mom would use those quite a lot.
*  So I think she has some of it.
*  My dad is just a big worrywart.
*  So I have that kind of neurotic energy, I believe.
*  But I think, too, I was smoking a lot of weed
*  and I mostly got it when I was hung over.
*  Like, that's when it would be the worst is I would be hung over.
*  So anyway, I had to do is you're realizing what you did to your body.
*  I think I just had I had to attack it from from three different places.
*  So the first is the actual.
*  I was like, all right, I'm going to rewire my fucking brain.
*  And I set myself out to do this.
*  And I put a rubber band on and I did that stupid thing.
*  But it totally worked where if I was like, there's something wrong with my lip.
*  And I'd snap my rubber band and I'd be like, I'm healthy.
*  I would just replace it with I am healthy.
*  And if I do come up with that idea, I read somewhere that it's a good way
*  to help with like repetitive thoughts or to just help yourself.
*  I mean, I was training my dog at the same time, too.
*  And I was like, yeah, this is kind of like dog training.
*  I just have to interrupt that, you know, like that firing.
*  And there's that whole idea of what fires together.
*  It's not even an idea. It's like what fires together, wires together.
*  So every time the other thing I had to do was explain that
*  what fires together, wires together.
*  So it's this concept of whatever you're kind of thinking and acting on.
*  It just creates like a pathway, a neural pathway in your brain
*  that gets stronger and stronger if they're if it's like that.
*  Like, for instance, if so, this is why part two was replacing the thought.
*  But I also couldn't act on it.
*  So I couldn't go look in the mirror.
*  I couldn't go Google anything if I thought I had cancer.
*  I had to cut myself off from acting on because a lot of people
*  who have hypochondria, they'll obsessively Google,
*  they'll go get tested for everything.
*  They'll spend thousands of dollars getting tests.
*  Luckily, I was not on I didn't have insurance.
*  I was too poor to really like lean fully into my hypochondria that way.
*  And I just had to stop myself from the action because that, you know,
*  anytime you have a thought and you act on it, it reinforces that connection,
*  that like mind body connection, and it would reinforce that pattern of worrying.
*  And then I had to start observing.
*  I kept this is very, I guess, too, it's very like CBT.
*  So cognitive behavioral therapy.
*  I didn't know this is kind of what I was doing, but I would keep now.
*  They have very it's like you keep a record, a thought, what they call a thought log.
*  And I would just document when I had the thought,
*  what brought it up, like what triggered that thought?
*  Because there's always kind of a trigger.
*  And then what action I took and what action I could take to replace it.
*  And so I sometimes it's just not acting on it at all.
*  And then I started working with therapists on all the things that were underpinning
*  those the the triggering thoughts.
*  So one was like, I couldn't hold joy.
*  I just anytime I felt like I was excited about doing anything,
*  I was going to Hawaii.
*  That was when I was like perseverating on my lips and I couldn't.
*  It was like I could not enjoy anything without my brain
*  telling me that everything was going to shit and I was going to die.
*  So I had to look at that.
*  Where does that come from?
*  Feelings of worthlessness, upbringing, whatever.
*  Yeah. Then the other one was shame around sexuality.
*  Like there was just some a lot of shame around.
*  Like I was pretty promiscuous when I was drinking a lot and I didn't.
*  I wasn't always proud of the men I woke up with.
*  And it happens to the party girls.
*  And, you know, I was an intern.
*  I was an international slut.
*  And there were some there were some like, you know, I'm Catholic to raise Catholics.
*  So that shit got squirted in before I had a chance in hell.
*  And so there was lots of shame around that, that I had to really look at and deal with.
*  And and yeah, so I just started looking at all this stuff and I like it took me.
*  It was work. It was fricking work.
*  And now I'm like completely free of it.
*  I don't. Yeah, that's amazing.
*  You did that. Congratulations.
*  I mean, I I definitely I feel like I can live and breathe and I can just be present.
*  Meditation was big.
*  And then I think a lot of people forget that, you know, drinking and substances are not a coping mechanism.
*  They can be if you if you are not using them addictively.
*  But for many people, like drinking is they'll be like, I have a coping tool.
*  It's drinking. I'm like, that's not a coping tool.
*  It exacerbates it. It does.
*  Like it or not.
*  So I had to quit that.
*  And I was joking just like how many fucking things I need to do to start my day.
*  I'm like, I wake up, I meditate.
*  I have to like, you know, I have to work out or I'm a crazy person.
*  I've got to sweat.
*  I just know what I have to do.
*  Yeah. And people it's important, I think, instead of and people ask me all the time
*  how I deal with the online hate and all that.
*  I'm like, I just go work out.
*  That's my answer to everything.
*  Yeah, that's an answer.
*  Go work out, though, because it requires effort and it requires it.
*  Like as much as it's difficult when you're sitting down in front of a computer
*  to overcome procrastination and write.
*  Multiply that times 10 and it's getting to the gym
*  because the physical discomfort of like, oh, you like your mind.
*  Well, your brain will mindfuck you. Yeah.
*  That's why I have these this.
*  I have like mugs and t-shirts that say conquer your inner bitch.
*  I love that. That's what it is.
*  There's there's a thing.
*  It's it's in me.
*  I was talking to David Goggins, who's one of the most savage people
*  that's on the planet today.
*  And he and I had a long, hilarious conversation on the phone yesterday about it.
*  And I said one of the things that I really appreciate about you
*  is you talk about your struggles.
*  Like there's a video that I put up on my Instagram the other day.
*  I just wrote Stay Hard and it's his video.
*  And it's him talking about this struggle that he has.
*  David Goggins, one of the hardest men alive.
*  He has a struggle sometimes when he gets up,
*  he just starts feeling sorry for himself.
*  He starts feeling like it just like, fuck, I'm tired.
*  I don't want to do this. Yeah.
*  And then he he actually says he said those thoughts into a tape recorder
*  or a phone or whatever the fuck it is and then listen to it playback.
*  And he's like, I sound like a straight bitch. Yeah.
*  That's hilarious.
*  But he realized it. Yeah.
*  And then he got fired up and went out and did it.
*  But what I said to him is what's so important about him
*  and why he's so important to people is because
*  he shows you the weakness.
*  He shows you that he has these thoughts himself, but he just always wins.
*  Yeah, he overcomes those.
*  But he knows that that those demons are there.
*  They're there for everybody.
*  But he's just got a long history of overcoming those demons.
*  And so he knows that he just has to go to work.
*  It's the warrior ethos. Yeah.
*  You know, and something I've really always tried to develop in myself.
*  And I respect in other people.
*  And I think that you don't have to be a like literal warrior
*  to develop that ethos.
*  And it's something that used to be so respected and Sparta.
*  And there are just so many there's that was something that was revered.
*  And I feel like in our society now, because victimhood has become currency
*  like no warrior in the fucking world would ever want to be considered a victim.
*  They will die on their own sword. Yeah.
*  And it's important that I think people like David and you and just to
*  to really embrace that spirit and try and promote it,
*  because ultimately it feels better to work against your worst instincts.
*  It does. It just it might be harder, but it feels at the end.
*  It feels so good. You you don't have to do a lot.
*  This is the other thing that I love about.
*  There's this great book, Tiny Habits, and it's all about bundling habits
*  and how you you don't have to start every day and say,
*  I'm going to start working out every day and hour.
*  No, you're probably going to fail.
*  Just start doing 10 minutes and then you might do more.
*  And then bundle it with one minute of meditation
*  and just start little increments and just be consistent.
*  You know, that's great advice, because it really is about
*  building healthy habits, not so much.
*  It's it's just my friend said to me, it's more more habits, less goals,
*  because we're so goal oriented and goals are good to work towards.
*  But you're not going to get there without healthy, consistent habits.
*  And people are just discipline is fucking hard.
*  It is fucking hard. It's hard to be disciplined.
*  It is hard. And the victim mentality, one of the reasons why I reject it
*  so heavily is because it's completely contrary to comedy.
*  Yeah. Like if everyone is a victim and you can't like have any victims ever.
*  Well, then you can't have any jokes now because you're making fun
*  of things that are preposterous.
*  And as soon as you can't make fun of things that are preposterous,
*  like like I was talking, we were talking before about this
*  vice thing that was written about transphobic episodes of this podcast.
*  And one of the things that they wrote was that I incorrectly
*  described how Caitlyn Jenner
*  transition or why Caitlyn Jenner transition.
*  I'm like, oh, you mean Chris Jenner isn't really a demon
*  that hovers over his bed and whispers in his ear
*  and converted him to a woman like, what the fuck are you talking about?
*  This this kind of nonsense is like invite.
*  And I know Caitlyn Jenner got mad at me.
*  I was only just recounting an old joke from 2016.
*  I got no hate for that person. No, no.
*  I'm sorry if I said the wrong name. I don't have any no hate. Yeah.
*  We we're making big deals out of things that aren't big deals.
*  And we're making we're turning jokes into literal statements
*  that are that is hate speech. Yeah.
*  That shit is nonsense. And you know, it's nonsense. Yeah.
*  And you know, it's nonsense. We had to I mean, we were having there was
*  we were driving yesterday and there was a Planned Parenthood above
*  a Mexican place that we drove by.
*  And I was like, OK, imagine you're like going in and they're like,
*  you're killing babies.
*  And it's like, I just wanted to get a margarita, you know,
*  and we were making all these jokes.
*  And I was like, God, it feels so good to just be like joke freely.
*  Because I feel like the the world has become just
*  a floor of eggshells.
*  And everyone's like walking on eggshells all the time.
*  Can I say this? Can I say this?
*  Because everyone's many people are dealing with mental illness.
*  And that's what it's like when you're dealing with mentally ill people.
*  You're constantly walking on eggshells.
*  But it's I always say to comedians, I'm like, don't die on your
*  don't die on the content of the joke.
*  Die on the right to be hyperbolic. Yes.
*  Because that's what they're coming after. Exactly.
*  They'll come after that.
*  I'm like, don't fight about the content of the joke.
*  Just fight for your right to be a hyperbolic comedian, because that's
*  if we have that, we have nothing.
*  We have to be ridiculous. We're fucking clowns.
*  Well, look at Joey Diaz. Yeah.
*  He's the best example.
*  And in my opinion, the funniest guy I've ever seen.
*  Everything is everything he says is so over the top.
*  But that's part of why you laugh. Yeah.
*  You know, he's not being honest.
*  He's he's making you laugh.
*  He's doing comedy and he's doing it by grossly,
*  ridiculously exaggerating something so crazy.
*  Yeah, that's why I get mad when comedians are like
*  you who are shitting on other comedians.
*  When I see other comedians going after other comedians for their jokes,
*  I'm like, what the fuck is happening here?
*  Well, they're always bad. Here's the thing.
*  That's this is the fact the comedians that go after comedians for jokes,
*  they're always mediocre. Yeah, there's this is I don't know.
*  I'm not trying to be mean. No.
*  And I'm not always as a generalization is the tool of the comic.
*  It's not always some of them are good comics that do it erroneously.
*  But the thing that they're doing,
*  they're doing because there's a feeling inside you that always feels bad
*  that you don't reach the high marks. There's like a thing where you don't quite.
*  And then you see someone step out of line or you see someone take it,
*  maybe misstep. Maybe maybe they fuck up.
*  Maybe they make a joke and it doesn't work and you want to attack them.
*  Yeah, you want to talk. But Patrice O'Neill said it best.
*  And he said when someone tells a joke that kills or someone says a joke that
*  offends people and doesn't work, it all comes in the same place.
*  Yeah. And that place is you're trying to be funny. Yeah.
*  That's what you're trying to do. You're not trying to be mean, you know?
*  And I remember particularly the early days of my, my standup comedy.
*  I, when I was terrible, um,
*  I would just say anything to get a laugh, anything.
*  And I didn't have to believe it at all. I literally didn't have to mean it.
*  If I knew that it would work and I treated, I treated comedy jokes like hammers.
*  There was like a hammer. I'm just looking for a nail. Like, does that work?
*  No, does that work? I was lost in the woods. I was,
*  I had a blindfold and I was feeling for trees. Yeah. Everybody though.
*  That's what I did. And then after a while I realized, okay,
*  well some of these things, I have to think they're funny.
*  And then then it works better. And then I, and then I just had it,
*  I had to figure out who I was.
*  Like I got into comedy with very little real social life.
*  When I was 21, when I got into comedy, I had only been fighting.
*  Like I didn't have a normal childhood.
*  Like my child from 15 to 21 was all kicking people in the face and getting
*  kicked. Like that was my whole life.
*  So my whole sense of like what the world was, was all fucked up.
*  So I had to develop opinions on things.
*  I had zero opinions on politics or weddings or anything.
*  So all I talked about for like the first year of comedy was sex.
*  Yeah. That was my whole act. But that's all I had.
*  That's pretty common, especially when you're 21. You know,
*  what other life experience do you have? And by the way, thank God,
*  that's what you did. Because do you ever wonder where you would be if you were
*  that age now? Oh my God. You'd be out in the streets.
*  I would have a real problem.
*  I don't know what I would do. But the point is like,
*  when I would tell a joke outside of sex, I really didn't know what was funny.
*  Yeah. I didn't. I knew it was like certain things were funny with sex.
*  And so I had those jokes. But if I would tell a joke about something else,
*  like I was just swinging at the wind.
*  I love the process of finding what's funny though,
*  even though it's uncomfortable and awkward. I was doing,
*  I was trying to get this bit where I was talking about how my dad sat me down to
*  have an awkward conversation about my freezing my eggs.
*  And I was like, too old. I was like 37. I was like, Dad,
*  isn't this like asking me if I want to freeze the chicken,
*  like seven days after it's been in the fridge? You know,
*  you're probably not going to unfreeze that chicken. It just seems like too,
*  it's like past its prime already.
*  I feel like maybe you should have had this conversation with me when I was like
*  30, not 37. It just seems so, and he's like,
*  I didn't realize you had a whole chicken metaphor worked out. He was like,
*  oh. And so I was trying to do this and all I kept getting was like, oh,
*  from the audience. And I hate the pity. I'm like, I'm up here talking about,
*  it's fine. You don't have to feel bad for me, but that's my job as a comedian to be
*  like, okay, why is everyone feeling sorry for me?
*  There's a lot of gals out there freezing eggs and I just want to put my hands on
*  their shoulder and go, keep those fucking eggs frozen. Just keep the eggs frozen.
*  Do you know that 99% of eggs don't get used? I'm sure it's something crazy.
*  I could be wrong, but it's a crazy high percentage of eggs that don't get used.
*  Listen, it's, you don't have to have kids. It's expensive. Yeah.
*  Kids are expensive, but freezing your eggs is fucking expensive.
*  And you have to storm. You gotta pay a freaking storage fee.
*  Listen, having kids is awesome. Don't get me wrong. Yeah.
*  But you don't have to have kids. Like this,
*  this idea that the path that everybody takes is the path you have to have.
*  There's something about it that used to infuriate me when I was younger,
*  where people with children would tell you, you have to have a child.
*  And I'm like,
*  That feels like a prisoner telling me that I need to commit a crime.
*  That way it can come with us.
*  You don't have to. No, you don't have to. I don't, look, I don't,
*  I don't have a like a steadfast rule for anything
*  involving human beings and their path in life, as long as they're doing no harm.
*  I think as soon as someone does,
*  I always feel like they're trying to justify their own path.
*  But like how many people who do certain things want you to do those things as
*  well? I appreciate the honest parents. Like my sister is like, don't have kids.
*  And she's kidding. But she, and it's,
*  it's another one of those things that in my instance, it never,
*  it was less about having a kid and more about having a family.
*  And I had never at that point met a man that I wanted to really have a family
*  with. And that was important to me. I know it's crazy wanting a man in my life and
*  all. Can I get canceled for that one?
*  And so it just, it hadn't, you know, I'm very, and then I was,
*  I hit 40 and I was like, oh shit. Am I going to regret this?
*  Is it something that, you know,
*  I'm more worried about looking back and being like, I should have, but I,
*  I just, you can always adopt. I can always adopt.
*  There are so many kids who need good parents. And I feel so,
*  I am truly like that woo kind of hippie check who's like,
*  I'm right where I should be. I have to believe that. I have to believe.
*  But you are, you are right where you should be. You're right.
*  Considering especially your past, you are right where you should be.
*  Yeah. And considering, I mean,
*  even just this whole trip to Texas has been so informative because I,
*  I went to go,
*  I went through the process of looking at houses just to see,
*  found out all this stuff, but really I was like, oh, I,
*  I can buy a house. That's a,
*  that was an amazing moment for me because I went bankrupt when I was 26 and I
*  have worked really hard to, I had to like repair my credit.
*  I had to get a little baby $300 a month card that I paid off in full. And you
*  know, I, I had to focus on that shit and I feel it was a nice moment to be like,
*  okay, all right, I can see the path forward.
*  And so many times in my life when I thought I wanted something,
*  like I really wanted to write for Maxim when I was 23,
*  I recently found the proposal. It's hilarious. But I was like, yeah, I want to,
*  I was, I was such a, I was such a boy, like a, a boy's girl.
*  You know, I just,
*  I moved a lot and the guys were always nice to me and they always let me in
*  their club.
*  So I was at poker nights and bachelor parties and all that shit where women
*  generally weren't allowed and I had access to just the male brain and they were,
*  they felt comfortable being their disgusting selves around me and I didn't
*  judge them for it. And, and that, so I was like,
*  I need to write for Maxim. I get these dudes.
*  I want to write sex advice and I never really got that column.
*  I never had, I didn't know anybody to even, I was living in a small town.
*  I was talking to Colin about this and I was like, I was so delusional.
*  I was waiting tables and I was like the town drunk telling people when I was
*  serving them French fries, like remember my name.
*  Did you really?
*  I'm going to be fucking huge.
*  I'm going to be huge one day. They're like,
*  just can you get me coleslaw instead of fries young lady?
*  What are you talking about?
*  I am pretty sure I saw you peeing in the alley the other night.
*  That's why you got to forgive people when they're young.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. When you,
*  when you see someone acting really ridiculous when they're young, don't,
*  don't write them off forever.
*  Yeah. I mean, it's been a lot.
*  I mean, the story, I think of the long fucking road that has been to even,
*  and so I didn't get that, but then I ended up writing for Playboy,
*  which was even better. It was on the internet, you know,
*  and I wanted to write for Maxim. We only had magazines and it was much bigger
*  than I could have imagined, but so in the same space. And so it worked,
*  you know, there might be another better thing. Like rejection.
*  I love that phrase. Rejection is God's protection. I love that.
*  And my therapist always says,
*  God's protection.
*  Yeah. It's like you being rejected by a man or a woman or somebody
*  or a life opportunity.
*  It's just because there's something better or
*  you're a jerk.
*  I've always felt like it just means whatever it is,
*  whether you're rejected for a job or rejected, either you're not good enough
*  or the system's fucked.
*  Oh, see? Yeah.
*  One of those things is, well,
*  there's a lot of people that get jobs that do not deserve them and people that
*  do deserve those jobs don't get them. Yeah. That's cronyism, nepotism.
*  There's a lot of fuckery that goes on with it, but that's okay too.
*  But a lot of times it's a wake up call.
*  There's a lot of people like when you were telling people, remember my name,
*  there's a lot of people that really believe there's something that they're not.
*  And the only way to find out that you are not that person is to be defeated.
*  And that's one of the reasons why I think martial arts is so important for men.
*  Cause men have it in their head,
*  this ridiculous idea that there's something that they're not.
*  And the best way to find out that you are something that you're not is to get
*  squashed. So you get squashed a lot.
*  I've eaten a lot of humble pie.
*  Well, anyone who gets good at jujitsu has been fucking manhandled for a long
*  time. And to get to reach a black belt in jujitsu or even a purple belt,
*  which is what Andrew Yang thinks every police officer should be.
*  And I think so too. You get your fucking ass handed to you for years.
*  Yeah. All the, I mean, I can think, I can close my eyes,
*  just think all the times like strangled tapped, tapped, tapped, tapped on my leg.
*  Ah, tap. It's just like, you just get, you lose all the time.
*  Most men don't have enough opportunities in life to lose.
*  Losing is very important. Losing, failing and losing are so huge.
*  They're so important.
*  And we live in a culture that it doesn't really, um, you know,
*  it's obviously very success driven and everybody. And you see the,
*  you know, that 10 years to become an overnight success or whatever.
*  I'm like, I ate so much.
*  I was telling this story today with Colin just about how I was so delusional
*  and I had, I went bankrupt.
*  I started fetishy.com when I was for, because there's greeting cards and t-shirts.
*  And I had this great idea and then I had no business acumen and I drove around
*  America, highest gas prices ever in America, I think to this day for six months.
*  And I was like selling t-shirts on the beach, telling people like,
*  yo, remember this or like it's spring break.
*  I'm not going to remember anything. Yeah. I was just delusional.
*  And I would just, I came out here and then my cousin,
*  who's my partner on a lot of stuff. I'm like, you know what?
*  We can turn this company around. I was like on the verge of bankruptcy.
*  I'm like, we're going to go to Costco and we're going to get some whiteboards and
*  we got $600 worth of stuff and two cards.
*  I was maxed out on my credit cards.
*  I go to pay with my credit card and they're like,
*  we don't take credit cards because it's Costco.
*  They only take like that one kind American express or I think it's changed now
*  visa or something. So they only took one and they wouldn't take it.
*  And then we just had to like abandon these two cards.
*  Like why did I think that like dry erase boards was the thing that I needed in
*  that moment spending $600.
*  And I do tell young people who come to me for advice. I'm like, you know,
*  there is, you have to kind of be a little delusional.
*  To, um,
*  in a creative path in particular,
*  because the difference between delusions and dreams is hard work.
*  Like you're delusional if you're sitting in your mom's basement and you're like,
*  I'm, I'm going to do this. And you're never doing anything,
*  but you do need a little bit of overachieving delusion to kind of push
*  yourself.
*  You could call it that. I would just call it ambition. Yeah.
*  Ambition and a trust in the process. Yeah. Yeah. Terrible.
*  If you're a comedian, you're terrible. Right. And, but you think,
*  I know a lot of terrible comedians who have been hugely successful.
*  So as terrible, I might attribute that.
*  Few of those are joke thieves, but a lot of them, they,
*  they start out bad,
*  but they have these moments where they get laughs.
*  If you could figure out what happened there and then,
*  and then take those embers and blow on them and, and, and use it,
*  and figure out how to recreate that and then figure out how to get better at it.
*  It can be done, but you also have to be ruthlessly introspective.
*  And that is a thing that most people are not willing to do.
*  Most people want to protect themselves from their failures and they want to
*  pretend that it was other people's fault or people were plotting against them or,
*  you know, how come it always happens to them or he gets all the breaks and all
*  that shit does you zero good and just pushes people away from you.
*  It creates exact opposite, the exact opposite amount of the,
*  the exact opposite kind of energy that you need to be successful.
*  What you need to be successful is pain.
*  Yeah. You need to, all my best,
*  like growth moments in comedy came after I bombed,
*  like embarrassing, horrific bombings.
*  Those are when I got my shit together and I got better and I go, my, my God,
*  I can't do that again. And then I got better. This,
*  there's been a series, there's like been,
*  there's these big ones in my life where I was like,
*  like it was the worst feelings I've ever had.
*  Yeah, it's not.
*  I've had losses and fights that feel losses feel bad.
*  I get PTSD just talking about bombings from some of the bombing.
*  It's getting your ass kicked is what I'm trying to say.
*  Bombing feels worse than getting your ass kicked. It really does.
*  I had one at the comedy store that I still remember. Like it was yesterday.
*  It was, it was a monumental,
*  a guy that I was kind of having an affair with actually.
*  He was there with his friends, which was even worse.
*  I would have rather it had been a thousand strangers and they kept pushing
*  me and it was, and they kept pushing me and pushing me cause I'm nobody.
*  And I just kept drinking and drinking and drinking and I got on stage and I was
*  like, I'm cold and afraid. And that was it. And then I blanked.
*  I couldn't remember anything. They mused. It was her,
*  I, it was her effect. You know, you feel me. It was.
*  A hundred percent. I can't watch open mic nights. I can't.
*  Like one of the,
*  one of the reasons why I take great comedians on the road with me,
*  I always take funny people because there's nothing weirder to me than watching
*  someone who's not funny and then thinking I can go be funny. I don't,
*  I feel like nothing's funny. Like if I see someone eat shit, I'm like,
*  Oh my God, comedy doesn't work. Like there's no comedy. It's not real.
*  This can't be done. It can't be done. This person's bombing. Nothing is funny.
*  Nothing they're saying makes me think, Oh yeah, I know it's funny.
*  And then if you go on after someone who bombs, who's terrible,
*  you have to kind of reintroduce the idea of things being funny.
*  Yeah. Like it's a lot more work.
*  Yeah. This has, this actually happened to me in a situation that I had no
*  business being in, which was often the case with standup. And it was,
*  they had made some deal where Bill Burr was performing. Who's a God.
*  And then there was just a bunch of nobodies who that they had arranged that
*  would like kind of just open for him basically so that he could like do his
*  hour that he was testing. Cause he doesn't go fuck.
*  They're not here to see any of us. They're just here to see him.
*  And the girl,
*  I was the girl in between a girl who bombed and Bill.
*  And I was like, this is so much pressure. Thank God I didn't,
*  in that instance I didn't bomb, but it was, you were like,
*  the audience is traumatized. You know,
*  they need to recover. They need to,
*  you need to bring them back and let them know everything's okay.
*  There's also the thing where you know that someone who's going on after you is
*  just way better than you.
*  And you just start judging your act and judging all of your material.
*  Second guessing your taglines and yeah,
*  that was like a who has a Jeff Garland.
*  I was opening for him and I was just so paranoid. I got in my head.
*  The first show is a disaster. And he's like, no one gives a fuck, Bridget.
*  They're here to see me. You know, like you can go. He's like, I,
*  I demand you go out there and bomb. And he's like,
*  you need to try all new stuff. He was great. He pushed me. He's like,
*  I don't care. Go out and be like there. I'm going to come out.
*  Cause you know him. He just has like the awkward silences that he loves.
*  He's so I love when he's like,
*  no most people in this moment would be uncomfortable.
*  It's just silent and it like sit down,
*  just take a load off and yeah, I've learned a lot. I mean, I learned,
*  I definitely learned more from bombing than I have from.
*  Yeah, that's where you learn. Well, you definitely learn from killing too.
*  I mean, well that just feels like, feels awesome,
*  but it also does teach you what's good in your act and the pacing and correct
*  pacing and like how you're, you're presenting bits.
*  And I never leave a bit alone until I'm ready to film it.
*  I'm always fucking moving things around and trying to find a better way to,
*  and you know, you find out through whether or not it works.
*  What's your process for writing?
*  Well, there's a bunch of different ways.
*  Sometimes I just have an idea and I just write it down on my phone.
*  Like sometimes I'll be talking to my wife and I'm like, I got an idea.
*  And she, she understands. So I just run away. I've run away,
*  like literally run and I'll just write it down. Cause like,
*  I can't it's like they're slippery fish. Like, ah,
*  I'll remember that. You'll never remember it.
*  I've I know now that I don't remember it. So if a good one pops in my head,
*  I will literally run away in a restaurant. I'll get up and run. Yeah.
*  And like, what the fuck is he doing? Do you audio? Like sometimes you,
*  sometimes sometimes I audio. Well, also sometimes if I'm like,
*  if I'm high especially, and I think I'm not going to remember this,
*  I have to say it because I don't, I don't,
*  I won't remember it while I'm writing it because I'm really high.
*  I'm like, what was I saying? So I have to say it because it's quick, you know?
*  So I have like, when I swipe down on my iPhone, there's the,
*  the audio recorder is one of the things that's built in there.
*  So I just swipe down, hit that and start yapping. That helps.
*  But the other thing is like sitting and sometimes they're just ideas that I have
*  that I bounce around in my head while I'm driving around.
*  I'm trying to figure out how to work it out.
*  And then I bring them on stage raw. Sometimes I haven't even written it down.
*  And I just fuck around with it on stage to see if I can find a place for it.
*  But then the big thing to me is also sitting in front of a computer.
*  And I know a lot of comics don't like that,
*  but some of my best bits have come from sitting down and going over the bit and
*  going over material and also writing essays. Like I write essays.
*  And so I'll write like a couple thousand words, but I'll extract a sentence.
*  Right. And that one sentence will be a bit.
*  But if I don't sit and write that, I don't get that sentence. Right. Right.
*  And a lot of comics saying, Oh, I write on stage. I'm like, yeah, I do too.
*  I do too. But I also make myself sit down.
*  Like I need a new hour every two years,
*  really a new hour every year because the last year is really just hammering the
*  samurai sword down.
*  Bing, bing, bing.
*  It's, you know, honing the blade, but the bit,
*  the metal has to be in position after a year. So I have to get something.
*  And you got like, you can come up with it on your own. You could just,
*  just, just talk and go on stage and socializing with friends.
*  A lot of times things come out, socializing with friends, good ideas.
*  Well, pop into my head like you're laughing, having fun. You say something crazy.
*  You're like, Oh my God, you should use that. And you write that down.
*  But there's no substitute for actually writing for sitting down and writing.
*  Yeah. Just sitting your ass in that chair and doing the work. It's, it's like,
*  it doesn't hurt. This is what I tell young comics. Like, well,
*  I'm not really feel comfortable writing like that because it always comes out
*  forced. Yeah. Get better at it. Like that's the argument that I've talked to
*  in comics that, that just do crowd work. Whenever I do bits, it seems fake.
*  I'm like, well, that's cause they're not good. Yeah. You got to get better at
*  doing that. Do you like crowd work? I do it if some shit is going on.
*  Yeah. Yeah. But you know, I just, you know, I'll do it occasionally just to have fun.
*  Yeah. But I feel like there's this,
*  it's a weird sort of fake immediacy.
*  Like there's a fake energy like, Oh my God, this is coming out of nowhere.
*  You know, this is so much funnier than it really is because that's,
*  people are laughing really loud and because they know that you're coming up with
*  it in the moment. It's fun sometimes, but there's no substitute for real bits.
*  Yeah. Like a real killer bit. That's what I like.
*  When I would listen to Richard Pryor or Sam Kinnison,
*  or I wanted those fucking perfectly honed chunks.
*  Yeah. You know, that's like Chappelle. I mean, God, I watch his stuff.
*  I'm like, he is like a master class,
*  just the way that he constantly misdirects and it's like,
*  the joke's always on you.
*  Just so I mean, that opening to the most recent one, the sticks and stones.
*  Yeah. Just,
*  it's just how he manages to bring it back to the Anthony Bourdain thing.
*  And then he's like, and this guy, I mean, he's just, it's,
*  he's just a master. You see somebody who's so gifted at that.
*  He's so dedicated. Did you ever, I feel this way about Colin Quinn, actually,
*  that New York special that he did. Did you ever see that? No, I haven't seen it.
*  Holy fuck. It is, Colin's a genius. He's a genius.
*  I watched it and rewatched it again immediately because I was like, what the,
*  how the fuck did he just do that?
*  He tells the whole history of New York and it's all in jokes.
*  I think Seinfeld directed it. It's on Netflix. It is genius.
*  I've never seen anything like it really.
*  It was like the history of New York in an hour.
*  He's so unappreciated.
*  So unappreciated.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And comics appreciate him.
*  I remember one time I did Tough Crowd and Colin was working the,
*  he was warming up the audience and he just did a standup.
*  So there's an audience there to see Tough Crowd and Colin is just doing standup
*  for the audience. And it is so good. I remember thinking afterwards, like, wow,
*  his standup was so much better than the show itself. I was like,
*  it's kind of interesting. Like people don't know how good he is.
*  He's so good. His red state, blue state that he did is genius.
*  It's like aired on CNN and now it's on Netflix,
*  but it was a roast of all 50 states. It's freaking hilarious.
*  It's amazing.
*  He's yeah, he's really under, I feel like underappreciated.
*  What have you learned in your time off?
*  Like what have you learned about your comedy? Have you, what are your?
*  I can live without it and learn that. I can survive.
*  Well, yeah, without it. I mean, you're not twitchy. Oh, well,
*  I got twitchy the one time I did it. I did it in Houston.
*  I did a weekend at the improv,
*  but then I got twitchy about giving people the COVID. I got worried.
*  I'm like, what if I got it? And then I gave it to somebody.
*  Yeah, that would worry me. So getting weirded out about that.
*  I got weird weirded out about like, you know, someone who's compromised,
*  getting it because of my carelessness. And then I thought about,
*  I was like, also then there's people that are in the audience.
*  Are you responsible if people come to see you and then someone in the audience
*  gets COVID? Like, are you responsible for that?
*  Not directly, but it's like secondhand.
*  Do you feel guilt free? You don't feel guilt free.
*  Like if you find out that a fan who loved you,
*  but was overweight and they came to see you and they got COVID and died after
*  your show, like, yeah, you'd feel horrible. If you were a decent person.
*  Okay. This is not,
*  I don't know if there's a way to do this where people don't get sick.
*  What about the drive-thrus? Aren't people doing that?
*  That seems whack. I know Bert loves them. Bert loves them,
*  but Bert's crazy and he's always drunk. So it's like, it's hard to,
*  it's hard to. He's having a blast. He loves it. Yeah.
*  But Bert just wanted to perform, you know, and he figured out a way to do it.
*  I mean, I'm pretty sure that the drive-in movie comedy thing was his idea.
*  Oh, wow. I think he's the one that started doing it.
*  And he's the one for sure who's doing it on the biggest scale.
*  He told me he did a show. I go, how many people were there? He goes, 700 cars.
*  Oh, wow. I got 700 cars. That's crazy. That's a lot of people.
*  Yeah. You got to figure that's at least 1400 people. Yeah. Maybe more. Yeah.
*  And you know, he said at the end of it, they were flashing their lights.
*  It was like a fucking UFO. He said it was awesome. That's kind of cool. Listen,
*  he just wanted to be out there. Yeah. You know,
*  he just wanted to be out there doing standup and it's going well.
*  He's selling out all over the place.
*  I feel bad for the comedians who were like just getting that momentum.
*  You know,
*  the ones that were grinding and grinding and grinding.
*  Cause I've been thinking a lot about this just with COVID,
*  how much momentum was just stopped all over the world.
*  Just the momentum for musicians. You know,
*  I heard this story about a musician people starting businesses just stopped.
*  Yeah. People going to college sports,
*  but these comedians who aren't making money or musicians who aren't making
*  money, musicians only make money touring. Yeah.
*  But we're just about to start making money. Maybe not even like just beginning.
*  Like my friend Allie, Allie McCroskey. She was, she was opening for me,
*  just really starting to get paid work and then was actually starting to headline
*  and then it all went away. Yeah. I mean, that's what... Now she's living with her mom.
*  Oh, wow. Yeah. There's no, there's no money. There's no money.
*  Like how do you make money? Yeah.
*  The only way a comic survives today is if they started a podcast before all this
*  shit happened. And I have been telling comics this from the fucking jump.
*  You were the one who told me to start mine. Yes. And you listen. I did.
*  You told me, I remember where I was.
*  It was at the comedy store and you were like, start a podcast.
*  And I was like, man, Joe Rogan tells you to start a podcast. I guess you should.
*  Look, I mean, it's, it's very successful now.
*  The thing is it's,
*  it's a vehicle for you to be independent and to not just make money,
*  but also to get your voice out there.
*  You can get your opinions out there in a way that you don't have anybody leaning
*  over your shoulder. Like I had,
*  there was a time where I was doing the rounds with some radio people where
*  there was like some offers for me to do a radio thing. And I was like, Oh,
*  but there's going to be like someone telling me what I can and can't say.
*  Right.
*  There's going to be someone bringing me guests like this guest is going to come
*  in and that guest is going to come in. I'm like,
*  I could probably make do with that, but it would also be those,
*  there's uncomfortable moments.
*  I remember when I did radio where the, I knew the DJ did not want me there.
*  Right.
*  They weren't a fan of my comedy or the DJs are weird people and they're like
*  comics in a lot of ways, but a lot of them are like comics that never did
*  comedy.
*  Right. Right.
*  I have this like insecurity about the comics that are out there battling.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I remember one guy was mad because he said, uh,
*  looked like he had about two hours sleep. He smelled like liquor. I'm like,
*  yeah. Yeah. I'm a comic. Yeah. Yeah. I did have two hours sleep.
*  I did smell like liquor. We were up having a good time.
*  I had a show last night. Motherfucker. Yeah. You know,
*  we were up until four o'clock in the morning, just laughing.
*  And then I came here at six. Yeah. That's what happened.
*  Do you expect this is what I do, man. I'm a comedian,
*  but there's something about the person who just the comic,
*  the like a lot of DJs I think secretly wanted to be comics,
*  but they just, because they'll try to be funny. They'll try to be witty,
*  witty morning guy. Yeah. Yeah. But they never,
*  they never put their balls in a wheelbarrow and made it onto that stage.
*  Yeah. They never did.
*  So you were like no radio sticking with the podcast.
*  Well, I just didn't, I didn't think anybody was going to hire me. Oh, okay.
*  But the problem was I was worried about having a place
*  where I could just say what I wanted to say.
*  I always knew someone was going to tell me not to do something. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Like, it's so annoying when you say something funny and someone's like,
*  you can't say that. Oh, you fuck.
*  There was an episode of fear factor once with this lady could not reach her
*  hand into this barrel.
*  This is a barrel of worms to pull out a piece of paper and the piece of paper I
*  think would say you have to eat one worm or no worms.
*  And I'm pretty sure she was vegan too. So she couldn't eat a worm.
*  She'd have to kill a thing. It was hilarious. So I go,
*  just put your hand in there and grab the paper. Just like, I can't, I go,
*  but you definitely can trust me. You can do it. You put your hand in there.
*  You grab the paper and you do it. I go, it's not that hard.
*  I'm telling you it's all in your head. I'm going to help you through it.
*  And she's like, I just can't, I can't, I go, you're saying you can't,
*  but that's not true. It's difficult, but you can. I go, watch, I'm going to do it.
*  I go, want to watch? And I put my hand in there and I pull out a piece of paper.
*  I see that I go, that's why only men get to be president.
*  And she was so mad at me. I go, I'm joking. I go, but you can do it. Like,
*  but NBC wouldn't have it. They wouldn't do it. They cut it out.
*  And I remember this conversation I had with the producers. I was like,
*  why can't you say that? I go, you understand I'm joking, right? They will.
*  A lot of people going to get mad. I go, yeah, a lot of people get mad at jokes,
*  but it's pretty clear that I'm joking and you know,
*  I'm a comedian and everybody else does too. So what are we doing?
*  Like what are we doing? I remember that feeling. I'm like, it's going to be that.
*  It's going to be that all day. It's going to be that all the time.
*  It's going to be that,
*  but podcasts are the only place where a comic can say whatever the fuck they
*  want. But what I've been telling comics from the jump is this is the only place
*  where you can do this.
*  Where you don't have any other people doing,
*  and thankfully a lot of people have listened, particularly like Tom Segura and
*  Christine. Like Tom and I had a conversation. They're awesome.
*  They're moving out here. Coming out this week.
*  She's, I just love her.
*  Yeah. I hooked them up with my real estate agent.
*  So we were in the middle of this lockdown and me and Tom were on the phone and
*  he goes, dude, thank God you told me to do this podcast. He goes, what the fuck?
*  He goes, I was making so much money touring and then I was like basing my
*  lifestyle off of that. No one ever thought the plug would be pulled out like this.
*  No one ever saw this coming, but not just that.
*  They've established who they are through that podcast in a way.
*  Like you realize how silly he is and how silly they are together.
*  How funny. They're awesome. They're great. They're my favorite. Well,
*  they're not my favorite com, yeah, they are. Okay. They're my favorite comedy couple.
*  But there's a bunch of other ones like Bonnie McFarland and Ridge Voss and,
*  uh, Natasha Ligero and Moshe Kasher. There's a few that work.
*  And that's the answer to these people that say like, oh, comedians,
*  she's never dated other comedians. Well, yeah, my whole theory.
*  One headshot per couple. Yeah. It's a good theory.
*  It's a good theory most of the time, but like all theories, there's always a,
*  yeah, there's some that work. Obviously I think they don't.
*  I, the thing I love about Tom and they just don't take themselves very seriously
*  at all. Or their opinions. Yeah. And then they're not the people,
*  even though they're super successful,
*  they're not the people that tell you what you should and shouldn't do.
*  That shit's gross. I don't want to do that. That's what,
*  it's like you were saying earlier about the just letting people kind of find
*  their path because I, what worked for me isn't going to work for thee.
*  And this is what we're hearing from, you know,
*  these kind of extremes is what's right for me is what's right for everybody.
*  What's right for me is what you have to do. And if I think something,
*  you must comply. If I believe something, you can't say a thing,
*  you can't think a thing. You must do this. You got to adhere to this or that.
*  You know, there's just so much madness in the world when it comes to this shit.
*  It's weird. It's interesting. Like I understand, you know, Kanye, clearly,
*  I pray for him. Kanye. I understand right when he started wearing the Maga hat,
*  I was like, I get it.
*  I get it because there was so much pressure,
*  especially like in LA and when you're living in that liberal bubble state,
*  there's so much ideological pressure. I could feel it.
*  I could feel myself not wanting to say things. And that's why I just was like,
*  fuck it. I'm saying whatever I want on Twitter, bro,
*  I'll pay the consequences, whatever they might be.
*  And I'm not going to censor myself. And you know,
*  I have the whole theory of on Twitter,
*  if you get like a lot of followers for one tweet,
*  you have to immediately tweet something that's the opposite so that you can weed
*  out all the like zealots and ideologues because that's the only way to
*  purify following from like the radicals.
*  And it does work. I feel like, because I can see it in my mentions,
*  for the most part, my,
*  like the people who follow me are like in on the joke and there are some really
*  smart, funny people and I love it when they contribute to the joke.
*  Like I'll read my mentions cause they're usually freaking hilarious.
*  And then there's always like one idiot who's like, Oh,
*  this is the most obvious grift I've ever seen. I'm like,
*  do you just? Yeah. Yeah.
*  That grift word, there's too many dorks that are using that word. I know.
*  Oh, it's a grifter because I like using the word.
*  There are a lot of people that are fucking grifters,
*  but there's too many people using that word. It's a good word.
*  It's one of those words. It's a fun word. It's a really fun word.
*  It's a fun word to say. It has a good accurate. Yeah.
*  I'll tell you where to find grifters.
*  Here's a fun thing to do that I,
*  I should start just a segment on my podcast.
*  I love reading Yelp reviews of psychics.
*  You want to talk about fucking grifters? I could read these
*  for hours. You want comedy, Joe? Go read psychic reviews
*  on Yelp. Yeah, they are nothing but grift. They, they're like,
*  I came in and he didn't remember my name.
*  He should have known my name when I walked in the scenes that are set.
*  Like I showed up and this woman was babysitting her grandchild and then she
*  needed me to give them a ride. I'm like,
*  these people who are psychics are insane. It's amazing.
*  All of your audience should take a moment, go read some psychic Yelp reviews.
*  When you're feeling down, you will immediately feel better about life.
*  There's all these people that want you to know that they know a psychic that's
*  real. Like, dude, I'm telling you, she knows, she just knows things.
*  You got to talk to her.
*  I had a girl on my podcast who was addicted to psychics and I was like, come
*  on, how bad could it have been? And she was like,
*  I spent $60,000 on psychics last year. I'm like, okay, yeah,
*  that's an addiction.
*  Whoa. How did she have that much money?
*  I mean, I think she had good money. She had decent money.
*  Obviously she was making decent money.
*  If you make more than $60,000 a year, you're probably not that much of a moron.
*  Right? You've done well.
*  I mean, if you have that money to blow on psychics, that's what's,
*  that's what's confusing about it.
*  It's crazy. It's crazy.
*  And I think it got to the point where her psychic started feeling guilty because
*  he told her that she, he had to like cut her off. That's like a drug dealer.
*  Bro, you, you taking in too much of this crack.
*  I thought she was kidding when she said it.
*  Her psychic cut her off. Oh my God. That's funny. Amazing. It's a wacky.
*  It was a wacky interview.
*  Those are dirty people. They're evil people. Those people in the seance people,
*  those are even eviler. Your,
*  your father's talking to me from beyond the grave. I, I sense he misses you.
*  Yeah. Oh, give me money. Give me money. I was talking to your dead dad.
*  Do you believe in any kind of psychic powers?
*  I think, I think it is,
*  it is likely that there are evolving senses that we are aware of and that we
*  recognize,
*  but that no one in this current state of evolution has a handle on how to control
*  them. I think there are moments when you think about people and they call you.
*  I think there are times when you know someone's lying.
*  There's a feeling you get when you know someone secretly hates you. Right.
*  Is this weird things where you go, I knew that fucker,
*  there's something and I don't know if those are body language that you're
*  picking up. It could be that. Yeah, it could be that.
*  But there's also things like when you think about someone and they call,
*  people say, Oh, that's a coincidence. It, you're right.
*  It could be a coincidence. Yeah. But I'm not buying that all the time.
*  I think sometimes it's a coincidence,
*  but I think sometimes there's a strange inner connectedness to life.
*  And I think that we used to be animals with no language and then we develop
*  language and you're basically, when you're talking to me,
*  when you and I are talking and you're speaking with your language,
*  you're making sounds and I read your mind through those sounds and I recognize
*  those sounds mean particular things.
*  I put them into my own organization of what they mean to me and they mean
*  different things to different people, which is why it gets,
*  things get confusing,
*  which is also why I'm so ruthlessly opposed to compliance because you're
*  forcing me to accept your definition of what these sounds mean and what that
*  means in terms of like what the actual context of it is and what the intent is
*  behind these sounds. And it's, it's, it's creepy and sneaky.
*  Yeah. Wildly debunked. Yes. But I think exactly.
*  It's been wildly debunked by my opinion.
*  Drives me crazy. But also just words you can and can't say.
*  Yeah.
*  But there's something about human beings where I feel like there is a connection
*  that's like almost there. Yeah. It's like, it comes together sometimes.
*  It's like just every now and then you get it, but you don't always have it.
*  There's something and when you do mushrooms, you have it in a big way.
*  You know, one of the things of ayahuasca when they first discovered ayahuasca,
*  one of the ingredients that was later recognized as being already discovered to
*  be a compound called Harmin,
*  they, they started calling it telepathy.
*  So the first people that were studying ayahuasca,
*  the first scholars that were studying it were the researchers were calling it
*  telepathy until they realized that, you know,
*  do the rules of scientific nomenclature had already been established that was
*  Harmin. So they knew what the thing was,
*  but they were calling it telepathy because through this compound people were
*  having these shared experiences without talking.
*  And then when they relayed these experiences,
*  they were actually communicating without talking and they were saying there's a
*  type of telepathy that's possible with this drug. I think,
*  I think we are becoming something.
*  And if we don't interfere,
*  we probably will technologically and with Neuralink and all these other crazy
*  things. If we don't interfere,
*  I think we will ultimately become more and more in tune with that.
*  Our ability to sense things and communicate nonverbally and read each other
*  nonverbally. There's something about,
*  there's something about us where we connect in this way that is you can't
*  measure it. You can't put it on a scale. You can't put a tape measure to it,
*  but there's something to it.
*  I agree. My, my,
*  my best friend and I have always had that psychic connection and we just thought
*  the adults weren't witches like we were in that they sucked.
*  So we always developed it. And to this day, I can be like,
*  call me Sarah telepathically and she will,
*  literally within like a day,
*  it feels like I'll hear from her randomly until it's just that we like
*  intuitively know when we need each other.
*  And I worked with autistic kids for a while and part,
*  one of my many jobs.
*  And I kind of have a weird theory that autism and the rise of it is the human
*  brain and evolution. And it just hasn't,
*  we're kind of catching it mid evolution because those kids have amazing gifts.
*  I saw some crazy shit working with autistic kids,
*  just things that didn't make any sense. Like my one example,
*  I was working with a kid and he was nonverbal and we were in the playroom and he
*  was, you know, he kept, he was obsessed with flies.
*  He would get obsessed with different things at different times and he would look
*  up and then look back and look up. And he was in his, we were like,
*  I thought it was locked. It wasn't. And he runs out of the room suddenly,
*  runs through the laundry room,
*  runs into the kitchen and then midair grabs a fly as it's flying.
*  Yeah, I saw this. I was running on his heels trying to catch him.
*  I was like, what the fuck?
*  And then he brings it back into the playroom and he would like basically play
*  with the fly until eventually it died.
*  And that was just one of the, I mean,
*  there were so many moments like that with all of these different kids where I'm
*  like, they're tapped into something else.
*  And if you lived in a world and say you had a sixth sense, say that you had,
*  say that you lived in a world where nobody could see and you were the only
*  person who could see,
*  you'd be banging your fucking head on the wall too if you could see.
*  And everyone was like, what are you talking about?
*  So sometimes I wonder if it's not, they're not, like you're saying,
*  maybe the brain is evolving and we're just catching,
*  it just doesn't fit in society. So they're,
*  they're feeling because there's a lot that I don't know.
*  I just saw so many of the autistic kids are just amazing.
*  Some people have that feeling when it comes to autism and autistic kids that
*  maybe that's an emerging type of consciousness.
*  And that even though we're looking at today as being a detriment,
*  that it might be the standard in the future.
*  Yeah. I mean, they have amazing, because like you were saying, we're animals.
*  And we've done,
*  I've always been fascinated with how out of touch we are with our instincts
*  because they still run the show for all of us. Most people. Yeah.
*  Most people right now, there's so much fear in that you can feel it everywhere.
*  There's so much fear. Everyone's in fear, fear, fear, fear, fear,
*  everywhere.
*  And that drives so much of this behavior that we're seeing like tribalism
*  and trying to be a tyrant and rule over people and
*  feeling like you have to stop anything that doesn't make you feel that even that
*  language. Like I don't feel safe. What does that cause of words?
*  Like what does that even fucking mean? I don't feel safe. I'm not. Okay.
*  You don't feel safe by my words, but you like burning down a city is supposed to
*  be okay. You know, it's a weird,
*  we live in like weird times where there's so much, but I feel like,
*  I think it was really shown in the tsunami.
*  Remember that huge tsunami that was in like 2006, was it?
*  Or 2005? No, not the one in Japan. The one that was in the ocean.
*  And all the animals ran away and all the humans ran to go see all the
*  shells and shit and why the ocean was,
*  there were tons of people who drowned because they were like, what's happening?
*  And that's just evidence to me of how out of touch with,
*  I wonder if our ancestors would have made that same mistake where they're like,
*  what's happening? I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  Or would they have been like, we're getting that we're following the animals.
*  Well, there's a real wonder like what kind of, uh,
*  what kind of understanding of animals and of the land and,
*  and storms coming and all sorts of shit that animals seem to tune in.
*  Did we lose when we, you know, had houses and
*  Did we lose it is what I'm wondering. I wonder, right?
*  Or did we just never have it and we're morons?
*  Maybe, maybe that's it. Well, don't you think also we,
*  we're so much more capable of expressing ourselves.
*  We're so much more, um,
*  occupied with tasks and things and whether it's information or
*  computers or TV or different people that we're talking to constantly that the,
*  the mind is overwhelmed. And that how much time do you spend in the woods?
*  I spend a lot of time in nature.
*  Well, when you're there and you hear nothing, it's weird.
*  Oh, I love it.
*  Like there's a weird quiet to the mountains. Like there's a desert too.
*  Yeah, I love it.
*  And it also it's humbling because it lets you know, you ain't shit.
*  Not shit. That's why I love the desert.
*  I love it because it puts me in my place.
*  It's like everything in the desert has evolved to survive the
*  harshest conditions on earth.
*  And everything there is either trying to kill you or will kill you.
*  And there's something about that,
*  that painful evolution that all the plants and animals had to undergo
*  that just speaks to me and just even the harsh, I mean,
*  it's like nine o'clock in the morning. You're like, it's so high.
*  Like I'm going to die.
*  And it's also, it doesn't care about you.
*  This ecosystem has existed long before you were ever here. And it's, it's,
*  it's all working together.
*  The bugs are working with the lizards with the snakes and the plants and the,
*  the little water that there is and the coyotes and all this shit is working
*  together. And it's maintaining this, this system.
*  But I love that. I mean, that's the thing that I,
*  I feel like people are losing when they're looking down into these demonic boxes
*  all day long is that connection to, um,
*  you know, having your feet kind of being made of mud, but also made of stars.
*  That famous quote I'm butchering, but we are made of stardust.
*  That we are part, you know,
*  I'll look out at the stars and be like, what the fuck I'm part of this.
*  I'm not even high. And I can experience that trip of,
*  we aren't separate from, I'm not looking at the stars. It's like,
*  I'm part of that crazy. And we're all just,
*  it's such a miracle that we're here in this time and space.
*  And it's such a wild trip. And we're,
*  and we have more than we've ever had in the, in the history of humans.
*  And we're wasting it tearing each other apart. It actually hurts my soul.
*  When there's a lot of wasted energy for sure. That's why when I see people,
*  you know, when people are like, how, okay, little miss captain of the fence,
*  writing team, you know,
*  I'm going to get a t-shirt that says captain of the fence writing team.
*  And you are truly the captain. Listen, I'm, I don't,
*  I'm not married to any of my thoughts. Yeah. I don't think,
*  I think it's good to question everything, including yourself. Yeah.
*  And there's some thoughts like, Hey, don't murder people. Don't steal.
*  Don't rape. Don't, you know, don't like,
*  a lot of things are like, don't drown old people. Like, yeah,
*  there's a lot of like real clear ones. But,
*  but when it comes to whether it's a government or
*  behavior or ideology or any of the things that we,
*  we hold so rigid, I think it's really dangerous.
*  It's really dangerous to look at things the way we look at things.
*  We have these non pliable opinions.
*  And also connect all of our own feelings of importance
*  to these opinions being valid. Connect who you are as a person,
*  like who your,
*  your value as a person to whether or not the opinions that you hold are true.
*  So you will fight to the death for those opinions. So common.
*  It's so common. That was like all the Trump supporters who were in my comments.
*  It was like, I attacked them personally.
*  Like I had gone to their house and personally attacked them and their mom
*  and told them that they were shit. And like, you guys,
*  you can't personally identify with politicians are the biggest pieces of shit
*  ever. They are Trump's not a politician. That's why we like him.
*  He's out here to drain the swamp.
*  I love it when they're like, we're not listening to Hollywood. I'm like,
*  you're your hero is Hollywood. You know, what are you talking about?
*  Well, that's hilarious. And then when people call you Hollywood,
*  like what does that mean? No, because it means show business. No, it's a, it's,
*  it's, I just, I feel like we deserve better. Yeah, we definitely,
*  you know, in this election makes me feel like we deserve, but we don't,
*  but we don't, we deserve this because this is where we've left it.
*  We've left it to this. Like nobody wants to be fucking president.
*  There's a few people that you could get behind, like Tulsi Goward, that you go,
*  I just, I think that's who she is. I mean, I don't think there's any bullshit
*  there, but there's very few of those.
*  The people that are willing to run for president.
*  This is the kind of people that are willing to do this.
*  Cause most of the people, most of the people that think about they go, Ooh,
*  my fucking skeletons. I have a friend of mine.
*  That's funny. I mean,
*  I was just thinking it would be a shit job and I would hate it.
*  And I would hate myself because I think by the time you get there in order to
*  even maneuver,
*  you have to sell yourself out so many times that you don't even know.
*  Well,
*  you think about how many people are just waiting to attack anybody who's running
*  for president and about the way they ramp up their,
*  their attacks and the, and the machine behind it.
*  It's not as simple as like I'm Joe Biden and I think Donald Trump's a fucking
*  loser. And so I'm going to say that, no,
*  there's like a whole machine with literally billions of dollars on
*  the line, because if our team gets in there,
*  then we can push our agenda. We can get certain bills passed.
*  We can get certain legislation through. We can make sure that certain regulations,
*  yes. And it's, it can literally one way or the other impact corporations in this
*  spectacular way. So they have to really, really put a lot of effort into it.
*  So the idea that, that we allow that that's,
*  that's where things get crazy. Like it should be,
*  it's almost like if you want to run for president,
*  you almost should have no help. Like no one,
*  no one. It should be like grassroots.
*  Like they take you and they take away your phone and they,
*  they keep you in a hotel room and they just bring you place to place and no one
*  gets to talk to you.
*  Isn't that AOC though? She's pretty grassroots or she has like a whole
*  organization behind her. The tribe, the justice league or whatever, the squad.
*  Squad. I call them the tribe.
*  But they also have like the, what's it, what is it? Is it the like,
*  democratic justice league or something?
*  It's like the, it's a pretty socialist, I think, organization.
*  Well, she's got a lot of people that also agree with her that are also in
*  politics and they also work together and you know,
*  and then she's compromised some of her own democratic socialist.
*  Well, I can't wait until she's a Republican in like 10 years.
*  Well, you're telling me that you had read some of your shit.
*  I'm going to find it for you. I just, it is, it is like,
*  it was a part of the book when I was waiting tables,
*  telling everyone to remember my name and drunk all the time. I was,
*  I was super, there was a whole part where I was talking about Bush.
*  I didn't know anything about politics at all, but I was, I was just so,
*  I was a libtard. Like the definition, by definition of what,
*  what they, the right would consider a libtard. That was.
*  Well, you weren't hardened yet by the world.
*  I mean, I was pretty hardened at,
*  I had had enough shit up in pre prior to 23 that.
*  Yeah.
*  But you were still hopeful that these sort of airy fairy idealistic notions of
*  what, you know, what should be done with our culture and that this would work.
*  And with no understanding of economics, no understanding of.
*  I think it's good to be that hopeful.
*  I don't think you should go burn down government buildings and be like, yeah,
*  let's tear it all down. But I think it's good to have that idealistic hope in
*  your, what does that famous quote? Like you're, you're, if you don't,
*  if you're not a Democrat in your twenties, you don't have a heart.
*  And if you're not a Republican in your thirties,
*  you don't have a brain or something like that. Or you're not a conservative.
*  It's an old, yeah, it's an old saying. If you're not a liberal as a youth,
*  you have no heart. If you're not a conservative as you're older, you have no brain.
*  And I'm not really either because, you know,
*  I'm not socially conservative at all.
*  Me neither.
*  I mean, that's where they, it's funny when people were like, Oh,
*  she's just a grifter.
*  She's gotten red pills and she's going to be on the right now.
*  And then the right will start talking about porn or something. I'm like,
*  Oh, thank God I'm not one of them.
*  Our sex or whatever weird shit.
*  Weird shit. Yeah. Or, you know, whether or not, I mean,
*  you know,
*  these ideas that you have to be one or the other is where it's so
*  stupid.
*  Yeah. You can hold both things.
*  That is what we should be doing.
*  We should be holding both things and evaluating them.
*  Yeah. Well, especially it's really difficult for me when,
*  when people want to restrict other people's ability to express themselves or
*  do things, whether it's, uh, you know,
*  gay rights or trans rights or civil rights or women's rights or any time you
*  want to stop people from doing something that literally has nothing to do with
*  you. Yeah. You know, like the gay rights one was the gay marriage one was always
*  weird to me. Like when I was seven years old, I was seven years old.
*  We moved to Florida and I had this can't this, uh, Cuban friend,
*  his name was candy candido. His last name was candido. And they called him candy.
*  I love that. And, uh, uh, his dad was so mad. He had a newspaper.
*  He's slamming it down on the fucking table. And, uh, we're like, what's the matter?
*  He's like, they're going to let these fags marry each other. Oh my gosh.
*  I was, how old was I? 11? Yeah,
*  I was 11 because I'd moved from San Francisco. So I was 11.
*  And I remember thinking, what a fucking idiot. This guy's a grown man. See,
*  I lived in San Francisco from seven to 11. So I was like,
*  I was right down the street from Lombard street. So we were around like my next
*  door neighbors, they would get naked. They were these gay guys.
*  They would get naked with my aunt and they would smoke pot and play the bongos.
*  That was my life when I was seven years old. So I was so used to gay people.
*  So normal for me that being around this guy when I was 11,
*  I was like, this is so weird. So weird. I moved from, from, uh,
*  San Francisco to Florida, Gainesville, Florida,
*  which was so dumb in an apartment complex.
*  So it was like people weren't doing so good and they were so dumb.
*  Yeah.
*  It was too hot. It was too hot to be smart.
*  There's something I think about Florida. It's like, God damn, it's so hot down there.
*  You can't be smart.
*  It's hard. It's hard, you know,
*  but I was just saying that like,
*  so I don't understand why people who are
*  conservative, like why, why if you're fiscally conservative,
*  that makes sense. If you're financially conservative,
*  if you believe in the second amendment, you have all these ideas about rights.
*  Like we have rights,
*  but why do you give a fuck if people get married? Like what?
*  I know Caitlyn Jenner when she transitioned was against gay marriage.
*  Oh, weird.
*  She's like, I've always been more of a traditional girl.
*  What?
*  She owns on the Ellen. Oh yeah. On the Ellen show.
*  Ellen confronted her about it.
*  Wow. And it was like, what?
*  What happened to all? What? That? What?
*  I don't understand. What?
*  Well, she's Republican. Right. Is she still? I don't know, but probably not.
*  Oh, but if you're rep, I think so maybe, but when you're Republican,
*  that's one of those things you're supposed to just subscribe to.
*  It seems like they've, they've accepted that that's not a battle they're winning.
*  Well, it's evolution of the culture. Like at a certain point in time,
*  like don't you know any gay people that are cool? Yeah.
*  Like do you really give a fuck if they get married? Yeah. Marriage is dumb.
*  Anybody dumb enough to get married should be allowed to give away after shit.
*  We were in Arizona and this guy was talking about his daughter and he,
*  and she is gay and divorced. And I was like, Oh,
*  I'm glad the gays know what divorce is all about now.
*  They're probably going to regret fighting for that marriage thing.
*  They're paying for half an alimony. They're like, Oh shit.
*  Melissa Etheridge is on the podcast years ago and she's been married and
*  divorced a couple of times. And she was telling me all these women,
*  she's got to pay alimony to, alimony to. I go,
*  what's that all about? She goes, bitches are crazy.
*  And I was like, Oh, you can say that.
*  A gay woman has been divorced. It's paying all these women alimony.
*  And especially like, it's not like she fucked them so hard.
*  They can never work again. Like, no,
*  you used to be in a relationship with a successful person. You're not anymore.
*  Time to get a job. No, they can't. They can't.
*  She licked their pussies so good. They're just confused.
*  They can't even fill out forms. They can't work anymore.
*  Whose stand up is that? I'm accustomed to this. I'm accustomed. I think it was.
*  I think it's Chris Rock. Yeah. He's like, you're getting accustomed to things.
*  I'm accustomed to getting my dick sucked. Yeah. Yeah. I need pussy payments.
*  That's what it was. Right? Yeah. Yeah. I think about that a lot. It is.
*  It's a, look, I think marriage is, is great.
*  If you love someone so much, you're willing to do something stupid. Yeah.
*  That's my situation. Yeah.
*  I just think it's, you know,
*  and it makes sense when you have family, it makes sense.
*  You have children because the way I felt like I felt like having a child is way
*  more of a commitment than anything financial. You really,
*  you're making a human being bring them in the world and you're responsible for
*  them for at least 18 years. At least now it's like 25. Dude,
*  I know people that are 40 that live with their parents right now. Yeah.
*  Especially during COVID. It's tough. Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's we've all become like European families. Yeah. Yeah. It's,
*  it's intergenerational. Well, you got to survive. Yeah.
*  The reality is like,
*  it's not a bad idea to pool all your resources together and try to survive
*  and help each other. Right. Yeah. Because we really are at a crossroads. Yeah.
*  Like when, when you realize it makes us realize how good we had it for so many
*  years when, you know, people, the, the economy was booming.
*  People could be independent and out there supporting themselves.
*  But then when all that shit is literally cut in half, like you gotta make do,
*  you gotta figure it out. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And I think it's better for people to be around other people. Yeah.
*  Because all my friends who have been isolated, you know, people,
*  it's way more open here. Oh yeah.
*  But my friends in LA are losing their minds who have been alone because it's been
*  going on like six months now. It is way more open here, isn't it? Yeah.
*  Way more open. That's why I love it. Yeah. It feels normal. Yeah, it does.
*  It just feel, you wear a mask, but yeah, you go to a restaurant. It's crazy.
*  Isn't it amazing? It's nice. It's nice.
*  It made me, it's been nice to just feel kind of what normal was.
*  Retail stores are open. You go to a retail store, put a mask on.
*  And LA definitely, I mean, it's when I was walking my dog in LA,
*  every single day I have to avoid a crazy, there was a guy with a machete.
*  There was, and then I walked out and then I was two days, every walk I go on,
*  there's basically like a crazy homeless, oh,
*  a young woman who's out alone and they're having some kind of breakdown.
*  And it gets worse and worse every day.
*  It's like it is deteriorating faster than I could have even imagined.
*  And it makes me mad because the government doesn't give a fuck about me.
*  They don't care about my safety.
*  I'm supposed to have endless compassion for the homeless.
*  And they don't care that there's a guy with a machete having a, having a moment.
*  It's not that they don't care. They can't do anything about it.
*  They can though.
*  Their only job is to keep somewhat keep me safe as a citizen.
*  That is what they, if that, why am I paying taxes if they can't do that?
*  This is why I'm like, fuck you, California, you're garbage.
*  You're paying taxes to keep these politicians fed.
*  Okay. But they need to make sure that I'm not getting attacked.
*  Well, I walk my dog.
*  But that's the problem with some, some places big as LA.
*  There's like a diffusion of responsibility thing that you get to when you get to
*  numbers that are so high, when you get to like 20 million people, you know,
*  what is it? There's like a expression about how, uh, not an expression,
*  but there's an example about how when people see someone getting attacked,
*  like if there's only one person there and someone's getting attacked,
*  you feel responsible to help. But if you're in a crowd,
*  yeah, everyone assumes someone else is going to jump in and nobody does
*  anything. And nobody feels responsible.
*  It's been notably worse. You know, there, there has to be something.
*  People are paying tons of money. I was in Venice.
*  I was in Brentwood.
*  They these people are paying millions of dollars in taxes and they have
*  encampments across the street from their house. They're kids playing.
*  It's not safe for it. You know, there, there, something has to, we were,
*  it's interesting too. I,
*  Jamie and I were talking about this because they, um, before just the way,
*  I don't even know if they know how many actual homeless people are there.
*  Cause I volunteered once to be part of the homeless count.
*  And that's how they count the homeless is volunteers who go through LA for like
*  one weekend and count as many homeless people as they can.
*  And you write down what streets you're on. Yeah.
*  And you like go in little groups and, um, I didn't, I never,
*  I was out of town that weekend.
*  Please don't do that. But I legitimately was out of town that weekend.
*  So I ended up not being able to do it, but I was like, Oh cool.
*  This is how they count the homeless,
*  but that doesn't seem like a very good measure of how many they're homeless
*  people. There are, I bet it's probably like twice as many as it actually
*  reports. How are you getting? Yeah, that's a lot of people.
*  70,000 they say now. They think New York city has 80,000. Wow.
*  They should be in LA. It's a way better place, better place to be homeless.
*  Yeah. LA is like tolerable. Well, because now they get under the underpass.
*  Yeah. But during COVID they've loosened all those restrictions.
*  So it used to be like, you couldn't block the sidewalk and you couldn't with
*  your, we saw somebody grilling a fricking, like,
*  it was a huge fire on a grill on the side of the road.
*  It was like a hibachi or some shit.
*  Like when just having a grill in the middle and there's women with their
*  strollers trying to walk, it's madness. I don't know. And I have,
*  that's the one, I feel like it's the one problem if I could solve,
*  I would focus on solving it because it's such a crossroads of economics,
*  mental illness, addiction. It's so many things that are abuse.
*  I was watching a video about this kid. He was 28. He's been homeless,
*  literally on the street since he was nine years old. His, uh, he was in a car,
*  uh, with his mom. They were living in a car until they were 11 and then from
*  11 on he was on the street. Yeah, it's, it was terrible. And he was talking about,
*  I mean, he, he had no teeth. Like his front teeth were gone.
*  He had his face reconstructed, his arms smashed.
*  Somebody beat him up with a bat. He, uh, you know, had been sexually abused.
*  He didn't have any socks. He didn't have any shoes. He didn't have anything.
*  He had, you know,
*  he talked about the small amount of clothes he had and it was kind of weird
*  cause he was, you know,
*  really for a person who has been homeless and on the street in this horrible
*  life since he was nine, kind of seemed pretty together.
*  Like the way he was talking and communicating, at least in this video. And, um,
*  you know, you realize this is the thing about people when,
*  when you, if you're mad at someone, say,
*  if you're mad at someone for their behavior, like, say, if you're,
*  if you're a gay person,
*  you're mad that Caitlyn Jenner doesn't believe in gay marriage,
*  even though she wanted to transition and wants you to call her a woman now,
*  instead of being mad. And I guess you could be mad at the idea,
*  but I think what we really need to start doing is look like, what,
*  what happened? How'd you get like, what all,
*  what are all the things that took place in your life that you,
*  that you turned into this right now? Like, what are those things? You know,
*  this is the concept of determinism, right?
*  This is the concept that there is no real free will.
*  Everyone is sort of an accumulation of all the experiences they've had,
*  their genetics, their life,
*  all the different factors that are out of their control,
*  along with the decisions that they've made because of these factors and all your
*  emotions and you, yeah,
*  genes and drug addiction and all these different things.
*  And it brings you to this point.
*  And I think this is the thing with homeless people that we need to take into
*  consideration as well, because when you see someone who's homeless, you know,
*  like, Oh, this fucking loser. Oh, they're a drug addict. Oh,
*  get them away from my house.
*  The amount of undoing you have to have to take a 40 year old person who's
*  grilling in front of a house in Venice with a heroin tracks all over their arm
*  and make them a reasonable contributor to society,
*  a healthy person who can, you know, kind of do anything. And I know,
*  I know there's so much on do. I have, I do have endless compassion,
*  but on the other hand, there's a lot of entitlement.
*  There's a lot of entitlement in the, in the homeless community. There is,
*  but they don't have anything. Like if you don't have anything and you look at
*  people who have things like this is one of the things you're seeing with a lot
*  of these riots, a lot of the looting and all the craziness.
*  It's like haves and have nots and the have nots like these motherfuckers,
*  why do they have this? Especially during COVID. Cause everybody has nothing.
*  Right. These homeless people don't have anything.
*  They feel entitled because they don't have anything and you do.
*  And there's a weird thing that people,
*  people have this thought that if you have something and they don't have it,
*  it's because there's an injustice and you have contributed to this injustice or
*  you've caused this injustice. That's where the entitlement comes.
*  And this is a, it's a real problem in the way Americans in particularly think
*  about in particular, think about economics.
*  Yeah. It's resentment politics. It's all resentment.
*  And you can get a lot of people to agree with you.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Cause most people, most people also don't have good things.
*  Like I was reading this tweet from this girl was talking about, um, you know,
*  like we, we need to start going into the suburbs and going into these people's
*  houses. And then she wrote eat the rich.
*  Yeah. That's a big thing right now.
*  And I was like, what are you talking about? So you're 24. Okay.
*  What do you think is going to happen when you're 44 and you're one of those
*  people? You're going to be happy with that.
*  You're going to be happy when you're tired because you've been working all day,
*  trying to achieve a dream and you're exhausted.
*  And you see these people outside your house. How the fuck do you have this house?
*  How are you in that house? All comfortable as fuck. Well we're out here.
*  You know, I'm sure you've seen some of those people too.
*  There was one video from, I think Kenosha and this guy,
*  I'm not sure if that's when it was from, but it just stuck with me.
*  He was like yelling at the, they had smashed his windows and he was like,
*  I have fucking mouths to feed. He's like, do you want everybody to vote for Trump?
*  I have fucking mouths to feed. What are you doing? And like they'd smashed his,
*  where, you know, people, they don't know what they're doing.
*  And so many, so many of the kids on the streets are truly kids, like 17 children.
*  Where are your parents? We have a fucking parenting problem.
*  The kid in the Kenosha that went up killing those people.
*  Are they all on Instagram?
*  The parents are. They're like, yeah honey, go have fun. This motherfucker,
*  he's not liking my shit.
*  Resentment, resentment, resentment.
*  Yeah. We, you know,
*  we have a lot of problems and there's a lot of us and uh,
*  we could all like,
*  we could all do with some house cleaning.
*  And compassion.
*  Yeah.
*  I think compassion for each other.
*  Clean up your own backyard, get your life together, do your best.
*  Nobody wants to do that shit. They want to blame everyone.
*  Nobody wants to clean the shit in their front yard and not do drugs that are,
*  you know, they're spending all their money on.
*  They want to go out and be like, the libs are ruining my life.
*  Or like burn down a fucking building.
*  And it's weird how there's certain environments that just tolerate like
*  homelessness and craziness.
*  And then those folks find those environments like Venice.
*  Like Venice is just a, it's a breeding ground for it. It's crazy.
*  There's just so much. It's such a, that it is really just so complex.
*  I don't even know how you beat it, but I don't,
*  I do wonder why some obviously some cities are doing
*  things that where it isn't festering and exploding
*  and some cities are. So why don't, what are,
*  what are the cities that have it somewhat under control?
*  What are they? That's the problem. Busting them to LA.
*  Yeah. Law and order people like, like Giuliani was when, you know,
*  he was the law and order guy.
*  It's a good question. I don't know. I don't know what they do with them.
*  I don't know how they help them. I don't know what they do.
*  There was an Upper West side thing recently where they had a hotel and they had
*  like 300 homeless guys living in this hotel,
*  but then they started like jerking off in front of people and, you know,
*  taking shits on people's cars and stuff.
*  De Blasio had to move them out and now people are pissed off at him for taking
*  these people out. And what, you know, was really, it was mostly men,
*  mostly homeless men. And what was really crazy was this article that was written
*  about it was so distorted.
*  It was like homeless families are being relocated when their
*  kids are just now going to school. Like first of all, yes, literally,
*  this is pulling at the heartstrings.
*  There's been a bunch of things they're doing lately to pull at the heart.
*  But this was one of the most preposterous articles that I read.
*  One of them was they're calling,
*  they're now calling homeless people the unhoused.
*  No, it's persons experiencing houselessness.
*  We're going to get canceled for calling them homeless.
*  No, the unhoused.
*  No, it's persons experiencing houseless.
*  Oh, it's upgraded.
*  Unhoused, the unhoused.
*  This was an article about people that were putting rocks under the underpasses
*  that when homeless people had moved out of certain areas,
*  they were going under these underpasses and putting these enormous rocks so that
*  people couldn't put tents in. And they were saying,
*  do you understand what you're doing to the unhoused?
*  These are the only places they can go to escape the elements.
*  The reason why they go under that underpass,
*  it's literally the difference between life and death.
*  There is that. That's also somewhat of a myth because there is this,
*  there are beds sometimes that go empty because people don't want to give up
*  their drugs and weapons. So the idea that like, oh,
*  they don't have anywhere else to go isn't always true.
*  Well, they're drug addicts, Bridget.
*  You need to take a little bit more compassion when you're making these
*  statements because these people that are drug addicts,
*  they don't know what to do. They need their drugs.
*  You should let them just do their drugs.
*  Does it feel like we're on the backside of the empire?
*  Yeah. Yeah. It feels like Rome right before it collapses. Yeah. I mean, um,
*  one of the things that Douglas Murray said, uh, when I interviewed him,
*  I guess I don't interview anybody, right? I talk to people.
*  I sure remember that.
*  When I was talking to Doug, he was saying that at the end of every empire,
*  there's all these gender issues or hermaphrodites. Yeah. Yeah.
*  He went into depth about it. It's like Rome and Greece.
*  They always had this thing where like they want to break down all the,
*  there is no gender, there's no sex, there's no biology. Deconstruct everything.
*  And they also, they deconstruct all the norms, all the norms of culture.
*  And one of the more disconcerting ones is deconstructing pedophilia.
*  That has been a constant one lately where you're seeing, uh,
*  there's a weird pedo vibe everywhere. Well, you know, that thing, the gavit,
*  Oh, cuties is crazy. Okay. Yeah. That's about talking about the,
*  the Gavin Newsom thing where they passed that. Did that pass? Yes, it passed.
*  He passed. He signed it. And they said it was a great victory for LGBTQ people.
*  What? Because before it was defined, this is how, this is,
*  this is the idea. I might be butchering it, but I'm going to do my best.
*  Before,
*  if you had vaginal sex with a girl and impregnated her and say,
*  like maybe you were 20 and she was 14,
*  they didn't put you in a sex register list because they wanted you to be
*  responsible for taking care of the baby that you created. So this was the idea.
*  But if you had anal or oral sex with her,
*  then they would put you on the sex offender list. Yeah. Well,
*  it's because you're just being a pervert, right?
*  You're just mouth fucking some 14 year old as opposed to making a baby that you
*  would then be responsible for. So, okay, but this is why they,
*  they wanted to pass this law. And this is why it would for LBGTQ folks,
*  whatever, gay people, whatever, is they wanted the, they said, well,
*  the vagina is not available to gay folks.
*  Cause these guys don't have a vagina.
*  So if you're saying that a 20 year old can have sex with a 14 year old girl and
*  not be put on a sex registered registry,
*  how come a 20 year old man can have sex with a 14 year old boy and he is all
*  of a sudden a sex crime. He's committed a sex crime. And they're like,
*  this is not fair.
*  So the idea is that it's in the judgment.
*  The judge gets to decide. Okay.
*  So I guess you're giving the judge the ability to decide one way or another.
*  So you give them the ability to discern whether or not this was someone who's in
*  an actual relationship with a person who can commit, which is very weird.
*  Right. Right. A certain person who can consent. So,
*  but the problem with people have the, they gave a 10 year gap. So, you know,
*  like, oh, like 14, 24, or you could say 10 and 20.
*  Like I don't know what it means or where it's where it's defined. Yeah,
*  that's weird. It's crazy,
*  but they're only doing it because it already existed in that form for straight
*  people. Right. Okay. It's not like this. See, like we're looking at it,
*  like saying, Oh, now you're making it legal for 24 year olds to fuck 14 year
*  olds. That's not, it's already kind of like that with straight people.
*  They have vaginal sex. Right. Wow. That's wild. It's wild.
*  I didn't even know that that was not, you know, I don't know. That's,
*  I thought it was like statutory. I think even, but I think if you impregnate,
*  I think this is the idea. If the person's impregnated,
*  the judge has the ability to not put them on the sex offender list so that that
*  person can get a job. Right. So you could support your child. Right. Right.
*  Because especially in impoverished areas, right? Right. That's yeah.
*  The whole, it seems like it's everywhere. The cuties thing.
*  That's more complicated than cuties. Cuties is here's, here's something crazy.
*  There was a story in Atlanta where these, uh,
*  these guys had rescued 39 kids from sex slavery. I didn't hear a fucking word.
*  No, nobody heard about this. I saw a hundred articles about Ellen being mean.
*  Yeah. Yeah. A hundred. Yeah.
*  And I didn't see more than one,
*  one day in and out of the news about these 39 kids that were rescued.
*  Yeah. That's another one. Um, that is really, I was in a rest stop.
*  It was like a truck stop on the way here and they had the signs, you know,
*  it's like, are you being human trafficked?
*  And they're in rest stops across America and it's like,
*  are you working against your will? Are you being forced to do sex? I was like,
*  shouldn't this be in like three other languages?
*  Not just English.
*  About a flight attendant and there was a man on a flight with a young girl and
*  the young girl wrote a letter and left it in the bathroom and the flight
*  attendant got the letter and recognized that something was going,
*  she was making eye contact with the kid. She knew something was wrong.
*  And then upon landing, they had police waiting.
*  Oh wow. Yeah. Yeah. So it's, I mean, that's another one where it's real.
*  Yeah. It's a real problem. Human trafficking and sex trafficking is terrifying.
*  And crazy and hideous and odious and all of the worst things in the world.
*  And but then you have cuties, which is like, what are you doing?
*  What are they doing? I know I've seen the arguments that explain to people that
*  don't know what the fuck cuties is. So cuties is that it's a movie on Netflix.
*  It's a foreign film. I believe the director is French.
*  Is she French?
*  Oh, that's all right. I just don't know that I'm correct about that.
*  And it's,
*  it's supposed to be a movie about the ex sexual hypersexualization and
*  exploitation of young, young girls.
*  Critics of cuties say the Netflix film hypersexualizes a preteen dance troupe,
*  but director said Monday that she is fighting the same fight in quotes.
*  They are to stop the exploitation of young girls.
*  So the way she stops it is by sexualizing them.
*  Well, I guess that, you know,
*  try saying her name. Say that name.
*  My, my Mona do Corre.
*  Quick question. Yes. Do you remember the movie kids? I do. Yeah.
*  That was a pretty fucked up movie. That was about kids being wild.
*  And it was, it was an actual movie about real kids. Yeah. But he's fucked up.
*  That direct. Yeah. That director's really fucked up.
*  There's another movie called like 13 about two 13 year old girls a couple of years
*  ago and they're like taking ecstasy and they're also,
*  but the thing about kids is kids was a documentary. No, those are all actors.
*  Those are all actors. Wait, am I thinking of the same movie?
*  Yeah. And one in it and like, yeah.
*  But wasn't there one that was a documentary?
*  It was filmed a little bit like a documentary, but it wasn't. Oh,
*  oh, that's right.
*  That movie starts with sex right out of the opening.
*  What year is that? I got, I rented it from the library,
*  the library when I was in like seventh grade, sixth grade. Yeah.
*  I was young too. Okay. I fucked up.
*  I thought that was a documentary. That guy. Yeah.
*  But it got a lot of shit when it came out, didn't it? I feel like it was.
*  I think it was, I think I never saw it and I think it was out pre internet.
*  I think, Oh, definitely. Probably 94, 95. Yeah. It was fucked up.
*  It was a fun hit. The director has done a lot of sketchy shit, right?
*  What other movies has he done?
*  Gummo was the other big one. Oh, that was a weird one. 95. Yeah.
*  I made 20 million bucks.
*  Yeah. But I wonder what the, I remember,
*  I feel like that was pretty controversial.
*  Do you remember the movie? Was it called happy? Is that it?
*  There was a really fucking weird movie about this kid who finds out that their
*  dad is a pedophile. Oh God, that would be horrible. The guy is,
*  I think it's happiness and the, the, the guy is kind of normal.
*  Normalized in the movie. And it's like, the kid is trying to.
*  My friends and I got into this on Twitter about the cuties thing and, and you know,
*  I, I don't know that those girls are old enough to decide to do that
*  film. You know, so it's that,
*  some of the warnings on it and stuff, like I don't even want to watch it.
*  It just seems, it seems I probably should and just,
*  but I don't really want to for other, just whatever. It just seems.
*  But my, you know, I don't think it's necessarily like Netflix's
*  problem. It seems more like a societal problem that we have.
*  Wait a minute. It's Netflix's problem to have it on their network.
*  They have it on their network, but it's, it's the, it's like this writer,
*  Jane Costin said, it's like the thing adjacent. She was like,
*  has anyone been to a dance recital? Cause I was talking about like, uh,
*  have you ever been to dance recitals?
*  Like we had to do some fucked up shit when we were young kids,
*  like dress up and do the in the black and do the, my,
*  the addicted to love and like leotards and red lipstick.
*  And I was little doing these dances and John Benet, that's it.
*  That's a whole fucking weird world.
*  Joey Diaz and I were in Dallas once and we were staying at this hotel.
*  We were doing the Addison improv.
*  We were staying at this hotel where they had one of those things going on in the
*  hotel. So there was a child beauty pageant.
*  It was fucking bizarre.
*  It's one thing to see it on TV,
*  but to see five year olds in pumps with full makeup and blown out hair.
*  Remember this from Bad Grandpa with the giant Knoxville movie a couple of years
*  ago, they like, he had picked up his grandson and I mean, it was fake,
*  but they were also pranking people. So like, it's not really fake.
*  Right.
*  He dressed up like a little girl and they went and did this whole thing at the,
*  and she starts doing that crazy dance and freaking everybody out.
*  Yeah, this is a boy. I fire member.
*  I mean, that's right.
*  This stuff is in our culture already. That's,
*  and I think that's more cuties aside and whatever.
*  But that, that kind of shit with little kids and those baby beauty pageants,
*  it's like that. Whoever greenlit that who's like, yeah, it looks good.
*  Short skirt, stick your ass out. Nice high heels.
*  Yeah, it's weird. Who said yes to that?
*  So that's, that's my, I guess my point is not necessarily,
*  my feelings about cutie are just from what I've seen. I'm like, no,
*  but I also think that this is in our culture and we need to examine that,
*  that, that this like the beauty pageants and the, you know,
*  and it's funny because I'll be like, oh, QAnon is crazy.
*  And not everything is about pedophilia. And then you see a cuties, you know,
*  preview and you're like, oh, maybe there are tunnels under.
*  What, what is it? My friend said, she's like,
*  my brother said there are tunnels,
*  there are tunnels under the Getty or some shit for human trafficking.
*  I don't think that's true, but, but there was a fuck Island. Yeah.
*  That was real. Yeah. And the fact that prominent politicians, well,
*  we went 26 times. Not a lot of times. Wow. You do a really great impression.
*  There's another fuck Island, North Fox Island. Oh, I was never there.
*  Michigan in the seventies. Oh, really? Well, there was a darker, way darker story.
*  Oh God. Oh, he darker. Oh yeah. How can it get darker than Epstein?
*  I had to like, there's all videotaped and that's what I mean,
*  that's what I was. Have you seen the documentary?
*  Well, when Epstein killed himself case closed, I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
*  wow, you really do a great social impression. I was watching the documentary.
*  You had a nice play.
*  You know, the fucked up realization I had watching that documentary is that I
*  would have been one of Epstein's girls. Right.
*  I was a fucked up 17 year old doing drugs. What does it say, Jimmy?
*  Jeffrey Epstein was accused of self trafficking,
*  young girls on his mysterious private Island over 40 years ago,
*  a different millionaire escaped justice in a stunningly similar case. I, you know,
*  I had a conversation with Eric Weinstein about this and he, he had a very,
*  I think accurate perception of it. He said,
*  I believe there are people who help curate experiences
*  for high profile people who can't get these on their own.
*  Cause it's too dangerous.
*  And then someone comes along and normalizes it and lets you know, it's okay.
*  I gotcha. And everything's fine. This is how we do it.
*  And that this person in Epstein's case turns out to be intelligence.
*  You know, that was the, uh, that, that was the, um,
*  accusation that who was the prosecutor that had to release him. He was told,
*  what's his name? Acosta. It was told, uh,
*  it was above his pay grade and that this man was intelligence. And so he had,
*  he had to let him go because he was a part of the intelligence community.
*  So someone told him to let this guy go.
*  Yeah. And so when, when he got arrested the first time,
*  he got like a ridiculous sentence where he's allowed to go back to his house.
*  He only had to be in jail during the day.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Or he had to be in jail at night and then had to be at his house during the day
*  cause he was working.
*  Remember this too, like this came out two years ago.
*  That's right. Sasha Baron Cohen says he turned over disturbing,
*  who is America footage to the FBI.
*  Cohen says his show nearly helped the FBI expose a pedophile ring in Las Vegas.
*  They're doing what you're talking about. Yeah.
*  Someone was saying, look, we can, we can help you. We can get you these things.
*  And this is what's terrifying. What's terrifying is that if, if,
*  if there can be an island that is literally curated and run by an
*  intelligence agent who's bringing in prominent celebrities and politicians and
*  even scientists from all over the world to this place where they're having sex
*  with underage girls and we all know about it. And then the guy gets killed.
*  And then, oh, he just, uh, hung himself. Oh, he hung himself.
*  And then you get a Michael Baden who's a famous autopsy doctor says, no,
*  these, these injuries are inconsistent with hanging and they're very consistent
*  with someone being strangled in the position that he's, these choked down.
*  It's not where someone has ligature marks if they, yeah, all,
*  all the things that point to the fact that he was murdered and months later,
*  like, anyway, whatever. Hey,
*  24 hour news. Donald Trump's a bad person. We need to get rid of him.
*  He's moving. And meanwhile, Galeen, she doesn't go to,
*  she doesn't even go to trial until October. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Is she even arrested? Where is she at? Yeah. Where is that lady?
*  Is this the story that went away?
*  No, it's so, it's so weird how it just all gets like house in New Hampshire
*  waiting magically disappears by herself chopping wood,
*  just waiting. Like, what are you doing?
*  Like they arrested her in a house in New Hampshire. She bought a house,
*  like in the woods. She thought she could just be out there.
*  Didn't even change her hairstyle. Oh wow. How about when she was on,
*  they took pictures of her at in and out reading a book about CIA agents who've
*  been killed. Oh my God. Remember that? You ever seen that? She had a photo shoot.
*  Oh my God. In and out in LA. Yeah.
*  There was a photo shoot where she was still on the loose after Jeffrey Epstein
*  was killed, where she was like sending messages to people.
*  So here she is like clearly posing and the book powerful in and out commercial
*  by the way, made people hungry. Yeah,
*  it was posed so you could see the book and the book was about CIA agents who've
*  been killed. Where does there,
*  you could see like the book spine on one of those pictures. Yeah.
*  One of the pictures there's many pictures.
*  Yeah. Yeah. They did a lot of sleuthing to figure out like there's terrible
*  photo shopping done on the photo. Wow. Is there? Yeah.
*  So this photo was taken at a time that like there's this, uh,
*  this good boys movie was a Seth Rogen movie. Right.
*  If she was there, that would have been like this week.
*  And they looked in that company said they never actually had that poster there,
*  but that looks like it was actually there. So,
*  there's a lot of confusion around why this even happened. Wow. So where's,
*  what is that in the lower right hand corner?
*  Is that showing what the book is where the arrows are pointing?
*  That's showing where she said someone went to that in and out.
*  Oh, that's where she sat. Where's the book? I'm trying to find it.
*  It's so messed up. I, so crazy. I mean, I was,
*  I had to stop watching the documentary cause it's so it's,
*  it's as dark as it gets.
*  How about when Trump, when they asked Trump about it, he's like, I wish her well,
*  I wish her good luck. Is it very unfortunate?
*  What are you talking about? Are you saying you, you wish the,
*  the lady who's accused of sex trafficking, underage girls, you wish her luck.
*  All these guys are, all of them,
*  that like level of being is so gross.
*  I feel like everyone in that fucking circle is disgusting.
*  I think back then you could be disgusting and there wasn't any consequences for
*  it. You know, and you,
*  when you think of what it must've been like to be a politician,
*  like in the Kennedy days, right?
*  I just open lane.
*  No cars on the road.
*  Nobody does anything. Nobody tells you to stop.
*  Nope. You could do whatever you wanted.
*  Getting your dick sucked in the, in the pool.
*  Yeah. You could do that while people were watching. Like no one cared.
*  Yeah. Now it's,
*  crazy. Like the press would not talk about his affairs that they all knew.
*  Yeah. It was like a, how amazing. Yeah.
*  What a strange shifting of attitudes.
*  And how did that ever exist in the first place?
*  If you're the press and literally your whole job is to tell stories and you've
*  got this crazy story that you keep it under wraps.
*  I see it all the time though. I see it all the time.
*  But the Kennedy thing wasn't even a good cover.
*  Remember when Marilyn Monroe sang at his birthday party?
*  Yeah. But every time someone gets me toot, everyone's like,
*  we knew about it and whatever.
*  And I don't know if it's just industries protect their own or if they're like,
*  everyone in the industry is like, ah, I kind of knew that was coming. You know,
*  you'll hear like these stories of, of, of, uh,
*  I just feel like it might be like politicians. They protect each other.
*  I feel like in every industry, whenever somebody gets outed, there's,
*  there's, um, some sense of like, ah, maybe, maybe,
*  maybe.
*  Well, when the Kennedy thing was, uh, was happening,
*  what's really fascinating is if you apply that same logic and thought to his
*  assassination, no wonder why there's so many conspiracy theories.
*  Because if,
*  if the intelligence community really decided to whack him and you don't think
*  they could have got away with it, he's fucking people left and right.
*  And he got away with that. Yeah. Documented. That's the problem I have.
*  Not just him. A lot of people back then, MLK, there was a whole, uh,
*  thing written about him the other day.
*  But this,
*  this idea that they could have never gotten away with his murder because people
*  would have talked like, no, people didn't talk about anything.
*  Of course they could have got away with his murder.
*  And especially if they, you think they're going to kill you.
*  And then if you go and look at how many people who are witnesses who did wind up
*  dying in really suspicious ways, it's fucking bonkers.
*  People that were there for the Kennedy assassination that wound up dying.
*  It's nuts. It's nuts. How many of them like committed suicide,
*  parked their car in front of a train, like all that kind of shit.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that there's, the whole world was dark back then.
*  It was dark. I think it's always been dark. Yeah. But I mean,
*  I think like this whole sex trafficking thing,
*  this seedy underbelly of the world thing, I think back then it was way worse.
*  And I think there's no way of exposing it. Well, yeah, they all just got whacked.
*  I think. Yeah. And I think it was like a normal, it was probably like,
*  when you think of things like skull and bones and all these weird little
*  like clubs and these secret societies.
*  Remember when Kennedy, did you ever hear that Kennedy speech about secret
*  societies? No.
*  Oh my God. He talked about how secret societies are repugnant.
*  And this is before he was murdered. You know,
*  Kennedy was like vehemently against like the CIA and the NSA and all this.
*  And he made this public speech about secret societies.
*  What does this say? The president and the press address for the American newspaper.
*  You can play that.
*  See if you can play it because it's really powerful to hear his voice and to
*  know that this guy. Yes. Well, listen,
*  there's a lot of reasons to think that he was probably killed by the
*  intelligence community. Oh, that's us.
*  It's already up. You can go watch episode 1400 with Tony Hinchcliffe.
*  I had the golden pony. It's a, it's a, here, listen to that though.
*  It's very bizarre.
*  It's a very bizarre statement because why would you think about today?
*  Well, ladies and gentlemen,
*  the very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society.
*  And we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies,
*  to secret oaths and to secret proceedings.
*  We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment
*  of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it.
*  Even today,
*  there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its
*  arbitrary restrictions. Even today,
*  there is little value in ensuring the survival of our nation.
*  If our traditions do not survive with it.
*  Wow.
*  And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security
*  will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of
*  official censorship and concealment.
*  Dude, he's trying to warn us. He's trying to warn us about exactly what's happening.
*  Patriot act to try to Edward Stodden in Russia. He really was.
*  Yeah, he really was. We didn't listen. They killed him.
*  They blacked that dude. We did listen. We listened.
*  We know now to shut our fucking mouth.
*  We're both going to be dead in 24 hours.
*  Get away with more shit back then just like everybody else.
*  Yeah. I mean, it's a, it's a weird time because some, some of this stuff,
*  you know, I have very conflicting feelings about some of the stuff that comes out.
*  I think it's good that a lot of lights being shined on it.
*  I also hate that people don't get due process. So there's like a very strange,
*  we live in a very strange time for this where great more stuff is being revealed.
*  Although we seem to forget the stuff that's actually proven like Epstein in five
*  minutes. And then there's stuff that's not, you know,
*  people are being destroyed and have no,
*  no access to due process or anything. And even,
*  and there's no way to defend themselves.
*  Well, the stunning thing about the Epstein thing is that the mainstream media has
*  let it go.
*  Yeah, completely. You would think that, and they barely even really covered it.
*  It wasn't even something that I had to,
*  it's almost like they covered it. Like there was a cursory mention.
*  Like they had to, they had to mention it. Otherwise they'd be complicit.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's a, it's a weird,
*  that seems like it should be a way bigger deal and be much more covered and
*  investigated.
*  And thank God for those amazing reporters down in Florida who did all that
*  investigative journalism. The woman, I can't remember her name,
*  but she, she's really responsible for like staying on that beat.
*  And I just, I,
*  I think this is why I feel even in LA during the riots,
*  like the local journalism was amazing. They were doing great work.
*  They were on the ground. They were interviewing people in real time.
*  And part of the reason I see so,
*  I hate all the division and all of the,
*  it's like that death of local journalism,
*  which has contributed to so much of just nobody really knows anything.
*  Well, that's,
*  I've been real forgiving of people writing clickbaity articles.
*  And one of the reason why I tell people like journalists are fighting for their
*  life right now. They're very important to me.
*  It's very important to me that there's people that are willing to get the word
*  out and willing to explain what's happening.
*  And some of them are forced to write some bullshit articles with click baity
*  titles because they have to stay alive because no one is buying newspapers.
*  No. And it's, it's not generally,
*  it's usually a calling. I think my true journalists,
*  they're usually called to do it. They can't let go of a story.
*  They want to find my biggest, again, this is another weird issue,
*  place where we're in is I call it journalism and it's activism masking is
*  journalism. And I,
*  and that is where I feel like the press is this is where they're losing their
*  credibility because they're not being honest.
*  There's no one, well, there are some,
*  but there's very few who are unbiased.
*  Well they are,
*  they're mostly working in local journalism at rags that are being canceled,
*  bought out, bought up by bigger things.
*  And so you have the people who are kind of activists and they're journalists or
*  practicing journalism and that's damaging to all journalists because now you're
*  undermining what your job is to do,
*  which is present facts and present evidence and present and chase down leads
*  and not have your own opinion about things.
*  Have, you know,
*  discover something as more evidence is presented to you and always be checking
*  yourself.
*  Well, my hope is that through this independent sources will emerge.
*  Like you're seeing that with some independent political sources,
*  like you're seeing like whether it's the Jimmy Dore show or Kyle Kulinski or
*  rising on the Hill,
*  all these people that are not beholden to any one party that are talking about
*  politics. I'm hoping we're going to see that with everything and that these,
*  these people with these bias perceptions and you know,
*  journalism as you call it,
*  which is a great word that they they're going to because of their own faults,
*  open the door for independent people that are not connected with these things
*  that do have a calling,
*  but that recognize that there's a real,
*  you're hindered if you're connected to some machine.
*  I think this is why people are so confused right now and lost.
*  And I hear this from these letters I'm getting to letters from the politically
*  homeless and they're saying what happens a lot is they'll get red-pilled by the
*  mainstream media. They recognize kind of,
*  I think Malice talks a lot about this and just recognizing the idea of the
*  cathedral. Yeah, he's great. I'm a brilliant.
*  And just the idea of the cathedral that isn't his idea.
*  And I can't remember who he always attributes it to and realizing there's a
*  narrative and there's an agenda that's being pushed.
*  And once they open their eyes and see that they'll it's,
*  there's not much of a stop on the way to,
*  and now why isn't Biden fighting against Petalwood? You know,
*  there's like, you're just like, suddenly you're like mainlining.
*  You've gone from taking a red pill to like snorting them and mainlining it.
*  And now you're queuing on because I'll hear these people who are start out very
*  reasonable, like, Oh, the left got crazy. I got a little disillusioned.
*  I started going down the rabbit hole and then there's really not much because
*  they don't, people don't know what to believe all of the confusion. Oh,
*  you can protest. You can't protest. You can wear a mask. You can't wear a mask.
*  There's no credibility. Every system.
*  And this is generally in societies when you see this kind of breakdown of society
*  is when people lose faith in the people who are governing them,
*  the experts, you know, you have epidemiologists who are like,
*  racism is the real virus. Like that's not the way viruses work.
*  You know, when you're, when you're saying these things to, as a scientist,
*  how are you expecting people to take you seriously when they've stopped their
*  fucking lives for you?
*  Did you see what the UN's quote was about the pandemic that it revealed that the
*  patriarchy is a gigantic problem? Yeah.
*  And then you were blaming it on the patriarchy.
*  And you have all of these,
*  these institutions that are falling in line with this. So people are,
*  they're stumbling in the wilderness and then they're online and then they're
*  virtue signaling and then they're, they're in these echo chambers.
*  And then they're going to war with anybody who disagrees. And then they're,
*  they're demanding compliance.
*  But it's easy for it to people. The thing that concerns me is if you are a person,
*  you know, I have to check in with myself when I'm like,
*  if I feel like I'm saying fuck you, I'm voting for Trump. Like that is,
*  that is being radicalized. You know, I,
*  that is the process of radicalization happening. I understand it. It's,
*  it's something that I can, but it's completely emotional. If you're like,
*  for some people it's not. Some people think that it's more dangerous than
*  anything is woke politics. That's Tim Poole.
*  Tim Poole is like, the media is lying to us that they're,
*  they're gaslighting us.
*  And I think that this whole woke bullshit is more dangerous than anything.
*  And he's gone like full MAGA. I'm like, wow.
*  But see that,
*  that is something that I would check in with myself about,
*  because if you were here and now you're here,
*  I understand.
*  And I think this is why we live in one of the most interesting times in American
*  history ever, because there's so much migration, literal migration,
*  you sitting here is a perfect example of that. And political migration,
*  ideological migration. My inbox is evidence of this.
*  People from the center going left to right, people from the right, coming left,
*  people from the left, coming right. It's fast. I mean,
*  it's going to be studied for hundreds of years. If we have a future,
*  you're totally right. You're totally right.
*  It's just a fascinating time in our, in our history.
*  And I think that people,
*  we have to give each other space to re realign a little bit.
*  But what is worrisome to me is in the absence of anyone to trust.
*  So journalism journal, many journalists have abdicated their role.
*  Many politicians are, well, they're all just shit basically.
*  Sending a populist message to the people. Like,
*  I don't understand the worship at all. In the absence of all of this,
*  where do people turn? You know,
*  they're turning to people like you for instance,
*  because you're willing to have conversations with many different kinds of people
*  across the spectrum. So they can maybe, you know,
*  in order to read the news now, I'll see a headline. If it confirms my bias,
*  I'm like, I better double check that. You know, I immediately, I'm like, okay,
*  double check that. That's cause you're smart.
*  But this is how everyone should consume the news.
*  But I understand why they don't because it's like, okay. And then I read a quote.
*  Well, that was, now I have to go listen to the whole, okay,
*  that was completely taken out of context. Now they're citing a study.
*  Now I have to go read the study. I have, I end up with all this,
*  go to all the source material. You have to just go to the source material always.
*  But that takes,
*  it'll take me an hour to read one article and figure out like what's actually
*  true in that article. No one has that time.
*  It's easier to be like, I hate this. Exactly. Mad. Yeah. That's,
*  that's what most people do. They find something that confirms their bias.
*  And then they read only those things that,
*  that exists in their little echo chamber.
*  But you should be seeking things that, you know, push against your bias.
*  I was having a conversation with a person, a person, a friend of mine, a person,
*  a friend of mine who happens to be a person.
*  The unhoused.
*  And she was asking me about UFOs.
*  And I said, my main problem with UFOs is that I want to believe.
*  Yeah. My main problem with all this evidence, like it seems real,
*  it seems real, it seems real. But the problem is I want to believe.
*  And whenever I want something to be real, I go, Ooh,
*  probably double check that. Yeah. You have to mind. Fuck yourself. Yeah.
*  That's the right way to,
*  that's how you can avoid making an ass out of yourself online and sharing
*  something that's not real. Like pretty much video. I will not share it.
*  I see so much video getting shared by people who are independent journalists that
*  is cut weird. It's edited weird. It's not true. You end up.
*  And there are, you know, people, everybody on the internet,
*  I always make fun of this on dumpster fire. I'm like, everyone's,
*  I hate this new season of law and order where there's a murder every day in real
*  time. And then the internet is like a sleuth figuring it out.
*  They're like breaking it down frame by frame. See this, like, thanks guys.
*  Like the police on the ground. I am detectives probably have this handled.
*  Thank you for your.
*  Well, sometimes though they do find people like that guy before he did the
*  interview with vice and exposed that he's the one who killed the Magus
*  supporter. Yeah, they found him.
*  They found him because of a tattoo on his neck and they had identified him.
*  People just randos that were like looking at photos sleuthen.
*  They actually found them.
*  I believe that there's some use in that,
*  but it just seems like there's also probably more misinformation that gets
*  spread that way than actual facts.
*  And it's that old quote, like the lie spreads faster than the truth,
*  you know, 10 around the world before the truth gets out of bed or whatever.
*  The lie, a lie will go around the world before the truth gets out of bed.
*  That's true. And in this kind of environment, and then everybody's.
*  I'll, you know, I got Russian troll farms and Chinese.
*  Russian login in at nine a.m. Oh my God. It's madness. I love it.
*  And I don't know where it, where it ends.
*  There's no map of the territory at this point, but it starts with us.
*  That's what I'm saying. It starts with the individual.
*  It starts with people recognizing that they're biased,
*  learning to consume news in a more intelligent way. That's reasonable.
*  Checking fact checking things.
*  And it starts even before that with improving yourself,
*  getting control over who you are.
*  Like think of what you've done overcoming hypochondria,
*  kicking drugs and alcohol, all the craziness that you've gotten through.
*  That's what's led you to be this critical thinker that you are today.
*  And this strong person.
*  The problem is we're asking people to be strong when they're not.
*  We're asking people who are there right now,
*  who they are is not capable of doing these things.
*  We're asking them to do why because of all the experiences they've had in their
*  life. That's no excuse. No, no, no. It's, it is not an excuse, but it is a fact.
*  Like who they are is they're,
*  they're so accustomed to behaving and thinking in a certain way that takes a
*  radical shift to rethink this. And they can, they can do that.
*  They can act in that way and rethink the way they live their life,
*  but they have to be severely motivated to change is so hard.
*  Well, and then there's so much, you know, so say you are,
*  so you radically shift your ideology online. And I've,
*  I've experienced this just not in shifting my ideology,
*  just not censoring. Then you get swept up with all the likes from you get,
*  it's reinforced with dopamine of like, Oh, if I say this thing,
*  this thing does well. And that's again,
*  asking a lot for people to work against. You have to actively be like, okay,
*  now what am I not saying again?
*  Because I'm worried I might piss off my new audience who's embraced me. You know,
*  I would ask anybody who's gone from the left to fully to the right, like,
*  what are you not saying now about things that you're noticing on your new team
*  that you've joined?
*  Weird thing when people do completely as a grown adult shift their ideology.
*  I'm always like, Oh, did you, Oh, did you,
*  or were you always wishy washy where you're always full of shit, you know,
*  and to be rigid one way or the other is just so strange. It's so strange.
*  Yeah. I guess I, I,
*  I can attribute my shift to paying attention and being thrown into the culture
*  war.
*  And I don't even feel like my actual values have changed so much as the culture
*  has changed around me.
*  Most of what I believe about free speech, you know, rights,
*  the right to have jobs and work how you want to,
*  which I push back against all the time in California, what they're doing there.
*  Well, they had, you know, they fight that gig society.
*  I told you about it. The last time I was here,
*  they had a fight with it about standup comics.
*  They were going to try and include standup comics.
*  The comedy store actually was at the head of that. Yeah. Yeah.
*  They actually fought and won and got comics reclassified.
*  But there was an issue where certain people were not going to get booked because
*  these arenas, these venues rather, we're going to have to employ them.
*  And they're like, we can't afford to give you health insurance.
*  You do a fucking stupid one woman show here.
*  There's trying to pass the national version of this called the pro act.
*  And this is trying to do this. The Democrats, they're already passed the house.
*  That's so crazy.
*  And it's a, it essentially would categorize independent contracting and
*  it would give it the same label that it has in California under AB5.
*  And that's people like you who write articles for a bunch of different publications.
*  You'd have to be an employee of each of those publications.
*  Or join a union. That's what they want.
*  It's like, you're either going to have to join a union.
*  You're either going to have to work for the government or join a union or go get employed.
*  But people work gigs. You know, most people are adults.
*  They can understand the cost benefit analysis that they're making.
*  They can say, I might not have great health insurance,
*  but I have the freedom to work as an Uber driver when I want to.
*  I can log in when I want to. I can clock out. I can take an hour break.
*  I can do whatever the fuck I want on my time.
*  And I understood when I was waitressing that I could have gone and got worked in a
*  corporation.
*  I could have probably gone and got a job anywhere and had good benefits.
*  And I would have had to clock in at a certain time and clock out and probably
*  play the game and not say things that I want to say.
*  And I understood that I would have to take a riskier path.
*  And I took responsibility for that.
*  Now I think that some of these companies do need to be held accountable in terms
*  of how they treat their workers, how much they pay their workers.
*  And it is true. I'm not here to defend Uber because they do,
*  I mean, even just talk to any Uber drivers, they've, you know,
*  lowered their rates and it's harder for them to make money. And it's all,
*  so they're not exactly perfect,
*  but you can't take agency away from people who are choosing to
*  work as a gig person and not maybe join a union or go work at a
*  job. And this is why I can't, you know,
*  this is something that people should be calling Biden out on because he's come
*  out many times in support of this.
*  Do you know how gross it would be if comedians had a union?
*  Disgusting.
*  Could you imagine what fuckwits would be in control of that union and how,
*  how many shitty comics would go to the head of that union?
*  Because they don't have any power or agency in their comedy career.
*  Yeah. It would be like a huge HR department.
*  The worst comics with the shittiest ideas of what constitutes comedy.
*  Yeah. And they would probably start censoring people.
*  Yeah. All of it is,
*  we should be able to work where we want and how we want.
*  That's especially someone like you write articles for a bunch of different,
*  like all of a sudden you would have to be in a union and pay dues.
*  Well people, so one of the women that I'm friends with had to leave LA because
*  in many single, this, and it always hurts the people.
*  They say they're trying to help. She was a single mom and she had,
*  you can't work, you couldn't write more than like 30 articles a month.
*  Most people who are freelance are writing 30 articles a week if they can,
*  you know, they're cranking these things out in there.
*  And if you are a company, for instance,
*  you now have to employ that person.
*  And so companies based in DC, if you're writing for a political,
*  whatever it might be,
*  they were saying we can't work with you because you,
*  we would have to fall under the laws of AB 5 and either hire you or
*  that's it. And we're not going to hire you.
*  This is the perfect example of where you can be fiscally conservative
*  and socially liberal.
*  And you don't have to agree with,
*  you don't have to like uniformly agree with everything that's on your side.
*  And this is, this is one of those.
*  This is a conservative viewpoint that I completely agree with.
*  Give people freedom, especially with what we do,
*  whether it's a comic or a writer or you do both, but that kind of shit,
*  it's crazy. The idea that you would have to be like forcing people to join
*  unions is insane.
*  Yeah. And there, if you really,
*  I encourage people to read the Pro Act bill and to try and figure it out again,
*  go to the source material. Don't just listen to me, go research this stuff.
*  There's some stuff that I think most people are like, okay,
*  that's a little reasonable,
*  but the problem with these bills is that they try and cram in as much crap as
*  they possibly can. And so you, there's,
*  it would make it so that you could, there's, it's just,
*  it's very pro-union and I again don't have anything against unions,
*  but they shouldn't have all of the power. You know,
*  you shouldn't be forced to join a union in order to work
*  as a comedian or a freelance writer. And it hurts so many people.
*  It hurts sign language, people who do translations. It hurt,
*  people who work as independent drivers, you know, personal assistants,
*  like it was an endless,
*  there's a whole website devoted to stories from people from hundreds of
*  different. Why did they pass it?
*  Because the woman who did is an insane person. I mean, this,
*  I think it's part of the reason that Elon's probably going to bounce out of
*  there too, because I don't know that he uses, I'm not sure,
*  but I'm not sure that he uses union people in his factories.
*  I could be wrong about that,
*  but I know that part of her beef was with Elon and Uber and these big
*  corporations. But when you look at who's funding her,
*  which I love doing is following the money of all these people.
*  It's like all the labor unions.
*  So she's in the pockets of these people and she,
*  she will post something and then people will be in her mentions like,
*  please don't do this. You're hurting us. You're hurting us.
*  You're hurting your constituents. Her name's Lorena Gonzalez. You're hurting.
*  And she'll just take her, the ability for anybody to reply to her. I'm like,
*  what kind of fucking representative are you that you are saying I'm helping
*  people? Your people are like, you're hurting us. And she's like,
*  mute's all replies. Like you actually don't care about your people.
*  You're just posturing and saying that you do. And in fact,
*  you're just in the pocket of unions and pushing a bill that most everyone in the
*  state, I mean, Uber and Lyft are going to leave California, not like,
*  leave, take their headquarters,
*  like no Uber or Lyft in California because they couldn't comply with the whole
*  freaking business model of Uber is independent contractors and Lyft.
*  That's the business. That is the business model. That was the whole plan.
*  That's the whole thing, the deal. And you're trying to say, no,
*  you need to employ these people.
*  What is California going to look like in 10 years? Is it going to be Mad Max?
*  It feels like Mad Max already a little. I mean,
*  it does a little, especially now that it's on fire.
*  Yeah, it's just, it's so, it's so,
*  it's heartbreaking what's happening to some of the cities. It just,
*  I believe that there will be a resurgence.
*  I think whenever the city's empty out artists move in and weirdos and they're
*  like, woohoo opportunity. So I, I believe in the creative,
*  especially in New York, it's like, people are like, New York is dead.
*  I'm like, it's not dead. You know,
*  well, I hope they're right.
*  I hope so too, but people still live there in the seventies,
*  even though it was violent.
*  I think LA has more problems than New York does.
*  LA is just one earthquake away from being a dead man's land.
*  Yeah, no, I don't want to be there for that.
*  Cause then if the earthquake hits, you think there's a mass exodus now?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. The mass exodus now is about freedom. That's most of it.
*  It's about freedom. And then the worry about taxes,
*  cause they're talking about raising taxes.
*  I think that fell. That didn't pass. I could be wrong,
*  but I'm pretty sure that that even that was too crazy for California.
*  Or is that the wealth tax?
*  They were thinking about the wealth tax and then, Oh, I don't know.
*  The wealth tax is something when they were going to, that died. Yeah.
*  That was the most ridiculous proposal of all time.
*  Biden's talking about that today though.
*  The same tax, the California tax.
*  It said like if you make over $400,000 a year,
*  nothing or excuse me, like under nothing will change. Tax the wealth or tax the
*  wealthier. So over 400,000.
*  The thing about the California one, Peter Schiff talked about it.
*  It's it's so,
*  it was so crazy that 10 years ago if you had left 10 years ago,
*  you'd owe money. And then if you leave now from 10 years on,
*  they could get money from you. So if you leave today,
*  you owe money for 10 more years.
*  It's so ridiculous. How do you even enforce that?
*  You're just criminals. You're stealing. You're stealing. Yeah. It's,
*  it's shameless stealing. And you know, the idea, Tim Kennedy was on the,
*  here it is. If you make under $400,000 a year, this is Joe Biden. You will not,
*  by the way, he didn't write this.
*  You will not pay a penny more in taxes when I'm president.
*  The super wealthy and big corporation will finally pay their fair share and we'll
*  invest the money in working families. We're going to reward work, not wealth.
*  No, you're not.
*  No, here's the thing that drives me crazy. Where the biggest wealth is,
*  I believe it's California that has the most wealth inequality in America.
*  They have done nothing to help the middle class.
*  They've eaten the middle class completely.
*  All my friends who are my and my age or a little younger in their thirties,
*  they all had to leave and go buy a house and they left years ago because they're
*  like,
*  it's too expensive for us to try and get ahead and have kids.
*  And these mom and pops that are getting destroyed, nobody,
*  they don't give a shit about the middle class or the working class.
*  And so every you're seeing tons of homeless people are unhoused and tons of
*  people who are absolutely loaded. I can't wear, how am I going to,
*  you know how much money it would take for me to buy a house in LA for a down
*  payment in my neighborhood? 1300, 1300 square feet,
*  $250,000 like a quarter of a million.
*  You're looking at me like, that's not that much money.
*  You're like, what's the problem, Bridget? It's a lot of fucking money. Yeah.
*  It's not, I get it. There's no, I'm detached, but I'm not detached.
*  I still understand it.
*  There's no pathway upward for the middle class in places like
*  New York or LA.
*  Don't you think when places get really big though,
*  it's almost they're unmanageable when they get really big.
*  And they're always, when they're really big, they're always run by Democrats.
*  The really big cities are always Democrat run for whatever strange reason.
*  I mean, Detroit's a good example of what happened. You know,
*  that was a thriving city.
*  Yeah, but that was different because then that was when they shifted the auto
*  industry. Yeah. And there's no,
*  Detroit was one of the richest cities in the world. Yeah. Yeah. They fucked that up.
*  Globalization. Yeah. I mean, that was one of Michael Moore's best movies.
*  It was about Flint. Oh yeah. You know, about how Flint, Michigan.
*  Was it called, what was his first movie? The big movie that put them on the map?
*  Michael Moore. Was it the climate change one? Roger, Roger,
*  Roger and me, Roger and me. Yeah.
*  It was all about the guy who was the head of GM. Is that what it was?
*  Where he was trying to contact him to figure out why you're moving jobs out of
*  the city. And do you understand what you're doing to this place? And that was,
*  he was a real populist. Yeah. You know,
*  and it's funny how he became a villain when he had this movie criticizing the
*  industry of climate change, the industry behind climate change.
*  And everybody's like, you piece of shit. I thought I was one of you guys.
*  Everyone's canceled.
*  It's when we were driving around and our tour guide,
*  our little Sherpa who was showing us around, he,
*  he was like showing us all these amazing little old Austin places that are
*  closed because of COVID and will probably never open.
*  And they've been there since like 1938 and all that. And, you know,
*  we were saying like, if I was a philanthropic billionaire,
*  I would buy all these little mom and pops and help keep them alive.
*  Cause they're the lifeblood of these cities. And they're also just the,
*  that's what kills me is like, I hate seeing this,
*  this coffee shop that's been there since forever closed and there's a
*  Starbucks next door and like, they're fine.
*  It just kills that. That is where I want.
*  Well, Austin is all about these little small independent places,
*  independent restaurants, independent businesses.
*  That's one of the things that I really love about it.
*  That's one of the things that attracted me to this place in the first place.
*  I'm hoping that new ones will rise and take their place. That's,
*  that's the hope is that the ethic of this community,
*  we need a more robust middle class. You know, if I,
*  that's what we need to cultivate in California.
*  If you want to try and fix California, that's where you start.
*  How do you help people who are living in the 100 to
*  $600,000 a year range or even less 60,000 because you can't,
*  what is their pathway up? Especially now. Yeah. How do you help?
*  How do you help them? Because that's where, that's where,
*  that's what, what holds the center.
*  Bridget, why don't you run for president? You'd be able to nail it.
*  Maybe we should both run. No. Yeah. No, no. I'll be your VEEP.
*  No, no, no. I'll support you. I don't want to be president. I give you a VEEP.
*  Come on. You'd be first woman president.
*  Kamal Harris would be the first woman president if Joe Biden wins.
*  Cause he ain't going to make it. Yeah. With the Timbalands. All right.
*  We did three hours. We saved. Oh really? Wow. Yeah. It's already four. Sorry.
*  Passed four. Sorry. It was awesome. I enjoyed it. That was a fun one.
*  You gonna move here?
*  Uh, I'm definitely considering it. I don't like to be a follower.
*  You're not a follower. I'm a follower. It feels so lame. No. Why?
*  Because I got here first. No, no. Just because I'm generally,
*  everybody's leaving and I'm generally, and I want out. Don't be stupid.
*  I just don't know where I want to go. It's better here. Maybe I'll go to Idaho.
*  That's right. But they'll get mad if you talk about it. Shout out to Boise.
*  All right. Uh, dumpster fire. It's available.
*  On YouTube. Walk-ins welcome is my podcast.
*  It's a different vibe than dumpster fire. A little more nuanced.
*  And, uh, your Instagram you don't use.
*  And Twitter at Bridget Phetasy. We use Twitter a lot. I love Twitter.
*  Twitter loves you. Thank you Bridget. I love you too. Thank you for having me.
*  I enjoy it as always. Bye everybody.
