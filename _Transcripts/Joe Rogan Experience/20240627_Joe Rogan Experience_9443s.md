*  And you guys make fucking awesome cars. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=26.0s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=29.0s)]
*  For a living. What a great job. I mean, what a fucking great job. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=30.0s)]
*  Dude, yeah, it is. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=34.0s)]
*  You guys get to work on some of the fucking coolest cars that have ever been made. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=35.0s)]
*  You guys have an incredible gig. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=39.0s)]
*  Living the dream, man. That's it. That's what it's all about. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=41.0s)]
*  So I drove that 1970 Barracuda and I got here. I said, I don't want to say shit until we get on the air. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=44.0s)]
*  Dude, I'm sweating. I've been sweating thinking about it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=48.0s)]
*  That thing is a masterpiece. It's my favorite. That's my favorite car now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=51.0s)]
*  That just went. Number one. It beat all of them. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=55.0s)]
*  Hell yeah, dude. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=58.0s)]
*  You know, like edges. You know, the Camaro is amazing. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=59.0s)]
*  The Minova that I got from Steve Strope is fucking incredible. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=62.0s)]
*  But this thing is fucking. It's also it's like I have so much history with this car. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=65.0s)]
*  And I bought this car 20 years ago and to buy it. Reggie Bush bought it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=69.0s)]
*  And then he got rid of it after a while. He dumped a bunch of money into it, too. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=74.0s)]
*  He was telling me. And then when my friend Yoel told me he got it back, he called me and he said, I have your Barracuda. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=77.0s)]
*  I'm like, no. And this is like, you know, I was already thinking that I wanted to get another one. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=87.0s)]
*  I wanted to get them. I only like hot rods that are manuals. That's all I like. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=94.0s)]
*  I do not like automatic hot rods. Just feels like something's wrong. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=98.0s)]
*  When you're driving a classic muscle car, it's like, why am I not shifting? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=101.0s)]
*  You know, and just what you guys did to that thing is just you guys are artists. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=108.0s)]
*  I appreciate it. It's really amazing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=112.0s)]
*  We were stoked, stoked to hear when you found that car because you could have built anything, you know. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=114.0s)]
*  Yeah. So but that damn car was so rad. And to start with it. Yeah. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=118.0s)]
*  Revamped that sucker and put our touch on it. And I had a blast doing it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=123.0s)]
*  And I'm glad that you're digging it. I love it. I love it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=127.0s)]
*  That was the whole everything on that. All the styling and stuff aside. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=130.0s)]
*  It was the focus was making that fucker work really good so that you got something fun to drive. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=133.0s)]
*  So it drives so different than anything else. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=139.0s)]
*  It's that that high revving, naturally aspirated Mercury engine, which is very different. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=141.0s)]
*  It's a wild motor man. Yeah. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=148.0s)]
*  Like the Mopar dudes, not a big fan of it, right? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=150.0s)]
*  Because it's right. It's Chevy based, but it's a fucking motor. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=153.0s)]
*  You know, it's an internal combustion engine. Looks like a heavy under the hood. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=157.0s)]
*  People have to get over that. Yeah. Like there's a bunch of people that are taking V8s like LS engines and putting them in the back of Porsches. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=160.0s)]
*  Yeah. And people are like, man, I don't know. They're doing like those 964s air cooled engines. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=168.0s)]
*  But dude, do you know how fun that would be? It's probably lighter than the Porsche engine. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=174.0s)]
*  It's got way more torque. Oh, yeah. Way more horsepower. Totally different sound. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=180.0s)]
*  It's I mean, it's upgrades. It doesn't have to fit. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=185.0s)]
*  It's not like you've got to stick with whatever came in a factory and make it better. It's hot rotting. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=187.0s)]
*  They got to let that shit go. Yeah, they got to let that shit go. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=193.0s)]
*  The people who are the worst about it is Ferrari people. Ferrari will sue you. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=196.0s)]
*  I know, man. I've heard that. That is so crazy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=201.0s)]
*  You buy a Ferrari and you paint it weird colors, they'll fucking sue you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=205.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. You see, there's a couple of things floating around. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=209.0s)]
*  You get that dude that just, man, he swapped like a Honda motor, turbo Honda motor into a little 308. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=211.0s)]
*  Every comments like when's the cease and desist letter coming? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=217.0s)]
*  Yeah. I wonder if they can do that with classic ones, because I know that there's a bunch of people that have hot rotted. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=221.0s)]
*  Some old GTOs and they really are incredible. They're cool. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=225.0s)]
*  Yeah, I talk about it all the time. I'm itching to like rest. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=229.0s)]
*  Oh, mod it. Testarosa. Ooh, it's going to happen. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=233.0s)]
*  One of these days. I don't know why, but I think I see those cars. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=236.0s)]
*  Those cars never did it for me. Really? It looks like junk. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=239.0s)]
*  Oh, man. That side thing with the like vents like get the fuck out of here. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=243.0s)]
*  It's the generation. It's the generational gap. You know, those Miami vice. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=247.0s)]
*  I was a kid. I remember Miami vice. Everybody wanted a Testarosa. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=252.0s)]
*  I want to do the like that Lambo LP 2000 or whatever the Lambo truck, the vintage one. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=255.0s)]
*  Oh, the one Mike Tyson had. Mike Tyson had one of those back in the day. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=261.0s)]
*  Do those mid travel. You only want to do that because you picture that fucking Doberman sitting in the front seat of that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=264.0s)]
*  That's a perfect car for like Doberman, Rottweiler. I've got to. Yeah. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=270.0s)]
*  That's your style for sure. Yeah, that's the guy with warrants. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=274.0s)]
*  Got a car like that. That guy's done some shady shit. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=278.0s)]
*  You got to get some of those in your collection. A Doberman in a Lambo truck. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=280.0s)]
*  Like, what are you up to? For sure. You know how to get ketamine. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=284.0s)]
*  So, dude, did you rip that? You drove it here. Yeah, I drove it here. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=290.0s)]
*  So you got a few miles on it. Yeah. Oh, my God. Dude, it's so different. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=293.0s)]
*  That engine is just a high revving engine. I mean, what's the what's the red line on that thing? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=297.0s)]
*  You could shift it like 83, 84 hundred. That's so crazy for a V8. It's so crazy. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=302.0s)]
*  And it sounds so different. It's like it sounds like a combination of like the Voodoo engine from the the Shelby GT 350. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=307.0s)]
*  And like an exotic car. It's real weird. It's got a sweet sound like the Voodoo engines and all those coyotes are cool. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=317.0s)]
*  But like me even being a car guy, if I'm on the highway and I'm just cruising like with my family and some asshole kid flies by it [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=325.0s)]
*  and one of those with an exhaust system on it. What the fuck is Jesus? And a little respect. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=331.0s)]
*  I don't think you need an exhaust system on one of those. They sound good when they're straight from the factory. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=337.0s)]
*  I like that sound. But dudes go crazy with their exhausts. Oh, yeah. It's like it's not annoying to you. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=342.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like a maturity thing. I think, you know, you got it. You want the exhaust tone like that car, too. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=348.0s)]
*  We put that little bypass on it. You can you can open it up and it's maybe like 20, 30 percent louder, but it's not obnoxious. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=354.0s)]
*  It doesn't need to be. That sounds perfect. I don't know if there was like an HOA or something, you know, so I'm sure you have that option. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=360.0s)]
*  Yeah, I try to be respectful. I try to be respectful. It's weird driving that though and getting back in another LSV8 powered car and like you're shifting so much earlier. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=367.0s)]
*  And then you jump in that trying to figure like mentally stay in it. Another three thousand RPMs. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=376.0s)]
*  And yeah, it comes alive at five grand and just rips. It's just very different. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=381.0s)]
*  But it's got plenty of low end torque for it to be fun, like right off the line. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=386.0s)]
*  But it's just like when you get on the highway, when you get on it's first of all, the handling, the thing. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=389.0s)]
*  I wanted to ask you this because you guys remapped how the transmission works and the tunnel and then you put the rear transaxle. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=394.0s)]
*  Does that shift the weight more to the back? It makes that car ends up being like perfect 50 50. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=404.0s)]
*  So with a big monster V8 in the front of it, the car still, you know, it's a little more exotic because it's balanced. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=409.0s)]
*  That's what I was thinking when I was driving. I'm like, God, this thing is so balanced. It's so sorted. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=415.0s)]
*  It's it's just like super predictable. Yeah, it feels like a sports car, doesn't it? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=421.0s)]
*  Compared to the exact opposite feeling of the old car. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=425.0s)]
*  The old 70 was that it had that giant Hemi in the front and it was like really front end heavy. Oh, yeah. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=428.0s)]
*  And you could feel it. You could feel it around turns. You could feel it everywhere. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=436.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, it had solid rear axle. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=440.0s)]
*  It didn't have the widest tires in the world. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=443.0s)]
*  And it was just like, oh, yeah, it's a big old like boat anchor. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=446.0s)]
*  That's why everybody that chimes in and like, man, should have a big old 426 Hemi with a four barrel on it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=450.0s)]
*  You're like, dude, what the fuck? Shut your mouth. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=455.0s)]
*  I shut your mouth. If I gave you that car, you'd shake your pants. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=459.0s)]
*  It's the most incredible car of all time. Shut up. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=462.0s)]
*  You drove the Camaro yesterday you're talking about. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=465.0s)]
*  So it's interesting back to back two days jumping out of the Camaro. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=467.0s)]
*  The Camaro is way more sketchy. The Camaro is like if you're taking a right turn, you give it a little juice, you're going to kick out. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=471.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's so powerful at the low end. It's so it's got that just wants to go. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=478.0s)]
*  You got to be like very careful with the throttle in the Camaro. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=485.0s)]
*  You got to respect the Camaro a lot more than this one. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=489.0s)]
*  This one just lets you feel where the balance it's just like, you know, where the limitations are. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=491.0s)]
*  It's like giving you more information, it seems like. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=498.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was just like a bar brawler. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=501.0s)]
*  You know, the Camaro is like some crazy dude who comes into a bar and he's doing coke and starts smashing shit. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=503.0s)]
*  You know, that's what it's like. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=509.0s)]
*  It's like it handles for one of those cars for 69. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=511.0s)]
*  I mean, you don't get a 69 Camaro that handles better. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=514.0s)]
*  It handles amazing. But it just it's so rowdy. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=517.0s)]
*  And it has what is that like 850 horsepower? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=520.0s)]

*  It was a dope Bronco, though. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=702.0s)]
*  He had it like completely redone. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=704.0s)]
*  It was a total sleeper. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=707.0s)]

*  Really funny. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=717.0s)]
*  But, you know, he made like a ton of money off of hanging with Mr. Cooper. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=718.0s)]
*  He's just chilling, having a good time, enjoying himself. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=720.0s)]
*  But just luckily he wasn't in that thing. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=724.0s)]
*  That's how our governor got paralyzed. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=727.0s)]
*  The tree? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=730.0s)]
*  The tree fell. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=731.0s)]

*  He was jogging. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=733.0s)]
*  Jogging around a lake. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=734.0s)]
*  The fuck is a tree falling while you're jogging? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=735.0s)]
*  Dude, what are the odds? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=736.0s)]
*  What are the odds? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=738.0s)]
*  They do fall, though. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=739.0s)]
*  You know, when you're hunting and you're in an area with a lot of dead fall and it's windy, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=741.0s)]
*  like if you hear a crack, that's something you have to be very considerate of. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=746.0s)]
*  You have to really consider it. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=751.0s)]
*  Because if you hear a tree falling and it's anywhere near you, you could get got. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=753.0s)]
*  You have to really pay attention if you're in a place where trees fall. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=758.0s)]
*  It's super, super, super rare to be there when a tree falls. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=761.0s)]
*  But when you go through the woods, you see fallen trees all the time. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=765.0s)]
*  They do happen. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=768.0s)]
*  And if you are there, you could just zig when you should have zagged. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=769.0s)]
*  If that happens to me, I hope it takes me out, dude. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=774.0s)]
*  Because I would not want to tell that story. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=776.0s)]
*  I hope it grazes me. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=778.0s)]
*  And people are like, dude, what happened? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=780.0s)]
*  A fucking tree fell on me. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=782.0s)]
*  It came out of nowhere. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=783.0s)]
*  Well, Abbott's pulled it off. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=786.0s)]
*  He's the governor. He's a great guy. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=787.0s)]
*  And that's what happened to him. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=790.0s)]
*  It's a crazy story. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=792.0s)]
*  The guy was like super fit, running around a lake. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=794.0s)]

*  Fucking wild. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=800.0s)]
*  That's like we always talk. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=801.0s)]
*  No disrespect to anybody, but getting hit by a train. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=802.0s)]
*  That's always blown my mind. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=806.0s)]
*  I saw that on Instagram last week. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=808.0s)]
*  Because they don't sneak up on you. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=811.0s)]
*  They do, though. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=813.0s)]
*  Because they're moving so fast, you miscalculate how much time it takes to get out of the way. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=815.0s)]
*  You really do. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=820.0s)]
*  You see them. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=821.0s)]
*  You see them coming. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=822.0s)]
*  They're coming towards you. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=823.0s)]
*  You don't understand what that means. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=824.0s)]
*  If you think you can run across a highway because you see the car down there, no, you can't. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=828.0s)]
*  No, you can't. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=832.0s)]
*  That car's going 80 miles an hour. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=833.0s)]
*  It's going to fucking smash into you. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=835.0s)]
*  It's just a bad car. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=836.0s)]
*  And it's also, for whatever reason, sometimes people stop on tracks. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=838.0s)]
*  It's the craziest thing. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=842.0s)]
*  Their car stalls. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=843.0s)]
*  They get stopped on tracks. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=844.0s)]
*  Or they try to beat the train. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=846.0s)]
*  And they get clipped. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=848.0s)]
*  That's what happened to Matt Hughes. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=849.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=850.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=851.0s)]

*  It's amazing. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=855.0s)]
*  It's an adrenaline thing, too. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=856.0s)]
*  We were out ripping those scooters, those little rental fucking electric scooters. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=857.0s)]
*  And Sean was at Buddymine. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=861.0s)]
*  He fucking throttles down on this thing. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=863.0s)]
*  I'm like, dude, don't do that. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=865.0s)]
*  Right in front of the train. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=866.0s)]
*  It looked like something out of a movie. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=868.0s)]
*  Like if we had fireworks going off in the background, it would have been... [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=869.0s)]
*  I forgot all about that. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=872.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=873.0s)]
*  I had a concussion. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=874.0s)]
*  I forgot about it. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=875.0s)]
*  And you're trusting some fucking rental scooter. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=876.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=879.0s)]
*  What are the odds that that thing's not beat to shit? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=880.0s)]
*  Driving around Austin yesterday. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=882.0s)]
*  After we drove them. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=883.0s)]
*  Those things just... [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=884.0s)]
*  They leave them wherever, huh? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=885.0s)]
*  Ever. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=886.0s)]
*  Like... [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=887.0s)]
*  You have an app, you just find one, pick it up, start riding. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=888.0s)]
*  In the middle of the road. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=890.0s)]
*  Like yesterday, we were driving around. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=891.0s)]
*  They're just fucking everywhere. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=892.0s)]
*  It's a great way for people to get around, though. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=893.0s)]
*  If you like... [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=895.0s)]
*  Like, Austin is a great walking around city. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=896.0s)]
*  There's a lot of places just like where my club is on 6th Street. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=898.0s)]
*  They shut the street down on the weekends. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=901.0s)]
*  And it's just for people walking around. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=903.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=905.0s)]
*  It's fucking cool. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=906.0s)]
*  Everybody just wandering around, going to bars. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=907.0s)]
*  It's really... [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=909.0s)]
*  Prime for a bachelorette party on about six or seven of those scooters. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=910.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, dude. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=913.0s)]
*  They're always happening. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=914.0s)]
*  Seeing them get KO'd. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=915.0s)]
*  They're always happening. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=916.0s)]
*  And they're in those petty cabs. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=917.0s)]
*  They're always in the back. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=918.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=919.0s)]
*  Those scooters should be regulated here. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=920.0s)]
*  We're lucky to have Josh with us today because Josh had himself a fucking violent wreck on [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=922.0s)]
*  one of those in Louisville. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=927.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=929.0s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=930.0s)]
*  Helmet? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=931.0s)]
*  No helmet. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=932.0s)]
*  No helmet. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=933.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=935.0s)]
*  We're all doing stupid shit. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=936.0s)]
*  We're all doing stupid shit. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=937.0s)]
*  Yeah, off the concrete. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=938.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=941.0s)]
*  Pull out my phone. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=942.0s)]
*  I'm navigating. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=943.0s)]
*  We're trying to find a bar. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=944.0s)]
*  I'm in the lead. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=945.0s)]
*  And pull out my phone and just kind of stand there and then got a tank slapper and... [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=946.0s)]
*  Honestly, my pride is hurt way worse. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=950.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's not recoverable. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=956.0s)]
*  When you get older, falling becomes way more dangerous. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=957.0s)]
*  That's what we said. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=960.0s)]
*  You know, I used to fall when I was a kid. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=961.0s)]
*  It was like a normal thing. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=963.0s)]
*  You'd fall off your bike. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=965.0s)]
*  Now you fall off your bike like, Jesus. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=966.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=968.0s)]
*  Check and everything. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=969.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=970.0s)]
*  Making sure. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=971.0s)]
*  It used to be able to like roll. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=972.0s)]
*  Now it's just you hit and splat. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=973.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=974.0s)]
*  You just hit awkward. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=975.0s)]
*  And then things click. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=976.0s)]
*  Why is it clicking? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=977.0s)]
*  Why is my neck clicking? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=978.0s)]
*  Clicking, breaking. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=979.0s)]
*  And you're just thinking about crack bones and shit. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=980.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=983.0s)]
*  Don't ride scooters, bro. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=984.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=985.0s)]
*  We need you. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=986.0s)]
*  He learned his lesson. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=987.0s)]
*  We need you out there making awesome cars. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=988.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=989.0s)]
*  I saw that Grand National you guys did. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=990.0s)]
*  That's another car that I appreciate, but I don't get it. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=991.0s)]
*  I put that in the Testarossa category. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=994.0s)]
*  To me, it's like that's a sedan. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=996.0s)]
*  That's like a regular sedan. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=998.0s)]
*  Like it just there's nothing special about it. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1000.0s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1002.0s)]
*  So I've never been I've never been into those cars either. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1003.0s)]
*  I've always hated the G bodies. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1006.0s)]
*  Not a fan at all. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1008.0s)]
*  But that's a car that's so fucking violently fast and badass to drive. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1009.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm sure. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1013.0s)]
*  And it's got like a menacing. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1014.0s)]
*  I kind of made me a believer in him because it's got like this menacing look about it [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1015.0s)]
*  because it's like you said, it's like a sedan. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1019.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1021.0s)]
*  It was an average ass looking car. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1022.0s)]
*  But it's it kind of made me a believer. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1024.0s)]
*  I turn the corner on the G bodies a little bit. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1026.0s)]
*  Yeah, a little bit. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1028.0s)]
*  But it's not the best shape. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1029.0s)]
*  Those years. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1031.0s)]
*  What is that like 87 or something like that? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1032.0s)]
*  Yeah, those years sucked. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1034.0s)]
*  It did. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1036.0s)]
*  Those years. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1037.0s)]
*  Even the greatest stuff that anybody made during those years sucked. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1038.0s)]
*  When's a Mustang coming? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1041.0s)]
*  You got to do a Mustang, don't you? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1042.0s)]
*  I do have to do a Mustang. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1044.0s)]
*  Look at that thing. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1045.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty dope. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1048.0s)]
*  As far as those cars go, it's dope. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1049.0s)]
*  But it's just they're not the best looking cars. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1051.0s)]
*  Like if you're going to I don't know if you're going to commit to a car. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1053.0s)]
*  You like some some shape and some. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1056.0s)]
*  I like the old 70s stuff. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1058.0s)]
*  The ones when people were taking acid and making great music. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1060.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1063.0s)]
*  That was the cars. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1065.0s)]
*  Those are the cars. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1066.0s)]
*  You had these like colorful characters that were designers that. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1068.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1071.0s)]
*  That dude's name was just a fucking nut. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1072.0s)]
*  Do you remember what the crazy clothes and. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1074.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1076.0s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1077.0s)]
*  Crazy GM designer. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1079.0s)]
*  At the early early. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1080.0s)]
*  Had that. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1081.0s)]
*  No, I had the red suit all the time. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1082.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1083.0s)]
*  They did drugs. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1084.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1085.0s)]
*  Tons of drugs. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1086.0s)]
*  Here's what. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1087.0s)]
*  Here's why you can tell. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1088.0s)]
*  It drops off radically after the sweeping psychedelics act of 1970. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1089.0s)]
*  So in 1970, they made everything schedule one. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1094.0s)]
*  They turn mushrooms, LSD. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1097.0s)]
*  Everything became schedule one. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1099.0s)]
*  And the purpose of it. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1101.0s)]
*  Look at this fucking crazy dude. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1102.0s)]
*  That's the guy who designed everything. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1104.0s)]
*  He's an animal. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1105.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1106.0s)]
*  Dude, world famous, famous guy. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1107.0s)]
*  So when they made it in 1970 from 70 on, the cars started sucking. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1109.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1113.0s)]
*  Like literally. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1114.0s)]
*  Like it's like right when everything became illegal, the cars just fell apart. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1115.0s)]
*  You get like a couple of good 71s, like the 71 Barracuda is dope. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1119.0s)]
*  In a carryover car. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1123.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you get into like the 70 Camaros and you're like, what did you do? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1125.0s)]
*  Like, what did you do? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1128.0s)]
*  It's like, it's OK. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1130.0s)]
*  But like, but you had perfection. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1131.0s)]
*  Like, what did you do? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1133.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1134.0s)]
*  That's a funky one to think is there 70 Camaro guys, you know, and I could see like there's something about them. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1135.0s)]
*  That's all right. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1140.0s)]
*  But to veer away from such an iconic design, the 69 was it's one of the baddest cars ever made. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1141.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1148.0s)]
*  And to just drop that, not even like evolve it a little bit. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1149.0s)]
*  They get into like the 80s and you're like, what is that? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1152.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1155.0s)]
*  Well, the Irocs like, what is that? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1156.0s)]
*  What have you done? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1159.0s)]
*  What have you done? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1160.0s)]
*  What are you guys doing? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1161.0s)]
*  Would you do something? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1162.0s)]
*  You guys are on the wrong drugs. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1163.0s)]
*  Well, I think cocaine came in and played a part of it, you know, because like we did it. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1165.0s)]
*  This fucking design is awesome. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1169.0s)]
*  Send it. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1171.0s)]
*  We did a 79 Camaro white one and it's like, you know, white teatops. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1172.0s)]
*  Did it for a guy out at Pennsylvania and we call it the cocaine cruiser. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1176.0s)]
*  It's got that look, you know, but yeah, the design, it kind of went out the fucking window. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1180.0s)]
*  I think like AMX, AMC AMX, I'll bet you that entire product line was like an acid trip. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1185.0s)]
*  I feel like. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1191.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1192.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1193.0s)]
*  That's wild ones. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1194.0s)]
*  That's javelins and shit. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1195.0s)]
*  Even the way they are. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1196.0s)]
*  I mean, besides the just the drugs. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1197.0s)]
*  I mean, there's stories about Bill Mitchell. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1199.0s)]
*  I mean, he was supposedly now this is a story as you heard, they were paying prostitutes out of petty cash from General Motors. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1201.0s)]
*  Of course they were. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1210.0s)]
*  Like on a weekly basis. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1211.0s)]
*  Payment gold bullions. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1212.0s)]
*  And they lived a life like. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1213.0s)]
*  It was kind of a rock star lifestyle. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1215.0s)]
*  I mean, there's stories about them getting drunk and taking like a horse drawn carriage in New York City and driving it like through the Waldorf Astoria. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1217.0s)]
*  And I mean, shit like that back in the day there. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1223.0s)]
*  It's a crazier mentality and they were getting away with a lot more shit that I think trickled down into the company. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1226.0s)]
*  I think they trickled down the design. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1232.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1234.0s)]
*  They were rock and roll guys. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1235.0s)]
*  They made rock and roll cars, man. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1236.0s)]
*  They all they really did. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1238.0s)]
*  Like those you go back and look at it like a 1969 Mustang. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1240.0s)]
*  Like whoever whatever you were on back then, you fucking nailed it. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1244.0s)]
*  Like there's nothing like that before that. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1247.0s)]
*  You know, if you go to like the 19 the difference between the 1950s cars and the 1960s cars is crazy because if you think about the difference between a 2013 car and a 2023 car, not much fucking difference. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1250.0s)]
*  Right. Even Mustangs and things like that. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1262.0s)]
*  They look great. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1264.0s)]
*  13, you know, 10 years ago, they look great now. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1265.0s)]
*  But it's like they don't look that much different. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1267.0s)]
*  That you know, that's an old car. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1269.0s)]
*  But 50 to 60s like that's when the drugs kicked in. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1271.0s)]
*  And that's 100 percent. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1274.0s)]
*  They started making the Corvette look like the 67 plus Corvette. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1275.0s)]
*  They just had this fucking shape to it. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1279.0s)]
*  You know, they just went ham. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1282.0s)]
*  Yeah, dude, that's a good observation. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1284.0s)]
*  I've never really put two and two together on that because the 50 stuff so like civilized and like professional. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1285.0s)]
*  And then it yeah, definitely do do do do do do do do do do do do. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1291.0s)]
*  These guys got fucked up and they made some amazing art. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1297.0s)]
*  And that's really what it is. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1300.0s)]
*  And what you guys do is take that art and update it. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1302.0s)]
*  That's what I love. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1305.0s)]
*  I love like, first of all, I love the craftsmanship and just the skill that you guys have in the engineering that's involved. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1307.0s)]
*  And I just really, really appreciate all that. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1314.0s)]
*  That all that goes into that. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1316.0s)]
*  But it's also art. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1318.0s)]
*  Like you guys are making art with other with old art. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1320.0s)]
*  You take these rusted old fucked up cars and you strip them all down, put a completely new chassis, put everything in it so it works like a modern car. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1323.0s)]
*  And you get the best of both worlds. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1333.0s)]
*  You get that look that those cars had was just magical. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1335.0s)]
*  Whatever they were, whatever the design element of those cars, it's just magical. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1339.0s)]
*  Dude, that's the key to those because everybody loves muscle cars. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1344.0s)]
*  But, you know, people look at them like you get somebody who's like 45, 50 years old. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1347.0s)]
*  He made himself a bunch of cash and he says, that looks cool. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1352.0s)]
*  I want to have it. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1355.0s)]
*  Has no fucking idea that when he buys a 70 Cuda, it's a massive pile of shit to drive. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1356.0s)]
*  Like a bone stock car. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1362.0s)]
*  You have no idea because you look at it, you think it's cool. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1364.0s)]
*  It's fast. It was fast. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1366.0s)]
*  It's not. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1367.0s)]
*  Got the iconic big motor. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1368.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1369.0s)]
*  My mom had a 1971 when I was growing up. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1370.0s)]
*  That's when I became infatuated with Cuda's. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1373.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1375.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1376.0s)]
*  It was with a 340 automatic. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1377.0s)]
*  That's a crazy car for your mom to have. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1378.0s)]
*  Your mom must be pretty fucking cool. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1380.0s)]
*  She's pretty cool. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1382.0s)]
*  But it was like the shape of that car just intoxicated me just as a kid. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1383.0s)]
*  And I was always like, but hers was like kind of boring looking. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1388.0s)]
*  It was like kind of a copper bronze color. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1391.0s)]
*  It was like kind of boring stock. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1393.0s)]
*  And I was like, man, one day, one day. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1395.0s)]
*  That was like the car in my head always was like 70, 71. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1398.0s)]
*  I like both of them. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1402.0s)]
*  There's something about the 70 with the individual headlights. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1403.0s)]
*  It just makes it a little, it stands out. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1406.0s)]
*  But that fucking grille in the 71 is pretty wild too. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1409.0s)]
*  Yeah, I like the taillights on the 72. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1412.0s)]
*  It's a good looking car. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1415.0s)]
*  And it's easy when you start with one of those. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1416.0s)]
*  We've done a handful of Cuda's because those cars are just good looking to begin with. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1418.0s)]
*  And you don't really have to touch the body on them. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1422.0s)]
*  You know, you talk about like making art. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1424.0s)]
*  That car is like art to begin with. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1426.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1427.0s)]
*  Well, I think Dodge did the very best job of doing that retro version of the Challenger. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1428.0s)]
*  They did. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1433.0s)]
*  I think that all those cars that to me look a lot like an old, like the first time I saw the Hellcat, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1434.0s)]
*  I was like, that's a fucking dope car. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1440.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1443.0s)]
*  Dope modern car. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1444.0s)]
*  Like you could see driving that 15, 20 years from now would be cool. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1445.0s)]
*  Dude, they're very cool. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1448.0s)]
*  My problem with them is we've always been around the muscle cars. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1449.0s)]
*  So you're used to the proportions of like I've had 70 challengers and you're used to those proportions. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1452.0s)]
*  And when you see that car next to it, it's like, I don't know, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1458.0s)]
*  I feel like the big dumb kid in gym class when you're a kid is just like a little overgrown. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1462.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1465.0s)]
*  Why did they become bigger? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1466.0s)]
*  All the shit's so much bigger. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1468.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's just the wheelbase, the platform, you know. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1469.0s)]
*  All the safety requirements they have to have. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1471.0s)]
*  The HVAC system in a new modern car or whatever is as big as your entire dash interior of like that 70 Cuda. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1473.0s)]
*  You pull out the HVAC system under the dash of one of those new ones. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1482.0s)]
*  That's why from the steering wheel all the way to the outside of the firewall, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1484.0s)]
*  I mean, you're talking like three fucking feet. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1489.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1491.0s)]
*  And it's just the amount of shit they pack into those new cars. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1492.0s)]
*  It's fucking nuts. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1495.0s)]
*  The horsepower and the performance is pretty mind blowing on that stuff. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1496.0s)]
*  Like if you think everybody raves about like the muscle car era, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1500.0s)]
*  but if you stop and think like you can go into the dealership right now and buy a thousand horsepower car, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1503.0s)]
*  a car that runs nine second quarter miles. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1508.0s)]
*  Jamie just got a brand new Tesla Plaid and I don't know if you've driven one of those. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1510.0s)]
*  But look, I love muscle cars, but that car makes every car feel stupid. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1515.0s)]
*  That's what I've heard. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1520.0s)]
*  Stupid. I mean stupid. It goes zero to 60 in two seconds. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1521.0s)]
*  It flies. It goes so fast. It's like it's time traveling. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1524.0s)]
*  Like it moves into positions that no other car can do it. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1529.0s)]
*  And somehow it does it silently so you don't feel like a douche bag. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1533.0s)]
*  Like you're like, baaaaaah, baaaaaah, and getting in front of somebody. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1537.0s)]
*  You just go, shhhhhh. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1541.0s)]
*  And you're going. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1542.0s)]
*  How wild is it, Jamie? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1543.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1544.0s)]
*  I mean, I barely drove it yesterday because I took it in the back and was like, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1545.0s)]
*  Oh my God, this is a little... [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1548.0s)]
*  Okay, hold on. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1550.0s)]
*  And I think it's 1,100 horsepower. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1551.0s)]
*  Is it controllable or is it just by itself? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1554.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1557.0s)]
*  It's so dialed in, there's never wheel spin. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1558.0s)]
*  I mean, when you take off, there's no wheel spin. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1563.0s)]
*  It's all completely electronically managed. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1565.0s)]
*  The base of the thing is all batteries. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1568.0s)]
*  So the weight is low. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1570.0s)]
*  So it's got an amazing center of gravity. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1572.0s)]
*  1,020 horsepower. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1574.0s)]
*  Oh, back to your point. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1576.0s)]
*  1.9 seconds, 0 to 60. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1577.0s)]
*  It's nuts. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1579.0s)]
*  Bro, it's preposterous. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1580.0s)]
*  I know, it's tough when you talk about that to make the argument against electric cars. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1583.0s)]
*  Because, dude, the performance is nuts. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1587.0s)]
*  I drove the fucking Cuda here today, though. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1589.0s)]
*  I didn't drive the Tesla. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1591.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1592.0s)]
*  It's a different experience. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1593.0s)]
*  I'm not trying to go... [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1594.0s)]
*  I'm not embracing anybody. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1595.0s)]
*  I'm just going to work. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1596.0s)]
*  It's the feeling. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1597.0s)]
*  It's the auxiliary experience. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1599.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1600.0s)]
*  A little bit of vibration, the noise. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1601.0s)]
*  You're in control. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1602.0s)]
*  You're connected to the car, right? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1603.0s)]
*  You feel like you're the one operating the car. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1605.0s)]
*  There's a few things in life that people wish they had that are actually worth getting. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1607.0s)]
*  And muscle cars are one of them. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1611.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1613.0s)]
*  There's just one. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1614.0s)]
*  Dude, modified muscle cars. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1615.0s)]
*  You know, modified muscle cars. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1616.0s)]
*  You got to make that something so you can drive it. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1617.0s)]
*  Because it's like, there's a lot of things that people wish they had. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1619.0s)]
*  And then when you have it, it's like... [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1623.0s)]
*  I'll explain this once. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1624.0s)]
*  My first nice apartment that I ever had was in North Hollywood. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1626.0s)]
*  When I first moved to California and I was on a TV show, I was like, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1629.0s)]
*  Wow, I got a nice apartment. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1631.0s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1632.0s)]
*  This is my own place. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1633.0s)]
*  It had a loft and a pool table. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1634.0s)]
*  And I was sitting in front of my TV and I realized, I go, oh, this is just a house. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1636.0s)]
*  Like, it's just like every other house. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1641.0s)]
*  The same feeling I had when I was in a shitty apartment. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1643.0s)]
*  It's just your place. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1646.0s)]
*  You go to your place, you chill. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1647.0s)]
*  It's the same feeling. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1648.0s)]
*  So all that extra money you play for these big giant houses and all the crazy shit, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1650.0s)]
*  you think you're going to get that same amount of juice from like, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1654.0s)]
*  Wow, what an amazing feeling being in this house. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1658.0s)]
*  But it's just your house. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1661.0s)]
*  You just have that same feeling. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1662.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm in my house. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1664.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm open to my refrigerator. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1665.0s)]
*  I'm going to have breakfast. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1666.0s)]
*  It's the same feeling. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1667.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1668.0s)]
*  It's not the same feeling with cars. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1669.0s)]
*  When you're in one of the... [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1671.0s)]
*  I drive the Tesla to work, it's quiet. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1672.0s)]
*  It's great. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1674.0s)]
*  I listen to books on tape. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1675.0s)]
*  I'm cruising along. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1677.0s)]
*  It makes no sound. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1678.0s)]
*  It's very relaxing and peaceful. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1679.0s)]
*  But when I drive like the Camaro to work, it's like, I'm in a fucking doors video. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1681.0s)]
*  It's like, do, do, do, do, do, do, do. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1687.0s)]
*  It's a trip. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1691.0s)]
*  I'm on a Disney ride. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1693.0s)]
*  I'm in a Disney ride. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1694.0s)]
*  Are you jamming out to any music in that or do you just listen to the music? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1695.0s)]
*  I jammed out to music until I was halfway here and I'm like, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1698.0s)]
*  I didn't want to hear the music anymore. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1701.0s)]
*  I just wanted to hear the engine. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1702.0s)]
*  There's both things. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1704.0s)]
*  I have a Porsche 1993 RS America. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1705.0s)]
*  It's the rawest car I have. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1708.0s)]
*  It's not fast at all. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1710.0s)]
*  It only has like 300 horsepower. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1711.0s)]
*  It has no power steering. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1713.0s)]
*  It has no air conditioning. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1715.0s)]
*  It has no radio. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1716.0s)]
*  It has no nothing. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1717.0s)]
*  And it weighs like, you know, it's like, I don't know, 2000 something pounds. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1718.0s)]
*  It weighs nothing. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1722.0s)]
*  And it's so fun. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1723.0s)]
*  I'll bet. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1726.0s)]
*  It's so different than any other experience. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1727.0s)]
*  And it's not the fastest. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1730.0s)]
*  It's the slowest car I have for sure. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1731.0s)]
*  It's not that fast. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1733.0s)]
*  But it's every, every mile per hour, everything you're fucking feeling in your ass and in your hands. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1734.0s)]
*  And it's this raspy air cooled. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1744.0s)]
*  You don't have to be going fast. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1751.0s)]
*  It's just the feeling you're getting. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1753.0s)]
*  You're on a ride. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1755.0s)]
*  It requires all of you. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1757.0s)]
*  All of you. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1758.0s)]
*  It's like a motorcycle. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1759.0s)]
*  All connected. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1760.0s)]
*  You're making everything happen. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1761.0s)]
*  You're the one controlling it. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1762.0s)]
*  There's no computers. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1763.0s)]
*  There's no traction control that you have to really steer that bitch too, because there's no power steering. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1764.0s)]
*  So like when you're parallel parking, you got to fucking work your, you got to work your forearms. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1770.0s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1775.0s)]
*  But the feeling, the feedback you get is unprecedented. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1776.0s)]
*  It's just like, and they say it's even more so if you get to like this 1970 ones, like they take when they do like Chris Harris did that once. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1780.0s)]
*  He took a night. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1789.0s)]
*  I think it was a 1970 or 71 911 T. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1790.0s)]
*  See, you can find that video. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1794.0s)]
*  It's like Chris Harris, my perfect sports car. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1795.0s)]
*  And so he took this 911 T and he brought it to this guy who makes race cars and he had him fit it with a roll cage and ramp up the engine and tune the suspension. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1799.0s)]
*  And there's a video of him driving around the British countryside in this green 1970s Porsche. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1812.0s)]
*  And it's fucking amazing. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1819.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1821.0s)]
*  It's the it's what everybody loves about driving. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1822.0s)]
*  Just in one video. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1825.0s)]
*  This guy who's an automotive enthusiast, he can kind of get any car he wants. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1827.0s)]
*  I mean, Chris Harris is like the premier auto journalist of our time. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1832.0s)]
*  And he chooses to have this one little tiny lightweight stripped down car that he has built. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1835.0s)]
*  See, we found it. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1842.0s)]
*  Check this out. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1844.0s)]
*  Give me some volume. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1846.0s)]
*  I need volume. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1847.0s)]
*  There is an other side. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1848.0s)]
*  That's not it. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1849.0s)]
*  That's the singer DLS. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1850.0s)]
*  That's the nasty car to the one below it. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1851.0s)]
*  The one below it. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1854.0s)]
*  No, not singer. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1855.0s)]
*  Chris Harris, 911 put like my perfect sports car. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1856.0s)]
*  911, my perfect sports car. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1863.0s)]
*  That era of 911. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1865.0s)]
*  I mean, it's very similar to the muscle car vibe. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1867.0s)]
*  Yes, very. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1869.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1870.0s)]
*  Right to the second one down. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1871.0s)]
*  Remember the green 911. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1872.0s)]
*  That one. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1873.0s)]
*  So this is a car that Chris just like, you know, had built over time. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1876.0s)]
*  Just give me. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1882.0s)]
*  Let it go right there. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1883.0s)]
*  The chassis is probably the trickiest bit of all in this car. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1913.0s)]
*  I didn't just want an RS replica, so we went for the look of an ST, which for those of [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1916.0s)]
*  you less geeky than me on the subject of old 911s, is a car from 1971 with wider arches [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1920.0s)]
*  than an RS and no duck tail spoiler. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1926.0s)]
*  So we have eight and nine inch wheels. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1928.0s)]
*  The nines are rare and stupidly expensive, but they do look the business. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1930.0s)]
*  And that also means we have more mechanical grip and a wider track. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1934.0s)]
*  And we needed some trick dampers to deal with that. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1938.0s)]
*  The internals of the ones fitted to this car are very similar to the stuff fitted to Sebastian [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1940.0s)]
*  Roy. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1944.0s)]
*  Shit. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1945.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1946.0s)]
*  The name who runs the joint is to dampers what Gordon Ramsay is to Rose Lamb. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1948.0s)]
*  They cost a horrendous amount of money, but are well worth it. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1952.0s)]
*  Why do they sound so much smarter than we do? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1955.0s)]
*  That's why we use them for infomercials. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1957.0s)]
*  Dummies buy things from people of British accents. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1959.0s)]
*  Way more eloquent. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1962.0s)]
*  Shamwow. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1964.0s)]
*  The Shamwow guy was American, though, right? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1965.0s)]
*  That wasn't a guy. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1967.0s)]
*  He was a wild boy, right? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1968.0s)]
*  Didn't he get like a bit of hooker someplace like that? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1969.0s)]
*  Is that what he did? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1972.0s)]
*  He got arrested for biting a hooker. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1973.0s)]
*  I never would have guessed. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1975.0s)]
*  Seemed like a straight shooter. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1976.0s)]
*  I think he did that Shamwow, got that Shamwow money and started doing Shamwow money things. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1977.0s)]
*  Sounds good for him. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1982.0s)]
*  That's an American success story right there. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1983.0s)]
*  I think he's dead. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1985.0s)]
*  Is he dead? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1986.0s)]
*  Shamwow guy alive? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1987.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1988.0s)]
*  I think he's dead. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1989.0s)]
*  I think he's dead. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1990.0s)]
*  Is he dead? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1992.0s)]
*  Is Shamwow guy alive? [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1993.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1995.0s)]
*  Congratulations, sir. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1996.0s)]
*  I think it's the OxiClean. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1997.0s)]
*  Didn't he have a coke problem and killed himself? [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=1998.0s)]
*  The OxiClean guy? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2001.0s)]
*  Did he? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2002.0s)]
*  Billy Mays. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2003.0s)]
*  Oh, Dee did. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2004.0s)]
*  I'm still trying to get past the biting a hooker. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2005.0s)]
*  Was that just the problem with the negotiation on the front end? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2007.0s)]
*  Couldn't you just... [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2009.0s)]
*  It depends on what drugs he's on, what the hooker did. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2010.0s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2015.0s)]
*  Who knows what happened? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2017.0s)]
*  I don't know the story. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2018.0s)]
*  Very unfortunate for all involved. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2019.0s)]
*  But yeah, the Billy Mays guy, he was doing a lot of blow and he had a heart attack or [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2021.0s)]
*  something, right? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2025.0s)]
*  Is that what he died from, Jamie? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2026.0s)]
*  Not quite like that, but I don't want to go to get into it. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2027.0s)]
*  You don't want to get into it? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2031.0s)]
*  I'm friends with the sun. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2033.0s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2034.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2035.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, Jamie. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2036.0s)]
*  Sorry for bringing that up. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2037.0s)]
*  Sorry, buddy. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2038.0s)]
*  Anyway, who doesn't like to party? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2039.0s)]
*  Look, James Gandolfini, one of my favorite actors of all time. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2041.0s)]
*  That's how he went. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2044.0s)]
*  He's partied a little too hard. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2045.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2047.0s)]
*  Blew the ticker. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2048.0s)]
*  Dude, it didn't happen. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2049.0s)]
*  You know, leave it all on the field. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2050.0s)]
*  Not that it matters. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2052.0s)]
*  That's one of my all time favorite fucking shows. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2053.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2055.0s)]
*  Gandolfini was the first guy that you rooted for that was a murderer. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2056.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2059.0s)]
*  Like he was the hero. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2060.0s)]
*  The hero. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2061.0s)]
*  That song. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2062.0s)]
*  He murdered Christopher Moltisanti in the fucking...in the Cadillac. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2063.0s)]
*  Yeah, spoiler alert. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2068.0s)]
*  I mean, he was the first real, I think, on TV, the first real anti-hero. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2070.0s)]
*  If you really think about it, like, was there anybody before him? [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2077.0s)]
*  Jamie, can you think of anybody? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2080.0s)]
*  That'd been like 94, 95. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2082.0s)]
*  The Sopranos was later than that, I believe. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2085.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was like 2000s. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2088.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2089.0s)]
*  I think it was early 2000s. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2090.0s)]
*  I remember, like, thinking when I was watching, okay, this is totally different than anything [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2091.0s)]
*  ever. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2095.0s)]
*  Because they can do anything. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2096.0s)]
*  That intro, that score at the beginning. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2097.0s)]
*  It was so annoying being Italian then, because everybody wanted to talk like they were in [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2100.0s)]
*  the mob. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2104.0s)]
*  All the dumbest Italian guys in the East Coast, like, hey, that's our fucking thing. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2105.0s)]
*  This is our thing. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2109.0s)]
*  Shut your mouth. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2110.0s)]
*  Everybody wanted to be on the mob. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2111.0s)]
*  It was like, it's like people move into Montana because they saw Yellowstone. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2113.0s)]
*  It's like the same shit. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2117.0s)]
*  It's enticing, man. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2118.0s)]
*  Fuck, I watch it. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2119.0s)]
*  They sold it hard. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2120.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2121.0s)]
*  They sell it hard and they want to be a rancher. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2122.0s)]
*  You got to do rancher stuff. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2123.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2124.0s)]
*  You got to get up at fucking 3 in the morning, feed the cattle. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2125.0s)]
*  Bro, that's no joke. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2126.0s)]
*  That's real work. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2127.0s)]
*  You get into, like, shootouts and... [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2128.0s)]
*  Yeah, how are they getting into so many murders? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2129.0s)]
*  You're in their shoulder deep in a fucking cow trying to pull out the calf and doing all [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2131.0s)]
*  that shit. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2135.0s)]
*  I don't think people realize it's not just like all about distressed, like, leather boots [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2136.0s)]
*  and like, you know, cool jackets. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2141.0s)]
*  There's some fucking work there. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2143.0s)]
*  Backbreaking work, yeah. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2144.0s)]
*  But there's this amazing scene where this old cowboy is talking to this young guy and [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2146.0s)]
*  he's saying, you're going to be a great guy. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2153.0s)]
*  You're going to be a great guy. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2155.0s)]
*  This cowboy is talking to this young guy and he's saying, you're doing art for no audience. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2157.0s)]
*  Like, when you're out there. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2162.0s)]
*  What you're doing is you're doing art for no audience. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2164.0s)]
*  It's like, wow. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2167.0s)]
*  If you really love that, that is what it is. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2168.0s)]
*  That's an interesting way of looking at it. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2171.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2173.0s)]
*  And we're doing it. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2174.0s)]
*  We're plastering it all over Instagram and the internet and YouTube and trying to get [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2175.0s)]
*  everybody to see it. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2178.0s)]
*  With an audience. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2179.0s)]
*  Yeah, with an audience. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2180.0s)]
*  Doing art for an audience. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2181.0s)]
*  It's interesting, though, because it is kind of what that is. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2182.0s)]
*  There's something about like cattle wrangling and all that stuff that somehow or another [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2185.0s)]
*  speaks to human beings because I think we evolve doing that. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2189.0s)]
*  And I think like tending to the land and I think farmers have that sort of same feel, too. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2193.0s)]
*  There's something about that that's just like natural with human beings. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2198.0s)]
*  And it just there's a natural human reward system that's involved with cultivating your [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2203.0s)]
*  own food and being involved in a farm that I think it just centers people in a very unusual [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2208.0s)]
*  way because I think it's like your body's designed for a certain amount of that. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2214.0s)]
*  You know, I think it's a good thing. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2219.0s)]
*  Even if it's glamorizing and unrealistic light and it does make people go and say they sell [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2222.0s)]
*  their business and they go out there and they're going to become a rancher and they fail. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2228.0s)]
*  But at least it is pushing some people to get back to that wilderness living like I [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2231.0s)]
*  think it's a good thing. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2238.0s)]
*  Most people aren't cut out for it. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2239.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2241.0s)]
*  There's a lot of people. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2242.0s)]
*  I think I've heard that Paulie Shores was it Son-in-law? [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2243.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2245.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2246.0s)]
*  I'll bet you there's so much of that going on out there in Montana. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2247.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2250.0s)]
*  Billings and shit like that. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2251.0s)]
*  Well, there's something going on in Wyoming. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2252.0s)]
*  Jeffree Star, who's this famous YouTuber who like is like a... [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2255.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2260.0s)]
*  Are they transgender or is he gay? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2261.0s)]
*  He's very flamboyant, very fun. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2264.0s)]
*  But he's like involved in some dispute with his neighbor or just said his neighbor tried [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2267.0s)]
*  to kill him, run him off the road and I don't know what the fuck is going on, but he's [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2272.0s)]
*  making Instagram videos about it. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2275.0s)]
*  Like, can you imagine some rancher and Jeffree Star moves next door? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2277.0s)]
*  Have you seen... [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2281.0s)]
*  He's throwing parties. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2282.0s)]
*  I haven't seen it. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2283.0s)]
*  No. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2284.0s)]
*  He wouldn't exactly fit in. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2285.0s)]
*  But maybe he would. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2286.0s)]
*  I mean, maybe they're open-minded. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2287.0s)]
*  I don't know what's going on, so I can't really comment. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2288.0s)]
*  You think he's going down to Tractor Supply and buying a couple bags of feed? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2290.0s)]
*  It might be. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2293.0s)]
*  It'd be fun. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2294.0s)]
*  Some Carhartts. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2295.0s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2296.0s)]
*  Yeah, Carhartts. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2297.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2298.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2299.0s)]
*  I don't know what they're doing, but it's like... [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2300.0s)]
*  RuPaul bought a fucking ranch, too. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2306.0s)]
*  RuPaul bought some giant ranch in Wyoming. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2309.0s)]
*  Lives on a ranch. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2312.0s)]
*  How many people out there have been in that industry? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2313.0s)]
*  They've been in Montana, they've been in Wyoming their whole lives, and they're making a fortune [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2316.0s)]
*  off of selling ranching supplies? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2319.0s)]
*  All this stuff that they say for these people that come in, they've just moved. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2322.0s)]
*  Like, I'm starting a ranch. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2325.0s)]
*  What do I need? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2326.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2327.0s)]
*  I'm going to set you up. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2328.0s)]
*  So what you're going to need is... [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2329.0s)]
*  A ranch starter kit. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2330.0s)]
*  You imagine starting a ranch from scratch? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2331.0s)]
*  What? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2334.0s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2335.0s)]
*  Do you know how to do this? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2336.0s)]
*  Are you crazy? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2337.0s)]
*  You're going to learn a curve. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2338.0s)]
*  You're going to die. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2339.0s)]
*  How many cows do I need? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2340.0s)]
*  Several. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2341.0s)]
*  A whole mess of them. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2342.0s)]
*  That should actually be a fun reality show. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2343.0s)]
*  Didn't Jeremy Clark do that? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2345.0s)]
*  Did he do something like that? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2347.0s)]
*  Didn't Jeremy Clark start a farm? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2349.0s)]
*  I believe he did. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2350.0s)]
*  I think he did it for a television show. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2351.0s)]
*  And the same kind of deal. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2354.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's got to be all encompassing. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2356.0s)]
*  You'd be exhausted. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2359.0s)]
*  Yeah, Clarkson's Farm. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2360.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2362.0s)]
*  This is episode one surviving. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2364.0s)]
*  Dude, it's all changing. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2367.0s)]
*  Everything's changing in this country because they're moving. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2368.0s)]
*  Austin's a good example. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2371.0s)]
*  Years ago, it was Texas. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2372.0s)]
*  It's just badass, fucking cowboy stuff. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2375.0s)]
*  And now it's... [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2378.0s)]
*  Well, Austin was always very blue. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2379.0s)]
*  Austin's always been this blue spot in a red state. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2382.0s)]
*  And it's always been very progressive. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2385.0s)]
*  And one of the funniest things that I've ever seen that's pretty accurate is a T-shirt that said, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2387.0s)]
*  Keep Austin weird and surrounded. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2391.0s)]
*  It's like you need the balance. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2395.0s)]
*  You need the balance. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2398.0s)]
*  Because if you're in a place like San Francisco or LA, there's no fucking balance. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2399.0s)]
*  There's no Republicans on the outside. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2403.0s)]
*  Even the progressives here are so much more reasonable than the progressives in LA [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2407.0s)]
*  because they encounter rational opposition to their ideas all the time. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2412.0s)]
*  And that stuff only works in urban environments. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2418.0s)]
*  Progressive ideology and the policies they push with homelessness and crime and defunding the police. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2422.0s)]
*  That shit only works. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2430.0s)]
*  And it doesn't work. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2432.0s)]
*  It doesn't work at all. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2433.0s)]
*  But you can only get away with it in urban environments. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2434.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2436.0s)]
*  In the country, no one's buying any of that. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2437.0s)]
*  No. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2439.0s)]
*  It's just like people work too hard. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2440.0s)]
*  It's like if you want to get by, if you're fucking in a rural area, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2442.0s)]
*  no one's interested in that nonsense yourself. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2446.0s)]
*  Fuck no. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2449.0s)]
*  So the beautiful thing about Texas is Austin is just like, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2450.0s)]
*  Small city. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2453.0s)]
*  There's like a million plus people. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2454.0s)]
*  Not that many. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2455.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2456.0s)]
*  And then there's another million on the outside. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2457.0s)]
*  And then outside of it is just Texas. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2458.0s)]
*  Outside of his Buc-E's and fireworks. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2462.0s)]
*  Dude, that's what I'm talking about. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2465.0s)]
*  Gun stores. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2467.0s)]
*  It's like, it's ranches. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2468.0s)]
*  It's like that keeps Austin balanced. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2470.0s)]
*  Where they don't get too off the rails. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2474.0s)]
*  They don't go to Portland. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2476.0s)]
*  I'm going to ask you about the homeless stuff. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2477.0s)]
*  We were here, what, two years ago? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2479.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2481.0s)]
*  Yeah, two or three years ago. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2482.0s)]
*  It was really, really getting, it was height of, you know, pandemic stuff and all that. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2483.0s)]
*  But man, last night going around, it's way different. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2487.0s)]
*  Yeah, they cleaned it up. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2490.0s)]
*  They did it in a very intelligent way. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2491.0s)]
*  They acquired hotels and they bought buildings and house people. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2494.0s)]
*  And they have a bunch of different programs they do to try to help people get back on their feet. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2499.0s)]
*  And they discourage camping. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2504.0s)]
*  They won't let people camp. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2506.0s)]
*  You just can't camp under the bridges. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2507.0s)]
*  They clean up your shit. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2509.0s)]
*  They'll take you out of there. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2510.0s)]
*  They'll let you know that there's resources available for you. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2511.0s)]
*  But the real problem in all these cases is mental illness. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2515.0s)]
*  That's the real problem. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2519.0s)]
*  Mental illness and drug addiction. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2520.0s)]
*  And both of those things kind of go hand in hand. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2522.0s)]
*  And a lot of those folks are like badly, badly addicted to drugs. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2524.0s)]
*  And they can't sustain themselves. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2528.0s)]
*  And they can't support themselves. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2530.0s)]
*  And I don't think encouraging them to just camp out everywhere like they do in San Francisco. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2531.0s)]
*  And they actually give them money for doing that. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2536.0s)]
*  That doesn't help anybody. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2538.0s)]
*  It's not helping them. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2540.0s)]
*  It's not helping your community. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2541.0s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2542.0s)]
*  And everybody knows it. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2543.0s)]
*  You don't think that enabling them and giving them like needles and stuff like California does is beneficial? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2544.0s)]
*  I think just give them everybody's money. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2549.0s)]
*  All the money. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2551.0s)]
*  If they were rich, they'd have no problems. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2552.0s)]
*  Just give them all a million dollars. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2553.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2555.0s)]
*  All the money we're spending in Ukraine is only like 2,000 homeless people. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2556.0s)]
*  They could afford that. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2559.0s)]
*  Dude, I don't know. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2560.0s)]
*  I don't know if it kills your problems. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2561.0s)]
*  Look at fucking Shamuel guy. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2562.0s)]
*  Different problems. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2563.0s)]
*  Amplifies it maybe. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2565.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2567.0s)]
*  I mean, if you just gave them money, it wouldn't help. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2568.0s)]
*  You really, I don't know what to do. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2570.0s)]
*  I mean, I think that like when a person is that fucked, when their mind is that fucked, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2572.0s)]
*  and they're that far gone in terms of life, they have no hope, and they're just covered in filth and they're living in a tent. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2577.0s)]
*  So taking that person and rebuilding them is a massive project. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2584.0s)]
*  It's probably going to take as much time to make them normal as it took for them to get that fucked up. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2589.0s)]
*  So you think about like childhood abuse, sexual abuse, violence, detention, juvenile system. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2595.0s)]
*  They've gone through jail. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2603.0s)]
*  They've gone through so many different things. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2605.0s)]
*  They have no hope that life is eventually going to be awesome. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2607.0s)]
*  When you wake up, you go to an awesome job. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2611.0s)]
*  You guys have a cool place. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2613.0s)]
*  You work with cool people. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2614.0s)]
*  You make awesome shit. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2615.0s)]
*  That feels good. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2616.0s)]
*  That's like a good feeling. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2618.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2619.0s)]
*  These guys never have good feelings unless they're getting high. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2620.0s)]
*  And that's what's that's the scary thing is like you get them out of that and then they're going to be depressed. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2622.0s)]
*  They have nothing going on. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2626.0s)]
*  They're 43 years old. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2627.0s)]
*  They've never had a job. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2629.0s)]
*  Like, how do you fix that? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2630.0s)]
*  You don't fix it by just letting them camp. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2632.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what the solution is because at a certain point in time, it's like it's so hard to turn people around and they have to want to turn around. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2634.0s)]
*  So like it has to be in them that they somehow or another want to do better because some people don't want to do better. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2644.0s)]
*  They just want to stay high. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2650.0s)]
*  You know, they just like I feel better when I'm high. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2652.0s)]
*  I just want to stay high. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2654.0s)]
*  And they just do. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2655.0s)]
*  Just get caught in that rut. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2656.0s)]
*  You got a lot of huge mega churches out there that aren't doing nothing for them. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2658.0s)]
*  You know, tens of thousands of people in arenas and I mean, they're not doing shit. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2663.0s)]
*  I don't think they can do anything. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2670.0s)]
*  This is what they're not doing. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2672.0s)]
*  Anything. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2673.0s)]
*  They're not doing anything. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2674.0s)]
*  But I don't think they can do anything. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2675.0s)]
*  I don't think I don't know what you can do other than what they've done in Austin. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2676.0s)]
*  But Austin is like I had the mayor on Stephen Adler and we talked about it. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2680.0s)]
*  And one of the things that he said was like I it's my goal before I leave office to put a handle on this homeless thing. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2685.0s)]
*  If I don't do that, I failed. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2692.0s)]
*  And I think he did it. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2693.0s)]
*  But the thing with he said was we can do it because we only have somewhere in the neighborhood of 2000 homeless people. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2694.0s)]
*  He goes Los Angeles is unmanageable. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2701.0s)]
*  They have like 100000 homeless people. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2703.0s)]
*  When you get to that point, have you ever seen Skid Row in downtown L.A.? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2705.0s)]
*  Never in person. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2710.0s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2711.0s)]
*  I saw it in person in the early 2000s before the pandemic and it was nuts then. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2712.0s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2718.0s)]
*  And it was engineered. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2720.0s)]
*  They used to take people when they would arrest them and dump them off on Skid Row. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2721.0s)]
*  They'd take people and bring them there like they literally set up these homeless shelters and they set up these food banks and they set up and these people just live on the street. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2726.0s)]
*  It's a zombie movie. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2736.0s)]
*  It's so crazy when you go down there. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2738.0s)]
*  And when I what is this? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2740.0s)]
*  This is saying that there's up to 10000 people now homeless in Austin. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2742.0s)]
*  10000. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2746.0s)]
*  Yeah, one percent of the population. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2747.0s)]
*  What? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2749.0s)]
*  According to the city of Austin's own count. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2750.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2751.0s)]
*  Is this new? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2752.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2753.0s)]
*  I mean, they're all they moved them out of the downtown area under the bridges and they all live out in the parks now, apparently. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2754.0s)]
*  Oh, and like state parks? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2758.0s)]
*  Not even state parks like City of the City parks. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2759.0s)]
*  This is Zilker Park, I think. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2761.0s)]
*  What? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2762.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2763.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2764.0s)]
*  That's crazy, man. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2765.0s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2767.0s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2768.0s)]
*  So they just got it out of view. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2769.0s)]
*  Is that what they did? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2770.0s)]
*  Yeah, I believe so. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2771.0s)]
*  So what it is is like there's different people that have to patrol that. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2772.0s)]
*  It might be different than the cops that are patrolling people on the streets. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2777.0s)]
*  168 different camps across the city. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2780.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2782.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2783.0s)]
*  Often hidden from public view in the woods. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2786.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2788.0s)]
*  Dude, it's kind of like, you know, sweeping the floor. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2789.0s)]
*  Okay, take everything I said back. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2792.0s)]
*  They didn't fix it. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2794.0s)]
*  They just got it off the streets. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2795.0s)]
*  Just blew the lid off of that one. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2796.0s)]
*  They just got it off the streets and now there's campments. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2797.0s)]
*  Back when your mom said clean the room. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2799.0s)]
*  I did a great job. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2800.0s)]
*  Yeah, right under the rug. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2801.0s)]
*  All under the bed. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2803.0s)]
*  So those all marks on the map that are homeless encampments? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2805.0s)]
*  Yeah, as of, published for 26, I think that as of June. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2808.0s)]
*  And so they think there's 10,000 people? [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2814.0s)]
*  Is this like some New York Post exaggeration? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2816.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2819.0s)]
*  But that's what the Austin City thinks? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2820.0s)]
*  Yeah, City of Austin counts. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2823.0s)]
*  What do we know about homelessness in Austin? [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2825.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2827.0s)]
*  So that's the case then when the mayor was on, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2828.0s)]
*  which was a couple of years ago, the numbers gone up by 8,000 people. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2830.0s)]
*  There's another crazy story. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2834.0s)]
*  So I was looking while you guys are talking, that Mayfair Hotel in LA. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2835.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2839.0s)]
*  But that's come up in a bunch of documentaries and all that stuff. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2840.0s)]
*  They just paid, the city paid $11.5 million in damages because they used that [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2842.0s)]
*  and what they called Project Room Key, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2847.0s)]
*  which got a bunch of people off the street into housing. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2849.0s)]
*  But immediately drug use, damages in the hallways, violence, all sorts of stuff. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2852.0s)]
*  Now the city wants to buy that building for like $83 million. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2858.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2861.0s)]
*  And do what? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2862.0s)]
*  House homeless people and just let it stay? [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2863.0s)]
*  If you're telling me they gave them a free room and they destroyed it. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2865.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're a little self-destructive. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2868.0s)]
*  They're not in the best state of mind. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2871.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know how we got into that subject. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2873.0s)]
*  You said something about Buc-E's. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2876.0s)]
*  Have you seen the Buc-E's? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2878.0s)]
*  They're making a mess. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2879.0s)]
*  No, they're building one in Mexico, but it's not a Buc-E's. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2880.0s)]
*  It's a knockoff? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2885.0s)]
*  Yeah, they've got them cease and desist and all that shit and they're still building it. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2886.0s)]
*  Did you see what they did with In-N-Out? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2889.0s)]
*  In Mexico, they have, it's not In-N-Out, it's like In-N-Out, something like that. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2891.0s)]
*  See, like, copycat, it's the same logo, it's the same look. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2901.0s)]
*  Yeah, so it's not called In-N-Out. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2906.0s)]
*  It's not called In-N-Out, what is it called? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2908.0s)]
*  So this is in CulecÃ¡n, Mexico. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2913.0s)]
*  In-I-N-Out. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2916.0s)]
*  It looks exactly like In-N-Out. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2918.0s)]
*  When you go there, the burgers are all the same, the trays are the same, animal style, the whole thing's the same. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2921.0s)]
*  They just stole the menu, they stole the way it looks, and they barely changed the name. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2927.0s)]
*  Gotta applaud their effort there. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2933.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's not like they're making Ferraris, it's a fucking cheeseburger. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2935.0s)]
*  You can make a cheeseburger exactly like that cheeseburger. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2940.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you could also come up with your own name. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2944.0s)]
*  Or you could just say, fuck you, I live in Mexico. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2946.0s)]
*  Ride the coattails. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2952.0s)]
*  Yeah, what they could do is just eventually change the name. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2953.0s)]
*  Oh, Buck Two's Super Mercado, look at the fucking GoFerrari and everything. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2956.0s)]
*  Same as the Bucky's guy. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2961.0s)]
*  Quite as big as the Texas version. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2963.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a little downsized. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2965.0s)]
*  Bucky's is an impressive establishment though. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2967.0s)]
*  It's a Walmart. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2969.0s)]
*  You go in there, you're like, what is this? This is insane, is that a gas station? [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2970.0s)]
*  You'd go broke at the beef jerky market. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2974.0s)]
*  You've been to the beef jerky buffet? [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2977.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's preposterous. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2979.0s)]
*  I mean, you gotta try a little bit of everything. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2980.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a ridiculous place. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2982.0s)]
*  It's so Texas, that's why I talk about it on stage, because it's so fucking Texas. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2984.0s)]
*  It's so ridiculous. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2988.0s)]
*  Speaking of on stage, fucking last night, dude, thank you. It was phenomenal. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2989.0s)]
*  Thank you, glad you guys had a good time. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2995.0s)]
*  Dude, phenomenal time. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2997.0s)]
*  You run that place and your whole entire staff, I mean, hats off. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=2999.0s)]
*  It's like watching an orchestra, like seriously. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3002.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're all very good. Everybody's great. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3005.0s)]
*  It's a lovely little environment that we've created. It's real fun. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3007.0s)]
*  And everybody loves it. It's like everybody's having a good time. It's real nice. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3011.0s)]
*  And you're working your fucking ass off. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3016.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're doing a lot of work. But it's not work. It's talking shit. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3017.0s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3022.0s)]
*  I always do my fucking hats off to you the way, I mean, you're busting ass there. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3023.0s)]
*  Man, I don't know where the fuck you get the energy from. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3027.0s)]
*  Vitamins. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3030.0s)]
*  I'm 40 years old and I look at you, I'm like, God damn. What am I doing wrong? [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3031.0s)]
*  I'm used to doing it, but I'm used to doing it. I do it every day. It's normal. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3034.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're on the gas. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3037.0s)]
*  It's fun, but it's fun. It's just fun. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3039.0s)]
*  When you're doing stand-up, the hard part is the writing. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3041.0s)]
*  The writing and the creating new bits and working them out on stage. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3044.0s)]
*  That's the tricky part, the hard part. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3047.0s)]
*  But the fun part is just having a good time. People have fun. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3049.0s)]
*  It's just having a good time. You're just making a good time. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3053.0s)]
*  It's a great environment and a cool place. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3057.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's beautiful. Just like I was saying, you guys have this great job. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3059.0s)]
*  You go and do something that's very rewarding. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3063.0s)]
*  That's what owning a comedy club is like. It's like we're providing this really fun experience. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3065.0s)]
*  You can go, have a couple of drinks, laugh, have a great time, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3072.0s)]
*  fun people, nice people, loving people. It's fun. Beautiful environment. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3077.0s)]
*  There's only a few jobs in the world that provide that. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3083.0s)]
*  For us, you almost live there. It's not a job, it becomes a lifestyle. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3088.0s)]
*  The shop, I spend more time there than I do anywhere else. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3092.0s)]
*  Because that's what you do. That's the lifestyle that you live. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3096.0s)]
*  All the different personalities have to figure their spot, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3101.0s)]
*  figure out how to get along with each other. That could be a real issue. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3105.0s)]
*  It can be. That could be a very interesting issue. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3109.0s)]
*  We've got 95 people total. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3112.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3115.0s)]
*  There's different personalities, different talents, different personalities. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3116.0s)]
*  There are artists, there are craftsmen. Imagine having 95 comics all living in the same... [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3122.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're going to have issues. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3130.0s)]
*  Especially if they're around each other all day. We only see each other at night. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3133.0s)]
*  You go through your whole day and most of these guys are playing golf or doing something else. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3138.0s)]
*  Then they come to the club. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3142.0s)]
*  I think there's a lot of similarities in any type of art and creation. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3144.0s)]
*  Because you are getting some of that instant gratification as far as you're gratifying yourself with what you're creating. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3150.0s)]
*  But you also get from that customer and you get stuff. You're doing the same thing in the comic stuff. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3155.0s)]
*  It's not like you're putting in the work now and then a year from now you'll see if it paid off or not. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3159.0s)]
*  Throughout the night you're knowing right now if it's hitting or not hitting or working. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3166.0s)]
*  There's something I guess different. I'm looking at a corporate job of somebody going and pushing papers [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3171.0s)]
*  and having to wait for a year review before somebody said that you actually moved the needle or did a good job. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3176.0s)]
*  Right. How much joy are you getting from what you're doing every day? That's the big one. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3182.0s)]
*  Because if you can have a job that pays more money but you hate it, that's not a good trade off. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3186.0s)]
*  You want to feel good. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3193.0s)]
*  At all the things in life, if you get sick, what's the first thing you think? [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3197.0s)]
*  God, I really should have appreciated when I wasn't sick. I really should have taken care of myself better. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3202.0s)]
*  I really should have been more careful. I should have got more sleep. I should have taken my vitamins. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3207.0s)]
*  You vow, like when I get better I'm going to appreciate this. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3211.0s)]
*  That applies to jobs too. If you have a job that sucks and you fucking hate it, you hate what you do, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3216.0s)]
*  and you do it all the time and you're just in there because you have to be there all day, your day is dread. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3225.0s)]
*  If you can get paid less to do something that makes you feel better, that's so much more valuable. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3231.0s)]
*  As long as you can get by, you are so much better off getting paid less. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3238.0s)]
*  And enjoying what you do. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3243.0s)]
*  Unless you have a family and you have to support people and you have obligations. I understand. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3245.0s)]
*  I'm not saying you should go fucking risk your life on a whim. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3248.0s)]
*  But I am saying that if you can pick a path in life that is more enjoyable, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3251.0s)]
*  I feel like there's a lot of miserable rich people. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3256.0s)]
*  That's not the end all be. It's a trap. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3262.0s)]
*  What you really want is to feel good. You really want to feel good about your purpose in life. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3265.0s)]
*  The things you do, the way it impacts other people. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3269.0s)]
*  And that's what you guys do. The look on people's faces when you deliver those cars. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3272.0s)]
*  For us that's what gets you out of bed every morning. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3277.0s)]
*  Because it's hard work. Just like how you're out there sweating your ass off and busting your balls. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3281.0s)]
*  And I'm sure sometimes it's tough. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3285.0s)]
*  Building cars is the same way. They rip your heart out. They challenge you. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3287.0s)]
*  It is tough, tough work. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3290.0s)]
*  But the finished product, the goal, and what makes it all worthwhile is giving you a car. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3292.0s)]
*  And you drive it and you're like, holy fuck. The thing's badass. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3296.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter if we made money, lost money. What's going on? [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3299.0s)]
*  That's the goal. That's what I thrive on. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3303.0s)]
*  That was going to be my point when you hit on it. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3306.0s)]
*  You're coming from the mentality of you're going to always work as hard as you have to. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3309.0s)]
*  And then some to be successful at what you're doing. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3315.0s)]
*  And then because you've put in the work, you're achieving goals, which is what makes you happy. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3318.0s)]
*  There's people out there that don't want to put in the work. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3323.0s)]
*  And they're unhappy because they're not seeing success. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3326.0s)]
*  But they're not seeing success or being gratified or being happy with what they're doing. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3328.0s)]
*  Because they're not willing to put in the work either. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3331.0s)]
*  They don't know what to do. Some people just have no experience in putting in the work. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3333.0s)]
*  They don't know what that even means. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3337.0s)]
*  They don't know what grind. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3339.0s)]
*  Yeah. They didn't have... [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3340.0s)]
*  That's one of the things that I think is very important about kids with competition. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3342.0s)]
*  Any kind of competition, whether it's chess or whether it's athletics, sports, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3346.0s)]
*  there's something about realizing that hard work equals getting better. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3351.0s)]
*  And hard work equals performance. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3355.0s)]
*  You perform better when you work hard. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3357.0s)]
*  And you learn that. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3360.0s)]
*  The extreme examples are like wrestling. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3361.0s)]
*  People go through wrestling practice. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3364.0s)]
*  You realize this is hard to do. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3366.0s)]
*  And if you can get good at this, you can kind of get good at anything. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3369.0s)]
*  Because if you can push yourself mentally to deal with the grind of wrestling practice, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3373.0s)]
*  you can kind of do anything. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3377.0s)]
*  But it's just if you can learn that lesson early on though about working hard... [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3379.0s)]
*  Some people don't ever learn it. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3384.0s)]
*  They just play video games and eat Twinkies. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3385.0s)]
*  And then one day they're 40. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3387.0s)]
*  And they're like, I've got to get my shit together. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3389.0s)]
*  Wrestling practice, like you said, being at wrestling practice and doing it hard is hard. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3391.0s)]
*  Becoming a good wrestler is even harder because it's not just at wrestling practice. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3395.0s)]
*  Like you said, it's when you come back from wrestling practice and thinking that you deserve a fucking treat [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3400.0s)]
*  because you worked really fucking hard that day and you need to eat like shit, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3404.0s)]
*  or you need to do this, or you get to go into... [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3407.0s)]
*  It's all of the lifestyle to perform at a high level that's fucking hard, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3409.0s)]
*  not just the act of doing what you're trying to do. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3413.0s)]
*  Well, especially when you get to like a championship level. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3416.0s)]
*  When you get to like, you know, All-American, state champs, national champs. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3418.0s)]
*  I mean, those guys, there's not a stone unturned. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3423.0s)]
*  Those guys are animals. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3426.0s)]
*  They're doing everything exactly the right way because the competition is so stiff. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3427.0s)]
*  If you don't do it, the edge between you and another guy who's equally talented but works harder, [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3432.0s)]
*  he's going to get better than you. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3436.0s)]
*  He's going to bypass you. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3437.0s)]
*  And you feel it in practice. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3438.0s)]
*  There's guys that, you know, you know, are running in the morning before practice. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3440.0s)]
*  You know, these guys are doing the stairs. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3444.0s)]
*  Those guys have more gas. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3446.0s)]
*  Those guys are more driven. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3448.0s)]
*  And you always notice because those are the guys that win in the training room. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3449.0s)]
*  And that's the same with Jiu-Jitsu. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3453.0s)]
*  It's the same with kickboxing, with everything. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3455.0s)]
*  Like any, the guys who, there's guys that are like very naturally talented. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3457.0s)]
*  For whatever reason, they just have great genetics and they learn things better. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3462.0s)]
*  But oftentimes those guys don't work as hard. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3466.0s)]
*  Like sometimes the really naturally talented guys are a little lazy because it kind of came easy to them. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3469.0s)]
*  They get outworked. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3473.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3474.0s)]
*  Which the rare ones are the ones that are super talented and also crazy disciplined. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3475.0s)]
*  That's how you get a Michael Jordan. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3481.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3483.0s)]
*  And Mike Tyson. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3484.0s)]
*  You get crazy discipline and insane talent and insane genetics. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3485.0s)]
*  And then you're fucked because you're not going to beat that person. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3490.0s)]
*  There's only a few of those. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3493.0s)]
*  It's devoting everything to just winning and like nothing else matters. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3495.0s)]
*  That's the goal. That's the only direction. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3499.0s)]
*  You sacrifice everything else to get to that level. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3501.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think that's not good either, right? [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3504.0s)]
*  Your fucking, your life is a disaster, but there's one thing you do you're the best at. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3507.0s)]
*  That's interesting too. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3512.0s)]
*  Competition. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3514.0s)]
*  You either have that competitive, I want to be better or you don't. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3515.0s)]
*  Do you guys make cars like thinking about shows, thinking about like SEMA and showing people up? [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3521.0s)]
*  You know, we used to do stuff like that, you know, where you're like you're competing for an award, but it's not. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3527.0s)]
*  You're never looking at like I'm going to do this because I want to win this award. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3534.0s)]
*  You're just trying to make the best possible car you can. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3538.0s)]
*  And it's great like at the finish line if you get said award. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3541.0s)]
*  And sometimes you've got some customers that like that. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3545.0s)]
*  You know, some guys are like trophy chasing or they like parking the car and sitting at the show and, you know, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3548.0s)]
*  waiting there for the award ceremony and getting that half million dollar car and you get that fifty dollar plaque and it makes it all worthwhile. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3554.0s)]
*  No, man, I mean, we've changed gears like quite a bit over the years that for me it's the driving experience, you know, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3562.0s)]
*  making a car that's like so functional, workable. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3569.0s)]
*  That's just a blast to get in and drive. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3573.0s)]
*  And it's more rewarding like getting a guy like dude comes up to the shop, picks up a car and drives it a thousand miles home. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3576.0s)]
*  That's better than getting that little plaque. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3584.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3587.0s)]
*  At a car show because you blew through an extra like seven hundred thousand dollars trying to make something over the top. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3588.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3593.0s)]
*  All for that, you know. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3594.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3595.0s)]
*  And most of those cars are not drivable at that point or you're going to be scared to death to drive it. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3596.0s)]
*  Not drivable? [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3601.0s)]
*  When you're going to like the, you know, insane show car trying to win every indoor award. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3602.0s)]
*  Really? They're not drivable? [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3607.0s)]
*  When you look at our industry. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3608.0s)]
*  Laughing at me. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3610.0s)]
*  No, when you look at our industry, it's it's wacky like the stuff you see that's so over-the-fucking-top like those hero cars and stuff [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3611.0s)]
*  That's not something you're gonna jump in and drive. You're not driving that to work [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3618.76s)]
*  When you say hero cars you talking about like those Baja racer things? [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3622.48s)]
*  No, you see stuff that's like like [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3625.76s)]
*  Riddler [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3627.96s)]
*  Seema show coverage or like these the biggest like the Riddler word like Josh says you've got these cars that are like million two million dollar [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3629.16s)]
*  Builds right chrome plated rotors. Yeah, and felt pads [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3636.68s)]
*  You know, this is like show car show car. Oh, so you can't even drive it at all [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3640.16s)]
*  No, you can turn out of the trailer. Yeah, and the tires are all wrapped in saran wrap [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3644.3599999999997s)]
*  So the tires don't get dirty and what yeah [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3648.16s)]
*  Really? Yeah, it's kind of like going away now [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3650.96s)]
*  Thank goodness because of the the audience and the or the customers are changing right and they're wanting to use these cars, right? [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3654.0s)]
*  But everybody was so focused on chasing that trophy or going to a go into a show and winning that trophy [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3660.12s)]
*  We want to go and make a good showing for the company with whatever we bring, right? [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3666.2799999999997s)]
*  But worrying about a panel of judges or somebody judging the car and them deciding what's cool [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3669.96s)]
*  That would be like you not having an audience and just having like Simon Cowell and Paula Abdul saying if it was a good joke [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3675.12s)]
*  Or not, you know, you want yeah, you want the group you want you to know that you're doing good and by the audience [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3681.68s)]

*  What it would be the purpose of felt rotors so it doesn't scratch the chrome and stuff like that [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3695.08s)]
*  It's they these are show car. It's it's felt pads and chrome rotors. Yes. You know the trailer man. That's it [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3699.76s)]

*  Right that's you're out that he's working out [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3733.88s)]
*  He wants to just fucking accelerate down right field like a rocket ship versus someone who just wants to [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3736.48s)]
*  Want to like just be a mass monster right? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3742.92s)]
*  Yeah, I just don't understand why anybody would want to make a car that they're not gonna drive [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3746.4s)]
*  I just that mindset that doesn't I don't get that at all like there's only one reason to have a car [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3750.76s)]
*  It's like I mean, dude [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=3756.68s)]

*  Things awful [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5155.36s)]
*  Things awful, but the cult following the shop that's building it and the customer they've got a vision [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5156.94s)]
*  They're gonna take that and modernize and do a bunch of crazy cool shit, but yeah, that's see that [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5161.54s)]
*  I've seen people do stuff like that with like for with Ford f40s [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5166.1s)]
*  You know yeah, I've seen them do stuff like that. It's pretty interesting [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5171.22s)]
*  You know like modem and widebody them and that cars tiny [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5175.02s)]

*  40 that's a sick car [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5189.58s)]
*  But a lot of people have done things to those like taking them and like [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5192.2s)]
*  Extremely modded them you put twin turbo engines in them and wide bodied them and shit. It's just like wow [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5196.58s)]
*  Well super performance brought those back so they made it available because you get like an exact reproduction of that car [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5203.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh really they're starting with kit car to do that the original ones are worth millions who does that super performance? [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5209.58s)]
*  They do a ton of su su super super super performance [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5215.7s)]
*  Okay, they do a lot of the Cobras and stuff and they're fucking bad [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5220.42s)]
*  It's a it's a nicely built piece, but that's a car. You don't need that kind of power [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5223.74s)]
*  And I mean that things like this big yeah, they're so tiny [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5227.58s)]
*  That's why it's crazy that people are putting like twin turbocharged thousand horsepower engines. Yeah there you go wow [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5230.54s)]
*  That'd be along the lines of the Porsche you're talking about just analog is holy shit look at that thing [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5236.98s)]
*  Yeah, they do they do a good job [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5244.0199999999995s)]
*  So they build a brand new one [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5246.160000000001s)]
*  It's a brand new built exactly like the original car was built except the body's not aluminum wow [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5248.160000000001s)]
*  It's like it's Shelby license it goes in the register, too [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5253.68s)]
*  And is it is it all modern suspension and exact duplicate of what was there so it drives like the original car [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5256.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think they got like a ZF transaxle in them or something like that which would be like a Pantera kind of [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5264.56s)]
*  Transaxle [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5270.38s)]
*  Toilovers and brakes, but yeah, but that's it yeah, so just some suspension components little mild upgrades and same horsepower [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5271.88s)]
*  Doing modern motors. Yeah, you can put whatever you want in them, but that's a good example [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5280.34s)]
*  That's like the Porsche example like put the right like 500 horsepower in that the things gonna be a thrill [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5284.14s)]
*  We're just an absolute blast to drive yeah, and if you went too much it probably be unmanageable right yeah [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5289.9400000000005s)]
*  like mid-engine like [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5296.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's interesting how [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5298.92s)]
*  Mid-engine cars like this like in America all we have is the Corvette [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5301.76s)]
*  Right that's what we've got now. I mean now you get the Corvette you get the new GT [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5306.88s)]
*  Which isn't exactly mainstream is that the c8 yeah, and the I have the old GT of a 2005 [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5310.84s)]

*  That's not like but as far as production cars like the Corvette is like the first time [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5321.6s)]
*  America has like made like a mass production car yeah, you've never gravitated to the newer vets [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5325.900000000001s)]

*  It's like Porsche still gets it Mustang still gets it, but they don't get it when you get up to like the GT 500 [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5342.22s)]
*  That was the old thing about the old GT 500 you could only get it in a stick. Yeah, I had like a [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5347.9400000000005s)]

*  Yeah, it's so good. It handles, so it's so thrilling you feel everything in that car. It's so capable [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5413.36s)]
*  That's a great car [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5421.16s)]

*  Yeah, just yeah, and you get used to that ass in that power coming out of that right behind you you know [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5428.16s)]
*  It's very intoxicating. It's a totally different feel in the handling where the balance isn't of the car isn't that like a [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5434.14s)]
*  When that thing slides out isn't it kind of like a narrow window before it's gone [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5441.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's tricky for sure you got to know what you're doing. You know you can't just stomp on the gas when it's sliding [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5447.14s)]
*  You know [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5453.66s)]

*  But it handles so well for because when you're describing the balance of it with the rear [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5473.12s)]
*  Transaxle that totally makes sense to me because you feel that while you're driving it. It's like really balanced [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5478.599999999999s)]

*  Yeah, it's crazy. They did it without a vote. I don't think it makes sense. I really don't I don't think there's enough minerals in the ground [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5616.7s)]
*  I don't think they just the mining alone that would have to happen and the reality of what happens in that mining [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5623.9s)]
*  Like people you need to understand what they're talking about [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5631.5s)]
*  They're talking about batteries like the as this idea that batteries just come from ferries and that now all of a sudden you have [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5634.1s)]
*  This like zero carbon impact vehicle like that's nonsense. That's complete total nonsense [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5640.82s)]
*  You you're ignoring the entire supply process of what it takes to make that what is with people that they don't they won't recognize [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5647.18s)]
*  They don't want to recognize that some people didn't know about it until I had this guy on my podcast said Darth Cara [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5653.78s)]
*  Who wrote a book about it and he went to the Congo to show these illegal? [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5660.360000000001s)]

*  But they have children working in these mines [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5670.08s)]
*  they have women working in these mines with babies on their back and they're they're mining toxic cobalt and [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5671.92s)]
*  This stuff is I mean, there's no protection. So safety these people are like chipping this shit out of the ground and [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5679.12s)]
*  That's a good percentage of all the cobalt that's involved in electronics and batteries and cell phones and all the things that we need and [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5685.740000000001s)]
*  It's not very publicized [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5695.02s)]
*  And it's it's this man exposed it and he risked his life to do it and he wrote a great book about it [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5697.42s)]
*  and the podcast was [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5703.02s)]
*  It was insane like listening to his story and how he risked his life to get this footage [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5704.740000000001s)]
*  And you know and there were several times where there was men guns and he got questioned and he had you know [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5709.5s)]

*  Reality that everybody now is faced with it's like this is how they get the stuff that you need to run your cell phone [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5719.84s)]
*  Like stop thinking that you know, you have zero impact if you're buying this you're contributing to this [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5726.72s)]

*  Yeah, and to say that like everything has to be electronic like slow down like where is this coming from? [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5739.240000000001s)]

*  So instead windows they're working [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5766.56s)]

*  How crazy that is you've had so many people commit suicide and your solution is putting nets around the building [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5803.46s)]
*  Those people just go up to the top floor fuck this bang. I want it to be over [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5808.78s)]

*  Well, really we should be making phones in America and they should be American [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5824.26s)]
*  American wages where people get health and dental and all the stuff you're supposed to get and you have a living wage [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5828.64s)]

*  And if I if Apple makes a little less, that's how it's supposed to be [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5838.78s)]
*  You're not supposed to be using slave labor to do stuff and you know, we don't have an ethical choice [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5842.24s)]

*  And there's not like this like very obvious ethical choice like hey this company only uses high-paid labor [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5858.08s)]
*  Everybody has insurance. There's none of that if they only work X amount of hours a day [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5865.82s)]

*  And I was just moving already crazy the guy was moving towards him, too [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5972.42s)]
*  That's a little bit like the net scenario though, like what's the problem that we're not solving that like why the yes [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=5976.82s)]

*  90% of every single thing we use to be made in the USA, right? [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6187.28s)]

*  That didn't work. That's what's fascinating about social media [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6595.46s)]
*  It's like people just find like YouTube for example like you don't have a whole lot of other choices [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6598.82s)]
*  No, you don't like it's they've tried. Yeah, doesn't stick dot. No, they just nailed it [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6603.62s)]
*  They figured it out and they dominate but it's like so simple in a way [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6608.26s)]
*  You just it's just a place we can upload videos, right? [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6612.42s)]
*  But it's so they've done it so much better than everybody else. It's weird [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6615.42s)]
*  We're like trying to create a new YouTube like good luck. Good luck getting people [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6619.26s)]
*  They're so addicted to just looking on YouTube every day. There's so much to look at [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6624.7s)]
*  What what's the threads do? [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6630.18s)]
*  It's like a Twitter [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6633.1s)]
*  It's like a version of Twitter that [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6635.780000000001s)]
*  Facebook built it looks exactly like Twitter. I think they're even getting sued because it looks so right [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6638.780000000001s)]
*  Is Elon suing them? Is that real? [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6644.26s)]
*  Well, I think I read they hired a person that worked at Twitter and I copied stuff [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6648.7s)]
*  Well, that's what happens you fire everybody [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6656.06s)]
*  They go to work for your competitor and they know things that was in Silicon Valley that HBO show [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6660.06s)]
*  The same shit here it is threads user count falls to new lows highlighting retention challenges [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6665.22s)]
*  Oh, no, how many people are on it now? Oh, this was even two weeks ago. Mmm [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6671.62s)]
*  They're down 82% Whoa [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6677.02s)]
*  Pretty typical for a new app though. It's hard to retain people [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6680.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the thing is like people are so addicted to like their tick-tock they go from the tick-tock to their Twitter [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6683.92s)]
*  Like it's very difficult to get people to change platforms [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6689.62s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta get everybody to change [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6693.7s)]
*  I've stayed off the tick-tock deal. I mean it's two. Well, maybe it's a little too youthful for me [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6696.66s)]
*  I did your dancing is fucking killer though. Yeah, I don't watch those videos. I just post them. It's very it's very addictive [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6702.3s)]
*  I'll tell you that I watch people just scrolling through their tick-tock all day long. It's so addictive just get constant [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6708.82s)]
*  Stimulation something anything dancing motorcycle crash this that you know my daughter and she's in college and that's [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6715.9s)]
*  Sorority stuff and that's that's where they live. I mean everything is tick-tock based [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6723.3s)]
*  It's all about tick-tock and China's tracking everything they do. Yeah [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6728.46s)]
*  Everything all your keystrokes. What are they doing with that? Who knows? I mean that constantly comes up like it's a concern [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6734.62s)]
*  But what are they doing? Well, here's the thing as [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6740.400000000001s)]
*  Technology becomes more and more powerful what you can do with data [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6743.82s)]
*  changes and if you have a [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6749.02s)]
*  Massive amount of data about people's behavior [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6752.04s)]
*  Their patterns what they're interested in what they gravitate towards what retains them [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6755.36s)]
*  What doesn't retain them and then all the stuff you're not supposed to have like their email addresses their fucking passwords like [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6760.42s)]
*  Their keystrokes it can actually monitor the keystrokes that you have so it could be sending that data [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6768.12s)]
*  So it could be transcribing text messages emails like whatever you got [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6774.32s)]
*  Not just on that but also on other devices that are connected to the network [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6779.26s)]
*  So if you have a network and you have devices that are connected to the network and that's an element [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6783.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, like they I believe it has access to computers that aren't even like don't even have tick-tock on them [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6788.02s)]
*  Really? Yes. Yeah, I think that's part of the user agreement [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6794.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, but didn't we read all this see get pull it pull it up because it's [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6799.34s)]
*  Aggregious when you read it you're like what it's so invasive. Where do they store all the dick pics? [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6803.8s)]
*  Imagine the servers. Yeah, there's like a certain cloud [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6810.96s)]
*  dick heavy cloud [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6814.92s)]
*  Well them big storm clouds fill with dicks [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6818.04s)]
*  Yeah, so what I wanted to read is the one part that we I know we read it on the podcast once [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6822.76s)]
*  I [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6830.360000000001s)]
*  Don't know where you read it from yeah, see if you can get us. Yeah, I did read it off my phone [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6831.96s)]
*  I'll pull it up. I know I got it in my notes, but it's uh, you know, it's like data is very [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6836.84s)]
*  Very valuable data is all that Facebook has it's all the Google has I mean they have infrastructure and you know staff [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6844.56s)]
*  And all that stuff [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6852.56s)]
*  But like the big money is in the data and no one even knew that that was a commodity [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6853.280000000001s)]
*  Everybody just gave up their data not ever thinking it was gonna be insanely valuable for targeting people for advertising [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6857.72s)]
*  Is that the biggest concern is what they can do from a financial standpoint versus like a malicious [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6864.92s)]
*  attack with that data [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6871.76s)]
*  I mean [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6874.08s)]
*  the real thing is like [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6876.08s)]
*  We don't know what [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6878.96s)]
*  What it like I read something about DNA, you know [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6881.4400000000005s)]
*  One of those ancestry things where they got bought out and someone paid [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6884.64s)]
*  For all the the DNA data, that's an interesting one. That's a little fucked up [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6890.92s)]
*  Yeah, see if that's real because it might have been one of them things where I was like scrolling through Instagram and it was like [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6895.58s)]
*  Some wacky person screaming about something. You always got to double check these [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6901.72s)]
*  See if that's real [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6906.6s)]
*  But I don't know what what I mean as technology increases you have to think [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6909.280000000001s)]
*  in terms of possibilities like maybe that data is gonna be even more valuable and more [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6914.64s)]
*  More personal like you don't you know, we don't know like what we're giving up Blackstone to acquire ancestry for [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6920.4800000000005s)]
*  4.7 billion [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6928.200000000001s)]
*  Okay, but do they [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6930.240000000001s)]
*  But do they have access to the DNA database of all the people that sent into ancestry? [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6932.4400000000005s)]
*  Right, what do they have do they have access did they buy the company or did they acquire the database as well? [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6939.400000000001s)]
*  You know I'm saying for 4.7 billion [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6946.92s)]
*  I'd certainly think that they got all the get it all assets and it is that but that's the thing [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6949.2s)]
*  Do they think of other people's personal DNA as an asset? [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6954.32s)]
*  Is it listed as an asset or is it just the business that does DNA testing that they bought? [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6957.24s)]
*  Because that's very it's a very popular business [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6962.56s)]
*  I'm right. I'm gonna want all that right [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6965.56s)]
*  But I mean I'm wondering if you can sell that like when people give up when when they send it in [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6968.64s)]
*  Right when they get their DNA test done. Are you giving up your rights to that information? [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6974.28s)]
*  Wonder if you sign any what waiver when you scroll all the way bottom and you know terms and conditions years like yeah [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6980.0s)]
*  Fuck it. You're not reading the 48 pages. Yeah. Hey, we're gonna sell one day all that shit goes with it [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6985.52s)]
*  That's the scariest conversation about bio weapons that they could make a they can make a bio weapon specifically targeted for you [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6990.04s)]
*  Well, if they knew your DNA [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=6998.4s)]
*  That's you talk about like the tick tock in China having all that shit [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7000.96s)]
*  You know you have something like a January 6 that happens right and all the red tape to get all of the [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7006.92s)]
*  You know geo [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7013.96s)]
*  Data from Facebook and everybody else is like fuck you you know we're not giving you shit [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7016.44s)]
*  You think they can get anything there's any backdoor deals like hey we need [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7020.8s)]
*  work US government working with China to get [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7025.6s)]
*  Any of that ship to if something were to happen like that they have that kind of relationship to get it in [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7028.4800000000005s)]
*  Backdoor channels of like the US would get the information from China. Yeah [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7034.04s)]
*  I don't know if China would have they would have to admit. They're taking it [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7038.6s)]
*  And I think there's been like real disputed still like with tick-tock in particular like where the data goes [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7042.84s)]
*  China is the world's biggest [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7052.96s)]
*  Face recognition dealer and then it says in the sub headline that the US is the second largest exporter [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7055.56s)]
*  exporter [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7062.08s)]
*  And there's a video. I'm trying to find of this [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7063.44s)]
*  What's happening? I said the video was made as though. This is what's happening in China right now showing the surveillance [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7066.6s)]
*  Taking facial recognition showing you driving down the freeway in cars and tagging the license plates and all that stuff [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7072.04s)]
*  Like even how or why that's happening is a big question [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7078.56s)]
*  Well, they just want people to know that they're being tracked everywhere you go then you'll self-censor [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7081.56s)]
*  Then you'll you'll stay in line. You won't do anything and in China. What's really scary is the places that have [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7086.72s)]
*  Everything connected to a social credit score [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7093.76s)]
*  So you have a centralized digital currency, and then you have a social credit score and if your social credit score is too low [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7096.2s)]
*  You can't do things can't buy things can't buy a car [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7101.32s)]

*  Yeah, wonder if you're of means can you buy credits for that? [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7149.04s)]
*  Social credit score. Yeah, it's good question [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7153.08s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure that somebody's monitor make a million dollar donation and get another 50 points on your social credit score [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7155.639999999999s)]
*  It's a bribe to be able to buy a plane ticket. Yeah, that's our future if we don't wise up [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7162.08s)]
*  so many people that just want [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7167.759999999999s)]
*  They want the government to have that kind of control because they think it'll silence the people that they oppose [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7170.0s)]
*  They don't realize it's gonna come for you, too. Like there's a real [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7175.16s)]
*  strong reason [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7179.36s)]
*  Why the founding fathers set this place up the way they did because they knew that people get in control things [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7180.719999999999s)]
*  They have too much power and then so they made it like real complicated [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7186.54s)]
*  With multiple layers of justice and that's the that's just to stave off this fucking [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7190.78s)]
*  Normal desire that people have to absolutely control the people that are under them. That's why kings existed [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7198.099999999999s)]
*  That's why monarchs and that's why rule emperors. That's what they've always done that forever and [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7204.5s)]
*  It's just a natural human instinct for one person want to control everything or one group to control everything and have everybody's be their subjects [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7210.38s)]
*  Glad we can just focus on building fucking cars [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7219.860000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna just keep kicking it old-school, you know, we're fucking [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7223.780000000001s)]
*  Manufacturing things out of steel in America [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7227.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and I have to worry about any of this because I'm not an important enough person that anybody's gonna utilize any of that stuff [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7230.34s)]
*  Against me. I'm just gonna it is weird that we're a country that requires so much of our stuff to be brought in [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7235.14s)]
*  Yeah, on our end like you saw it like such a negative change when you started bringing in like steel from India [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7241.42s)]
*  Steel from China. Yeah, I mean you'd get some stuff that was just crap, right? [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7248.8s)]
*  you'd be like we're manufacturing stuff and you're making a control arm for a car and you get a load of steel and [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7253.16s)]
*  You look at this stuff and we just reject it [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7258.6s)]
*  You're only using USA steel because shit would just tear rip break really jump couldn't bend it [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7261.400000000001s)]
*  I don't crack. I never even thought of that before so there's different standards in how people manufacture steel. Yeah [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7268.04s)]
*  Oh, wow a steel someone [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7274.4400000000005s)]

*  Fennagling shit and and if they got their steel from a questionable source, I mean, I don't know [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7304.160000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's all American steel. Maybe I'm wrong, but his take on it was like bro [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7309.92s)]
*  Like this is like people like the towers aren't supposed to fall that way like not supposed to be built that way either probably [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7314.72s)]
*  That was his take on it not mine his take on it and I was like, huh [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7321.6s)]

*  Holy shit, you know, it's wild though. Like those weeks after 9-eleven people were so nice [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7402.360000000001s)]
*  It was so different all the sporting events [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7408.88s)]
*  Yeah, and it was just like just the pride in the country you walking down the road just like high-fiving folks [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7411.12s)]

*  It's like America felt united. You drive down the street everybody had a American flag on their car [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7447.48s)]
*  They're those little American flag things to stick to your window [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7453.599999999999s)]
*  It happens that way and I mean it happens that way in your family happens that way in in business [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7457.2s)]
*  It happens that way in any relationship. You've got to have [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7461.44s)]
*  Unfortunately that bad fucking thing to remind you the good to remind you the good and everybody comes together and it's like alright [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7464.16s)]

*  Yeah, but when something bad like that happens you realize it's so easy for people to lose perspective [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7474.12s)]
*  And that's why I like the better things get the more people complain. It's like [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7480.4800000000005s)]
*  People it's so easy for people to lose perspective and not just appreciate things [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7485.280000000001s)]
*  It's a human beings are only we always want more, you know [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7490.88s)]
*  And we never really and then when something goes away, like I said about when you get sick you realize like oh [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7493.92s)]
*  Yeah, once you lose it. This is what's important. What's important is being healthy [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7499.24s)]
*  That's more important than anything if you were a rich person and someone said, okay [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7502.799999999999s)]
*  We have to stay sick like you have a cold a bad cold for the rest of your life [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7507.42s)]
*  But you get to stay rich or you can just be poor again [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7512.12s)]
*  You have to take being poor you can't be you'd have to be so fucking stupid [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7515.48s)]
*  Richness tired all the time coughing everywhere you go can't go upstairs [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7526.839999999999s)]
*  Why didn't the country come together during kovat like they did after 9-eleven? [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7530.879999999999s)]
*  Well, because the country was divided everybody was literally divided everyone was isolated [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7534.5599999999995s)]
*  That's a very weird like psychological experiment to run on people [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7539.32s)]
*  Not saying they did it on purpose [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7542.96s)]
*  But if you wanted to do a psychological experiment on people the best way to do is to isolate them keep them from working [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7544.04s)]
*  isolate them [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7551.4800000000005s)]
*  You got people already that are filled with anxiety and then all of a sudden this comes along [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7553.52s)]
*  for a lot of people like it was psychological overload and [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7558.52s)]
*  They were offered up one solution. This is this one solution. It's gonna get us out of this [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7562.76s)]
*  You got to get vaccinated and they were telling everyone has to do it. You got to do it. I'm doing it [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7568.44s)]
*  We're all doing it and no one really knew what the long-term effects were. No one really knew how effective it was [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7574.46s)]
*  No one really took into account that these pharmaceutical drug companies have always done shady shit [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7581.2s)]
*  They have the most criminal fines. They they they're always getting busted [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7587.04s)]
*  25% of their drugs get pulled after they get approved [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7591.799999999999s)]
*  It's just a wild-ass [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7594.5199999999995s)]
*  business and if you ever watch like dope sick or if you read anything about the Sackler family and the opioids like [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7596.84s)]
*  These people like they make great drugs for with great reason. They do wonderful things for people's health [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7603.0s)]
*  There's a lot of great drugs that really help people and then there's a machine that just wants to make money [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7609.12s)]
*  And that machine is in cahoots with the media and that machine was in cahoots with all the people that were promoting it in [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7614.32s)]
*  The health agencies and every doctor had to fall in line and if they didn't if they tried to prescribe other things they risk [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7621.679999999999s)]
*  losing their job [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7628.72s)]
*  and so that's why people didn't get brought together because they were fucking terrified and [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7631.04s)]
*  All the conditions were there to make people more divided [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7636.28s)]
*  More divided and more scared and some people still haven't recovered. I still see people with masks on to this day [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7640.88s)]
*  Outside walking around with masks on or driving in the car by themselves all the time. Yeah, just [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7647.4400000000005s)]
*  People that were already probably like very anxious and very fucked up. I like the guy you saw what three or four months ago. It's a [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7653.400000000001s)]
*  stretched Hayabusa [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7661.68s)]
*  Motorcycle right big-ass wheel on back guys got no helmet, but he's got a coven mask on [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7663.72s)]
*  Like guarantee you buddy, it's not the Cove that's gonna kill you well, maybe just want bugs in his mouth [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7669.52s)]
*  Because I would imagine if you've you know, you don't have a helmet on like you're gonna get some bugs in your face [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7677.08s)]
*  Yeah, but it's just like the standard paper [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7682.12s)]
*  Shitty mask. It's like you're it's like a cat when they hide under a table, but you still see their tail [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7685.0s)]
*  It's like I see you it's like that doesn't work [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7690.92s)]
*  Like it's like you're playing a stupid trick. Yeah, but it's a lot of it [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7694.92s)]
*  I think is has gotten to be worth sending a message. Yeah, they want everybody to know 100% [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7698.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, yeah, they're doing the right thing. I still wear a mouse [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7702.68s)]
*  I see people on Twitter like someone will declare, you know, I still max mask up everywhere [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7705.42s)]
*  I go I double mask in public and then underneath it people like yeah me too [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7710.3s)]
*  I do too [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7714.86s)]
*  I was just like shut-ins and insane people that don't want to let it go and they'll probably mask up three four or five years [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7715.42s)]
*  From now to okay. Go ahead. But that's what what it is. It's like it cracked some people and [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7721.9s)]

*  Where our shops at like just past the shop it kind of like almost like the country, right? [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7816.9s)]
*  You can't get out in these country roads and this dude just got so pissed because they were standing on the side of the road [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7820.98s)]
*  Filming but it was in his it was his property [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7826.22s)]

*  Shut the fuck up. It's this is a it's a public damn road [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7835.34s)]
*  I mean they had stopped and talked to the guy and the guy said you the neighbor [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7838.4s)]
*  He said you can park right there in that pull around so they parked in that pull around because the neighbor gave him permission [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7842.22s)]
*  apparently the neighbor [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7847.26s)]
*  That actually owned the property says that's not the neighbors driveway to say it's okay [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7849.58s)]
*  And he just instead of being like hey, dude, like what's going on? He just right came out hot [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7854.22s)]
*  Yeah, I bet the two neighbors are just fucking with each other. It's been an ongoing feud [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7858.98s)]
*  So yeah, I'm gonna get him go park in his defense though. Imagine if you're just trying to enjoy a calm peaceful day at home [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7863.18s)]
*  And you [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7869.76s)]
*  You're doing these fucking accurate lead foot takes [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7875.52s)]
*  Down that road. There's only what two or three, right? [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7880.08s)]
*  They're loud who the fuck wouldn't like that that guy that guy. Yeah, that was the one guy. We know there's at least one [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7884.24s)]
*  Yeah, he's at home watching old Bonanza episodes [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7891.72s)]
*  Wearing his mask [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7896.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, some people are weird man, you know, they don't like loud noises I [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7898.799999999999s)]
*  Get it though if you're in a country [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7903.54s)]
*  Quiet setting it's a loud ass car [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7905.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it is [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7909.0s)]
*  Do you like seeing that you like seeing the videos of that car before you get to see it in person? [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7910.24s)]
*  Or would you rather have it like a surprise? No, I don't mind at all [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7914.639999999999s)]
*  It's great to see the videos that makes you feel I'm more excited to see it when I get it [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7917.4s)]
*  But uh, no, the videos are awesome [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7921.16s)]
*  You know and the the one that Sean did was great Sean did one of my 69 Nova too [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7923.24s)]
*  The one that Steve Strope built me. Yeah, that one's awesome, too. He's great [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7927.82s)]
*  Does awesome shit. I'm just so glad that that's one of those things that came out of social media [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7933.099999999999s)]
*  That's interesting is like an individual content creator that it's just like probably wouldn't get a job doing that on a television show [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7939.0199999999995s)]
*  But his show is super successful just because genuine just because he really loves cars [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7946.58s)]
*  And he's a real likable guy and he's doing this thing [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7951.0599999999995s)]
*  It's like he doesn't look like your classic guy that is hosting a car show with quaffed hair on the Discovery Channel [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7953.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7960.9s)]
*  Right exactly some actor who's talking to you about a 69 Camaro, you know, it's like he's not that he's he's just [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7962.9s)]
*  Regular human being it's relatable. Yeah a lot of shit with TV [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7971.38s)]
*  Why do you think that TV executives don't realize for especially car related shit to get somebody that's legit and well because they want to control [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7974.66s)]
*  Everything right so they want to decide what you say they want to tell you where to stand [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7983.26s)]
*  They want to set the scene they have like all these things in their mind [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7987.16s)]
*  That they want the show to be in order for it to be successful in their defense [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7991.5s)]
*  They think they have a model in their mind what a successful show looks like [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=7995.9800000000005s)]
*  But what they the problem also is they don't have a lot of time to make something successful [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8000.22s)]
*  So if you're doing something like autotopia like what do you need? [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8006.54s)]
*  Like you don't need a lot and you just upload it it's not that much right if you're doing a television show you have [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8010.18s)]
*  Union wages you have trucks you have grips [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8016.5s)]
*  You have all these fucking people that are moving things around and carrying things lighting and then you have the executives [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8019.06s)]
*  You have the people that are at the studio you have you've got [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8024.3s)]
*  30 40 50 people that are involved in every project and millions of dollars in the budget [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8027.38s)]
*  So if it's not successful right away, it's gonna lose money and then they just bail on it [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8032.26s)]
*  So you have like a few episodes to catch fire and if it doesn't work [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8037.82s)]
*  You're gone and then the new one comes in and then they invest a sizable amount of money putting together some new thing and [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8041.42s)]
*  By doing that sometimes you make good shows when you get a bunch of great people with a good vision [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8048.66s)]
*  But a lot of times you you get too many things that don't work with each other that well [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8053.42s)]
*  And whoever the person is that you wanted to host the show never really gets to be themselves [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8059.7s)]
*  So they never really get to like people don't connect with them. They don't feel it [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8064.379999999999s)]
*  They just it's just fake and it doesn't feel that good. So you don't like it. So nobody watches it [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8069.74s)]
*  Whereas you can do a show like look at Jay Leno's garage. It's a perfect example. Jay Leno was the host of tonight show [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8075.379999999999s)]
*  It's like yeah, he did a great job, but it was not that thrilling. It was just the tonight show [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8081.78s)]
*  It's just this thing it was mediocre [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8087.62s)]
*  Mildly entertaining but when you see Jay Leno hosting Jay Leno's garage, he's great at it [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8090.54s)]
*  Yeah, he fucking loves car. He's so in his element [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8097.3s)]
*  It's so normal and natural that guy loves cars when he's talking about whatever it is when he's driving around the car asking questions [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8100.26s)]
*  That guy fucking loves it [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8108.38s)]
*  And so the people that like weren't into Jay Leno from the tonight show days because it was now clean family corporate television [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8110.48s)]
*  They love him now, they're like, oh he's a car guy you get the uncensored Jay Leno the real Jay [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8117.58s)]
*  Leno that's the real Jay Leno and that's what you get with like YouTube and things like that now and what you guys are [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8122.419999999999s)]
*  Doing on your podcast too. It's the same cat. You just being yourself. Yeah, you know and talking about cool shit [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8127.78s)]
*  Yeah, just talking about cars and whiskey other dumb shit. Yeah, I got you right [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8133.78s)]
*  But people love like tuning in to stuff like that [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8140.219999999999s)]
*  You know, they they'd love like no and there's only a few people working on this [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8143.26s)]
*  This is not like some massive project that involves corporations and this is coming straight from a bunch of people [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8147.58s)]
*  Yeah, and that's the thing that they can't duplicate [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8155.58s)]
*  That's why I like new shows like CNN. They just feel so fake. Everything feels fake [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8158.5s)]
*  Everyone's talking fake and they you know, it's a cut to commercial and every five minutes is like what is this? [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8163.9s)]
*  It's like a shitty format you think they realize that and if so, what's their pivot? They're trapped. It's working. They're trapped [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8170.06s)]
*  Yeah, they're making money and they but they're [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8176.580000000001s)]
*  Viewership is as low as it's ever been. It's really low like way down from the Trump era [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8181.02s)]
*  Well ads have to be down too [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8186.52s)]
*  I mean aren't being major corporations can't get the bigger ROI from going to more YouTube channels or podcasts or anything like that [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8187.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, but [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8195.42s)]
*  There's also this interesting relationship between [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8197.220000000001s)]
*  Advertisement and influence like if a primary source of your ad revenue is a certain company [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8201.300000000001s)]
*  Perhaps you won't report about things that company does that are bad [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8208.300000000001s)]
*  I think that's a heart that's part of the relationship they have it's not as simple as like this is the most profitable place to [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8216.74s)]
*  Advertise it's also this is a place that if we advertise we continue this relationship and this relationship [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8223.78s)]
*  Clearly is in some way influenced by the money that it gets from these corporations [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8231.140000000001s)]
*  It's not gonna openly criticize these corporations that are funding a giant chunk of their ad revenue [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8236.86s)]
*  That's so they're fucked. Yeah, so they're fucked and [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8244.26s)]
*  It's always gonna be better to get your your new source from someone who's like an actual journalist who's independent [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8247.460000000001s)]
*  You can get that now and that's what people are realizing [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8252.880000000001s)]
*  That's why cables like sort of slowly slipping away. When does Netflix have news? [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8255.94s)]
*  Ha that's interesting. When do they it's not a bad idea, right? I mean regular people read the news [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8261.52s)]
*  like just like [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8267.64s)]
*  The thing about the news is like you want to know all the news [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8271.880000000001s)]
*  So if they just told you one story like one story about the wildfires in Maui [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8274.72s)]
*  Really they should be talking about that all day. It should be like hours and hours and hours [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8280.32s)]
*  It can't really be five minutes, right? [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8284.52s)]
*  You know can't really be like more than 90 people are dead a thousand are missing back to you [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8286.96s)]
*  Bob today the Clippers scored a hundred you can't do that Clippers didn't score a hundred, right? [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8292.08s)]
*  It's just like [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8300.28s)]
*  They you know, they they don't have the time to [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8302.2s)]

*  Assessing that the video did not qualify for removal from the site [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8692.86s)]
*  So Facebook complied with requests from members of President Joe Biden's White House staff to throttle the reach of a [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8696.9s)]
*  2021 video by then Fox News host Tucker Carlson according to the federal lawsuit and it says despite Facebook staff [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8704.86s)]

*  strategy [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8748.18s)]
*  Deputy assistant to the president and director of digital strategy Rob Flaherty emailed Facebook executives [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8749.62s)]

*  They got Facebook to throttle that [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8789.46s)]
*  Even though it's true [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8793.22s)]
*  That's why and we paid for that staff of all those people to watch those videos and flag them and let Facebook know to [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8794.859999999999s)]

*  Carlson's video [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8812.6s)]

*  But the last time we did this dance it ended in an insurrection [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8822.1s)]
*  Mr. Clegg in turn noted that the video did not qualify for removal. Holy shit [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8827.74s)]
*  heavy stuff [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8834.18s)]
*  Despite the video not qualifying for removal Facebook officials said mr [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8836.74s)]
*  Carlson's video was being demoted to reduce its reach and in April 16 2021 follow-up Facebook officials told mr [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8840.98s)]
*  Flaherty that the the platform gave mr [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8848.5s)]

*  Despite it not violating the platform's policies [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8856.98s)]
*  That's wild [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=8860.78s)]

*  It's this place called the belly room and only seats like 70 people. That's where they started this show [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9046.74s)]
*  Like 10 years. No, that's fucking nuts [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9051.859999999999s)]
*  It's wild right it's but I mean bring it back to you guys like when you first started Roaster Shop and now being one of [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9055.84s)]
*  The premier builders in the world of those kind of cars. I mean how long you guys been around for? [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9060.92s)]

*  Yeah, time fucking flies. So when you first started out in like the 2003 [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9068.880000000001s)]
*  Market for like what was available in terms of like custom suspensions and things along those lines [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9074.04s)]
*  2003 it was a different world [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9080.68s)]
*  2003 it was a different world [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9082.92s)]
*  What people were interested in was wildly different so you had a different, you know [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9085.84s)]
*  Different demographic guys were into like 30s hot ruts [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9090.2s)]
*  Really when you looked at like aftermarket custom cars [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9093.0s)]
*  They were like a 1932 Ford a deuce roadster or something like that five window coupe [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9095.960000000001s)]
*  That's what was the popular aftermarket the muscle car stuff hadn't really been modified yet. So there was like [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9100.92s)]
*  Aftermarket suspension for those we were manufacturing chassis for 30s and 40s street rods [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9108.679999999998s)]
*  And it wasn't until like yeah, and I don't know probably like 2008 [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9115.119999999999s)]
*  What do you think caused this shift do you think it was shows like overhauling and rides? [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9121.0s)]
*  You know, I don't know when when the recession hit we our entire shop was all 1930s hot rods [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9126.4s)]
*  When we weathered the storm and got through the recession [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9132.64s)]
*  There wasn't a single one of those left and it was all muscle cars and it was it was like a fucking light switch [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9135.84s)]
*  You know, I don't know what the deal was if it was just a changing of the guards [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9141.64s)]
*  We always say it's like a little bit generational of what was cool when you were in high school or what your parents had [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9146.0s)]
*  mmm, and then there's always like a [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9151.88s)]
*  Josh put it best like a pendulum of this is cool. This is cool [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9154.439999999999s)]
*  We're gonna do the complete opposite and it swings the other direction and you're just constantly going back and forth [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9158.24s)]
*  High-end show cars to patina drivers from [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9163.56s)]
*  Protouring muscle cars and to lift it off-road four-wheel drive stuff. It's just always moving [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9167.92s)]
*  Everybody wants to do something different, you know, it's a counterculture part of it as soon as something I even heard [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9173.4s)]
*  I think y'all were talking about on Post Malone's podcast [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9178.12s)]
*  Everybody's into something until you find out like everybody else is into it, right? [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9181.12s)]
*  And then it's like I gotta do something fucking different. Yeah, but if everybody got into muscle cars, I wouldn't stop [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9184.44s)]
*  No, I don't think so I don't think they have this because there's so many different one [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9190.2s)]
*  There's so many different muscle cars or so many different styles and ways to build them [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9193.880000000001s)]
*  I feel that way about the UFC to like when I first started working for the UFC when I [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9197.32s)]
*  I started working for them in 97. I did it from 97 and 98 and I did it [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9200.76s)]

*  You're flying in a propeller plane and people are fighting with shoes on [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9217.04s)]
*  Bare knuckle and headbutts were legal. Like it was crazy. There's the crazy times. I'm happy that more people are I'm not like [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9220.88s)]
*  Yeah, I knew when it was cool [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9227.96s)]
*  Like that's that to me is so dumb [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9229.96s)]
*  Like if you like a band and also in the band makes it like yeah, it's fucking sold out. Yeah, I don't like now everybody likes them [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9232.08s)]
*  But you have these change to write all different fighting styles and different weight classes and that's kind of cool and yeah [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9239.68s)]
*  It's just gotten better. It's just constantly gotten better [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9246.08s)]
*  The people today are just the best ever [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9248.76s)]
*  Just it's insane like the level of talent and that it's such a pressure cooker because in every division like in this weekend [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9251.44s)]
*  You have Al Jermain Sterling's fighting sugar Sean O'Malley [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9258.16s)]
*  So you have the best of the best like the most exciting contender versus the most dominant champion and it's just whoo [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9261.0s)]
*  And that happens like this pressure cooker in that division because you've got guys like Corey Sandhagen and Marlon [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9268.720000000001s)]
*  Vare you got so many killers in this division [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9275.6s)]
*  Everybody's just striving to be the the champion and they're around so much talent that everybody has to get better [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9278.24s)]

*  wanting better and better and better which is why we've had to continue getting better on all the chassis and the [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9309.44s)]
*  Different innovations that we've come out with but it's the trickle-down [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9314.960000000001s)]
*  I mean you talk about UFC getting mainstream getting so much bigger [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9317.44s)]
*  Then you've got the apparel brands and then you've got you know [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9321.42s)]

*  You actually can make a business to support that the same thing in our industry where you have we can build [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9328.18s)]
*  The chassis at the volume that we can because of the way the industry has gone with the markets there [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9334.34s)]
*  So you put the time you can put the effort into it [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9339.38s)]
*  You can put the engineering and spend the money to develop something that's really fucking badass [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9341.34s)]
*  It's also great what you guys do for the hobbyist for someone who wants to build their own car [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9345.5s)]
*  Like you provide them the actual suspension [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9350.54s)]
*  Like if someone knows how to do all that and they have the time in the garage space [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9354.98s)]
*  Yeah, you know they can actually use the same components that you guys do and do it themselves [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9358.22s)]
*  Absolutely, and that's a big portion of our business. I mean a lot of guys we [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9364.3s)]

*  They take all the same components that we use in a car that maybe we build for you chassis [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kjjuHc55E&t=9372.62s)]
