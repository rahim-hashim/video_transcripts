# Joe Rogan Experience #2108 - Tom Green
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6.0s)]
*  Cheers, cheers, cheers. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10.0s)]
*  See you, bro. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=12.0s)]
*  You too, you too. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=14.0s)]
*  And we're up. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=16.0s)]
*  What the fuck is happening, Tom? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=18.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Great to be here, man. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=20.0s)]
*  Made it back, made it back. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=22.0s)]
*  Last time I saw you, I don't know, my eyes might have been a little crossed. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=24.0s)]
*  Well, last time I saw you was last night. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=28.0s)]
*  Right, that's the last time. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=30.0s)]
*  And the night before that. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=32.0s)]
*  That's true, that's true. We'd start with that then. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=34.0s)]
*  But the last time we saw each other on a podcast, things went a little westward. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=36.0s)]
*  We got a little intoxicated. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=40.0s)]
*  So, absolutely. So, you know, the whiskey kept pouring, the whiskey kept pouring. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=44.0s)]
*  And that was when I was, I had that van. So I still have the van. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=50.0s)]
*  I still have the van, but at the time I was kind of living in the van, traveling in the van. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=54.0s)]
*  This is heavy COVID. This is like the beginning of COVID where it was weird to be around each other. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=58.0s)]
*  Like, are we okay? We got tested. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=62.0s)]
*  Yeah, right. We got the COVID test. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=64.0s)]
*  And then I had the van out in the parking lot. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=68.0s)]
*  And we started drinking the whiskey about midway through the show. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=70.0s)]
*  And then the next thing I know, I'm opening my eyes in my van. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=74.0s)]
*  And it's the next day. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=82.0s)]
*  And I'm just like, oh, shit, what happened on the show? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=86.0s)]
*  So, you know, I think maybe the last half hour of the show was such a blur. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=90.0s)]
*  I don't really quite remember getting the van. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=94.0s)]
*  But I had a nice sleep in the parking lot. It was amazing. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=96.0s)]
*  And then I kind of was a little nervous about like, geez, what? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=98.0s)]
*  That's a weird feeling when you don't know what you said. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=102.0s)]
*  And I called my mom. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=106.0s)]
*  And everybody seemed, you know, like it was people thought it was funny. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=110.0s)]
*  But I mean, I think she was a little concerned about the drinking, the amount of drinking. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=116.0s)]
*  But no, that was a great time. But I'm not. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=120.0s)]
*  It was fun. That was a great time. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=122.0s)]
*  It was fun. So we got a little off the rails. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=124.0s)]
*  You didn't have to go anywhere. No van was parked. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=127.0s)]
*  It was awesome. It was awesome. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=130.0s)]
*  What is it like sleeping in parking lots? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=131.0s)]
*  That's got to be an odd thing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=134.0s)]
*  Well, I rarely did that in the van. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=136.0s)]
*  It was mostly out in these remote desert parks, like out in Bureau of Land Management land, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=139.0s)]
*  BL, land in the desert. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=144.0s)]
*  And I was going around filming. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=146.0s)]
*  And so I wasn't. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=148.0s)]
*  But there was a couple of times I'd sleep in a truck stop because I was wanting to make a lot of distance. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=150.0s)]
*  So I'd drive until I kind of couldn't keep my eyes open. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=155.0s)]
*  Then I'd pull over at a truck stop and sleep. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=157.0s)]
*  It's a sketchy proposition, right? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=159.0s)]
*  You don't know who's around. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=161.0s)]
*  Yeah, you don't know who's around. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=163.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, in the desert, it's a little more nerve-racking because you're all alone out there. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=165.0s)]
*  And people can see the van in the distance. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=169.0s)]
*  And it's a pretty nice van. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=172.0s)]
*  That's when the aliens come too. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=174.0s)]
*  You're all alone. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=176.0s)]
*  I was hoping for that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=177.0s)]
*  Nothing? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=178.0s)]
*  No aliens. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=179.0s)]
*  I had a nice flyover from a US fighter jet in the Trona Pinnacles, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=181.0s)]
*  in this amazing part of the desert in California. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=188.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=190.0s)]
*  And I was the only person there. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=191.0s)]
*  And I could tell this fighter jet saw me. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=193.0s)]
*  And he just kind of came and shh right over the van. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=195.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. Just to say hi? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=197.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I didn't get my camera out in time. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=199.0s)]
*  I flew in one of those ones. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=201.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=203.0s)]
*  With the blue angels. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=204.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=205.0s)]
*  God, it's insane when you realize what those jets can do. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=206.0s)]
*  And I think what they were flying was like an F-A-18. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=210.0s)]
*  See if that's true. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=214.0s)]
*  Nice. Yeah. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=215.0s)]
*  I think that's it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=216.0s)]
*  That's what we did. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=217.0s)]
*  I believe they are actually. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=218.0s)]
*  I think they have even more capable jets now, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=219.0s)]
*  because this is when... [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=221.0s)]
*  I want to say this is like 2003, 2002, something like that, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=223.0s)]
*  way back in the day. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=228.0s)]
*  I have a plaque that says you flew with the blue angels. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=229.0s)]
*  Pulled major G forces. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=232.0s)]
*  I've never been in a fighter jet. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=233.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=234.0s)]
*  I think I did six and a half Gs, something like that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=235.0s)]
*  And I stayed conscious. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=239.0s)]
*  But then I blacked out when I forgot to do the hooking on a lesser run, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=241.0s)]
*  like it was lesser. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=247.0s)]
*  It was like four Gs or something like that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=248.0s)]
*  Forgot to do the... [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=250.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=251.0s)]
*  When you're going through high Gs, you do a thing called hooking. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=252.0s)]
*  I think that's how they say it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=258.0s)]
*  When you hold on to the joystick, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=259.0s)]
*  or you can hold on to your straps on your legs if you're the pastor like I was, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=261.0s)]
*  and you go like this. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=265.0s)]
*  Hooch, hooch, hooch, hooch. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=266.0s)]
*  And you're literally forcing blood into your head to stay conscious. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=268.0s)]
*  So while we're doing this, I'm feeling... [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=272.0s)]
*  That's what you're doing. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=276.0s)]
*  See how she's doing that? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=277.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=278.0s)]
*  See how she's doing it? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=279.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=280.0s)]
*  I can't like it here. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=281.0s)]
*  That's how you stay conscious. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=283.0s)]
*  That's how you stay conscious. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=285.0s)]
*  You have to force the blood into your fucking brain. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=286.0s)]
*  It seems like it's kind of slightly on the edge of not being a perfect system, right? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=289.0s)]
*  Well, you've got to be a bad motherfucker to fly those things. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=293.0s)]
*  Those guys were all lifting. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=298.0s)]
*  All those blue angels piles, they were all jacked. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=300.0s)]
*  They were all like super diesel. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=303.0s)]
*  Because these guys are just fucking... [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=305.0s)]
*  They're wrestling with that thing. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=307.0s)]
*  It's not as simple as like you're... [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=309.0s)]
*  The physical force of going to 6 Gs is so extraordinary. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=313.0s)]
*  You haven't felt anything like it in your life. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=319.0s)]
*  These guys can go to like 13 Gs, some of them. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=321.0s)]
*  It's fucking insane. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=325.0s)]
*  I don't think I would want to do that actually. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=327.0s)]
*  I would probably just... [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=329.0s)]
*  I sometimes don't want to do those kinds of things. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=330.0s)]
*  You don't have to do it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=333.0s)]
*  It looks amazing, but I just feel like... [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=334.0s)]
*  I'm glad I did it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=336.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=337.0s)]
*  Just as a wake-up call, you think you understand... [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=338.0s)]
*  You see a jet, and I think of it almost like... [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=342.0s)]
*  Well, obviously, driving a race car is very difficult, right? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=344.0s)]
*  But driving a car fast is not that difficult. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=347.0s)]
*  If you have a good car, if you buy a new car today that handles really well, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=350.0s)]
*  if there's no one around, you can go pretty fucking fast and it's really in control. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=355.0s)]
*  But those things are different, man. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=359.0s)]
*  There's a physical experience. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=361.0s)]
*  It's so fast. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=363.0s)]
*  There's so much power and force behind those things. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=366.0s)]
*  You got a plane yet? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=368.0s)]
*  You're getting a plane, Joe? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=369.0s)]
*  Fuck that. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=370.0s)]
*  No. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=371.0s)]
*  No. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=372.0s)]
*  Bill Burr pilots. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=373.0s)]
*  Bill Burr flies around in a goddamn helicopter. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=375.0s)]
*  He took me up around downtown LA. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=377.0s)]
*  You can fly wherever you want in a helicopter. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=379.0s)]
*  Yeah, helicopters are even more of a no-no for me. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=381.0s)]
*  Because they seem to go down a little too much. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=384.0s)]
*  I've been in a few. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=387.0s)]
*  I flew in a Blackhawk through Baghdad and did one of those USO tours, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=388.0s)]
*  went to stand up over there back in 2003. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=393.0s)]
*  How was that? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=396.0s)]
*  That was a pretty wild experience. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=397.0s)]
*  It was right before... [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=400.0s)]
*  It was probably, fortunately for my nervous system, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=403.0s)]
*  right after the Mission Accomplished banner and right before shit hit the fan with the IEDs. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=408.0s)]
*  So I was kind of thinking, oh, it's okay, no big deal. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=415.0s)]
*  And we were over there in the green zone and we were flying around in the Blackhawk helicopter. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=417.0s)]
*  One night they said, you want to go out on a night patrol in a tank? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=420.0s)]
*  And I was all set to go. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=424.0s)]
*  And then they had to cancel it because of some sort of attack. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=426.0s)]
*  And then we started hearing there's some stuff happening. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=429.0s)]
*  We were there for a few days only, but they started avoiding stuff on the road and the Humvees. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=433.0s)]
*  And then the second I got back to stateside, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=439.0s)]
*  that's when it started to get real bad over there. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=444.0s)]
*  But I did a few of those. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=447.0s)]
*  I did Afghanistan as well and was on Chinook helicopters. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=448.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=451.0s)]
*  My dad was military, so that's why I'm rocking the Canadian Army jacket. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=452.0s)]
*  Canadian Army, we've got an army. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=455.0s)]
*  I heard recently. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=457.0s)]
*  I recently heard about it. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=459.0s)]
*  They didn't fight too hard against tyranny. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=461.0s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=464.0s)]
*  No, it's... [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=467.0s)]
*  Well, we did. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=468.0s)]
*  Actually, we fought pretty hard against the Germans. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=469.0s)]
*  I mean the internal. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=472.0s)]
*  Yeah, oh yeah, I know, I know, I know. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=473.0s)]
*  Internal government tyranny. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=475.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's fun. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=476.0s)]
*  I watch your show all the time, Joe. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=477.0s)]
*  So it's like I know I'm... [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=479.0s)]
*  And I'm a very proud Canadian. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=480.0s)]
*  Tom, you're the granddaddy of the show. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=482.0s)]
*  The granddaddy? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=484.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, I don't know about that, but I mean, you move on. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=486.0s)]
*  You are. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=488.0s)]
*  First of all, you've always been very nice to give me a shout out about those early days of broadcasting in the living room. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=489.0s)]
*  Well, dude, you're an awesome guy. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=497.0s)]
*  I've always loved you. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=498.0s)]
*  You're always cool to be around. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=499.0s)]
*  And you also, your show in 2007, when I went on your show, that was 100% a major inspiration for me to do this. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=501.0s)]
*  Because I remember thinking, oh my God, he figured it out. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=512.0s)]
*  Like I remember very clearly like sitting next to you on that chair going, dude, this is it. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=515.0s)]
*  Like this is it. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=520.0s)]
*  All you have to do is figure out how to make money with this. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=521.0s)]
*  Yeah, you said that on the show, which was hilarious. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=523.0s)]
*  And then you figured that out. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=525.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=526.0s)]
*  You really figured that out. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=527.0s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=530.0s)]
*  That was the missing link, damn it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=531.0s)]
*  But no, no, that's amazing. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=532.0s)]
*  No, it's, you know, I remember when we were doing it, I had, you know, I always wanted to do a talk show when I was growing up. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=534.0s)]
*  I loved Letterman, right? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=542.0s)]
*  And I'd done my show on. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=543.0s)]
*  You were great at it. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=545.0s)]
*  Yeah, I really did enjoy. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=546.0s)]
*  The first show was more, you know, me out in the street doing crazy stuff. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=548.0s)]
*  And then we did a talk show, which was a little bit more of a sort of a nightly show, a little bit more time to talk. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=552.0s)]
*  And I did I did love doing that when when the show stopped, it was right at the time of, you know, technology changing on the Web. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=559.0s)]
*  And that was kind of always kind of how I I was kind of looking at technology usually, because when I was a kid, I was in a rap group. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=568.0s)]
*  And it was from technology. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=577.0s)]
*  Right. I remember drum machines came out and we were listening to Public Enemy. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=579.0s)]
*  And one of these sounds, you know, how do you do that? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=582.0s)]
*  Right. And then I would go work a summer job. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=584.0s)]
*  I'd buy a sampler and a Kai S 900 sampler and Atari computer. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=586.0s)]
*  And, you know, I'm making beats in my parents' basement in Ottawa, Canada. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=591.0s)]
*  I was making beats in Ottawa, Canada. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=595.0s)]
*  You know, we started this group called Organized Rhyme. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=597.0s)]
*  What year is this? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=600.0s)]
*  This was well, we started in mid 80s. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=601.0s)]
*  So this is all pre-internet. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=604.0s)]
*  Yeah, pre-internet. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=605.0s)]
*  This was high school. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=607.0s)]
*  So how are you finding out about all this stuff back then? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=608.0s)]
*  Well, that was, you know, friends at school were listening to rap music. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=610.0s)]
*  So friends at school were like, hey, you got to check out Public Enemy. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=615.0s)]
*  You got to check out Boogie Down Productions. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=618.0s)]
*  I'm like, Boogie Down Productions. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=620.0s)]
*  Then you get someone to give you a cassette of like the criminal minded Boogie Down Productions, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=621.0s)]
*  Bridges Over album. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=626.0s)]
*  And you're listening to it and they're rapping about Scott LaRock, their DJ who'd been, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=628.0s)]
*  you know, unfortunately, you know, passed away in bad circumstances. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=632.0s)]
*  He was shot and killed. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=638.0s)]
*  And then you're listening to this sort of that was the internet to me. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=639.0s)]
*  You know, it was rap music and skateboarding. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=642.0s)]
*  It was skateboarding. Thrasher magazine was skateboarding. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=644.0s)]
*  You'd read stories about skateboarders in California in a magazine. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=647.0s)]
*  You'd listen to rap music and hear stories about, you know, people who were not in Ottawa, you know, doing cool shit. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=651.0s)]
*  And I was kind of wanting to get up on stage and perform. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=658.0s)]
*  I was trying to dabble in with stand up at Yuck Yucks in the comedy club in Ottawa. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=661.0s)]
*  And so. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=668.0s)]
*  When you say dabble in? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=670.0s)]
*  Well, I was doing stand up. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=671.0s)]
*  I was doing stand up, but I never really got to really, you know, a level where I was kind of I was doing it every week. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=672.0s)]
*  I was going down every week for a couple of years. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=679.0s)]
*  And actually, the reason I stopped was because the rap group got kind of sort of a record deal basically. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=681.0s)]
*  And I kind of went focused on that for a while and stopped doing stand up. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=689.0s)]
*  But yeah, the club in Ottawa, Yuck Yucks in Ottawa, still there. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=692.0s)]
*  It's moved, but it's owned by Howard Wagman, who's it's. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=696.0s)]
*  Yuck Yucks is kind of like the improv of Canada. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=701.0s)]
*  You know, it's chain all across the country. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=703.0s)]
*  Mark Breslin. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=706.0s)]
*  I'm sure you know Mark. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=707.0s)]
*  He's he started it. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=708.0s)]
*  And and it's he's kind of like it was it was it was wild because like I don't know. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=709.0s)]
*  It was something about the 80s, the 90s before the Internet. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=717.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=722.0s)]
*  You'd go down to a comedy club and you'd find out about stuff just through word of mouth, like the rap music and like comedy. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=724.0s)]
*  So I wouldn't go down to the comedy club. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=732.0s)]
*  And I remember Norm MacDonald come through and he was probably 25 years old. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=734.0s)]
*  Right. And I'm 16 in the audience. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=738.0s)]
*  And then I got to become this huge fan of Norm. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=740.0s)]
*  And he was Norm. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=743.0s)]
*  But back then, there wasn't a lot of people doing stand up like Norm. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=746.0s)]
*  Like there wasn't this sort of angle of sort of this absurdity to this this sort of this sort of it was a more of a structured down the middle way of doing stand up back then. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=751.0s)]
*  And and so Norm was a sort of, you know, you know, it was a curve ball. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=761.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's sort of curve ball. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=765.0s)]
*  And we just couldn't get enough of it. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=766.0s)]
*  So every time we was in town, we'd be down there. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=767.0s)]
*  But Howard Wagman told me this story about Norm. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=769.0s)]
*  And, you know, the first time he came down to do stand up at Yuck Yucks in Ottawa. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=773.0s)]
*  And he got off stage and he was disappointed in how it went. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=778.0s)]
*  Norm was he said, I'm never doing this again. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=783.0s)]
*  Walk down the street. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=785.0s)]
*  Howard Wagman chased him down Spark Street in Ottawa and said, No, that was great. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=786.0s)]
*  You're coming back. And he made him come back. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=790.0s)]
*  And the rest is history. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=791.0s)]
*  Norm was a legitimate genius. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=793.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like a genius of life. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=795.0s)]
*  Like like a rare specimen. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=797.0s)]
*  Like genius in not just that his comedy was brilliant, but just just like, look at this. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=802.0s)]
*  I've never seen this before. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=808.0s)]
*  Like a totally different kind of human. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=810.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and genuinely always funny. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=812.0s)]
*  Like every conversation was funny. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=818.0s)]
*  He was just funny. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=820.0s)]
*  I was on playing with him accidentally twice. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=821.0s)]
*  Nice. Twice. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=824.0s)]
*  That must have been amazing. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=825.0s)]
*  Twice on two separate occasions. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=826.0s)]
*  Just totally random. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=827.0s)]
*  We sat next to each other and playing like, whoa, this is crazy. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=829.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=832.0s)]
*  And the last one, it was so funny because he was telling me about how he quit smoking. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=833.0s)]
*  Yeah, I quit smoking. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=839.0s)]
*  It's fucking turns out it's real bad for you. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=840.0s)]
*  This whole thing about quitting smoking. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=843.0s)]
*  And we're talking about it. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=845.0s)]
*  Like how hard was it to quit? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=846.0s)]
*  This whole thing. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=847.0s)]
*  The moment we land, he walks into the gift shop, buys a pack of cigarettes, and he's lighting them before he gets out the door. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=848.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=857.0s)]
*  I thought you quit. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=858.0s)]
*  He goes, I did. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=859.0s)]
*  But all that talking about it made me want to smoke. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=860.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=862.0s)]
*  It's probably all an elaborate setup, right? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=863.0s)]
*  He's probably planning it the whole way. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=865.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=867.0s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=868.0s)]
*  He probably doesn't even smoke. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=869.0s)]
*  He was just doing it as a gag. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=870.0s)]
*  No, he was. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=871.0s)]
*  Well, he was into gambling too, right? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=872.0s)]
*  So like people that have those kind of like impulse control issues, like gambling is a big impulsive thing. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=874.0s)]
*  Like I'm going to fucking bet. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=879.0s)]
*  I'm going to bet on it. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=880.0s)]
*  Let's put the bet. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=881.0s)]
*  Put the bet. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=882.0s)]
*  All of it. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=883.0s)]
*  All of it. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=884.0s)]
*  That's rough. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=885.0s)]
*  You know, that kind of wild, crazy sports gambling too. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=886.0s)]
*  That's what you have to have, especially when you have money, right? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=887.0s)]
*  That's a scary addiction, man. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=888.0s)]
*  I watched Dana White gamble. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=890.0s)]
*  I watched Dana White play blackjack and he was down $600,000. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=891.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=895.0s)]
*  And my fucking hands were sweating. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=896.0s)]
*  I just, I was going, what are you guys doing? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=897.0s)]
*  That's real money. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=900.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=901.0s)]
*  This is so crazy. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=902.0s)]
*  He does it every night. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=903.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=904.0s)]
*  He does it constantly. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=905.0s)]
*  There's people that love it. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=906.0s)]
*  They love it. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=907.0s)]
*  They love the action. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=908.0s)]
*  It's thrilling. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=909.0s)]
*  For me, it's fortunately I've never liked numbers. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=910.0s)]
*  Like math was never something I enjoyed. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=915.0s)]
*  So when it comes to blackjack, you're going, you're doing math in my head and I get very [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=917.0s)]
*  uncomfortable. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=921.0s)]
*  So I just, I go, I'm not going to be good at this. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=922.0s)]
*  That's a great reason to not gamble. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=924.0s)]
*  You hate math class. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=926.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=927.0s)]
*  I just figured I'm not going to be good at this because I can't even really add up what [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=928.0s)]
*  I'm supposed to be doing here quickly. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=930.0s)]
*  So I'm just going to just sit on the side. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=932.0s)]
*  Plus I'm cheap. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=933.0s)]
*  I don't want to lose money. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=934.0s)]
*  I'm not a math person either. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=935.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=937.0s)]
*  It's a concentration thing. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=938.0s)]
*  It's like if you concentrated on math, really got good at the basics of it and then really [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=940.0s)]
*  started getting into more complex mathematics, it'd probably be very fun. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=947.0s)]
*  Probably be very exciting. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=951.2s)]
*  But the problem is I never concentrated in high school at all. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=953.08s)]
*  I didn't pay attention to it. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=957.0s)]
*  So I'm so removed. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=958.64s)]
*  Like if people start talking about math, like complex shit. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=961.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=964.28s)]
*  I checked out at long division. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=965.28s)]
*  Long division I checked out. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=967.16s)]
*  Are calculators available? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=969.16s)]
*  They're pretty much everywhere, right? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=970.16s)]
*  And aren't there's like an unlimited supply of batteries? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=972.16s)]
*  I'm like, come out. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=975.16s)]
*  This is what I'm wondering. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=976.16s)]
*  Now with our phones and our Google and everything, we don't have to learn any of that anymore. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=977.16s)]
*  I don't know anyone's phone number. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=982.16s)]
*  We don't really have to learn anything anymore. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=983.16s)]
*  I know like Eddie Bravo's phone number. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=984.7199999999999s)]
*  I know my wife's phone number. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=987.16s)]
*  I might know two other numbers. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=989.16s)]
*  When I was a kid, I had a hundred numbers in my head. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=991.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=994.16s)]
*  You can call your grandmother. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=995.16s)]
*  I still remember my phone number from when I was a kid. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=996.16s)]
*  Yeah, you could call your friends. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=999.16s)]
*  I could say it now, but that person probably wouldn't like that very much. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1000.16s)]
*  I got my phone number memorized from when I was in high school. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1003.16s)]
*  It was our first phone number. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1006.16s)]
*  I couldn't believe we had a phone number. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1008.16s)]
*  I'm like, wow. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1010.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1011.16s)]
*  Yeah, but that's- [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1012.16s)]
*  We had phone numbers before, but that was the first one that I've remembered. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1013.16s)]
*  And then that was the first answer machines too. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1016.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1018.16s)]
*  That was wild. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1019.16s)]
*  Remember if you're out and you're trying to meet somebody and they're going to meet you [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1020.16s)]
*  and then they don't show up and you want to figure out where they are, you'd go to a payphone, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1024.16s)]
*  put a quarter in it, call your phone and then put your code in and check your answering machine [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1028.16s)]
*  or your voicemail from the mall. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1032.16s)]
*  And you thought you were living in the future. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1034.16s)]
*  And then they'd leave a message on your answering machine to tell you, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1036.16s)]
*  hey, sir, I'm going to be a little late. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1039.16s)]
*  And then you hang up and then it cost you a quarter. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1040.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1042.16s)]
*  But it was, yeah, that's how crazy everything's changed in such a small amount of time. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1043.16s)]
*  When you left the house, you were gone. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1047.16s)]
*  No one knew where the fuck you were. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1050.16s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1052.16s)]
*  There was no SnapMap. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1053.16s)]
*  Kids today, they look at each other on Snapchat maps where they all know where they are at any moment in time. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1056.16s)]
*  There's no shenanigans. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1063.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1064.16s)]
*  No, I was thinking about like how when I was a kid, we would be able to very easily manipulate the situation with my parents and say, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1065.16s)]
*  okay, I'm going over to my friend's house. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1074.16s)]
*  I'm going to Bobby's house. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1076.16s)]
*  Go drinking and skateboarding all night. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1077.16s)]
*  No, that was better like that. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1079.16s)]
*  These kids today, they're tracked. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1081.16s)]
*  Everyone's tracked. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1083.16s)]
*  It's not your parents, it's the government. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1085.16s)]
*  And we're not going to be able to really get rid of it now, too. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1087.16s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1089.16s)]
*  There's no way this is going to turn bad. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1090.16s)]
*  No one's ever going to decide this has gone too far. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1092.16s)]
*  It's just going to keep escalating and getting worse. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1094.16s)]
*  And my eyes are getting bad because I'm sticking. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1097.16s)]
*  I find myself addicted to the phone as much as I know that it's happening. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1100.16s)]
*  I'll get on that TikTok and I just start scrolling through stuff. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1105.16s)]
*  And then, oh, shit, like two hours just went by. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1108.16s)]
*  You know, my eyes are getting blurry and it's really kind of starting to it's useless. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1111.16s)]
*  Piss me off, to be honest with you. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1117.16s)]
*  Yeah, for me, it's Instagram. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1119.16s)]
*  I don't have TikTok, but I use the Instagram reels. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1120.16s)]
*  God damn it. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1123.16s)]
*  It's so nuts like one after the other. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1124.16s)]
*  It's so interesting watching this mad scramble of people trying to figure out a new way to get your attention, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1126.16s)]
*  whether it's through like shooting a bow and arrow with your feet over your head at balloons. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1134.16s)]
*  You ever seen those gals that do that? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1139.16s)]
*  They stand on their hands and they have a bow in their feet and they have their legs all the way over the top of their head. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1141.16s)]
*  And they draw the bow back with their feet and shoot it. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1148.16s)]
*  I saw another thing kind of like that, but there was no bow and arrow involved. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1151.16s)]
*  But yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1153.16s)]
*  This is a thing. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1154.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that sounds good. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1155.16s)]
*  That sounds good. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1157.16s)]
*  Are they wearing clothing as well? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1158.16s)]
*  No, why would they be wearing clothing? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1160.16s)]
*  OK, cool. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1161.16s)]
*  They wear like bikinis. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1162.16s)]
*  They're hot. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1163.16s)]
*  Most gals with that kind of mobility with your body, you're probably pretty hot. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1164.16s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1170.16s)]
*  How could you not have a hot body if you could do that? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1171.16s)]
*  If you could get your butt over the top of your head and have your legs pull a bow back and then aim it and shoot it? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1174.16s)]
*  I certainly can't do that. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1180.16s)]
*  Who the fuck can do that? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1182.16s)]
*  What percentage of the population can do that? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1183.16s)]
*  See, and this is kind of, I think, where we started with us was, you know, how did I find out about rap music? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1188.16s)]
*  How did I find out about Norm? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1196.16s)]
*  You know, we had to use a certain sense of creativity and we had to go out of our way to find out about stuff. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1198.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1205.16s)]
*  And so it, you know, sounding like some couple of old guys here. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1206.16s)]
*  We are a couple of old guys. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1211.16s)]
*  Yeah, complaining about how the world was better before. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1212.16s)]
*  But I don't think the world was better before. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1215.16s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that's true. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1217.16s)]
*  There's some aspects of it that I think forced us to be just a little bit more creative and think out of the box because we were, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1218.16s)]
*  or at least in a different way, because you'd go find some drum machine or you'd go down to the little comedy club in Ottawa. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1226.16s)]
*  And stand-up comedy wasn't a mainstream thing then, you know. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1234.16s)]
*  It was pretty big, but not in Ottawa. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1237.16s)]
*  It was sort of almost like you felt like you were going somewhere that you weren't supposed to go. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1238.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1241.16s)]
*  You go down in the basement. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1242.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1243.16s)]
*  I was 16 years old. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1244.16s)]
*  I'm in a bar, you know, and there's some guy on stage and they're not talking about Norm MacDonald on television yet. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1245.16s)]
*  He hadn't gone to SNL yet. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1251.16s)]
*  I remember I'd see him and my friends would see him and then we'd go to school and we'd tell our friends, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1253.16s)]
*  you've got to go see this guy, Norm MacDonald. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1259.16s)]
*  He'd come every three times a year and every time he'd come we'd be there. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1261.16s)]
*  And it was just like this sort of myth. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1263.16s)]
*  It was a mythology to it, you know. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1265.16s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you got, we heard he moved to Los Angeles because he was writing for Roseanne, you know. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1267.16s)]
*  We all heard about this and it was this sort of, you know, all the amateur comics, the kids up there doing it. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1272.16s)]
*  Well, I guess I was the kid doing it. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1281.16s)]
*  Everyone else was kind of in their 20s and 30s, but everybody was just kind of like, there's hope. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1283.16s)]
*  We can get out of Ottawa, man. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1288.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1290.16s)]
*  There's something out there. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1291.16s)]
*  And then SNL and everything. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1293.16s)]
*  It was just amazing to watch him do that. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1294.16s)]
*  But I was having a good chat with Adam at the club, you know, about Norm because he was, of course, famously his sidekick on his show. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1296.16s)]
*  So it was such a shame to see Norm disappear like that. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1305.16s)]
*  He was talking about coming out here too. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1308.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1311.16s)]
*  So much has happened since I was here last. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1313.16s)]
*  I got a lot of stuff I wanted. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1316.16s)]
*  First of all, before I start talking about me, though, I just wanted to say thanks for having me at the club this weekend. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1318.16s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1324.16s)]
*  I'm so stoked. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1325.16s)]
*  The club is amazing. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1326.16s)]
*  And I've been hanging out there for the last two nights. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1328.16s)]
*  And I came in a little early and wanted to hang out and just settle in. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1333.16s)]
*  And man, it's just such a vibe there. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1337.16s)]
*  It's just such a perfect, perfect comedy club. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1340.16s)]
*  You did such an amazing job. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1343.16s)]
*  You're the only guy that brings his dog everywhere that's not annoying. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1344.16s)]
*  Maybe ever. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1347.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1348.16s)]
*  Maybe ever. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1349.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1350.16s)]
*  And everybody loves Charlie. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1351.16s)]
*  Yeah, everybody loves Charlie. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1352.16s)]
*  Charlie's in here with us now. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1353.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1355.16s)]
*  Charlie's a sweetie. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1356.16s)]
*  Charlie is, I got Charlie right before I came here the last time. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1357.16s)]
*  She's named after the John Steinbeck novel Travels with Charlie because I was out in the van. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1363.16s)]
*  And that book's about Steinbeck in the 60s, got a camper van, made a camper van out of a pickup truck. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1369.16s)]
*  And he drove across America and he wrote a book about America and its differences. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1374.16s)]
*  It's called Travels with Charlie in Search of America. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1379.16s)]
*  And I got Charlie at a rescue called Thrive is the name of the rescue, which is actually run by Jimmy Durante's daughter in San Diego, the entertainer Jimmy Durante who, it's like a ranch in San Diego. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1381.16s)]
*  And they bring these dogs in from the Bahamas in Mexico called Potcake Dogs. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1397.16s)]
*  And Charlie. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1402.16s)]
*  Anyways, we went out in the desert and everybody loves Charlie, like you said. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1405.16s)]
*  There's Charlie. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1412.16s)]
*  Charlie looks like she was just taking a nap. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1413.16s)]
*  She's like, what the fuck, you waking me up, my dad? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1415.16s)]
*  But just taking a nap. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1417.16s)]
*  The funniest thing is... [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1419.16s)]
*  Charlie actually goes on stage with you, we should tell people. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1420.16s)]
*  Yeah, she just chills out up there. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1422.16s)]
*  I just kind of take her... [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1424.16s)]
*  It's got to be so weird when you're killing all that noise. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1425.16s)]
*  She's kind of used to it. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1428.16s)]
*  But isn't that strange? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1431.16s)]
*  What a strange experience for a dog to be in the Bahamas. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1433.16s)]
*  And then all of a sudden she's on stage with Tom Green. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1437.16s)]
*  That's right. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1441.16s)]
*  She left the Bahamas. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1442.16s)]
*  She's cheering and she's just sitting there like, what the fuck is this? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1443.16s)]
*  Yeah, I'd look at her sometimes and wonder. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1446.16s)]
*  She left at five weeks old, the Bahamas. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1448.16s)]
*  So that was when she got out of there, five weeks old. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1450.16s)]
*  And then was in San Diego. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1453.16s)]
*  She got adopted by somebody else for like three months basically. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1455.16s)]
*  And then they couldn't keep her. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1459.16s)]
*  I got her at three months. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1461.16s)]
*  And it's funny, she grows up in the Bahamas. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1463.16s)]
*  Then she goes to California. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1466.16s)]
*  And then I moved back to Canada since I was last here. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1468.16s)]
*  And I left Los Angeles following in your footsteps. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1473.16s)]
*  The exodus continues. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1476.16s)]
*  It wasn't just me, man. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1478.16s)]
*  I keep getting labeled as a pied piper. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1480.16s)]
*  Come on, everybody was leaving. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1483.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1485.16s)]
*  I've got to say though, like, you know, there was a lot of factors to change my entire life. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1486.16s)]
*  I sold my house around the time right after I was here. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1494.16s)]
*  And that was the house that you did the Tom Green show for. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1499.16s)]
*  That I owned for 18 years, that I did the Webovision show in. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1502.16s)]
*  Webovision we called it. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1505.16s)]
*  Why don't you do a show now? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1506.16s)]
*  So I'm actually, I'm building a podcast studio in my barn. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1508.16s)]
*  It's in a unheated century barn. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1512.16s)]
*  Are you going to heat it? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1517.16s)]
*  Nope, not going to heat it. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1518.16s)]
*  No. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1519.16s)]
*  Are you going to have conversations where you're freezing to death? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1520.16s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to wear really warm jackets. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1522.16s)]
*  That's one thing that's cool about Canada. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1524.16s)]
*  Like people talk about the cold and how fucking cold it is up there. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1526.16s)]
*  But like the cool thing about the cold when you kind of get acclimated to it is you can kind of regulate your temperature. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1531.16s)]
*  Like you wear a really warm Arctic jacket. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1539.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1541.16s)]
*  In the barn while you're doing the podcast. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1542.16s)]
*  We'll probably move it in at some point. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1543.16s)]
*  Also you can die outside. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1545.16s)]
*  You can die. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1547.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1548.16s)]
*  It's a different thing. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1549.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1550.16s)]
*  It's a different thing. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1551.16s)]
*  And it makes more resilient people. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1552.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1553.16s)]
*  I think it makes better people. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1554.16s)]
*  I really do. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1555.16s)]
*  I was thinking about how you do, there's the barn. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1556.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1559.16s)]
*  You're freezing your dick off son. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1560.16s)]
*  First of all. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1561.16s)]

*  That's my dad there. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1563.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1564.16s)]
*  You know what you should get sponsored by like one of those like heater bodysuit companies. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1565.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1571.16s)]
*  For deer hunters when they sit in those blinds. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1572.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1574.16s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1575.16s)]
*  Deer hunters when they sit in tree stands. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1576.16s)]
*  You know how fucking cold you get? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1577.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1579.16s)]
*  See if it's cold out that's one thing. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1580.16s)]
*  But if it's cold out and you're not moving that's another thing. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1581.16s)]
*  That's another thing. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1584.16s)]
*  You could be, it could be fucking zero degrees. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1585.16s)]
*  But if you're hiking you're fine. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1587.16s)]
*  Well I wear these, we're actually talking to a sponsor right now. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1589.16s)]
*  They might sponsor it. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1592.16s)]
*  They're this clothing company, Baffin, and they make the warmest jackets right. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1594.16s)]
*  So it's like you can really regulate your temperature right. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1598.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1603.16s)]
*  And that's the thing like if you know how to do that. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1604.16s)]
*  Because I, it's been a lifestyle change. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1606.16s)]
*  I bought, I got this farm. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1610.16s)]
*  I'm on a farm now that I live on and basically I'm going to live there now for the rest of my life. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1612.16s)]
*  I know it. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1618.16s)]
*  I'm never going to leave this place. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1619.16s)]
*  I love it so much. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1620.16s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1621.16s)]
*  It's a wilderness area with some. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1622.16s)]
*  I enjoy your videos from there. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1623.16s)]
*  It looks like you're really enjoying it. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1624.16s)]
*  I am really loving it. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1626.16s)]
*  You know it's just, it's just such a piece of mine to get up in the morning. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1628.16s)]
*  And I've got this mule and I got my strap there on the side. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1634.16s)]
*  Yeah I got my mule. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1639.16s)]
*  And this is a whole new thing Joe. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1642.16s)]
*  I mean I don't know, I didn't, first of all I didn't know anything about horses and mules. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1644.16s)]
*  But I got a mule and a donkey and some chickens. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1650.16s)]
*  So a mule is a cross between a donkey and a horse, correct? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1652.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1656.16s)]
*  Is that how it works? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1657.16s)]
*  And I did not know that a year and a half ago. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1658.16s)]
*  They're supposed to like the most resilient animals for like riding trails and stuff. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1660.16s)]
*  So mules are, so yeah. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1666.16s)]
*  It's sort of all, it all started with I found this property and this farm and I wanted to be outside. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1668.16s)]
*  And then there was these two old barns there. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1674.16s)]
*  And I would look at these barns and I'd say they were kind of calling for something to be put in them. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1676.16s)]
*  They were 100 years old. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1681.16s)]
*  There was stuff stored in them. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1682.16s)]
*  And so some friends of mine and I, we kind of cleaned up the barns and we, I got this mule and this donkey. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1684.16s)]
*  And so initially the idea was I thought a mule would be kind of funny, right? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1692.16s)]
*  Because they got bigger ears and they're kind of, I was thinking three amigos. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1698.16s)]
*  I was thinking a donkey. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1702.16s)]
*  I was thinking a mule was a donkey. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1703.16s)]
*  I didn't even really know that much about it. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1704.16s)]
*  But, and I started looking for a mule that you could ride. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1706.16s)]
*  And there's not that many mules in Canada. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1712.16s)]
*  They're much more of a Southwestern, you know, American thing. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1715.16s)]
*  You know, George Washington brought mules to America. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1718.16s)]
*  It was a big part of, you know, then settling America. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1722.16s)]
*  They would use him for farming. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1725.16s)]
*  He brought them in? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1727.16s)]
*  Yeah. He was instrumental in being a big part of getting mules here. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1728.16s)]
*  They would use them for, you know, harvesting, you know, pulling, you know, harvesting crops and doing all the work around the farms and stuff. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1731.16s)]
*  They have also been used in war a lot. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1738.16s)]
*  They've been used in military. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1740.16s)]
*  So the pioneers preferred them to horses. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1742.16s)]
*  Yeah, they're extremely strong and they're very, very smart. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1745.16s)]
*  They can go longer without water. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1749.16s)]
*  Longer with, yep. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1750.16s)]
*  They use less water, less, less food. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1751.16s)]
*  My friend Clay Newcomb is actually a mule expert. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1753.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1756.16s)]
*  He's been on the podcast before. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1757.16s)]
*  Oh, cool. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1758.16s)]
*  He talked about fancy mules and like how you pick a mule and train in a mule. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1759.16s)]
*  Oh, I want to. Oh, I follow him actually. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1764.16s)]
*  I follow Clay. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1765.16s)]
*  Clay's interesting. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1767.16s)]
*  On TikTok. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1768.16s)]
*  He's got a podcast called the Bear Grease Podcast. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1769.16s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1772.16s)]
*  You know, a lot of it is about bear hunting in Arkansas. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1773.16s)]
*  Oh, nice, nice. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1775.16s)]
*  And just interesting like outdoor stories. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1776.16s)]
*  Like he's a very, very interesting guy, but he just knows a ton about mules. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1780.16s)]
*  Well, the thing that's so crazy about them is they're extremely smart to a point that it's, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1784.16s)]
*  you know, people say stubborn as a mule. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1790.16s)]
*  It's not really stubbornness. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1792.16s)]
*  What is it? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1794.16s)]
*  What is it? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1795.16s)]
*  Self-preservation. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1796.16s)]
*  So they figure out basically I'm riding this animal now. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1797.16s)]
*  She's a very big mule, as you can see. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1802.16s)]
*  She's a very big mule. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1804.16s)]
*  She's called 16.3 hands is the way you measure horses and mules. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1805.16s)]
*  And she's as tall as they get. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1808.16s)]
*  Her mother was a horse, so a Percheron paint mix. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1810.16s)]
*  So it's a Percheron's a workhorse, almost like a Clydesdale. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1817.16s)]
*  So she gets her size from that and her father's a mammoth donkey. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1821.16s)]
*  And she's 10 years old. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1824.16s)]
*  A mammoth donkey? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1825.16s)]
*  Yeah, a mammoth. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1826.16s)]
*  What a great name. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1827.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1829.16s)]
*  It's definitely created a very large, strong, serious animal. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1830.16s)]
*  I want to see a picture of a mammoth donkey. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1838.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1840.16s)]
*  How big is it? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1841.16s)]
*  There we go. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1842.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1843.16s)]
*  So you can sort of see. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1844.16s)]
*  Whoa, look at the size of that fucking thing. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1845.16s)]
*  That's a donkey? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1846.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1847.16s)]
*  Holy shit, dude. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1848.16s)]
*  And you can ride those too. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1849.16s)]
*  So. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1850.16s)]
*  And that's. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1851.16s)]
*  But are donkeys harder, between 900 and 1200 pounds. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1852.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1857.16s)]
*  Are donkeys harder to train than mules? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1858.16s)]
*  I'm not sure of the answer to that. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1861.16s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1863.16s)]
*  But I know that mules are easier to train than horses. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1864.16s)]
*  So I would assume, because they learn. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1866.16s)]
*  Mules are sterile. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1868.16s)]
*  They're sterile, yeah. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1869.16s)]
*  So a. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1870.16s)]
*  It's a hybrid animal and it can't breed, which isn't that fascinating that like a male of [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1871.16s)]
*  one species can breed with a male of another species. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1879.16s)]
*  They make an offspring. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1882.16s)]
*  It's alive. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1883.16s)]
*  It has testicles. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1884.16s)]
*  It has sex drive. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1885.16s)]
*  It has everything. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1886.16s)]
*  Can't breed. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1887.16s)]
*  Isn't that weird? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1888.16s)]
*  So the horse has. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1889.16s)]
*  Let me get this right. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1890.16s)]
*  I've been trying to learn as much about it as possible because I'm riding this thing and [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1893.16s)]
*  I don't want to die because you can fall off it and it's not fun falling off. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1896.16s)]
*  I've fallen off a couple of times. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1900.16s)]
*  Have you really? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1901.16s)]
*  Yeah, I wasn't too bad. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1902.16s)]
*  By yourself? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1903.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1904.16s)]
*  Out there in the middle of nowhere? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1905.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1906.16s)]
*  It was my own fault. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1907.16s)]
*  I was streaming on Instagram and not paying attention. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1908.16s)]
*  That's a good for beginners. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1910.96s)]
*  Don't let go of the reins and play with your phone while you're riding on a 1400 pound [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1912.76s)]
*  mule. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1916.5600000000002s)]
*  Fanny's 1400 pounds. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1917.5600000000002s)]
*  That's fucking huge, man. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1918.5600000000002s)]
*  But yeah, I guess it's a horse has 64 chromosomes and a donkey has 62. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1920.56s)]
*  And so when they breed, it ends up that the donkey, the mule has 63 chromosomes, which [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1927.36s)]
*  is not an even number and therefore makes it sterile. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1936.6s)]
*  So this is what I'm trying to. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1939.04s)]
*  So that's what it is. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1941.04s)]
*  Something's kind of complicated like that. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1942.04s)]
*  Isn't it fascinating though that nature figured out a way to stop everything from fucking [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1944.04s)]
*  everything and just getting pregnant? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1949.16s)]
*  Isn't it like nature's like we've got to have a system in here because that's just [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1951.3600000000001s)]
*  that's untenable. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1956.44s)]
*  That's going to lead to chaos. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1958.24s)]
*  Like if humans imagine, can you imagine humans could get other things pregnant, everything [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1960.24s)]
*  would be a hybrid of a human. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1966.3200000000002s)]
*  Everything. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1968.16s)]
*  Yeah, like a lobster human hybrids. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1969.16s)]
*  Somebody would do that. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1971.92s)]
*  Island fill with turtle people, people walking around with exoskeletons going, hey, this [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1972.92s)]
*  ain't so bad. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1976.5600000000002s)]
*  Somebody on the island, I can't believe someone fucked a turtle. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1977.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1980.84s)]
*  And there's going to be this guy like with a turtle shell on. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1981.84s)]
*  Fuck you. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1984.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1985.1599999999999s)]
*  He's going to be mad at you. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1986.1599999999999s)]
*  Like I'm just saying. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1987.1599999999999s)]
*  Because people are insane. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1988.1599999999999s)]
*  Insane. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1989.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, somebody has probably fucked a turtle. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1990.1599999999999s)]
*  100%. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1991.1599999999999s)]
*  Someone's fucked a turtle. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1992.1599999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1993.1599999999999s)]
*  If you had to bet everything you own. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1994.1599999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1995.1599999999999s)]
*  100%. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1996.1599999999999s)]
*  A guy somewhere has been hopped up on some fucking Vietnamese street math. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=1997.1599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2002.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2003.44s)]
*  Fucked a turtle. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2004.44s)]
*  Of course. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2005.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2006.44s)]
*  Somewhere in the Southwest. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2008.3200000000002s)]
*  Over there hiding from the law or something. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2009.88s)]
*  And he's messed up and he fucked a turtle. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2011.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2013.52s)]
*  People have fucked everything. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2014.52s)]
*  But no result because of the nature has made these protections, thankfully. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2015.52s)]
*  The wildest hybrid, of course, is the liger. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2019.46s)]
*  Because they miss the gene that regulates size. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2022.4s)]
*  They don't have the same gene that like a tiger and a lion does. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2026.7s)]
*  I've seen those. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2030.64s)]
*  I forget which one, how does it work? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2031.64s)]
*  Is it a male lion and a female tiger or a male tiger and a female lion? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2033.0800000000002s)]
*  I forget which one it is. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2038.12s)]
*  But in that combination when they make a liger, they just keep growing. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2039.12s)]
*  They're so big. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2042.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2043.84s)]
*  I've looked at these on the internet. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2044.84s)]
*  These, I don't, I, you know, the thing is, I guess a tiger and a lion and a donkey and [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2045.84s)]
*  a horse are close enough together in evolution to be able to do this. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2051.56s)]
*  And there's, I guess, no animal that is close enough to us to be able to come close enough. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2057.24s)]
*  Luckily. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2062.84s)]
*  Because, you know, they've done experiments with other primates. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2063.84s)]
*  Maybe just nobody's fucked the right thing yet to figure it out. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2065.4s)]
*  I bet someone pulled it off in China or Russia or something like that. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2068.08s)]
*  They probably got some chimp-human hybrid somewhere. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2071.56s)]
*  I've heard sort of internet conspiracy theories that there was a Russian experiment that went [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2074.88s)]
*  awry or something like this. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2080.7200000000003s)]
*  There was this one very strange case of a chimpanzee that they call humanzy. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2082.44s)]
*  And this chimpanzee had very human-like features and it lived with a family. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2087.36s)]
*  I forget if it was a family of researchers, I forget the story, but they always end tragically [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2093.52s)]
*  because those things, ultimately, as they get older, they want to be the boss. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2097.24s)]
*  It's a big male. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2102.0s)]
*  And they're going to just fuck you up. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2103.0s)]
*  They're going to bite your fingers off or bite your friend's fingers. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2104.64s)]
*  It's always something like that. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2107.2799999999997s)]
*  They always do something horribly, horribly violent, eventually. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2108.2799999999997s)]
*  But this one that they had, they had him for a long time and he looked like a human. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2112.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2116.52s)]
*  Look, he looked weird. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2117.52s)]
*  And he stood upright a lot and he wore clothes. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2119.7999999999997s)]
*  He's got a big old donkey dick. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2122.4s)]
*  Look at that donkey dick. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2123.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2124.7599999999998s)]
*  The humanzy of Orange Park. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2127.7599999999998s)]
*  First of all, humanzy is such a great name. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2129.56s)]
*  I almost wish it had worked just for that reason alone. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2131.48s)]
*  Humanzy. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2134.36s)]
*  I mean, there'd be humanzies going around. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2135.36s)]
*  But yeah, I often kind of have little... [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2137.2s)]
*  See if you can find... [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2141.2s)]
*  There's some weird shocking pictures of it. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2142.8s)]
*  Like that one in the upper right-hand corner. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2145.38s)]
*  The one... [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2147.12s)]
*  Yeah, right there. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2148.12s)]
*  And they're so strong. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2149.12s)]
*  Click on that one. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2150.12s)]
*  It's got an odd face. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2151.2s)]
*  And there's some pictures, I think, that are probably doctored that made it a little more [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2154.04s)]
*  human-looking that confused people. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2157.7999999999997s)]
*  But the thing, like as it got older... [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2160.2799999999997s)]
*  See if you can find the older pictures of it. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2163.56s)]
*  It looked real weird, man. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2165.7599999999998s)]
*  But it was just a chimp. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2169.6s)]
*  It was just a chimp that had been taught to behave that way. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2170.6s)]
*  Look at how he's walking. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2175.6s)]
*  He's walking like a chimp. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2176.6s)]
*  He's not walking like a human. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2177.6s)]
*  Look at the shoulders and the arms. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2178.6s)]
*  That's a chimp. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2180.08s)]
*  I sometimes think about the close calls I've had with... [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2181.08s)]
*  A couple times with animals where I wasn't really giving them the... [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2185.56s)]
*  Not just understanding the power they had. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2189.8399999999997s)]
*  I had a chimpanzee on a show I did once on my TV show back in the day. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2192.4s)]
*  And it was a trained chimpanzee, but massive. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2197.6s)]
*  And I remember after the show, I just said, hey, can I hang out with the chimpanzees? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2203.72s)]
*  So it came out and I was just sitting out within the parking lot for about half an [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2208.04s)]
*  hour. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2210.8s)]
*  Just me and this chimpanzee right in front of me, looking right in my eyes. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2211.8s)]
*  It was playing with the buttons on my shirt. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2213.88s)]
*  And the trainer was 20 feet away. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2216.24s)]
*  And I just thought it was the cutest thing. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2218.7599999999998s)]
*  And then a few years later, I read about the chimpanzee ripping that... [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2221.2799999999997s)]
*  Killing people and how violent they are. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2226.12s)]
*  And you go, man, that is... [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2227.7599999999998s)]
*  I had a macaw at one point, which I actually had to get rid of. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2231.56s)]
*  Big red parrot, a macaw. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2236.96s)]
*  And I got it when it was 13 months old. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2238.76s)]
*  And this was my biggest disappointment, I'd say, with a pet. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2244.44s)]
*  Because I had gotten this macaw. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2249.76s)]
*  It was named Rex. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2251.2s)]
*  He was on the web show for a period of time. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2252.88s)]
*  That was after you were on that time. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2254.8s)]
*  And I really love this thing. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2257.6s)]
*  And I love animals. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2259.08s)]
*  I was so fascinated by it because I was realizing, oh, this is a pet that I'm going to have for [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2261.4s)]
*  the rest of my life. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2266.2s)]
*  And I was all dedicated to this. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2267.3199999999997s)]
*  And I was really kind of somewhat moved by the fact that I was going to be having this [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2270.12s)]
*  beautiful macaw for the rest of my life. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2273.72s)]
*  And it would pick my teeth and it would stick its beak in my mouth and literally just kind [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2275.52s)]
*  of put its plate and chew on my ear and all of this kind of stuff. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2281.7999999999997s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, when it got to be about 13 years old, it just became a real [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2286.6s)]
*  asshole. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2292.48s)]
*  Like it really, really changed. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2293.48s)]
*  It had been going from this little baby to I couldn't put my hand in the cage without [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2295.16s)]
*  it really biting hard and almost took my finger off. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2299.92s)]
*  I had to go in the cage to clean the cage and I couldn't pick it up anymore. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2304.68s)]
*  And I actually had to find it a new home. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2308.96s)]
*  Do you think it just didn't like being in a cage? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2311.52s)]
*  I'm sure it didn't. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2314.48s)]
*  I wouldn't like it myself, you know? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2315.48s)]
*  And that feels bad too. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2319.16s)]
*  That's a thing I don't really like about having a macaw. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2320.16s)]
*  You're a prison warden. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2321.72s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2322.96s)]
*  I started to feel really bad. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2324.04s)]
*  So I took it back to the bird place where I'd gotten it and they said to me, oh yeah, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2325.44s)]
*  we don't, it's been 13 years later. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2330.12s)]
*  I've been spending 75 bucks a month on walnuts for 13 years. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2333.48s)]
*  These eat a lot of walnuts. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2338.12s)]
*  And then they say, oh yeah, we don't sell macaws anymore because when they get to be [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2339.6s)]
*  13, they change and they become really, really mean. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2343.28s)]
*  I'm like, you could have told me that 13 years ago. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2346.84s)]
*  So it's like there's an internal clock? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2349.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2352.44s)]
*  They hit like a puberty thing. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2353.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2354.92s)]
*  And so I feel bad about it. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2355.92s)]
*  I got her a better home. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2356.92s)]
*  That's why it's scary to be in front of a chimp. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2358.2000000000003s)]
*  The chimp, they could just decide. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2360.88s)]
*  I just want to fuck this guy up. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2363.6s)]
*  I have these moments where I think about the time when that macaw would have its beak in [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2365.12s)]
*  my mouth just months before it could have ripped my face apart sitting with that. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2368.96s)]
*  But the Fanny, this mule, and I have the donkey as well, who was her companion for her named [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2373.08s)]
*  Kia. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2379.2400000000002s)]
*  She was a two-year-old donkey. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2380.2400000000002s)]
*  And the donkey will live to be 50 potentially. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2382.56s)]
*  And the Fanny is a big animal, so she could live to be 30, 35 years old. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2387.2s)]
*  And so she's 10 now. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2392.16s)]
*  So it's a big responsibility. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2393.92s)]
*  And I really kind of consider them now after having them just for a short time, kind of [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2395.96s)]
*  family. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2400.44s)]
*  It's an amazing thing. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2401.44s)]
*  But I think the thing that's most interesting about a mule, and we won't talk about mules [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2403.6s)]
*  for the whole show, but they are so smart that they figure you out. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2409.88s)]
*  So I'm new to this. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2417.6400000000003s)]
*  So when I first got her, I was given one day of training on how to ride a horse. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2419.32s)]
*  So I learned how to saddle her up. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2425.56s)]
*  I learned how to get up on this thing. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2427.76s)]
*  You pull the rein, you look where you want to go, you push with your foot opposite of [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2429.44s)]
*  the side you want to turn. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2433.96s)]
*  There's a sort of little rhythm to that. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2434.96s)]
*  It went great for about a month, but then she started sort of figuring out that I was [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2438.28s)]
*  sort of uncertain in what I was doing. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2442.84s)]
*  She started to understand that I didn't know what I was doing. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2445.32s)]
*  And so she starts testing me. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2449.8s)]
*  And I don't necessarily realize that's what's going on. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2452.8s)]
*  So when I'd be saddling her up, she would move. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2457.0800000000004s)]
*  So I go to saddle her, take the saddle, it's a big saddle, you got to put it up on her [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2461.0s)]
*  back, put a saddle pad on, and you got to put the saddle on. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2463.92s)]
*  And then she would move into me and kind of push me. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2466.84s)]
*  And I didn't really know how to prevent that because she's 1,400 pounds. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2469.28s)]
*  So I'd have to kind of lead her around, try to get her back in position. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2471.92s)]
*  It became this weird sort of dance of me running around trying to get the saddle on. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2475.1200000000003s)]
*  I'd eventually get it on. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2479.4s)]
*  But what happens is she ends up losing all respect for me because I'm letting her sort [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2480.6000000000004s)]
*  of be the leader. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2490.08s)]
*  And so Mule really wants me to be the leader. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2494.56s)]
*  And it's hard for me to be the leader at first because I'm uncertain. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2501.34s)]
*  So they sense uncertainty. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2504.9s)]
*  So when I'm riding her, there's wolves at my place in the woods. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2509.04s)]
*  Oh, fun. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2514.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2515.92s)]
*  I got a story about that too. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2516.92s)]
*  And there's wolves there. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2518.8s)]
*  I was showing Jamie before the show. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2519.8s)]
*  There's a video of them on my trail cams. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2521.52s)]
*  She sees them coming out of the woods at night. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2524.56s)]
*  She doesn't necessarily want to go into the woods. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2527.48s)]
*  She thinks it's unsafe. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2530.02s)]
*  It's not because obviously they're not going to attack her and me. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2532.2000000000003s)]
*  She's a giant mule. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2534.96s)]
*  But she thinks that. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2535.96s)]
*  So over time, she started to not want to go in that direction. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2537.6s)]
*  She stopped wanting to turn left. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2541.08s)]
*  And so what would happen is I started to realize she didn't want to go there. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2543.2000000000003s)]
*  So every time I wanted to go there, I would get nervous. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2548.0s)]
*  I would feel uncertain. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2550.48s)]
*  Oh, she's not going to want to go there. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2551.48s)]
*  She would sense that I was nervous and it would double down and then she wouldn't go [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2552.92s)]
*  in there. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2555.6800000000003s)]
*  So I had to kind of get into this real sort of a psychological retraining kind of a mule [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2556.6800000000003s)]
*  intervention from the people that raised her. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2564.96s)]
*  I have so many questions. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2567.6s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2568.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2569.6s)]
*  It's really wild. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2570.6s)]
*  It's really interesting the intricacy of how you figure this out. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2571.6s)]
*  Now, did you have any training before you got a mule? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2576.4s)]
*  So she was owned by a single owner up in northern Canada in a place called Thunder Bay, which [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2582.0s)]
*  is about 18 hours drive north of me. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2590.28s)]
*  Way colder up there. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2594.36s)]
*  She's like in Club Med down now in southern Canada. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2595.36s)]
*  She's probably loving it. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2598.44s)]
*  And her owners were Kaya and Lisa who have a, they breed mules and they're called Twister [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2600.6s)]
*  mules. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2606.56s)]
*  Did you get any training? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2607.56s)]
*  They drove her down and we spent about three days. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2608.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2611.08s)]
*  And they showed me how to saddle up and they talked to me about it. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2612.08s)]
*  And I learned as much as one can learn in three days. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2614.2799999999997s)]
*  There's the basics, right? [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2619.48s)]
*  There's the basics. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2621.08s)]
*  Did you do a lot of it when they were there by yourself? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2622.08s)]
*  They just told you how to do it and you walked over and did it. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2625.24s)]
*  They spent time with me for about three days. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2627.88s)]
*  But this is kind of, they're telling me I'm doing quite well because I actually am able [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2629.94s)]
*  to handle this animal now, but it's been an interesting journey since June. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2634.3s)]
*  I got her in June because at first it's, the very first sort of on the surface way that [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2638.84s)]
*  you ride a mule is you look where you want to go. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2650.2400000000002s)]
*  Lightly pull the rein. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2657.88s)]
*  If you want to go left, you pull the left lane, rein lightly. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2660.84s)]
*  If that doesn't work, but you might not even have to pull the rein. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2664.6000000000004s)]
*  You could just look where you want to go and they feel your body shifting. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2667.2799999999997s)]
*  They sense your intent and you have to look in that direction. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2670.64s)]
*  Like Avatar when you link up with the dragon. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2675.7599999999998s)]
*  It's like telepathy for sure. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2678.12s)]
*  It really is. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2680.08s)]
*  And you feel it and it's such a really cool feeling when you really get into the pocket [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2681.08s)]
*  with it. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2684.12s)]
*  So then you pull lightly, then you do a little push with your foot. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2685.12s)]
*  And so that's all sort of very, you know, physical stuff. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2689.04s)]
*  And it worked fine for a while, but then, you know, I didn't quite understand the overall [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2695.52s)]
*  psychological sort of hierarchy that gets created and a trust level that's created between [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2702.28s)]
*  the mule and myself. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2709.88s)]
*  The more I screwed up, she's just even in the barnyard, the more I let her get in my [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2711.68s)]
*  space. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2715.0s)]
*  You don't ever want to let a mule get in your space. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2716.0s)]
*  It gets in your space. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2718.12s)]
*  A very sort of easy way to control that is you can just put your hands up to her eyes [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2719.12s)]
*  like that. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2728.2400000000002s)]
*  You don't even have to touch her. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2729.2400000000002s)]
*  And then they back off. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2731.44s)]
*  I didn't know that, right? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2732.44s)]
*  So I was kind of like, I'm pushing it. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2734.0s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2735.64s)]
*  I was trying to stop. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2736.64s)]
*  And then it realizes how small you are in comparison. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2737.64s)]
*  It realizes how small I am and it realizes I don't know what I'm doing. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2739.64s)]
*  And it loses all respect. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2743.2000000000003s)]
*  And so you start to kind of, so once you start to learn a little bit deeper about how to [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2746.4s)]
*  handle those just on the ground with her, then once you get up on her, she has a little [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2751.12s)]
*  bit more respect and is more apt to listen to you. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2758.08s)]
*  But it was really interesting because they came back. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2760.1800000000003s)]
*  They're really great. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2764.56s)]
*  They're trying to bring more mules into Canada because they love mules. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2766.48s)]
*  And there is something very different and special about mules because of their intelligence. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2770.96s)]
*  And so it's really interesting. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2777.16s)]
*  They came back and spent some more time with me. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2779.16s)]
*  And we went out on the trail. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2781.92s)]
*  And Fanny doesn't like ATVs. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2786.92s)]
*  So I've got this Polaris side by side that I drive around the property on. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2790.48s)]
*  It's a noisy ATV, four-wheel vehicle thing. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2793.96s)]
*  And they were driving ahead of me to kind of instruct me and I'm following along. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2799.44s)]
*  And we're coming up the trail and they stopped. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2804.04s)]
*  And as we approach the ATV, it's parked on the trail. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2807.2000000000003s)]
*  There's a space on the side. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2809.76s)]
*  I'm going to ride around the trail. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2810.76s)]
*  But in my head, I'm thinking, oh, Fanny's not going to want to go around this ATV. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2811.92s)]
*  And we get up there and I try to turn around the ATV by looking, pulling the rein, pushing [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2816.48s)]
*  my leg. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2820.76s)]
*  She just stops. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2821.76s)]
*  And when she stops and when she decides she doesn't want to go, this isn't like a little [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2822.76s)]
*  trail riding carnival horse. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2826.38s)]
*  She gets going and will turn and really kind of get quite aggressive in a way, which is [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2829.16s)]
*  kind of exciting though, I've got to tell you. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2837.8799999999997s)]
*  And I was a skateboarder. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2839.7999999999997s)]
*  I had a pretty good balance. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2840.7999999999997s)]
*  So it was kind of interesting. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2842.2799999999997s)]
*  But the thing that was wild about it, so then I go, well, she's not going to want to go [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2844.96s)]
*  around the ATV, I say to Kaya and Lisa. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2850.2799999999997s)]
*  And they say, no, no, well, it's not that she doesn't want to go around the ATV. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2853.24s)]
*  It's she knows that you think she doesn't want to go around the ATV. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2857.08s)]
*  You have to think in your head that she wants to go around the ATV. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2861.24s)]
*  What? [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2865.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2866.08s)]
*  Really? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2867.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2868.08s)]
*  Because when you're subconsciously, whether we know it or not, as human beings, we didn't [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2869.08s)]
*  always have language, right? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2875.2799999999997s)]
*  We didn't. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2877.2799999999997s)]
*  Someone invented language at some point. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2878.2799999999997s)]
*  Before that, we were just kind of all this nonverbal communication and energy, right? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2879.5s)]
*  So you get up to the ATV and if I'm thinking, oh, she's not going to go around the ATV. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2884.08s)]
*  Oh, look, look, I just, my whole body just went like that. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2889.48s)]
*  You know, I sighed. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2891.36s)]
*  I felt like a sense of defeat, right? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2892.36s)]
*  She feels that just through her saddle. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2894.44s)]
*  It's not total voodoo. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2897.44s)]
*  She feels like... [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2899.6s)]
*  Yeah, but there might be a little bit of voodoo. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2900.6s)]
*  Possibly as well. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2903.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, there's a magic to it. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2904.2799999999997s)]
*  It seems like you can't attribute all that to body. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2905.2799999999997s)]
*  She feels it. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2906.9s)]
*  She feels it. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2907.9s)]
*  And she's so smart. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2908.9s)]
*  A horse doesn't necessarily sense that as easily as a mule, quite a bit less easily. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2909.9s)]
*  So that's why people say mules are stubborn because they're sensing all of these little [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2915.86s)]
*  nonverbal cues that a horse might just be apt to say, oh, he pulled on the reins, so [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2919.5s)]
*  I'm going to go that way. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2923.78s)]
*  He pushed his foot, so I'm going to go that way. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2924.78s)]
*  And that's why also mules are also extremely, they're used in war and they're used in Grand [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2928.3s)]
*  Canyon trail riding and things like this. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2936.5s)]
*  Because if a horse is walking along the edge of a cliff and a snake jumps out, the horse [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2938.54s)]
*  might be apt to just jump the other way off the cliff, killing itself. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2945.9s)]
*  Whereas a mule will instantly identify cliff that way, snake that way, danger both ways, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2950.46s)]
*  mule will kill the snake. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2957.1s)]
*  It'll stomp out the snake. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2958.74s)]
*  Or at least won't jump off the cliff. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2961.08s)]
*  So it's... [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2963.34s)]
*  That's way better. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2964.34s)]
*  Yeah, better. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2965.34s)]
*  I just always just all have mules. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2967.1800000000003s)]
*  All have mules. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2968.1800000000003s)]
*  But you should get a mule. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2969.1800000000003s)]
*  You should get a mule. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2970.1800000000003s)]
*  I definitely would not have the time to be training a mule. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2971.1800000000003s)]
*  It seems like that's... [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2974.34s)]
*  Here's my question though. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2976.06s)]
*  There's the other question I've got to remember. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2977.06s)]
*  Why would you think that the wolves would not attack the mule? [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2978.9s)]
*  Well it's not... [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2983.34s)]
*  First of all... [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2985.38s)]
*  Because if she's scared of the wolves, I think she should be scared of the wolves. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2986.38s)]
*  Mules and mules, especially donkeys, and mules have donkeys. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2992.14s)]
*  They're actually used a lot as livestock protection animals, because they'll stomp out a coyote [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=2995.9799999999996s)]
*  or a wolf. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3002.62s)]
*  So a lot of farmers get them, put them in with their sheep, and they'll actually protect [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3003.62s)]
*  the herd. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3007.54s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3008.54s)]
*  So it's not impossible, but it is pretty uncommon that coyotes... [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3009.54s)]
*  In my area, the wolves are not gray wolves. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3018.06s)]
*  They're timber wolves, so they're not as big. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3019.86s)]
*  But they're big enough though. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3024.18s)]
*  They're about the size of huskies. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3026.02s)]
*  So they mostly kill deer and... [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3027.34s)]
*  Deer and smaller stuff. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3029.98s)]
*  They don't try for elk or anything like that. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3031.7s)]
*  Because the big gray wolves will take out elks. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3033.98s)]
*  I'm sure they... [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3036.86s)]
*  They take out moose. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3037.86s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3038.86s)]
*  Moose are so big, man. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3039.86s)]
*  For a wolf to take out a moose, that's crazy. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3041.4s)]
*  These are my trail cams at my place. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3044.38s)]
*  Oh wow, look, dropping a deuce right there. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3046.18s)]
*  On your trail cam, staring you in the eye. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3047.98s)]
*  That's an alpha move right there, son. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3050.3s)]
*  I guarantee that's the alpha. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3052.3s)]
*  He knows. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3053.7s)]
*  He knows you got that trail cam. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3054.7s)]
*  He's like, hey, Tom Green, check this out, bitch. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3055.86s)]
*  Shit, right in front of your camera. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3058.14s)]
*  So it's the only way to know 100% for certain that they're wolves and not a hybrid. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3060.18s)]
*  I know you know all about this, Joe, but the coy wolves is to do a DNA test. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3066.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3071.06s)]
*  Coy wolf is kind of a misnomer, because a coyote is a wolf. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3072.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3076.82s)]
*  The reason why the coyote spread so far across the country is because they have a built-in [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3078.5800000000004s)]
*  mechanism to protect them from gray wolves, because gray wolves would kill the coyotes, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3085.34s)]
*  whereas the red wolves in the East Coast would breed with the coyotes. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3090.94s)]
*  That's where you get the coy wolf. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3094.94s)]
*  I think they're viable. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3097.54s)]
*  I think when they breed, they can breed. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3099.02s)]
*  I don't think they're like a donkey, or like a mule, rather. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3101.86s)]
*  You mean a coyote and a wolf. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3105.94s)]
*  I think when the coy wolves, whatever they call them, coy wolves, I think they're viable. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3107.14s)]
*  I think they have babies. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3112.18s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3113.42s)]
*  No, they are, for sure. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3114.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3115.42s)]
*  It's not really ... It's not different. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3116.42s)]
*  Kind of like two different kind of dogs or something. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3118.8199999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3120.98s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3121.98s)]
*  Yeah, because I've been getting some information about this from a wolf researcher up who lives [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3122.98s)]
*  and he has sort of put out some trail cams and we've actually laid out some fur traps [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3131.7s)]
*  that can get a little bit of their fur, and we're going to send it for a DNA sample to [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3141.3799999999997s)]
*  find out exactly the percentage of DNA that wolf to coyote that we have here. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3144.14s)]
*  Because yeah, it's kind of ... I don't know. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3149.98s)]
*  You live out in the wilderness, you find these kinds of things, I find it quite interesting [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3153.4399999999996s)]
*  to just really kind of dive into it deep and try to figure it out. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3157.72s)]
*  Oh, it's fascinating. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3161.3599999999997s)]
*  You're out there in the real wild. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3162.3599999999997s)]
*  You're in the wild where there's packs of predators in your neighborhood. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3164.52s)]
*  I wish I had bear footage right now, but it's not online, but this year I put out my trail [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3168.48s)]
*  cams and I got I'd say a little more than a half dozen distinct different bears on that [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3174.2799999999997s)]
*  exact trail. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3182.2s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3183.2s)]
*  Which is on my property right by my house. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3184.2s)]
*  Brown bear or black bear? [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3187.56s)]
*  Black bear, yeah. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3188.8s)]
*  We don't have grizzlies out east, so it's just in Canada even. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3189.8s)]
*  It's all ... [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3192.76s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3193.76s)]
*  The liberals will try to reintroduce them. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3194.76s)]
*  You need more things to be scared of. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3196.54s)]
*  Well ... [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3199.44s)]
*  Talking about bringing grizzlies back to California. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3200.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3202.32s)]
*  I want you to come to Canada, Joe. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3203.76s)]
*  I know you haven't come to Canada lately, but you got to come to Canada. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3205.44s)]
*  Because here's the thing. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3210.28s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3211.28s)]
*  I watch the show all the time, so I know your feelings about Canada, but here's the thing. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3212.28s)]
*  Everybody loves you in Canada. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3216.4s)]
*  I'm coming down here. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3221.04s)]
*  Everybody's so stoked that I'm here. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3222.56s)]
*  I love Canadians. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3225.04s)]
*  I just hate their government. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3226.04s)]
*  Is that Pierre ... How do you say his last name? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3227.04s)]
*  Paulie Vier? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3230.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3231.04s)]
*  Well, it's French. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3232.04s)]
*  I don't think he's French, but the name's French. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3233.04s)]
*  Pierre Pauliev. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3234.04s)]
*  Pauliev. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3235.04s)]
*  That's sort of a weird R, silent R. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3236.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3237.64s)]
*  It's a strange ... As you see it written down, it's very difficult to remember how to say [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3238.64s)]
*  it. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3242.7200000000003s)]
*  Pauliev. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3243.7200000000003s)]
*  Pauliev. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3244.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3246.12s)]
*  He's so common sense and just calling out all the nonsense that's been done under this [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3247.12s)]
*  administration. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3254.12s)]
*  It's just so sad to watch. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3255.12s)]
*  This is the thing that I kind of, I guess, just wanted to throw out there which is it's [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3257.16s)]
*  not unlike here in the US. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3263.52s)]
*  You've got Biden as President now. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3265.4199999999996s)]
*  Then you've got essentially a Democrat. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3267.3999999999996s)]
*  We actually call our Democrats the liberals. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3270.9199999999996s)]
*  That's how unabashed we are liberal up there. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3273.12s)]
*  We actually call the party the liberal party. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3275.48s)]
*  It's not a bad word up there. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3277.16s)]
*  They actually call them the liberals. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3278.16s)]
*  The other ones are conservatives. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3279.92s)]
*  And conservatives, liberals and conservatives. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3280.92s)]
*  But it's the same thing. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3282.68s)]
*  Half the country hates the party in power right now as much as anybody. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3284.76s)]
*  It's just a constant thing and they want to get them out. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3292.04s)]
*  I just wanted to, as a proud Canadian, want to throw out the distinction that Canada's [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3297.36s)]
*  like here. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3303.48s)]
*  It's the same bullshit that's here. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3304.48s)]
*  Everybody's arguing about issues, important issues. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3307.32s)]
*  It's being reinforced through these algorithms. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3313.32s)]
*  People get mad about it and then they start arguing. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3317.32s)]
*  Like I sometimes kind of go, wouldn't it be interesting if Pierre Poliev won the next [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3321.2s)]
*  election? [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3325.16s)]
*  Because then all of a sudden we'd have a conservative government up there. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3326.16s)]
*  And let's say Biden won down here. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3328.88s)]
*  We got a conservative government up there and then Tucker Carlson might be going up [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3331.44s)]
*  to Canada talking about how great we are all of a sudden. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3334.2000000000003s)]
*  Because it just can switch on a dime. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3337.12s)]
*  It could. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3339.84s)]
*  It could go bad. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3340.84s)]
*  And it has before. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3341.84s)]
*  I've had, there's been my lifetime, Joe Clark was the first conservative prime minister. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3342.84s)]
*  Then there was Brian Mulroney and Stephen Harper was pretty recent. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3349.0s)]
*  But anyways, I don't like talking politics, but I did bring something about Canada that [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3353.92s)]
*  I love. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3357.56s)]
*  I want to, it's a good thing. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3358.56s)]
*  I'm trying not to talk politics too much because it's like, it's gross. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3361.7599999999998s)]
*  Just everybody gets all mad, you know? [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3366.68s)]
*  Yep. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3368.6s)]
*  I just, I don't fuck. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3369.6s)]
*  I kind of think like, wouldn't it be cool if the new thing became, people start to realize [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3371.08s)]
*  that the division is almost worse than what we're arguing about? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3378.0s)]
*  Well, the division is absolutely worse than what we're arguing about. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3381.44s)]
*  Most people want good things. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3385.36s)]
*  Oh, maple syrup. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3386.6s)]
*  This is for you and your family. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3387.6s)]
*  Huge, this, and I brought one for us too, just to try. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3389.12s)]
*  This is the freshest, best Canadian maple syrup made by my friends, the conboys, Ryan [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3392.12s)]
*  and Jason, shout out to Ryan and Jason, George and Darlene. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3398.3199999999997s)]
*  And they make this on their property. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3401.12s)]
*  They have thousands of maple trees tapped. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3402.88s)]
*  And this is a family run business. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3406.56s)]
*  They've been doing this for hundreds of years. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3409.92s)]
*  That is a lot of work. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3411.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's a whole. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3413.2s)]
*  Maple syrup, like making maple syrup, I've watched people make maple syrup on YouTube. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3415.72s)]
*  It's a lot of work. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3419.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3420.3599999999997s)]
*  It's crazy how much work is involved. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3421.3599999999997s)]
*  And it's really kind of incredible to go see how they do it because they've built these, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3422.48s)]
*  like I can't describe it properly, but reverse osmosis machines where they have tubes coming [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3428.7599999999998s)]
*  with the sap from all the, in the spring, the sap starts flowing, comes through these [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3434.64s)]
*  tubes from all through their woods on their property. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3440.04s)]
*  It runs out to their barn where they have these machines that do something called reverse [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3443.04s)]
*  osmosis. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3447.96s)]
*  I don't know what it is doing exactly, but they have to do it. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3448.96s)]
*  And then it goes into this giant vat with fires, with wood burn fires, and they boil [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3451.0s)]
*  the sap down until it becomes thicker and there's more sugar content. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3454.8399999999997s)]
*  And then you have this delicious syrup. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3459.3199999999997s)]
*  But I brought a couple of. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3460.52s)]
*  It's literally the blood of trees that you pour on pancakes. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3462.56s)]
*  It is. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3466.44s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3467.44s)]
*  Are we going to drink it? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3468.44s)]
*  Like in shot glasses? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3469.44s)]
*  As opposed to drinking whiskey till we're on the floor this time. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3470.76s)]
*  I never made it to the floor, sir. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3474.76s)]
*  You made it to the floor. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3476.2400000000002s)]
*  I maintained. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3477.6s)]
*  I don't remember what happened with you. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3478.6s)]
*  The level of motion and the ability to conversate. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3479.6s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3483.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3485.8s)]
*  Well. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3486.8s)]
*  Dude, that's diabetes in a shot glass. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3487.8s)]
*  We'll just do a shot, but I want you to see. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3488.8s)]
*  This is real maple syrup, Canadian maple syrup. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3490.32s)]
*  It's convoy maple syrup. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3493.28s)]
*  They're my friends. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3495.2000000000003s)]
*  The best best friends that you'd ever want. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3496.2s)]
*  And it's not your manufacturer's processed shit. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3500.2s)]
*  You know? [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3504.3199999999997s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3505.3199999999997s)]
*  Do you have to do it like a shot? [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3506.3199999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3507.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you can. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3508.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3509.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3510.3199999999997s)]
*  I can't drink this whole thing. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3511.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3512.3199999999997s)]
*  It's really good, though. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3513.3199999999997s)]
*  Pour it on some pancakes. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3514.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3515.3199999999997s)]
*  It just makes you think like how much sugar are you getting from pancakes with a pile of [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3516.3199999999997s)]
*  maple syrup? [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3519.7999999999997s)]
*  Are you getting a fuck ton of sugar? [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3520.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3522.6s)]
*  How much sugar is in, what is a shot glass? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3524.0s)]
*  How many ounces is that? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3526.56s)]
*  I should know this. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3528.0s)]
*  One ounce. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3529.2s)]
*  Let's just see how much sugar is in one ounce of maple syrup. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3530.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3534.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3535.64s)]
*  God, how could you drink that? [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3536.64s)]
*  Yeah, no, you don't really drink maple syrup, right? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3538.4s)]
*  We're just doing it for a gag. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3540.8399999999997s)]
*  Pour it on your pancakes. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3541.8399999999997s)]
*  It's amazing how good it tastes on your pancakes. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3543.36s)]
*  No, it's good in coffee. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3545.04s)]
*  Put it in your coffee in the morning. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3546.16s)]
*  So I keep a big jug of it. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3548.16s)]
*  17 grams in a shot glass. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3551.12s)]
*  And I guarantee you, if I'm having pancakes, I am drowning those bitches. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3553.72s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3558.0s)]
*  So I'll get you more whenever you need some. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3559.0s)]
*  It's the best. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3561.56s)]
*  It's different than- [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3562.56s)]
*  Waffles with that on it? [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3563.56s)]
*  Son. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3564.56s)]
*  Lots of butter. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3565.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3566.56s)]
*  Up to 20. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3567.56s)]
*  Up to 20. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3568.56s)]
*  Okay, 20. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3569.56s)]
*  So if I'm having pancakes, I'm having 120 at least. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3570.56s)]
*  I'm pouring a bunch of maple syrup on that shit. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3575.64s)]
*  Six ounces? [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3578.92s)]
*  Yeah, easy. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3579.92s)]
*  Easy six ounces. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3580.92s)]
*  I'm getting in between the stack. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3581.96s)]
*  Pouring a little in there. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3586.0s)]
*  It's just a nice little boost, a little energy boost, you know? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3587.16s)]
*  It's for like five minutes, then you're in a coma for the rest of the day. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3590.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3595.56s)]
*  But I guess if you're out there on your farm fucking throwing hay around all day, exhausted. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3597.16s)]
*  I did this summer in August. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3604.6s)]
*  I have some fields with hay. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3608.2000000000003s)]
*  We cut the fields. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3610.68s)]
*  And I have some local farmers that helped me cut the fields to square bales. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3614.08s)]
*  So you're really farming. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3619.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3620.68s)]
*  Farming for real, for real. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3621.68s)]
*  Farming hay for my animals. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3622.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3625.68s)]
*  I had 580 bales of hay off the property this year. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3626.68s)]
*  And we had to lift it all, carry it all onto a hay wagon. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3630.3599999999997s)]
*  See, because I'm going to try to figure out a way to do it a little differently next year. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3634.96s)]
*  But normally the farmers that have done my property for years, they've been doing it [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3639.4s)]
*  with these big circle round bales, you know? [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3643.7200000000003s)]
*  But I wanted to get square bales this year because it's easier to handle for the horses [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3645.76s)]
*  every day, or the mules and the donkey every day. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3649.38s)]
*  So every day I go to the barn, I pick up a bale, feed the... [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3651.1200000000003s)]
*  They eat about a bale and a half of hay a day. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3655.44s)]
*  It's cool because from May, June till about the end of September, you don't even have [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3659.6600000000003s)]
*  to feed them. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3667.76s)]
*  They're just out in the pasture eating grass. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3668.76s)]
*  Which I often think about, you know, when you think about vegetarians and you go, how [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3672.6400000000003s)]
*  do you put on muscle with just... [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3675.48s)]
*  And you can look at this giant animal, all it's doing is eating grass all day and they're [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3678.2000000000003s)]
*  massive. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3681.6800000000003s)]
*  But yeah, so I got to figure out a better way to get it in the barn this year because [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3682.6800000000003s)]
*  some of my friends... [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3687.92s)]
*  They have to eat it all day long. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3688.92s)]
*  That's the difference between eating meat and eating grass. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3691.4s)]
*  If you watch predators, predators eat and then they sleep all day. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3693.7200000000003s)]
*  You watch a donkey, those motherfuckers are just eating all day long. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3699.08s)]
*  They have to eat all day long. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3703.3199999999997s)]
*  They're always eating because there's not a lot of protein in that food. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3705.24s)]
*  It's got to break down in their weird digestive tract. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3709.96s)]
*  It's an undulate digestive tract. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3713.3599999999997s)]
*  So Fanny and Kia have come from a pasture that had 20 other animals in it to my place [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3716.72s)]
*  where they're just there by themselves with the whole field to themselves. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3724.52s)]
*  So Fanny was putting on some weight last summer. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3726.64s)]
*  I have to now monitor how much she's out in the pasture. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3728.72s)]
*  I should correct myself. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3731.48s)]
*  Undulates are cows and shit. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3732.48s)]
*  I'm thinking of cows and deer. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3734.2s)]
*  The weird stomachs and stuff. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3737.04s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure how the stomachs work on these. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3738.12s)]
*  I don't know how they work on egg wines. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3740.0s)]
*  But I know that to think that you could get that jacked eating vegetables is ridiculous. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3743.3199999999997s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3749.24s)]
*  That's what I was thinking. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3750.24s)]
*  Because I always... [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3751.24s)]
*  But vegans always like to make that comparison. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3752.24s)]
*  Like gorillas, they eat nothing but vegetables. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3754.2s)]
*  They have a totally different body. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3756.48s)]
*  That's true. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3758.32s)]
*  They are also not humans. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3759.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3760.32s)]
*  They're not human beings. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3761.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3762.32s)]
*  It doesn't mean if you ate what a fucking horse eats, you'd look like a horse, you [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3763.32s)]
*  dumbass. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3767.6s)]
*  You're not a horse. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3768.76s)]
*  And also, do you know how annoying that would be to have to eat grass all day? [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3769.76s)]
*  It doesn't sound like a blast. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3774.32s)]
*  Not a lot of variety there. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3778.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3779.1s)]
*  I think about that. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3780.1s)]
*  I have cookies for them. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3781.1s)]
*  I have little... [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3782.1s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3783.1s)]
*  I have a vitamin mix that I give them every day. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3784.1s)]
*  Is variation to their diet good though? [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3788.94s)]
*  For some animals, when you... [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3791.8199999999997s)]
*  You got, for instance, apples. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3794.08s)]
*  I have apple trees at the property. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3795.62s)]
*  That's one of the places she loves to walk towards the apple tree. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3798.42s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3800.74s)]
*  Because there's apples on the ground. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3801.74s)]
*  You can feel her pulling towards the apple tree. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3802.74s)]
*  But you don't want her to eat a bunch of apples because that can create acid in their stomach [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3806.54s)]
*  and they can get sick from that. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3812.74s)]
*  I was wondering that. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3814.3799999999997s)]
*  What happens to them in the wild though if they find a bunch of apples? [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3815.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3817.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3818.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3819.7799999999997s)]
*  Are they fucked up? [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3820.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm not sure if they... [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3821.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3822.7799999999997s)]
*  But maybe they somehow self-regulate when they're left to their own. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3824.9799999999996s)]
*  But you can feed them carrots. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3828.66s)]
*  One thing, I haven't done this yet, but I understand that they really like, I was just [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3831.7s)]
*  told, because I'm actually thinking, what kind of variety can I give the ladies? [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3834.7799999999997s)]
*  So they really like a frozen watermelon to be tossed into there. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3838.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, no kidding. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3841.14s)]
*  Bears like that too. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3842.14s)]
*  Oh, yeah? [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3843.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3844.54s)]
*  We went to a grizzly bear, I guess it's just like a conservation center where they have [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3845.54s)]
*  these enormous... [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3851.5s)]
*  It's in Montana. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3853.18s)]
*  But they're like captive, but it's really an enormous construction thing. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3854.18s)]
*  And the bears have like swimming pools and shit. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3862.7s)]
*  And they would roll them out, these frozen watermelons. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3865.1s)]
*  And watch them bite through a frozen watermelon will scare the living fuck out of you. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3869.86s)]
*  Because they go through it like it's nothing. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3874.18s)]
*  A grizzly does that. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3875.58s)]
*  I've seen hippopotamus do it on YouTube, but a grizzly does that too. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3876.58s)]
*  I think most of the time the hippos are doing it, it's not with a frozen one. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3879.62s)]
*  But they were saying that this bear's favorite treat is frozen watermelons. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3884.1s)]
*  I give them a frozen watermelon, and you just go through it like it's a grape. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3886.7s)]
*  See grizzlies are terrifying. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3890.38s)]
*  I admit that I am also actually... [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3894.8199999999997s)]
*  It's probably not really a warranted or fear, but I am nervous about these black bears on [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3899.98s)]
*  the property. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3905.98s)]
*  You should be nervous. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3906.98s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3907.98s)]
*  They do attack people occasionally. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3908.98s)]
*  They will attack you. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3909.98s)]
*  And if black bears attack you, they're attacking you to eat you. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3911.2999999999997s)]
*  It's a little bit different. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3914.46s)]
*  Statistically the odds are in my favor. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3915.94s)]
*  I think it's not as... [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3917.74s)]
*  Like grizzlies, they've attacked a lot of people. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3919.22s)]
*  I think black bears maybe only attack one person a year or something like that. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3921.62s)]
*  They attack people. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3925.62s)]
*  I mean, there's a guy who got killed over by Rutgers in New Jersey. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3926.62s)]
*  He was killed by a black bear. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3930.02s)]
*  There's a friend of a buddy of mine's went hunting for his very first trip. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3932.3s)]
*  He was in his tent at night and a 500 pound predatory black bear tried to remove him from [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3937.7s)]
*  the tent. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3944.9s)]
*  And his friend shot the bear and accidentally shot his friend in the wrist. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3945.94s)]
*  So he got shot in the wrist with a rifle. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3951.7400000000002s)]
*  The bear gets shot. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3954.1800000000003s)]
*  The bear runs off after it gets shot and then they don't... [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3955.1800000000003s)]
*  I think they recovered it. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3959.34s)]
*  I think it's dead. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3960.54s)]
*  But imagine your first night ever camping in a tent and a black bear tries to pull you [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3962.06s)]
*  out and eat you. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3966.78s)]
*  So I think sometimes people bring food in their tent. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3968.38s)]
*  That's one common mistake. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3971.76s)]
*  So... [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3973.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, your food, bitch. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3974.1800000000003s)]
*  Your food. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3975.2599999999998s)]
*  Your food. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3976.2599999999998s)]
*  Your food in the tent. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3977.2599999999998s)]
*  Your pigs in a blanket. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3978.2599999999998s)]
*  If you bring in... [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3979.2599999999998s)]
*  You should really... [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3980.2599999999998s)]
*  That is one thing that is why they go in the tent a lot. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3981.2599999999998s)]
*  They smell. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3982.98s)]
*  Someone brought their sandwich in the tent or whatever. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3983.98s)]
*  But yeah, no, I mean, look, I'm right there with you. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3986.18s)]
*  There's something about it though that... [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3991.46s)]
*  Well, you know when you're out there in nature and you're sort of natural instincts kicking [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=3994.22s)]
*  where you feel it. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4004.66s)]
*  And the fact that there is something unpredictable and that you don't understand out there is [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4006.74s)]
*  kind of exciting. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4015.2599999999998s)]
*  The fact that there is... [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4016.9s)]
*  I'm not really truly expecting to get attacked by a bear, but your senses are on alert. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4019.46s)]
*  You're listening into the woods. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4023.2599999999998s)]
*  You know they're there. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4025.06s)]
*  You know they know you're there and they've probably left. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4026.2999999999997s)]
*  But maybe this is the one time where they're walking along with their cub and you get in [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4029.7799999999997s)]
*  the wrong position at the wrong time. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4033.86s)]
*  And so often when I go for a walk, I have bear spray on me. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4035.26s)]
*  I sometimes have a rifle on me. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4039.6200000000003s)]
*  I don't carry it with me every time I leave the house, but I've got a few rifles. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4041.98s)]
*  I've not really been a hunter in my life, but I kind of... [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4048.54s)]
*  So many people around me, the country, everybody hunts and I think I'm going to maybe... [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4054.42s)]
*  How much land do you have? [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4059.98s)]
*  150 acres. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4063.14s)]
*  So it's kind of... [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4064.78s)]
*  You certainly hunt on that. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4065.78s)]
*  Yeah, and there's deer and it's quite... [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4066.78s)]
*  It's quite something that I never really expected to kind of live like that, but it's really [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4069.42s)]
*  kind of interesting. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4075.96s)]
*  And then it backs onto lots of thousands and thousands of acres of protected wilderness. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4076.96s)]
*  So they... [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4083.82s)]
*  Are you allowed to hunt back there? [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4084.82s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4086.38s)]
*  And on my property too. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4087.38s)]
*  What is the tag allocation like? [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4089.38s)]
*  Do you get land owner tags? [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4091.58s)]
*  Do you get tags because you're a resident of the area? [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4093.1s)]
*  You still have to get a hunting license. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4095.86s)]
*  So in Canada, if you want to get a rifle, first of all, it's completely different than [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4098.34s)]
*  in Texas, right? [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4104.62s)]
*  You can't just go buy one. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4105.62s)]
*  You have to go take... [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4106.78s)]
*  It's like getting your driver's license, essentially. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4107.78s)]
*  You have to go take... [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4109.26s)]
*  You have to write a test and you have to pass it and you have to do a course, a safety course. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4110.7s)]
*  Then you have to send that into the RCMP, the Canadian, the Mounties, right? [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4117.46s)]
*  They review it and then a couple months later, you get your non-restricted firearms license, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4123.58s)]
*  which allows you to go buy a rifle. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4130.54s)]
*  I've been collecting lever action rifles, so I've got just... [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4132.5s)]
*  That's cool. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4136.38s)]
*  Relatively new to this, but when I was out in the desert, I had a shotgun with me. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4137.38s)]
*  I had a hunting license when I was in New Mexico. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4141.54s)]
*  I was trying to hunt some quail. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4143.1s)]
*  Never saw a bird though. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4144.58s)]
*  So it was hunting, but I never saw anything, so I didn't really do... [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4145.66s)]
*  I was still hunting, but I never saw anything. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4149.58s)]
*  So that's why... [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4153.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm trying to think of what I want to tell you here, Joe. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4157.0199999999995s)]
*  That's why I think I really would love you to come up to Canada sometime and visit maybe [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4159.62s)]
*  and come up and do some shows up there. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4163.14s)]
*  People would love to see you. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4165.04s)]
*  There's just such a huge outdoors hunting, fishing culture. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4167.9s)]
*  That's what being Canadian is. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4174.58s)]
*  Once you get out of the city, people love to hunt, people love to fish. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4175.58s)]
*  I go ice fishing with my friends. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4181.68s)]
*  We go set up a... [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4184.16s)]
*  Didn't they put new restrictions on firearms up there? [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4185.16s)]
*  They just banned handguns. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4188.72s)]
*  Absolutely, yeah, but not rifles, which is pretty extreme from an American standpoint, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4190.68s)]
*  certainly. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4196.8s)]
*  I mean, to think that... [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4197.8s)]
*  So if you own handguns, do you have to get rid of them? [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4198.8s)]
*  No, you're not allowed to sell them to anybody and you're stuck with them. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4202.200000000001s)]
*  And that's probably the biggest change that's happened. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4207.4400000000005s)]
*  There is also no automatic weapons up there, so you can't get an AR-15, for example. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4214.8s)]
*  AR-15s aren't automatic. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4220.08s)]
*  Or that caliber or whatever. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4221.84s)]
*  You can't get those weapons. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4225.64s)]
*  But you can get a rifle, a shotgun. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4228.46s)]
*  I have a .308, I have a .243, I have a .22, I have a shotgun. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4231.9800000000005s)]
*  I have a .20 gauge, 12 gauge. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4236.9400000000005s)]
*  All the normal hunting rifles are fine. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4239.18s)]
*  What was the thought process behind banning firearms or banning pistols? [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4242.06s)]
*  Well I don't... [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4248.66s)]
*  I wasn't really kind of... [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4250.02s)]
*  I think it was just an attempt to curb... [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4252.46s)]
*  Was there anything people voted on? [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4255.5s)]
*  Well they voted for the government and the government did it. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4258.820000000001s)]
*  So obviously some people aren't too happy about it. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4261.740000000001s)]
*  One thing about Canada is the gun culture is different up there. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4268.700000000001s)]
*  More people are... [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4273.22s)]
*  I'm going to get in trouble with the people that are handgun enthusiasts in Canada, but [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4274.22s)]
*  it's just not as common up there. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4278.34s)]
*  It's more about hunting and hunting rifles. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4280.52s)]
*  There are probably a lot of people that are pretty upset about it for sure. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4284.099999999999s)]
*  But they're not actually taking away people's rifles or anything like that. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4288.099999999999s)]
*  One of the exemptions is individuals train, compete or coach in a handgun shooting discipline [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4300.58s)]
*  that is on the program of International Olympic Committee or the International Paralympic Committee. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4306.179999999999s)]
*  It's like someone's going to have to become a shooter. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4311.94s)]
*  Yeah, I compete. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4315.62s)]
*  I'm personally not... [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4317.82s)]
*  You compete in shooting. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4318.82s)]
*  That's why I have to have this gun. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4319.82s)]
*  I'm not really like... [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4320.82s)]
*  I don't really... [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4322.379999999999s)]
*  You know, I like my lever action rifle. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4325.54s)]
*  I like my shotgun. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4328.98s)]
*  I think I might hunt turkeys this year. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4329.98s)]
*  I'd like to do that with a lot of turkeys on the property. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4332.46s)]
*  I'm not really... [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4335.5s)]
*  I don't necessarily feel like I need a handgun. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4336.86s)]
*  It's a different kind of... [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4340.259999999999s)]
*  I don't necessarily feel that anybody should tell me that I can't have a handgun, especially [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4341.74s)]
*  not the government. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4346.179999999999s)]
*  Especially not the government that's already done some really shady shit like what they [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4347.179999999999s)]
*  did with the truck drivers. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4351.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4352.26s)]
*  Well, I'm from Ottawa too, so the trucker rally was interesting. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4353.26s)]
*  Dude, they fucking took away their bank accounts. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4357.099999999999s)]
*  They seized people's... [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4360.42s)]
*  They closed people's and froze people's bank accounts that just donated money. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4362.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4366.7s)]
*  Is that coffee? [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4367.7s)]
*  Yes. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4368.7s)]
*  First of all, the trucker rally was interesting because I'm from Ottawa. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4370.58s)]
*  So I grew up... [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4374.38s)]
*  You know, the Parliament Hill, I'm sure you saw it on the news, like the Parliament buildings [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4375.38s)]
*  is basically our Congress and our Senate combined essentially, the House of Commons and the [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4379.5s)]
*  Senate. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4387.0199999999995s)]
*  You know, downtown Ottawa is like Washington DC, right? [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4388.0199999999995s)]
*  That's our Washington DC. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4391.5s)]
*  I grew up there. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4393.139999999999s)]
*  I grew up skateboarding on the Parliament building's front steps. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4394.139999999999s)]
*  I did a radio show. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4398.0199999999995s)]
*  This is something about the freedoms of Canada that I think is interesting, okay? [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4399.86s)]
*  When I was a kid, I did a college radio show. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4403.219999999999s)]
*  And it was midnight till two in the morning. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4406.179999999999s)]
*  And I would say during the show, okay, after the show, everybody show up on Parliament [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4409.219999999999s)]
*  Hill, bring a soccer ball. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4414.179999999999s)]
*  Let's go play soccer. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4415.78s)]
*  And then we'd show up there with pizzas and we'd play soccer on the front lawn of the [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4417.259999999999s)]
*  Canadian government till four in the morning. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4420.299999999999s)]
*  Every half hour, the bell would go, brrng, brrng. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4423.74s)]
*  The RCMP cops would come. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4425.9s)]
*  They'd shine their lights out on the field. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4427.26s)]
*  It was super positive, right? [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4429.860000000001s)]
*  I love Ottawa. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4433.18s)]
*  It's an amazing city. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4434.34s)]
*  And I understand that everybody has the right to express their descent, right? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4440.34s)]
*  And I think Trudeau probably did overstep with some of his reaction to that, with some [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4450.1s)]
*  of the things he said specifically. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4455.1s)]
*  But there was also this element of not only was the city shut down, there's people that [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4458.1s)]
*  live downtown. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4465.14s)]
*  So those horns were these air horns. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4466.14s)]
*  There was really kind of, there's babies sleeping. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4467.700000000001s)]
*  It's really like a neighborhood, right? [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4469.9400000000005s)]
*  So it's kind of funny in a way, the difference between Canadians and Americans sometimes. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4472.26s)]
*  I'm both, right? [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4479.58s)]
*  I'm a dual citizen. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4480.58s)]
*  I love... [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4481.58s)]
*  Fence rider. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4482.58s)]
*  No, I just love both countries. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4483.58s)]
*  I've lived here for 20 years. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4485.700000000001s)]
*  I, you know, I, but what, you know, what is sort of a comparable thing, I think, was, [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4486.7s)]
*  you know, what, you know, in the United States, they, on January, was it January 6th? [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4501.5s)]
*  They, you know, they did more than freeze those people's bank accounts, right? [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4505.3s)]
*  They threw them all in jail, right? [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4508.5s)]
*  So... [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4509.5s)]
*  They threw a lot of them in jail. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4510.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4511.5s)]
*  So it's sort of, I'd say it's like a comparison, comparable thing. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4512.5s)]
*  It's like, I guess that's the thing I just kind of... [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4513.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's different. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4515.7s)]
*  Feel as it's like... [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4516.7s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4517.7s)]
*  There's sort of comparisons. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4518.7s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4519.7s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4520.7s)]
*  First of all, it's different because they entered into the Capitol building. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4521.7s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4523.099999999999s)]
*  You're not supposed to do that. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4524.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4525.099999999999s)]
*  They, a lot of people broke glass, smashed windows, they did a lot of shit. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4526.099999999999s)]
*  It was also, it's not comparable because it seems like they were instigated in some way, [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4530.0199999999995s)]
*  at least partially, by people in the audience that wanted them to go in there. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4537.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4542.74s)]
*  Whether those people were federal agents or whether those people are Antifa or whether [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4543.74s)]
*  those people were democratic operatives that want to turn this into chaos because it's [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4547.179999999999s)]
*  a great way to attack Donald Trump. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4550.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4552.58s)]
*  Whatever it was, there definitely was people that were instigating people to get into the [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4553.58s)]
*  building. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4556.62s)]
*  There's video recordings of it. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4557.62s)]
*  There's also weird instances of cops opening gates, letting people in. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4558.62s)]
*  The fact that it was severely under policed. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4562.98s)]
*  When they had the George Floyd protest, the Black Lives Matter protest, they had way more [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4566.78s)]
*  cops there for that than they did for this crazy thing where the dude is denying the [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4571.42s)]
*  election and his rabid fans are going to show up and you're not prepared for this? [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4575.5s)]
*  The whole thing seems like if I was going to make a playbook, if I was going to instigate [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4581.820000000001s)]
*  a bunch of dumbasses to go do something really stupid because it will make their leader look [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4588.26s)]
*  like a fascist and Hitler, that's how I would do it. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4593.46s)]
*  So you have that too. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4597.820000000001s)]
*  It's not as simple as the trucker protest was a legitimate protest where a bunch of [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4599.38s)]
*  people were like, why are you telling me that I have to take this experimental medication [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4603.82s)]
*  or I can't work? [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4609.26s)]
*  Where is the fucking information? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4611.3s)]
*  And now over time, we've seen now that the studies that they did do, they don't have [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4613.7s)]
*  to release them for like 75 years. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4621.26s)]
*  You know about all that? [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4623.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4624.78s)]
*  All the paperwork involving the vaccines? [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4625.78s)]
*  What is exact ruling of like what information they're withholding for 75 years? [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4628.06s)]
*  Let's be real clear on that. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4632.700000000001s)]
*  But then it's also how many people we know that got injured by it. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4634.46s)]
*  You're smart to be reluctant to do something that's new given the history and track record [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4638.34s)]

*  that's absolutely innocuous. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4650.620000000001s)]
*  You should at the very least, you should be able to consider not doing it, talk about [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4652.620000000001s)]
*  not doing it. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4657.14s)]

*  There's no drugs that have a gigantic effect on anything that don't have some people that [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4659.9400000000005s)]

*  That's crazy. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4699.26s)]
*  So that's that protest. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4700.26s)]
*  It's a different protest. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4701.26s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4702.26s)]

*  Absolutely. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4704.26s)]
*  It is a different subject for sure. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4705.26s)]
*  It's in response to tyranny. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4707.6s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4710.82s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4733.78s)]
*  I guess the point I'm trying to make, which is outside of the weeds of it is when I'm [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4734.78s)]
*  hanging out in Canada, half the people I talk to are so excited for me to come down here [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4740.0599999999995s)]
*  and they're all like, they're, you know, they were supportive of truckers, right? [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4745.9s)]
*  Like this was not like this was not some, it's not some fringe thing in Canada. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4751.5599999999995s)]
*  Maybe the people that actually got in their truck and drove there and camped out there. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4755.86s)]
*  Maybe that was a little bit more of a, you know, dedicated protester than the average [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4759.839999999999s)]
*  citizen. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4767.0199999999995s)]

*  Fuck Trudeau. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4771.860000000001s)]

*  You know, you would probably be amazed to see. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4775.860000000001s)]
*  I don't know if this is so common in Canada that we just don't even really, I don't even [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4778.620000000001s)]
*  think to mention it. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4781.9800000000005s)]
*  Driving around everywhere in the country, in the city, everywhere, people pick up trucks, [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4784.1s)]
*  fuck Trudeau flags. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4792.38s)]
*  It says fuck Trudeau, black flag, white letters, Canada flag on it. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4794.02s)]
*  People are mad. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4800.46s)]
*  And so it's not just like everybody in Canada is just down with it. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4802.900000000001s)]
*  Now, enough people are down with it that he got elected, but he might not get elected [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4809.18s)]
*  the next time and then that'll be just like it is down here. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4813.700000000001s)]
*  I hope he doesn't. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4816.42s)]
*  It might just be like it is down here. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4817.42s)]
*  If he gets elected again, you guys are gluttons for punishment. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4818.42s)]
*  Yeah, it could be. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4820.820000000001s)]
*  It could be the same as here. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4821.820000000001s)]
*  Trump could get elected again. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4823.14s)]
*  Trump could get elected. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4824.34s)]
*  It's sort of like this is I was I was thinking the other day, I'm almost kind of wondering. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4825.34s)]
*  This is obviously a stupid idea, but I'm wondering, like, maybe it wouldn't it be almost be better [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4829.46s)]
*  if we just got rid of the elections and just let the conservatives run it for four years [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4833.18s)]
*  and then just automatically the liberals run it for years. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4837.26s)]
*  I can pick a whole million holes and why that wouldn't work. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4840.26s)]
*  But and just let it go back and forth. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4843.5s)]
*  And then people can just be like, OK, let's just all get along. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4845.740000000001s)]
*  Let them have four years at running the country. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4850.1s)]
*  Do what they do. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4852.38s)]
*  Let the other side run for four years. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4853.38s)]
*  It's kind of a pendulum that goes back and forth anyways. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4854.900000000001s)]
*  And then we can kind of get back to, you know, just all getting along. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4857.700000000001s)]
*  And well, even if that did happen, the same problem would take place. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4861.46s)]
*  And it's that the people that are embedded, that are running the government, the real [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4865.14s)]
*  people behind the curtain, they're always there. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4868.740000000001s)]
*  They don't get elected. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4871.9400000000005s)]
*  They're always there. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4872.9400000000005s)]
*  And those are the people that are actually running the government, which so it would [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4873.9400000000005s)]
*  be the same horse shit they were dealing with now. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4876.660000000001s)]
*  Every four years, some new spokesperson comes in play and they do a bunch of shit that pisses [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4879.28s)]
*  off half the country. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4884.5599999999995s)]
*  And the same thing behind the scenes, the same people are running things. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4886.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's so frustrating. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4890.4s)]
*  And I got to the point where I started to kind of just try to disconnect from the from [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4892.12s)]
*  the conversation, which sounds sometimes I feel bad about it because you want to have [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4899.2s)]
*  you want to have a social contribution. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4904.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. But then you go, man, I just don't feel like talking about the same thing over and [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4908.839999999999s)]
*  over and over and over and over and over again. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4912.679999999999s)]
*  It's like, yeah. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4914.16s)]
*  What I was going to say, though, is that, you know, like. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4916.16s)]
*  The whole system is set up so that one person can't be in control for too long. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4924.32s)]
*  That's the whole idea about term limits. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4929.4s)]
*  You got four years and then you get elected again. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4931.0s)]
*  You get another four years and then you're fucking done. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4933.879999999999s)]
*  Mm hmm. I don't this. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4936.56s)]
*  I'm just saying this. This is not something that I fully support, but. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4939.6s)]
*  There's something to be said for someone staying in there for a long time and getting [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4944.400000000001s)]
*  it right, if they're good at it. Yeah. Right. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4948.120000000001s)]
*  I mean, if I was backfires in any other job, it would backfire with power and control. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4950.320000000001s)]
*  The problem is we are terrified of having someone like Putin who's in control of Russia [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4956.4800000000005s)]
*  for decades. Right. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4961.320000000001s)]
*  For sure. But if you had someone who was good at the job, you would want them to stay [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4962.56s)]
*  on the job. Like if you had the best CEO of your company, you're making record money and [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4967.84s)]
*  everything's doing great. The products are incredible. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4971.6s)]
*  Yeah. You want to keep that guy's a CEO. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4973.6s)]
*  He's obviously killing it. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4975.120000000001s)]
*  And when Steve Jobs is running Apple, he's killing it. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4976.120000000001s)]
*  You don't want to remove him as a CEO because you know how long it takes to build anything. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4978.84s)]
*  Right. And how long it takes to get good at your job. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4983.4400000000005s)]
*  Anything right. And to figure out who are the right people, who's who's backstabbing, [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4985.6s)]
*  who's you know, who's fucking who's you know, what are the issues? [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4989.36s)]
*  Who's trying to climb the political ladder and they're just thinking about themselves [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4992.76s)]
*  only. They're sociopaths. Figure it out. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4997.28s)]
*  It takes a long time to fucking work your cabinet now. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=4999.08s)]
*  We're going to if you had a president that was a young president that gets in at like [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5001.72s)]
*  thirty eight, forty years old and twenty years of running the country correctly. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5006.84s)]
*  That's what most of these dictatorships have. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5013.48s)]
*  As a benefit. Yeah. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5016.32s)]
*  It's horrible for the people. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5017.8s)]
*  But the benefit of having one guy run things and just keep it locked up and this is the [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5019.719999999999s)]
*  right way to do it. We've been doing it this way forever. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5025.679999999999s)]
*  This is correct. Yeah. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5028.12s)]
*  It's interesting that. Yeah. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5030.44s)]
*  You got a couple of the most important job ever. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5032.12s)]
*  And a new guy gets it or a new woman. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5034.0s)]
*  Right. Ever yet. But someday every four years. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5036.32s)]
*  Yeah. That's crazy. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5038.639999999999s)]
*  And and often trying to undo everything that was done the four years before. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5039.639999999999s)]
*  So that's what term limits brought in. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5043.84s)]
*  But then on the flip side, you know, we don't have term limits in Canada and Trudeau's going [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5045.6s)]
*  to be there for you know, if you're if you're not a fan of Trudeau, you know, I wish we [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5049.200000000001s)]
*  had term limits, you know, because because he's been there over over eight years now. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5052.240000000001s)]
*  Right. So and right. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5055.4800000000005s)]
*  But that's because that's because he's getting elected. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5057.240000000001s)]
*  He voted out. He might be getting voted out. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5058.92s)]
*  It seems like the Canadians are leaning towards getting rid of him. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5060.96s)]
*  Is that correct? You know, it's one of those things where it's it's it's it's kind of feels [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5064.320000000001s)]
*  like it's almost like 50 50 ultimately. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5069.240000000001s)]
*  But who knows? I think it definitely feels like it could. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5072.76s)]
*  Who doesn't want to get rid of them? [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5075.88s)]
*  Who are those people? [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5078.360000000001s)]
*  A lot of it's regional. It's it's I guess it's you know what? [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5080.040000000001s)]
*  I keep I kind of if we I knew if we were going to talk about this, I wanted to kind of sort [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5082.96s)]
*  of make this point because I again, I want Americans to understand what Canada is. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5087.8s)]
*  It's exactly like here. It's the same people that the same type of people that like Biden [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5092.68s)]
*  are the people like Trudeau, like the people in Canada that vote for Trudeau are the exact [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5097.56s)]
*  same people that they like Biden to. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5101.280000000001s)]
*  Right. There's nobody in Canada that likes Trudeau, Trudeau that also likes Trump. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5103.84s)]
*  There's also nobody in Canada that likes Pierre Poliev that likes Biden. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5107.92s)]
*  It's exactly the same. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5111.96s)]
*  The same division. It's this even on social media. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5113.6s)]
*  It's the same. You go on social media, you go on TikTok, you got angry conservatives [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5116.0s)]
*  in Canada saying fuck Trudeau and, you know, we're turning into a communist country and [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5121.52s)]
*  all of this stuff like completely, completely the exact same thing as here. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5126.84s)]
*  So so it's it's just it's just if I was I'm not here like trying to be a spokesperson [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5131.36s)]
*  for Canada or anything, but that would they would not want that. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5138.84s)]
*  Well, I think that's what scares us the most about Canada is that Canada is so similar [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5141.64s)]
*  to the United States, but we're seeing your rights erode. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5146.76s)]
*  There's also weird bills that keep getting passed. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5150.16s)]
*  You know, the C16 bill, the, you know, mandatory pronouns, mandatory use of someone's [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5152.92s)]
*  pronouns. And then there was the fact that you guys don't really have freedom of speech. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5159.0s)]
*  You have hate laws. You have hate speech laws. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5163.44s)]
*  And then you also have some weird shit going on with Canada trying to regulate the [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5167.12s)]
*  Internet and with the government trying to regulate podcasts and make podcasts subject [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5172.6s)]
*  to their. They did try. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5178.8s)]
*  They they did a little research on this in case it came up. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5180.4s)]
*  So they they tried and they haven't they haven't put into effect that regulation of the [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5185.280000000001s)]
*  Internet of as far as regulating disinformation that has not been put into effect. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5194.56s)]
*  And Trudeau actually said he would not put it put that into effect. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5199.84s)]
*  It was a sort of a subset of you know, it's sort of like, you know, you've got your extreme [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5202.68s)]
*  left wing here and then you have cooler heads and they did not actually put that into effect. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5209.240000000001s)]
*  Is it still on the table? [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5215.200000000001s)]
*  Trudeau has said that he would never put that into effect. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5217.240000000001s)]
*  Well, I think he's saying that now because he's knows he's fucked. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5219.84s)]
*  And so the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5222.56s)]
*  OK, that's kind of like our Constitution, I guess. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5225.64s)]
*  They say we have freedom expression, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5227.72s)]
*  So so we do have the elements of your government that would even consider that. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5231.76s)]
*  Yeah, but it's like, it's like it's like here. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5236.88s)]
*  It is. And that's the same. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5239.240000000001s)]
*  It's just the same. It's the same thing. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5240.96s)]
*  Like if you don't agree with it, then it's the same thing as, you know, fuck Joe Biden. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5242.4s)]
*  You know, it's the same thing. Fuck Trudeau. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5246.799999999999s)]
*  So and so, you know, because it's interesting. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5248.719999999999s)]
*  Like, I just really want, you know, Americans who are, you know, just not have never been to Canada. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5251.799999999999s)]
*  I need to understand that. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5258.879999999999s)]
*  Like, are you working for the Canadian Ministry of? [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5259.799999999999s)]
*  I would consider it something, you know, and travel. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5263.799999999999s)]
*  You know what I was thinking about? Like. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5265.759999999999s)]
*  In Canada, you don't have to be born in Canada to run for prime minister. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5268.4800000000005s)]
*  You could run for prime minister of Canada and come up and and solve all this stuff. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5273.92s)]
*  I mean, you have to live up there, but it's a nice place. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5280.12s)]
*  You come on, come on up to Canada. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5282.24s)]
*  You would win, too. That's the thing. That would be amazing. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5284.32s)]
*  You would be you. You would win. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5286.400000000001s)]
*  And you could just imagine I became prime minister of Canada. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5288.8s)]
*  Can you imagine? I was just thinking. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5291.68s)]
*  You think it's crazy. Donald Trump being president of the United States. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5293.2s)]
*  That would be next craziest thing. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5297.400000000001s)]
*  That would be the next craziest thing. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5299.160000000001s)]
*  More crazy and almost more crazy, because at least he was like hinting about running for president forever. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5301.160000000001s)]
*  Have I just on a whim? [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5306.84s)]
*  Just decided to go run for the prime minister of Canada and win, because you would you would win [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5308.56s)]
*  because you have so many fans up there. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5312.92s)]
*  You really do. And that's that's why I want that. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5315.240000000001s)]
*  So scary. That is so unqualified to run a country. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5316.76s)]
*  Well, I mean, you've got a lot of, you know, valid concerns and you feel [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5320.040000000001s)]
*  strongly about things. I think you should run. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5326.68s)]
*  I would support you. I think that would be amazing. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5329.200000000001s)]
*  I want to roll up to the World Economic Forum high on mushrooms. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5334.4800000000005s)]
*  See, in Canada, by the way, mushrooms are basically legal in Canada. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5339.6s)]
*  Weed is here's a something Trudeau again, not not. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5342.6s)]
*  He did legalize weed. That is one thing that he did do. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5345.92s)]
*  So congratulations. Did one good thing. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5348.360000000001s)]
*  It's just he's a weasel. That's the problem. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5351.120000000001s)]
*  He's what I don't like in leaders. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5353.32s)]
*  This fake bullshit fucking nonsensical gaslighting. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5355.84s)]
*  I just that shit drives me nuts. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5362.2s)]
*  It's so creepy. And then using all the inclusive terms to make it seem like everybody else is a piece of shit. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5364.08s)]
*  And you're an amazing human being and you're on the right side of progressive movement. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5370.04s)]
*  And like it's all just a bullshit act to stay in power. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5373.92s)]
*  And when you see politicians do it, you know, they just fucking wet their finger [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5378.5199999999995s)]
*  and try to figure out which way the wind's blowing and say those things and then act in the interests of whatever [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5382.44s)]
*  money got them into that position in the first place. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5387.879999999999s)]
*  Whatever machine is behind them, whatever support they get. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5390.759999999999s)]
*  That's that's all they're doing. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5395.08s)]
*  And those types of politicians, that's not the only kind you can have. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5396.879999999999s)]
*  You know, it's kind of like. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5402.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's you can have real leaders. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5405.08s)]
*  They do exist. It's such a huge sort of thing to wrap your head around. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5407.12s)]
*  You know, it's capitalism, it's money, it controls everything. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5411.32s)]
*  It's I mean, I kind of feel just leaving Los Angeles, leaving Hollywood, right, kind of has has sort of reset a little bit of life. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5414.4s)]
*  You know, like, you know, you know this more than anybody else, of course. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5421.679999999999s)]
*  But, you know, because we even talked about this, whatever it was, 20 years ago on my podcast about how, you know, you can democratize [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5427.24s)]
*  media with podcasting and get rid of all this money controlling everything, controlling. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5435.2s)]
*  And so it's sort of a, you know, a micro micro sort of more. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5441.48s)]
*  It's a similar thing to just politics in general. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5446.599999999999s)]
*  You know, money comes in, controls everything. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5448.88s)]
*  It can be so frustrating, especially now when you can see that, [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5450.32s)]
*  you know, you don't necessarily have to play that game anymore. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5455.4s)]
*  So, yeah, it's also the hive mind of Hollywood you're leaving. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5459.12s)]
*  There's a thing that happens in that town, in that area where [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5464.28s)]
*  the the people that think outside of the norm, say it in like whispered hushed tones. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5469.52s)]
*  There's a certain ideology that's attached to that city. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5476.400000000001s)]
*  And it's not logical. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5480.0s)]
*  It's a kooky, wacky, completely insulated left wing view of the world. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5482.16s)]
*  And they enforce it with an iron fist. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5489.56s)]
*  And if you're not on that team, you don't get booked for things. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5492.24s)]
*  You don't get picked for things. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5495.04s)]
*  If you're someone who has conservative leanings or you talk about [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5496.96s)]
*  because there's projects you're never going to get. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5500.88s)]
*  You're never going to be involved with the people will they'll malign you. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5503.68s)]
*  And without knowing you at all, be openly prejudiced about you. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5508.080000000001s)]
*  And so no one does it. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5513.080000000001s)]
*  So everyone who goes over there, who's just like desperately trying to make it, [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5515.04s)]
*  they're desperately trying to get in movies. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5519.64s)]
*  They're desperately trying to get a recording deal, whatever it is. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5521.4800000000005s)]
*  They're desperately trying to do. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5524.56s)]
*  The last thing they want to do is do something and talk about something [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5525.88s)]
*  that's going to politically get them at odds with the people that run the studios. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5532.0s)]
*  So no one does. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5536.320000000001s)]
*  Everybody just follows the same sort of wacky ideology these people take from [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5537.52s)]
*  the universities, they go straight into working as a PA and straight into working [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5543.12s)]
*  for executives and producers. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5548.88s)]
*  And all of those people are indoctrinated. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5550.52s)]
*  They're all in this wild ass cult of weirdness. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5552.44s)]
*  And then you have people that move there to try to make it. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5555.799999999999s)]
*  And these people are just always going on auditions. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5559.28s)]
*  So they're always like, please choose me, please choose me. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5561.679999999999s)]
*  And no, they didn't choose me. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5564.32s)]
*  And so you're trying to be friends with the people who choose people. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5565.679999999999s)]
*  You're trying to get them into parties, trying to introduce them to other people. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5568.5599999999995s)]
*  You're trying to be around other famous people. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5571.48s)]
*  This person's been chosen. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5573.96s)]
*  I got to be around the chosen person. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5575.5599999999995s)]
*  We go to the chosen person's party. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5576.879999999999s)]
*  Maybe we can get chosen. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5578.48s)]
*  And so you get this overwhelming anxiety that fills the fucking city. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5579.88s)]
*  And then now you have TikTokers and influencers and all these people that are [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5585.280000000001s)]
*  just trying to do anything to get famous. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5588.72s)]
*  And that the reality stars and all that started it all off and the fucking real [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5592.0s)]
*  housewives and all that wacky shit. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5595.360000000001s)]
*  You get away from that. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5597.6s)]
*  You're like, oh, there's real people out there. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5598.64s)]
*  There's real people. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5600.76s)]
*  That's a storm of anxiety. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5601.360000000001s)]
*  And just a hurricane of confusion and Zoloft and fucking WAAAHHHHH. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5603.64s)]
*  And everyone's losing their mind and everyone's in therapy and everyone's [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5609.32s)]
*  fucking nuts and everyone's trans. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5612.24s)]
*  It's out of touch. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5614.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5616.2s)]
*  It's just a crazed cult. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5616.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5619.04s)]
*  It's like, you know, you start out as a standup comedian and you are trying to, [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5619.24s)]
*  you know, poke holes in the, you know, the absurdity of the world. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5625.16s)]
*  And you're saying things that are not being said on stage. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5630.04s)]
*  And then, you know, as you know, you all of a sudden get brought into, and I'm [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5633.36s)]
*  sort of saying the, the every standup comedian, every outlier, every person [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5639.24s)]
*  that's doing something different, a punk rocker, a skateboarder, you know, my [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5644.92s)]
*  goofy show was so out there when I was making it and I was making it, I was [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5651.759999999999s)]
*  rebelling against, you know, in Canada, in my little, little public access show. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5655.759999999999s)]
*  I was kind of trying to rebel against what obviously seems like a formulaic [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5659.64s)]
*  mainstream way of thinking to create art. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5664.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5668.04s)]
*  And then you move to Los Angeles because, well, the show got on MTV. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5668.84s)]
*  I ended up moving to Los Angeles. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5672.68s)]
*  Now you're, I'm talking about myself now. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5674.4400000000005s)]
*  All of a sudden being asked to go on, you know, the show, the Tonight Show, [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5678.160000000001s)]
*  Saturday Night Live, and you're on these shows. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5684.400000000001s)]
*  And, you know, I was sort of, sort of a bit of a naive, you know, moron, basically, [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5686.24s)]
*  you know, like in, in, in, purposefully so I would go on these shows, try to go [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5693.6s)]
*  nuts, right, and try to do something crazy and just try to sort of, sort of [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5696.96s)]
*  almost disrupt the whole format of it. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5700.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5702.88s)]
*  In those first couple of years as a naive person who didn't understand how [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5703.4400000000005s)]
*  Hollywood worked and I was just, you know, I went on, I had a similar thing to our [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5707.68s)]
*  last appearance here on Jay Leno. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5712.0s)]
*  I went on Jay Leno when I had a film coming out. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5713.5199999999995s)]
*  I went on Jay Leno and I came up with this bit. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5715.959999999999s)]
*  Let me roll the bar. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5719.16s)]
*  They had a, you know, remember they had the bar cart, the Jay bar. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5720.719999999999s)]
*  I'll roll it out on stage during the show and then I'll do a shot of [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5723.719999999999s)]
*  Jagger with, with Jay. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5726.639999999999s)]
*  You know, Jay doesn't, this is a crazy story. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5728.4s)]
*  I probably told you this before, but I do a shot of Jagger with, with, with Jay. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5731.4s)]
*  And Jay doesn't drink. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5734.919999999999s)]
*  So he said, okay, well I'll throw it over my shoulder. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5735.799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5737.4s)]
*  So we go there and I'm with my, my buddy who's, you know, you know, I have a buddy [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5738.64s)]
*  who like pushes you further into the darkness, right? [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5743.160000000001s)]
*  Like, you know, like, you know, you, you, you, you got a, you got a bad idea and [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5747.08s)]
*  he pushes you further and makes it even worse. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5750.280000000001s)]
*  So, yeah. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5752.12s)]
*  So we're in the green room, getting ready. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5753.72s)]
*  I'm in the green room with my buddy, getting ready to go on the show. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5755.280000000001s)]
*  And he goes, do a shot now before you go on. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5757.56s)]
*  I'm like, okay, so I do a shot now before I go on. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5759.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5762.0s)]
*  Get ready to go on. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5762.84s)]
*  The, the, the bit's all approved with the Tonight Show, you know, it's a gag. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5763.56s)]
*  They know I'm doing real Jagger, right? [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5766.6s)]
*  But it wasn't planned that I would do a shot before I go on. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5769.280000000001s)]
*  He goes, do another shot before you go on. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5771.76s)]
*  Two shots. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5773.200000000001s)]
*  Two shots. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5773.8s)]
*  Do another one. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5774.4400000000005s)]
*  So now I walk out, I'm three shots in before the show even starts. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5775.04s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5778.200000000001s)]
*  You're hammered. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5778.68s)]
*  Well, then, yeah. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5780.160000000001s)]
*  And then I got out there and I did a shot and the audience goes crazy and cheers. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5782.200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5786.04s)]
*  And so then I do another shot and so I ended up doing way too many shots and it [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5786.64s)]
*  kind of ended up very similarly to our last, our last conversation here. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5789.76s)]
*  And, and it was, it was actually pretty hilarious. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5793.5599999999995s)]
*  It was one of those things where, you know, it did get out of control. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5799.4s)]
*  You know, the next day, there was a, the New York Post, it had my picture and it [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5803.68s)]
*  said dead drunk, you know, it was just like one of those things and, and, you [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5808.8s)]
*  know, Jay called me at home the next day. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5814.08s)]
*  Are you okay, man? [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5815.599999999999s)]
*  You know, really kind of went up. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5816.44s)]
*  But then, you know, then that was sort of a beginning of me realizing, oh, you [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5817.76s)]
*  know, you can't. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5821.0s)]
*  Why Tom Green went on Leno and deliberately got drunk. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5822.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5826.0s)]
*  And, and, you know, in hindsight, I go, well, that was, you know, kind of the [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5826.76s)]
*  outrageous kind of young version of me that I was doing on the show that made [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5831.320000000001s)]
*  perfect sense to do that for a gag. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5837.56s)]
*  Uh, but then, you know, the naive kid in me didn't understand, well, you know, a [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5840.200000000001s)]
*  lot of people in Hollywood did not understand that and then got mad and the [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5846.84s)]
*  movie studio. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5850.68s)]
*  Well, like the movie studio, I was on promoting the movie and they were like, [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5852.04s)]
*  oh, we don't want you to go any more talk shows for the movie. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5855.12s)]
*  I'm like, well, what? [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5857.24s)]
*  I was, it was a joke. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5858.5599999999995s)]
*  I was obviously, it was a joke and they're not interpreting it as a joke. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5859.44s)]
*  They're interpreting it as, as me being kind of out of control, which, yeah, [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5862.8s)]
*  exactly. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5866.96s)]
*  But it was a, it was a, a manufactured out of control. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5867.36s)]
*  I was out of control, but it was planned, it was planned confusion. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5871.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5874.16s)]
*  So, but that kind of subtlety didn't really, uh, didn't really kind of pass [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5874.92s)]
*  the smell test. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5879.5599999999995s)]
*  So, so then you start to go, oh geez, I better tone it down a little bit. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5880.92s)]
*  You know, better, better tone it down a little bit because this, and you sort [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5885.12s)]
*  of end up falling into that feeling where all of a sudden you're, like you [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5888.6s)]
*  said, going to an audition or driving out to a meeting and trying to, trying to [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5891.92s)]
*  sell someone. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5896.32s)]
*  Or just being a person that you're not. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5896.84s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5898.2s)]
*  Like if you're hosting a late night talk show and all of a sudden you're this [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5899.04s)]
*  sort of wearing a tie, this odd button down. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5902.84s)]
*  Trying to make something that they like and fit into their mold and, you know, [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5907.16s)]
*  try to get your own little creative shots off within that mold, but no longer are [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5914.56s)]
*  you actually being purely yourself. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5919.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5922.24s)]
*  And, uh, and, and, and so then, you know, you end up living there for 20 years, [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5923.12s)]
*  end up living there for 20 years and it becomes normal pretty quickly. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5927.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5930.56s)]
*  And then, and then you sort of slowly forget, oh, you know, oh, this is just [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5930.8s)]
*  the way it works, I guess now. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5935.44s)]
*  And then, uh, eventually, you know, one day you go, I'm getting out of here. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5937.32s)]
*  And I, I gotta say, um, you know, when you, when you moved here, it was a bit of a, [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5942.96s)]
*  uh, a light bulb, I think for me too. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5951.08s)]
*  It was inspiring for me because I sort of realized, Oh, look at that. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5953.639999999999s)]
*  Joe's leaving, you know, cause you were always at the comedy store, all the clubs. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5957.919999999999s)]
*  It was a scene in LA and you're thinking, wow, like Joe, Joe's just going to go do [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5962.0s)]
*  it on his own and just turn his back on this whole infrastructure here. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5967.56s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, you can do that. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5972.2s)]
*  You don't have to be here. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5973.68s)]
*  And, and it was really inspiring and, you know, it inspired a lot of people. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5975.08s)]
*  And, uh, and, uh, and I can tell you, uh, again, it's now living in the, uh, [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5979.72s)]
*  the woods, not far from where I grew up. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5989.8s)]
*  We had a cottage when I was a kid, pretty close to where I grew up. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5992.8s)]
*  They've got these birds, they're called whipper wills, right? [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5996.200000000001s)]
*  Whipper will, whipper will. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5998.64s)]
*  They make this sound. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=5999.96s)]
*  They're really unique sounding bird, right? [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6000.6s)]
*  Hank Williams sings about them. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6003.4400000000005s)]
*  And, uh, and I grew up as a kid hearing those in the woods at night, you know, just [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6004.88s)]
*  a dusk, we hear them. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6011.52s)]
*  And now like when I, I'm going to bed, I hear those and I'm going like, Oh, I [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6012.96s)]
*  feel like, like the sounds of my childhood and the smells of my childhood. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6016.72s)]
*  And the, even the things that, you know, the mosquitoes, the horse flies, you [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6022.2s)]
*  know, even the, the, you know, the, the, the, the, the large mouth bass in the, [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6025.360000000001s)]
*  in the lake and the, you know, the, the red wing blackbirds and all those sounds [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6030.400000000001s)]
*  and smells and everything, and you feel like yourself again, and it's like, and [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6034.84s)]
*  there was, there's, you know, for, for, for 20 years, I'd be like driving up [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6039.44s)]
*  Laurel Canyon, looking at palm trees and, and, and for 20 years, even after 20 [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6048.28s)]
*  years living in the same house, I never felt like I was actually at home. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6053.92s)]
*  I felt like I was off on some business trip trying to, and I remember saying, [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6057.2s)]
*  you know, even just, even after living there 15, 20 years, like, what the hell [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6061.24s)]
*  am I doing in Los Angeles? [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6065.879999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6067.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6067.639999999999s)]
*  What, what, this is a weird place. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6068.08s)]
*  You know, it's like a weird place. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6069.32s)]
*  And, um, you know, you feel almost like you have to be there. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6071.24s)]
*  Now everything's changed. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6075.04s)]
*  The internet, I think, and I think COVID did that for a lot of people too, because [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6075.92s)]
*  all of a sudden everybody's locked in their house and you're dealing with [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6079.32s)]
*  people and these zoom calls and the internet's changed. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6083.28s)]
*  You don't have to be anywhere anymore. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6086.16s)]
*  We realize we can be wherever we want. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6087.72s)]
*  You know, you took your entire organization away and it's bigger than [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6091.32s)]
*  ever and light bulbs start going off and you're like, wow, you know what? [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6096.24s)]
*  That's, that's really cool. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6099.679999999999s)]
*  I'm going to go home. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6101.12s)]
*  Well, when we were living in LA, you're, you're always thinking of yourself as [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6102.8s)]
*  someone who wants to work with the system. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6111.639999999999s)]
*  You're always thinking of that always. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6116.28s)]
*  I mean, I was on television shows. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6118.16s)]
*  I did all that stuff. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6120.8s)]
*  Did a couple of movies. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6122.0s)]
*  You're always working with the system. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6123.5199999999995s)]
*  So no matter what you do, you're working with, even when you put out specials, [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6125.56s)]
*  you're putting out specials, you're meeting with these people, you're [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6128.36s)]
*  working with the system and you start to think that that's what you do. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6131.24s)]
*  That's the business that you're, but it's not what you do is what you do. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6134.96s)]
*  That's what you do. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6138.16s)]
*  What you do is what you do and you could do what you do wherever you want to do it. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6138.92s)]
*  Especially once you get good enough out of the, you have an audience and like, [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6142.16s)]
*  you're supposed to take a chance. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6145.16s)]
*  You're not supposed to like keep living your life by these like bizarre tyrants [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6146.8s)]
*  and their rules and regulations about the way and the way they behave and the way [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6151.44s)]
*  they fucking the, it's so ridiculous. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6155.28s)]
*  It's such a bizarre place to be. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6158.36s)]
*  And when you realize that you don't need that anymore and comedians today [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6161.16s)]
*  realize they don't need that anymore. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6166.68s)]
*  All they need is a Tik TOK account or a YouTube account, an Instagram account, [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6167.92s)]
*  a Twitter account and some good content. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6172.64s)]
*  And if you get on podcasts, people check you out, they'll try you out. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6175.32s)]
*  And there's a gigantic organic network of comedians. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6179.679999999999s)]
*  We're all friends with each other and we all get on each other's podcasts and we [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6183.719999999999s)]
*  all trust each other. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6187.28s)]
*  Like if I tell you this guy's really funny, go see him. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6188.16s)]
*  Like I'm telling you the truth. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6191.12s)]
*  I'm not, I would not ever lie. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6192.24s)]
*  And I wouldn't have them on if I didn't think they were funny. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6194.12s)]
*  If I didn't like them, they weren't nice people. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6196.2s)]
*  I'm not interested. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6198.44s)]
*  So there's this beautiful organic thing and that's the real network. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6199.84s)]
*  Now that's the real network. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6205.16s)]
*  It's an organic network. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6206.44s)]
*  There's no contracts. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6207.88s)]
*  So every comic that I know that has contracts with other comics, they start [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6209.08s)]
*  doing things together, it always goes south. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6212.56s)]
*  I mean, maybe it can not go south once or twice. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6215.68s)]
*  I mean, maybe there's some great people that are figured out. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6218.12s)]
*  I mean, Tom Segura seems like he's figured out how to do it with your mom's house, [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6220.200000000001s)]
*  but that's like almost it. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6223.280000000001s)]
*  Everybody else that I know that gets involved with deals and so like just [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6225.4400000000005s)]
*  fucking just help each other, just help each other organically. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6229.72s)]
*  That was what I really loved about hanging at the mothership the last two [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6233.56s)]
*  nights is the energy there is different. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6240.4s)]
*  Like for the comedy club, just in the green room, like, I mean, you felt it. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6243.44s)]
*  You can tell that you've created an energy there that is supportive, right? [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6248.56s)]
*  All the comics are just hanging out in the green room, smoking cigarettes [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6253.68s)]
*  and everyone's talking and just, you know, it's super chill. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6256.72s)]
*  And I, you know, I did, you know, sometimes find that, you know, it wasn't always [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6259.8s)]
*  like that, you know, when you're at a comedy club, you know, and other comedians [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6264.92s)]
*  are sometimes a little more feel a little more competitive with each other. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6268.24s)]
*  And there's a little bit so stupid. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6271.04s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6272.84s)]
*  The, the, any competition that you have with other comedians is inspiration. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6273.64s)]
*  That's all you should look at it. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6277.68s)]
*  You see if someone's doing really well and you, you're like, wow, I wish I was [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6278.88s)]
*  doing that well, great. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6282.64s)]
*  That's inspiration to work harder. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6283.76s)]
*  That's inspiration to go write more, do more sets, re reevaluate your material [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6285.0s)]
*  go over it better, do something, write more, have some life experiences that [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6289.68s)]
*  you could translate and interact like skill work harder. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6293.72s)]
*  It's like, it's just, you should just be inspired. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6297.76s)]
*  And if that person's a good person, you should be happy for them. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6301.0s)]
*  And that's what we can all do. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6303.4400000000005s)]
*  This idea that we're all in competition with each other is just stupid. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6304.88s)]
*  It's not good for anybody. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6308.8s)]
*  I was, uh, Stoked to get to a, see your, uh, work in progress, your new hour [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6310.400000000001s)]

*  and sit on that balcony up there and just watch the show. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6332.12s)]
*  And it was just really amazing to watch you, uh, working out your, uh, new, [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6334.400000000001s)]

*  And I enjoyed our conversation because I've, I've, I've watched a lot of your, [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6342.400000000001s)]
*  um, interviews with, with comedians here. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6346.44s)]
*  And I saw your interview with Louie and you were talking about writing and saw [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6349.5199999999995s)]
*  your interview with Bill Burr. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6352.4s)]
*  You're talking about writing and you know, there's sort of this thing where a lot [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6353.2s)]
*  of comics don't write. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6355.679999999999s)]
*  And we were talking about this a little bit the other day, but I love the process [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6358.759999999999s)]
*  of hearing how the process works for you because I kind of do a mixture of things [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6362.24s)]
*  too. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6366.839999999999s)]
*  I, I, I like to, I like to go sit at a computer and type stuff up and then, but [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6367.04s)]
*  it's always, I've always found it hard to like, this is a question I kind of have [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6371.639999999999s)]
*  for you because when, when you go right, you work it out on stage and, uh, you [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6375.44s)]
*  know, you're, you've got your idea, you've got your premise, you've got your [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6381.5599999999995s)]
*  punch lines, you've got your, you know, your bit and you're working it on stage. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6384.08s)]
*  And then I, I, I found it really inspiring actually. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6387.879999999999s)]
*  Cause, um, first of all, I love, I love, I love the way it works with standup. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6392.28s)]
*  Like you, when you showed up at the, at the green room, you're about to go on [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6396.599999999999s)]
*  stage and you're like focused, you know, you're like focused and you're going [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6400.28s)]
*  through your notes and you're focused and I'm like, you know, I can tell you're [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6403.6s)]
*  focused, right? [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6406.120000000001s)]
*  Then you go out, you kill it. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6407.400000000001s)]
*  You, you come back in and you see the, you know, that, that adrenaline rush. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6409.88s)]
*  And then we're just, you know, and then we're, everyone's just, you're just [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6415.4400000000005s)]
*  relaxed and it's just that, that release. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6417.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6419.76s)]
*  And then we were just talking about writing and you said you're going to go [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6420.88s)]
*  home and actually, I don't know if you want people to know this is too far into [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6423.72s)]
*  the behind the curtain or whatever, but you're going to go home and write after. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6427.68s)]
*  I just think that's so cool. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6430.400000000001s)]
*  You know, well, it's fresh. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6431.360000000001s)]
*  You go home and actually type, type up some stuff. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6432.08s)]
*  And that's what I've been doing. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6434.04s)]
*  Some of my best writing is like a two hour window that I have where I'm [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6435.04s)]
*  still jazzed from being on stage and you're, you're still kind of thinking in [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6438.5599999999995s)]
*  that mindset, you know, you gotta just kind of, and don't let yourself relax [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6443.24s)]
*  too much, like kind of stay in that mindset. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6446.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6449.5199999999995s)]
*  And then, you know, as long as I'm not up too late where I get tired, then I'm [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6449.84s)]
*  forcing it, you know, so, but if I can get home at a reasonable time and I've got a [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6453.72s)]
*  lot of energy, I get my best writing in. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6458.64s)]
*  I get some of my best ideas because I'm already thinking like comedy. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6461.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6464.64s)]
*  You know, you just had it. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6465.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6466.12s)]
*  You said it, you have the exact words in your head and that's, that I thought [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6466.320000000001s)]
*  was a bit of a light bulb for me. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6471.240000000001s)]
*  I that's inspiring because, you know, I, I, I often find it's like, you know, [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6473.4800000000005s)]
*  when you write something down, you have, or, or when you do the set and you [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6478.0s)]
*  maybe write it down after, and then you don't go get to writing it and then you'd [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6481.72s)]
*  never remember what the rhythm was later. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6485.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6487.76s)]
*  What the hell was it I said again? [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6488.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6489.5199999999995s)]
*  So I know it was way funnier than what I'm writing right now, you know? [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6489.96s)]
*  So that's, uh, [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6493.48s)]
*  That's why recordings are so important. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6494.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6496.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6496.5599999999995s)]
*  Just put your phone on the little, you know, voice record thing, just, just to [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6496.799999999999s)]
*  get a reference. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6500.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6501.28s)]
*  I was, uh, I was talking to, uh, you know, Louis CK, uh, had a conversation with [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6501.96s)]
*  him about this and, uh, it was pretty interesting because I've kind of, you [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6507.4s)]
*  know, I like to drink, but I kind of quit. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6514.56s)]
*  I really have cut back drinking in the last, you know, I quit drinking [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6519.120000000001s)]
*  like three days ago. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6525.080000000001s)]
*  No, I, uh, no, but stand up, you know, I saw, you know, I, I, I wasn't doing [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6526.0s)]
*  stand up when I was doing my TV show. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6532.76s)]
*  I'd done it when I was a kid. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6534.280000000001s)]
*  I stopped. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6535.400000000001s)]
*  I did my TV show started again, like 13, 14 years ago. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6535.88s)]
*  It was drinking a lot. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6539.64s)]
*  Like I like to drink, like everybody likes to drink and I go on the road [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6540.76s)]
*  and I started realizing, man, like, even if I go out drinking Friday night after [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6544.52s)]
*  the show, my Saturday night shows aren't as good as they could have been. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6548.240000000001s)]
*  Cause I'm kind of like carrying a little bit of this alcohol around in me from [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6552.6s)]
*  the night before I quickly realized, you know, the beginning was like, I'll have [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6556.0s)]
*  a beer on stage, right? [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6559.72s)]
*  Then I, then I go, Oh, I better not have a beer on stage. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6560.96s)]
*  I'll wait till after the show to have a drink. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6562.84s)]
*  So then after the show, Friday night, you know, you know, on the road, it's fun. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6564.96s)]
*  You know, you're in Cleveland, let's go, let's party. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6568.88s)]
*  We're in Cleveland. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6570.72s)]
*  No. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6571.36s)]
*  So, you know, you have, have a few too many drinks after the show, Friday night. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6571.639999999999s)]
*  And of course I was, you know, younger too, right? [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6575.5199999999995s)]
*  I was, you know, my thirties. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6578.2s)]
*  So you can handle it a little more too than when you're 52. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6579.76s)]
*  So, but then every year that went by, I was like, Oh, those Saturday night shows [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6582.96s)]
*  are getting a little harder to get through, you know, and it's just one, too [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6587.48s)]
*  many Saturdays just lying in my hotel room, just waiting for the show to start [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6590.88s)]
*  hung over going, Oh my God. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6594.2s)]
*  And then gone and then dreading and being on stage. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6595.4s)]
*  So then I, then I decided I was going to quit drinking when I'm doing stand up [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6597.5199999999995s)]
*  like, so I'm not drinking this weekend until maybe Sunday night, you know, I [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6603.759999999999s)]
*  mean, we'll have a drink Sunday night. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6608.32s)]
*  Uh, maybe even Saturday night, I could do a hungover show Sunday, but, but [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6609.639999999999s)]
*  gotta have a little fun. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6614.4s)]
*  Listen, I got a solution for you. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6615.16s)]
*  IV drips. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6616.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6618.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, it's game changer. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6619.36s)]
*  So I can keep drinking. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6620.4s)]
*  You bring that right on stage with you? [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6621.0s)]
*  The IV? [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6622.16s)]
*  No. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6622.44s)]
*  I'm just kidding. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6623.2s)]
*  You don't bring the IV on stage. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6623.599999999999s)]
*  The next day. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6624.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6625.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6625.2s)]
*  The next day, you get a high dose vitamin IV. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6626.44s)]
*  Well, the thing that I've been enjoying about kind of scheduling it where it's [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6630.879999999999s)]
*  like, I don't drink for a couple of days before, you know, a week, a weekend like [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6634.839999999999s)]
*  this from doing five shows is like, I find, and this is what I was talking about [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6639.48s)]
*  with Louie about where I had a, you know, we're not close friends, but I had an [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6643.36s)]
*  opportunity to have a conversation with him about this once and it was pretty [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6648.24s)]
*  cool because the way his mind thinks is so, you know, analytical about this type [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6651.0s)]
*  of specific, everything comedy, right? [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6657.52s)]
*  And I was telling him, I was saying, you know, I stopped drinking before I go on [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6660.2s)]
*  stage because, you know, I feel like there was this period where I didn't have a [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6663.24s)]
*  drink for a couple of weeks. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6666.92s)]
*  And when I was doing crowd work, I was just coming up with stuff that I would [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6668.2s)]
*  never, you know, you know, when you have a great set of crowd work and you get [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6670.92s)]
*  up, I came up with this intricate story that I told and it was clear my mind was [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6674.0s)]
*  operating in a different level than it would have been had I just had a few [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6679.16s)]
*  beers the night before even, right? [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6682.48s)]
*  And, and then he said something that never really even occurred to me before, [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6684.88s)]
*  which is, you know, when you're working on a set, you know, if you, if you have [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6688.599999999999s)]
*  like a little bit of booze in your system, even from the night before, when [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6691.4s)]
*  you're up there working on a set, you don't remember the stuff that happened on [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6694.44s)]
*  stage as well either. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6697.68s)]
*  So then when you go home, you don't really even recall, you know, and that's [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6698.76s)]
*  the biggest, you know, the big part of repetition, getting up and doing these [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6702.76s)]
*  sets over and over again, and you remember everything and build on it and [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6705.599999999999s)]
*  if you're not retaining that information, right? [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6709.200000000001s)]
*  So, so I'm really laying off the sauce. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6711.92s)]
*  And I was actually kind of, I was excited to hear that, that we were going to do [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6715.64s)]
*  this show on the day of, of, of, of, of my, I'm doing two shows tonight at the [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6720.72s)]
*  mothership, Fat Man. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6726.200000000001s)]
*  And I was kind of excited because I knew I wasn't going to drink on this show. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6727.4400000000005s)]
*  So you knew you weren't going to repeat. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6730.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6732.4800000000005s)]
*  I knew I was not, I was going, I'm not going to do what I did last time. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6732.8s)]
*  And so I kind of came. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6735.52s)]
*  I'm not trying to encourage you to drink. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6736.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6737.76s)]
*  But I am trying to encourage you that if you do wind up drinking too much, do you [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6738.0s)]
*  feel hung over? [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6741.64s)]
*  You don't have to just tolerate that. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6742.24s)]
*  I like that too. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6743.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6744.4s)]
*  Get, get an IV drip. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6744.56s)]
*  An IV drip, huh? [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6745.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6746.8s)]
*  If you're in town, I'll connect you to the lady that does that. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6747.24s)]
*  Just seems like such an extreme. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6749.68s)]
*  It's like, you know, you're drinking too much. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6752.48s)]
*  You know, you're drinking too much when you're like, you're in a hospital [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6754.16s)]
*  bed with an IV drip. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6757.64s)]
*  You know, you're being smart about your party. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6758.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6760.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6760.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6761.12s)]
*  Or you're not in a hospital bed. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6761.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6762.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6762.84s)]
*  You're just sitting down. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6763.0s)]
*  It takes 20 minutes. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6763.92s)]
*  The reason I told you about the reason why I wanted to come down here sooner and just [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6765.72s)]
*  kind of come check out and hang at the club, you know, I was, I was super stoked. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6770.28s)]
*  I'm actually getting to headline the club this weekend. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6774.88s)]
*  That was even more than I was expecting. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6777.4s)]
*  I was just wanting to come down and see you and congratulate you on the club. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6779.2s)]
*  And the reason it's taken me so long is I had a fucked up thing that happened after [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6782.2s)]
*  I moved to the farm, basically immediately after I moved to the farm and everything was [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6788.0s)]
*  going great. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6794.48s)]
*  I was, I had a major injury that I told you about. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6795.959999999999s)]
*  I didn't get into too much detail about it, but I had a major injury in Costa Rica. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6799.799999999999s)]
*  I would, I went down there for a vacation and there was this, you know, a big bonfire [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6805.04s)]
*  on the beach and everyone was having fun. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6811.12s)]
*  I went to bed in the hotel. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6815.36s)]
*  Um, I wake up, I decide to go back to the bonfire a few hours later. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6818.5599999999995s)]
*  It's like two in the morning at this point, the fire has gotten a lot smaller. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6823.28s)]
*  I pick up a piece of driftwood off this beach and this remote beach, right? [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6827.5599999999995s)]
*  I go up to throw the driftwood on the fire. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6831.44s)]
*  And the reason the fire had gotten smaller is the people that had been at the fire, [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6833.639999999999s)]
*  put out the fire by burying it in sand and they buried this huge bonfire that was [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6836.679999999999s)]
*  about the size of this room in sand. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6840.96s)]
*  And so now there was just a little fire with sand covering hot coals, about four [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6843.08s)]
*  feet leading up to it. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6847.32s)]
*  And I'm walking up to the thing, you know, barefoot in, in, in, in, in, in, in a, [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6848.719999999999s)]
*  you know, in bathing suit and the t-shirt with a piece of driftwood. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6854.24s)]
*  And my foot goes into the sand, into these hot coals, immediate realization. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6858.32s)]
*  Uh, I fall back, uh, so if I'd fallen forward, I mean, my face would be burnt. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6865.36s)]
*  I ended up, uh, immediately realizing what had happened. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6871.4s)]
*  Uh, third degree burns on both feet, the top and bottom of my right foot and the, [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6876.24s)]
*  strangely the top of my left foot, not the bottom, thankfully. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6883.28s)]
*  Um, and, uh, the nerves were completely burned off my feet. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6887.5199999999995s)]
*  So after the initial shock of it, I, uh, wasn't in pain, which was the weirdest [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6891.88s)]
*  thing, and I looked down and there's a couple of people came to my sort of [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6897.599999999999s)]
*  assistance and were putting water on it, not feeling anything, you know, [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6901.12s)]
*  I'll get graphic cause it's crazy, but the skin is just falling off my feet. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6905.679999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6909.88s)]
*  Uh, I get help back to my room. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6910.8s)]
*  Uh, I'm not wanting this to be, you know, it's the first day I got there. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6913.599999999999s)]
*  I'm like, this really ruined my vacation, you know, I'm not feeling pain [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6919.12s)]
*  because the burns, the nerves are gone. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6922.36s)]
*  So I'm literally like trying to clean it up with like some nail clippers, [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6923.92s)]
*  chopping the little bits of burnt flesh off. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6926.72s)]
*  And do you have photos? [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6928.92s)]
*  I do. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6930.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6930.48s)]
*  Of this? [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6930.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6931.16s)]
*  Like when it looked like that? [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6931.48s)]
*  Not online. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6932.48s)]
*  I, so. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6933.04s)]
*  No, on your phone. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6933.96s)]
*  I have not even, I need to see. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6934.8s)]
*  I need to see. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6938.8s)]
*  I haven't even, I haven't even, um, talked about it online. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6939.76s)]
*  I didn't, this is the first I've talked about it online. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6944.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6946.84s)]
*  I never knew that you were injured. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6947.12s)]
*  I didn't want to talk about it. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6948.76s)]
*  I just didn't. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6950.4800000000005s)]
*  I, it was crazy. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6952.0s)]
*  I ended up spending two weeks in the hospital in Costa Rica and then was [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6957.320000000001s)]
*  medevaced on an air ambulance with Charlie. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6962.5599999999995s)]
*  Whoa, Charlie, you were there for the whole ride? [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6966.36s)]
*  Yeah, with Charlie. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6968.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6969.04s)]
*  And, um, the nurses take Charlie to go potty. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6969.36s)]
*  So I had some friends who came down, who were coming down anyways, and they, [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6972.28s)]
*  they took Charlie. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6976.2s)]
*  Oh, Charlie. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6977.36s)]
*  They looked after Charlie for two weeks while I, so I got, I got driven to [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6978.679999999999s)]
*  the San Jose hospital and she was, she was worried. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6984.679999999999s)]
*  She's adorable, man. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6990.92s)]
*  She's such a sweet dog. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6992.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6993.639999999999s)]
*  I know the people that are seeing her out now, like, oh, she's kind of [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6994.599999999999s)]
*  freaked out, but normally she's not freaked out at all. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6996.679999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6999.04s)]
*  She's super sweet. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=6999.5599999999995s)]
*  She runs up to everybody and wagging her tail. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7000.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7003.4s)]
*  Super friendly. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7004.16s)]
*  It's last. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7005.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7006.4s)]
*  So, and it was, I got, got to this hospital, the, the, the, there's a [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7006.599999999999s)]
*  surgeon from Columbia who worked there. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7009.639999999999s)]
*  It's a great hospital, thankfully. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7012.28s)]
*  Came out, he said, looked at my foot, said, we're taking you in immediately into [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7014.92s)]
*  surgery and they did skin grafts off my leg and they took skin grafts, like [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7018.28s)]
*  the size of a football off my right leg and stapled 60 staples to staple the [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7024.44s)]
*  skin into my foot and then I come up out of surgery and the doctor says to me, [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7030.84s)]
*  uh, which I think he was trying to make me feel better, but he said, well, the [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7037.44s)]
*  good news is you'll probably be able to live a normal life. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7041.88s)]
*  So he says to me, it's the first thing he says to me. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7045.24s)]
*  And I'm, you know, I can't move. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7047.72s)]
*  I had a morphine going into my back. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7048.96s)]
*  Uh, couldn't feel anything below my waist. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7051.0s)]
*  I thought it was paralyzed. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7053.4s)]
*  They told me I would be, you wouldn't be able to feel anything below my [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7054.16s)]
*  waist while this, while I came out of it. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7056.36s)]
*  And then I'd spent two weeks in a hospital bed and, uh, I was not able to [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7058.88s)]
*  get out of the hospital bed for two weeks. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7063.12s)]
*  Um, this is debatably too much information, but it's interesting. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7065.84s)]
*  You get, you get very constipated from all the medicine that's going into you. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7072.16s)]
*  And you end up not being able to, you know, go to the bathroom for about a week, [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7077.32s)]
*  but then you ultimately have to go and you can't get out of bed because [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7082.4s)]
*  your foot has to remain elevated. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7086.68s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7088.12s)]
*  So this is where you drop a log in a bucket. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7088.6s)]
*  You got to drop a log in a diaper. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7090.44s)]
*  Oh Jesus. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7092.4s)]
*  And then someone's got to clean your butts. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7094.4s)]
*  And then these Costa Rican nurses come in and clean your butt. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7095.76s)]
*  And it was just a really interesting, uh, moment of clarity for me, where [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7100.24s)]
*  you realize you're humbled as a human being and you realize, Oh, this is, this [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7106.76s)]
*  is, I've lost all ability to look after myself and you just kind of end up having [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7110.16s)]
*  to just kind of go with it. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7115.76s)]
*  And it was, uh, you know, to my honest with, I still think about that sometimes. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7116.84s)]
*  It wasn't the worst thing in the world. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7121.4800000000005s)]
*  No, I'm just kidding. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7122.8s)]
*  But, uh, you know, the, the, uh, they were very nice. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7123.360000000001s)]
*  The nurses were very nice. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7127.280000000001s)]
*  Very sweet of them to take care of you like that. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7128.360000000001s)]
*  And you can't put any weight on your foot cause the bottom of your foot is that [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7130.320000000001s)]
*  skin graft as well, or just the top? [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7133.96s)]
*  Uh, for, for, for the, so then for the next, uh, yeah, exactly. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7135.72s)]
*  And it was very delicate, the skin graft for the first. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7138.68s)]
*  No, was the bottom skin grafted as well? [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7140.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7142.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7142.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7142.76s)]
*  Really? [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7143.04s)]
*  It's all around very, very, um, [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7143.320000000001s)]
*  The bottom of your foot, like the sole of your foot was skin grafted. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7144.72s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7147.84s)]
*  Cause I would think like, how do they skin graft that? [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7148.4800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7152.0s)]
*  So your footprint come back to the same way, the ridges, the dermal ridges. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7152.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not perfect though. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7155.84s)]
*  It's interesting. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7157.72s)]
*  The, it was a world war two doctor who invented the way of taking these skin [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7158.400000000001s)]
*  grafts, actually they did it for burn victims in the war and they invented a. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7164.44s)]
*  Some really, I don't know the word for it, but some tool that actually takes [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7169.36s)]
*  a micro thin layer of skin, uh, so micro, I don't really have a scar on my leg [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7172.719999999999s)]
*  anymore. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7178.24s)]
*  It's very, it's amazing. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7178.679999999999s)]
*  So I've very, it's almost like a paper, less than paper, thin layers of skin. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7179.919999999999s)]
*  They take them off of strips like this and then they staple it in your foot [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7183.4s)]
*  to hold it on there. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7187.5599999999995s)]
*  And, um, and then, uh, that's left on there for about, I think it was just [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7188.639999999999s)]
*  about two weeks actually. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7195.48s)]
*  And then at the end of the two weeks in Costa Rica, they were, they, I had to go [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7197.639999999999s)]
*  under three general anesthetic surgeries in Costa Rica and a Central American [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7201.759999999999s)]
*  hospital by myself, by the way, I, uh, I, uh, my mom and was wanting to fly down. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7205.04s)]
*  My dad wanted to fly down. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7211.719999999999s)]
*  I was like, no, you know what? [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7212.639999999999s)]
*  I'm just sitting here like, you know, half out of it, you know? [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7213.679999999999s)]
*  So just, I'll just, so I just spent two weeks in there and they'd go, there was a [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7217.92s)]
*  second surgery where they go in and they, uh, checked it. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7222.24s)]
*  They had to go in and check it. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7226.32s)]
*  And so I had to go under general just to like take the bandages off because it's [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7227.4800000000005s)]
*  painful. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7231.16s)]
*  And then the third general one was to go in and take the staples out. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7232.32s)]
*  And, um, and then, uh, medevac back to Toronto to Sunnybrook burn center, [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7235.96s)]
*  Sunnybrook hospital burn center, where I spent another 10 days. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7241.0s)]
*  And then for the next essentially six months, Joe, I was, I would have to go to [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7244.5599999999995s)]
*  a doctor, uh, three times a week to have my bandages changed because it's like, [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7249.639999999999s)]
*  you know, oozing and six months. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7257.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7259.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7260.24s)]
*  It was about three times a week for the first two months. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7260.4s)]
*  And then it was like twice a week and then it was once a week. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7262.32s)]
*  And, uh, and they're also monitoring it for infection, right? [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7264.96s)]
*  Because if you get an infection, uh, then they have to amputate your foot. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7268.32s)]
*  So it was basically six months of me just worried about losing my foot. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7272.12s)]
*  You know, you're saying, am I going to have, am I going to have like that one [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7275.24s)]
*  testicle and one foot? [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7276.92s)]
*  Is this what's going on with me? [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7277.92s)]
*  So, so they didn't, uh, they didn't have to amputate my foot fortunately. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7279.0s)]
*  Uh, but it was pretty, pretty, pretty scary shit. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7282.8s)]
*  Holy shit, dude. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7285.4800000000005s)]
*  And, uh, anyways, uh, and then, you know, and then it was kind of like limping for [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7286.92s)]
*  the next year and then now I'm kind of still a little wobbly, but it's, it's, [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7291.12s)]
*  it's, it's pretty good. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7294.400000000001s)]
*  I'm, I'm, uh, I'm just gonna, I actually found some photos of this and, and [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7295.32s)]
*  pulled them up because I thought you might ask when I told you about this. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7301.52s)]
*  Now, the thing about this is what's crazy is this is like, this is actually, [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7304.360000000001s)]
*  this is like actually when it had healed. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7313.280000000001s)]
*  So, I mean, that's, that's after it healed. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7315.320000000001s)]
*  This, this is, this is months, months. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7318.68s)]
*  This is maybe two months after, uh, I was back in Canada at this point. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7321.4400000000005s)]
*  I have some better ones there. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7326.200000000001s)]
*  Um, you know, here's, uh, [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7328.160000000001s)]
*  horrible. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7329.96s)]
*  Here's, that's, let's see. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7331.0s)]
*  Here's, you know, this is sort of healing up, healing up this. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7333.4s)]
*  That's my mom, my mom, I thought that healing up at the hospital, but, uh, yeah, [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7337.2s)]
*  it's, uh, damn son, you got fucked up. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7341.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7344.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7344.36s)]
*  But, uh, it's, uh, you know, it could have been worse, right? [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7344.72s)]
*  Could have been worse. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7348.68s)]
*  So, yeah, you're alive. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7349.16s)]
*  You're here. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7351.24s)]
*  Could have been worse. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7351.68s)]
*  And you get this, you get the sense of, uh, almost, it's almost like a sense of [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7352.4s)]
*  gratitude you get afterwards. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7359.04s)]
*  Cause you're like, I'm alive. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7360.64s)]
*  I'm here. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7362.44s)]
*  I still got my foot and say, it's so strange how that happens. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7362.8s)]
*  Cause it's happened to me twice now in my life. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7365.5199999999995s)]
*  Cause I had testicular cancer when I was, when I was on MTV and I, that's why I [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7367.28s)]
*  stopped the show and I'd go to the hospital. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7371.36s)]
*  They'd room, I took my right testicle. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7372.76s)]
*  I still got the left one. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7374.08s)]
*  Everything's fine. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7374.84s)]
*  Um, but, uh, and you go, you go from, there's this, there's a moment where [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7375.68s)]
*  you're like, in both occasions, this moment where you're sort of traumatized [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7380.16s)]
*  by what's happening and angry about it. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7387.72s)]
*  And then it sort of almost instantly flips. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7392.84s)]
*  Must be some sort of human self-preservation kind of thing that's built [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7395.8s)]
*  into our way our minds work, where you're now grateful that it's not worse. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7400.12s)]
*  You know, like, you know, Oh, it's healing. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7405.08s)]
*  I was, I still have my foot. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7410.400000000001s)]
*  Uh, this is a learning experience. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7412.08s)]
*  You know, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not going to do that again. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7415.0s)]
*  Uh, you think that's wired into people? [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7417.84s)]
*  I think the opposite. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7419.44s)]
*  I think that's a learned skill. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7420.92s)]
*  I think that's something that you recognize as an intelligent person. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7423.32s)]
*  Like, you know what? [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7426.96s)]
*  I'm, I should be thankful for what I have all the time and we all should. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7427.76s)]
*  It's really hard to be. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7432.28s)]
*  You get so accustomed to the way your life is that you can't imagine if you [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7433.8s)]
*  were like severely impaired or something horrible happened. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7438.56s)]
*  It's like, after I had cancer, it's sometimes it comes into my mind, like a, [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7441.679999999999s)]
*  like a little bit of a light bulb or a wave. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7447.88s)]
*  Like I'll think to myself, you know, if I'm having a slightly bad day, you [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7450.0s)]
*  know what I mean? [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7453.799999999999s)]
*  And I'll be like, like I don't, for whatever reason happens, just sometimes [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7454.719999999999s)]
*  when I'm out doing normal errands and I'm having a slightly bad day, going to [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7458.12s)]
*  the gas station, pumping gas or something. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7461.12s)]
*  And then I think to myself, Oh man, at least I'm not in the hospital right [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7463.4s)]
*  now dealing with some crazy, you know, existential life and death thing, you [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7468.84s)]
*  know? [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7473.52s)]
*  And so, yeah, maybe it is a learned thing because of what I've been through with [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7474.28s)]
*  that, because the same thing happened after I burned my foot, you know, as [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7477.68s)]
*  soon as it's sort of, as soon as I'm, you're quickly start of, you go from. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7480.52s)]
*  I can't believe this has happened. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7485.400000000001s)]
*  I'm angry. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7486.76s)]
*  I just ruined my vacation. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7487.56s)]
*  I might lose my foot. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7488.84s)]
*  This is horrible too. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7489.72s)]
*  Okay. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7491.4800000000005s)]
*  How are we going to get better? [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7492.76s)]
*  How are we going to make sure that I do everything to change the bandages [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7495.72s)]
*  on time and your whole, your whole life changes, right? [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7498.72s)]
*  You know, I'm not, I'm not thinking about all the things that I'm normally [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7501.04s)]
*  stressed about, whether it's work or relationships or whatever, things that [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7504.240000000001s)]
*  are just normal standard things that you're pissed off about. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7508.6s)]
*  And all of a sudden you're just, Oh, not even thinking about that anymore. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7511.240000000001s)]
*  I'm just thinking about making sure I don't get an infection on my foot. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7513.96s)]
*  And you're sort of treating it like a military operation, trying to save your [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7516.56s)]
*  foot or trying to, you know, make sure that you, you know, make the right choices [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7520.76s)]
*  in your cancer treatment. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7524.84s)]
*  And, um, and then when you come out of it, it was true. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7526.2s)]
*  It's possibly a learned thing. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7529.84s)]
*  You come out of it and you realize, Oh, all that shit that I'm normally worried [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7531.2s)]
*  about doesn't matter compared to what, what I just went through. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7535.68s)]
*  And then you can kind of maybe learn from that. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7540.360000000001s)]
*  And you know, then you, it's time passes, you slip back into the same routine. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7545.280000000001s)]
*  You start stressing out about the same things again, but then every once in a [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7548.76s)]
*  while it pops into your head and go, at least I'm not dealing with the foot's healed. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7551.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7555.24s)]
*  Outside right now and everything's good. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7555.68s)]
*  I'm walking, I'm talking, I'm alive. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7557.32s)]
*  So gratitude, gratitude. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7558.68s)]
*  It's also people need to experience a certain amount of discomfort in order [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7562.12s)]
*  to appreciate not having that. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7568.12s)]
*  It's just the way we're wired for whatever reason. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7570.08s)]
*  I choose voluntary discomfort. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7572.96s)]
*  I do shit like cold plunges and so on as in hard workouts. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7574.56s)]
*  And I think it's a viable strategy. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7577.16s)]
*  I think it really works. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7579.12s)]
*  I think if you can force yourself to do difficult things, like a difficult [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7580.400000000001s)]
*  workout, a difficult yoga class, cold plunges, saunas, that kind of shit, [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7584.16s)]
*  your regular life will be less stressful. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7588.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7591.36s)]
*  You'll be, you'll be able to deal with these were seemingly high stress situations. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7591.88s)]
*  They will seem less stressful because you're doing voluntary stress all the [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7598.28s)]
*  time and you prepare yourself for difficult things. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7602.72s)]
*  When you don't prepare yourself for difficult things, you can get caught up in [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7606.4s)]
*  like just traffic being something that blows your mind. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7608.96s)]
*  You can't handle anymore. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7611.32s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7612.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7613.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7614.04s)]
*  I see you doing those cold plunges and I haven't done that yet, but people [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7614.76s)]
*  do that in lakes and stuff. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7618.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's awesome. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7620.120000000001s)]
*  I want to do that. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7621.160000000001s)]
*  Get a sauna, put it right by your lake. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7622.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7623.360000000001s)]
*  I want to do that. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7623.76s)]
*  I want to get a sauna. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7624.84s)]
*  But that lake's cold as fuck in the winter. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7625.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7626.64s)]
*  I was playing hockey on it a few weeks ago. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7626.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7629.0s)]
*  Just out there shooting some pucks in the net and, and, you know, so I can [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7629.240000000001s)]
*  play, I can skate again. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7632.52s)]
*  I did the first year I didn't skate. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7633.280000000001s)]
*  Get yourself one of them little wood powered saunas. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7634.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7637.56s)]
*  You could use it with firewood. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7637.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7639.360000000001s)]
*  You don't have to have anything electricity rigged up out there. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7639.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7641.96s)]
*  They make a bunch of those. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7642.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7643.48s)]
*  You can throw some wood in there, get that bitch hot as fuck. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7643.759999999999s)]
*  Get a chainsaw, cut a hole in the ice. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7646.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7650.36s)]
*  Make sure you don't drown. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7650.839999999999s)]
*  I am going to do that because it's, it's, I'm not sure how, I mean, I haven't [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7652.08s)]
*  done a cold plunge. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7656.599999999999s)]
*  I can tell you that I do like the cold. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7657.36s)]
*  Like we sort of touched on that earlier. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7659.839999999999s)]
*  Like when you just go outside into, like sometimes it's, Canadians complain [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7661.12s)]
*  about the cold who live in the city, but when you live in the country, it's [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7666.799999999999s)]
*  different, the city winter sucks. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7669.36s)]
*  Cause like they put salt on the roads and you're basically running from your [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7671.28s)]
*  house to your car, but in the country, when there's, you go outside and nature [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7673.84s)]
*  and you walk into the woods, there's no bugs, there's no mud, everything's frozen. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7677.84s)]
*  You can go places you can't go in the summer, in the winter, you can walk [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7683.599999999999s)]
*  across lakes, you can walk like across huge lakes to islands that are over there [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7686.719999999999s)]
*  with warm, you know, bath and Canada goose jacket on. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7691.16s)]
*  This is something about walking across lakes that I don't like. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7695.32s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7698.32s)]
*  I don't like it. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7698.88s)]
*  It's sort of like, I kind of was thinking to myself, I was going to say, you know, [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7700.5599999999995s)]
*  it's sort of like a cold plunge, except it's just, you just go outside as a [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7705.599999999999s)]
*  cold plunge sometimes, you know, it's like you do get a dopamine rush, right? [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7709.08s)]
*  Just from being outside. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7711.919999999999s)]
*  So you can, like, I've actually noticed that in warmer climates, sometimes I'm a [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7713.16s)]
*  bit more lethargic, you know, but when the winter comes, it's like, okay, go [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7719.5599999999995s)]
*  outside, it's like, you know, you feel it, you feel that, you know, it's just. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7723.44s)]
*  Well, Letterman used to always have a studio really cold. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7727.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7729.08s)]
*  I want people to be warm and sleepy. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7729.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7731.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7731.6s)]
*  A little cold, a little, ah, keeps the calm, but he fresh. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7732.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7735.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7736.16s)]
*  But there's something about walking across a lake that is just like, yeah, at any [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7737.12s)]
*  moment now, this can just break. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7741.16s)]
*  Oh no. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7744.0s)]
*  No. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7744.48s)]
*  Well, cause you know, I know you can't. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7744.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7746.04s)]
*  I know. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7746.2s)]
*  I'm like, I went ice fishing last year. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7746.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7747.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7747.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7748.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7748.28s)]
*  I get it. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7748.68s)]
*  Now people make mistakes all the time. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7749.64s)]
*  They go, they wait too long and it's a spring and they drive the truck out on it [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7751.16s)]
*  and it goes through the ice. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7754.8s)]
*  But, uh, if you're, you know, if you're properly advised by people that know what [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7756.64s)]
*  they're doing, don't, you know, like, like the people, you know, that some of my [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7762.92s)]
*  friends out there do a lot of ice fishing, you know, they tell you, okay. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7767.0s)]
*  The other thing you can do is like when I was playing hockey on the lake this year, [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7769.400000000001s)]
*  you just, just stay close to the shore. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7772.56s)]
*  So you go, okay, well, if I fall through, it's only two feet deep or three feet [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7774.2s)]
*  deep here, so, you know, you won't actually be sucked away under the, under the, [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7777.28s)]
*  under the ice, but walking across in the middle, yeah, you have a little bit more [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7781.88s)]
*  dangerous out in the middle there. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7784.76s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen the video of the Russian woman who jumps into the river. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7786.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7790.16s)]
*  It's so horrible. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7790.92s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7791.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7792.56s)]
*  They cut a hole in the ice and she doesn't realize it's a raging river underneath [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7792.92s)]
*  it and she just gets sucked under. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7796.2s)]
*  And I heard that just happened recently in the States too. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7797.68s)]
*  A woman's dog or something went in and she dove in after. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7800.04s)]
*  Oh God. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7803.92s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7807.360000000001s)]
*  The, that's fucking terrifying. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7807.64s)]
*  The idea of being trapped under the ice. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7809.360000000001s)]
*  There's another one of a guy who's trying to, they cut two holes and they try to [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7811.88s)]
*  swim from one to the other and the ice is clear and you see him under there. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7815.36s)]
*  You see him, you see him get disoriented and then you see him trying to find his [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7818.2s)]
*  way back to the other hole and then he does eventually find his way, but there's [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7821.4s)]
*  this sort of moment of panic where his friends are up on top and they're, they're [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7824.5199999999995s)]
*  banging on the ice and they're trying to say, no, no, this way, this way. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7828.08s)]
*  He can see him. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7831.36s)]
*  You can see his body panicking. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7832.96s)]
*  You know, you can see him like sort of feeling. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7834.92s)]
*  And when you panic, you lose oxygen. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7837.5199999999995s)]
*  Your body, your heart rate goes up. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7839.76s)]
*  It's like not good. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7842.32s)]

*  I don't want to see this man. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7846.0s)]
*  Stop it, Jamie. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7848.04s)]
*  I remember the first time I saw the concept of, of falling through the ice [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7849.96s)]
*  and in the winter was that remember that movie, never cry wolf. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7853.96s)]

*  Does there's, they're trying to say this way, this way. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7865.92s)]
*  And then he goes back all the way back. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7869.76s)]
*  He goes all the way. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7872.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7874.84s)]
*  No, the music even makes it. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7876.84s)]
*  What is he doing? [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7879.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7880.96s)]
*  They had a rope. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7881.68s)]
*  He found the rope. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7882.400000000001s)]
*  Is he going to make it? [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7884.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7885.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7886.0s)]
*  He ends up making it, but yeah, there you go. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7886.200000000001s)]
*  So I think you want a cold plunge in the lake closer to shore. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7889.120000000001s)]
*  Bro. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7892.88s)]
*  Fuck what that is. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7893.120000000001s)]
*  Whatever that is. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7894.5199999999995s)]
*  Fuck what that is. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7895.32s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7897.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7900.16s)]
*  He was like a foot away from the hole and he couldn't tell. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7900.36s)]
*  That's nuts, man. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7903.2s)]
*  It was, you ever see that movie? [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7904.919999999999s)]
*  Never cry wolf from the eighties. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7906.08s)]
*  It was about a guy that goes up in the Arctic to study wolves. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7907.5599999999995s)]
*  And then he ends up, you know, befriending them and Brian Dennehies [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7910.12s)]
*  plays the evil trapper. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7913.28s)]
*  And it was a, yeah, it was, it was a great movie. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7914.679999999999s)]
*  It was based on this Canadian novel, Farley Mowat novel called never cry, [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7917.879999999999s)]
*  never cry wolf. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7921.959999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7922.599999999999s)]
*  Did the wolves really make friends with them? [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7922.759999999999s)]
*  In real life. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7924.719999999999s)]
*  So he goes up to- [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7925.48s)]
*  In the novel. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7927.0s)]
*  Right, it's a novel. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7928.16s)]
*  It's a true story. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7929.04s)]
*  He goes up to, about a scientist who goes up to study these wolves. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7929.879999999999s)]
*  And, you know, it's just sort of man versus nature kind of story. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7933.799999999999s)]
*  We ended up becoming a Disney movie, but, you know, he ends up, you know, [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7937.0s)]
*  running out of food, his food gets dropped off in the wrong place or [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7943.12s)]
*  something like that. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7947.759999999999s)]
*  So he ends up sort of seeing the wolves eating mice. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7948.44s)]
*  So then he ends up, you know, the big scene, the big, probably inspired [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7950.639999999999s)]
*  some of my work later in life. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7953.76s)]
*  He starts eating mice off crackers and stuff like that. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7954.88s)]
*  And it was big, oh, gross out. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7957.12s)]
*  So he needs the mice off the crackers. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7958.56s)]
*  But, but then he ends up falling through the ice at one point, walking across [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7959.88s)]
*  a lake and there's a scene like that. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7963.2s)]
*  And it's one of those, you know, back in the eighties pre CGI movies where [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7965.08s)]
*  you're just sort of remember, you had to come up with actual scenes where [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7972.320000000001s)]
*  something relatable and shocking happens that you can actually really like [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7975.08s)]
*  grips you, you know, and then Brian Dennehy shows up and well, you know, [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7978.84s)]
*  he kills the wolves and it's very sad. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7983.16s)]
*  And that's the end of the movie. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7985.5199999999995s)]
*  So you don't have to watch it anymore. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7986.68s)]
*  Well, at one point in time, people did have to have become friends with wolves [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7987.8s)]
*  because that's where dogs came from. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7991.88s)]
*  So when wolves came around the campfires, there must've been some curious wolves [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7993.48s)]
*  and there must've been some generous hunters who threw them a bone or threw [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=7997.44s)]
*  them some meat and that's how dogs got made. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8002.28s)]
*  The, the bitch ass wolves are like, Oh, I'm just, I'm happy to be your friend. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8004.88s)]
*  I don't really want to hunt deer anymore. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8009.5199999999995s)]
*  They're cooking some nice, uh, you know, and it made the mammoth steaks here. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8011.32s)]
*  I think that smells better than the leaves were eating. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8015.48s)]
*  It smells incredible. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8018.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8019.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8019.84s)]
*  You know, especially with a wolf nose. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8020.08s)]
*  Imagine how good it would have been. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8022.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8023.639999999999s)]
*  So we made friends with them and that's, that's where dogs, that's where Charlie [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8024.36s)]
*  comes from, Charlie comes from a wolf. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8027.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8029.16s)]
*  I was, uh, yeah, I've, I've watched some of your episodes where you talk about [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8029.88s)]
*  wolves because I'm really finding myself interested in it because this is, I hear [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8033.44s)]
*  them at night, like at night, like not every night, but I, you hear them howling [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8038.28s)]
*  and she goes crazy. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8045.0s)]
*  So in the house at night, you hear them. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8046.16s)]
*  Cause they'll eat her. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8048.24s)]
*  And so, so we'll, she'll hear them from in the house at night. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8049.88s)]
*  I don't hear them, but all of a sudden this happens, you know, three times a week. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8054.719999999999s)]
*  She starts running around the house, barking, barking, barking. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8058.48s)]
*  And then I can, then we go out in the porch and you hear them howling in the [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8061.0s)]
*  distance and, and so they just, so this summer. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8063.36s)]
*  And I know this happened to you. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8068.28s)]
*  Uh, uh, I, I had chickens, I got chickens, I got chickens in, uh, in June as well. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8069.599999999999s)]
*  I had six chickens and, uh, I mean, eggs, you know, I'm getting eggs from my chickens [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8075.96s)]
*  and I've eaten a lot of eggs now, eating a lot of eggs and, um, and they free range. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8079.92s)]
*  Right. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8085.4s)]
*  So I just not fenced in, right. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8085.639999999999s)]
*  But the, the woods are sort of, there's a pond and their woods are on the other [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8087.5199999999995s)]
*  side of the pond and it's kind of a pasture on one side. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8092.28s)]
*  So, you know, debatably the wolves and the coyotes don't come right up to near the [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8095.24s)]
*  barns where the chickens are. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8101.5199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8103.16s)]
*  So, so I've let them free range. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8103.36s)]
*  So in the morning I get up and I let the chickens out and then they spend the day [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8105.12s)]
*  walking around on the lawn and the grass and then sort of a more, uh, you know, [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8108.44s)]
*  closer to the house area. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8112.599999999999s)]
*  And, um, this was great all summer. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8115.599999999999s)]
*  It was great. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8118.16s)]
*  I named them. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8118.679999999999s)]
*  It was, it was Loretta, Patsy, Shania, Dolly, June and Anne. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8119.48s)]
*  They're my girls, you know, give them all. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8123.2s)]
*  Female country singer names. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8125.04s)]
*  And then they were bonded with them in a way, like they're kind of, kind of sweet. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8126.56s)]
*  You know, actually would take that. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8132.36s)]
*  Sometimes I bring one in the house and like, you know, hang out with it and play [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8134.28s)]
*  piano with it and it was like, you know, it was, I mean, this is getting weird, [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8137.36s)]
*  but it was, you could tell it was interested in the music. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8141.32s)]
*  Like there's an intelligence there. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8144.0s)]
*  That's no, I mean, no chickens aren't known for being the most intelligent [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8145.52s)]
*  thing in the world, but you would see their wheels turning, listening to the music. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8148.88s)]
*  I kind of become attached to these chickens, you know? [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8152.36s)]
*  And then, uh, yeah. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8155.32s)]
*  Uh, so I get a bit more comfortable with having them free range. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8157.08s)]
*  They free ranged all summer and they're great cause they're eating all the [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8161.48s)]
*  bugs and they're getting all the, you know, insects and stuff on the [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8164.52s)]
*  property and around the house. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8168.2s)]
*  And, uh, so I, I drive into town one day. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8170.32s)]
*  Okay. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8173.92s)]
*  So I'm gone for two hours. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8174.48s)]
*  Okay. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8177.56s)]
*  And I come back and I'm coming up the driveway and it's just, uh, feathers, [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8178.96s)]
*  feathers, feathers, feathers, feathers. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8184.36s)]
*  And, uh, there was one survivor, Loretta survived. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8186.679999999999s)]
*  Uh, she was sort of, funnily enough, there was one chicken that didn't hang [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8190.16s)]
*  out with other chickens all the time. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8193.92s)]
*  And this one Loretta, I named her Loretta and, uh, she was probably just somewhere [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8195.039999999999s)]
*  else, but the spy just got, got, uh, got killed by the coyotes and I saw them on [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8198.8s)]
*  my, on my security cameras, came right up to the house. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8203.76s)]
*  And, and so the thing is, is like, you realize, and I realize this even more [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8207.039999999999s)]
*  after talking to the wolf expert, they were watching the house from the woods [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8212.84s)]
*  and they saw me leave and they knew that there was nobody there and they chose [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8219.52s)]
*  their moment, the wolves or the, I think it might've been coyotes that, that, [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8223.72s)]
*  that did the chickens. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8226.960000000001s)]
*  They like waited, like they waited for me. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8228.48s)]
*  They knew, they knew my truck. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8230.68s)]
*  They knew there was nobody there and they said, you know, one good thing to [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8232.36s)]
*  do if you leave, you know, is to play, play talk radio, you know, maybe they'll [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8235.76s)]
*  hear that. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8239.160000000002s)]
*  Um, but, uh, so they were watching and they, they came and they got five of [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8240.240000000002s)]
*  them all at once and it was, the chickens were gone. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8246.480000000001s)]
*  There was just feathers everywhere. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8248.720000000001s)]
*  Like, like, like, it almost looked like a bomb. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8249.560000000001s)]
*  It hit the chicken. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8252.44s)]
*  It was like just a big circle of feathers and there's five circles of feathers. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8253.08s)]
*  It's weird to come upon, right? [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8257.400000000001s)]
*  And so then I have this one chicken left and this is actually kind of sad too. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8259.28s)]
*  Um, it's funny. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8264.320000000002s)]
*  I literally cried and then my, cause I was like so upset and then, and then, [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8265.960000000001s)]
*  and then my neighbors, you know, we're farmers, you know, our buddies of mine, [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8270.84s)]
*  you know, came over and they were like, Oh, look at the chicken feathers everywhere. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8274.2s)]
*  And I was like, you know, is this normal for me to be crying about this? [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8278.32s)]
*  And I said, do farmers cry? [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8282.56s)]
*  They go not over their dead chickens, you know, I'm like, I'm like a city guy here [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8285.16s)]
*  crying over my dead chickens, but, um, but, uh, so then, yeah, so then I got two [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8290.44s)]
*  more chickens to keep Loretta company. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8295.08s)]
*  And this is kind of breaking news as of yesterday. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8297.44s)]
*  Uh, these two new chickens came and they hung up Loretta for the next sense. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8300.039999999999s)]
*  I don't know, August. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8304.84s)]
*  And then, uh, well, this is a downer, but, uh, yesterday I got a call and the two [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8306.84s)]
*  chickens, uh, killed the, killed Loretta, the ones, the one that was from the [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8311.72s)]
*  different flock, you know, they pectored a death last night or two nights ago in [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8317.2s)]
*  the middle of the night. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8321.88s)]
*  So, yeah, that's a downer. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8322.36s)]
*  But anyway, so now you're like, okay, so that's, so I got these two fucking [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8324.28s)]
*  murderer chickens and I'm planning to get more chickens in the spring, so I'm [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8328.44s)]
*  going to get rid of the two chickens. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8331.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8333.44s)]
*  You have to start from scratch. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8333.640000000001s)]
*  Start from scratch because I can't keep these new chickens around. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8334.76s)]
*  So they're fucking murderers. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8336.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8338.400000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8338.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8339.68s)]
*  And they're like, hi, I'm your friend. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8339.880000000001s)]
*  Like, no, you're not. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8341.44s)]
*  You killed my other friend. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8342.400000000001s)]
*  And they, exactly. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8343.44s)]
*  And they were friends for the, well, they were all together for the last, you know, [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8344.320000000002s)]
*  what you're supposed to do. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8347.400000000001s)]
*  Uh huh. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8348.36s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8349.320000000002s)]
*  I know. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8349.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8350.24s)]
*  Put them in the oven. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8350.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8351.640000000001s)]
*  It's not like I'm going to rehome them. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8352.04s)]
*  Would you like these two murderers? [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8354.36s)]
*  Don't you want to rehabilitate them either? [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8356.04s)]
*  Just. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8357.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8358.08s)]
*  Uh huh. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8358.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8359.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8360.28s)]
*  Apparently you'll let them on the grill. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8360.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8362.04s)]
*  I was, I was told you hang them upside down, just hold them upside down for a [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8362.240000000002s)]
*  while and they kind of blackout. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8365.400000000001s)]
*  And then you can, uh, don't want to get revenge for Loretta. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8366.400000000001s)]
*  It's, it's, it's a strange, well, you know what? [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8370.68s)]
*  Here's the, here's an interesting thing about revenge because I've been [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8372.92s)]
*  thinking about, well, I was, I was thinking about revenge with the coyotes. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8375.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8380.960000000001s)]
*  So, and so here's the thing that's a very sort of odd thing is, you know, I, [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8381.44s)]
*  I love the coyotes. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8388.199999999999s)]
*  I love the wolves. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8389.32s)]
*  Like I love them. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8389.96s)]
*  Like I love hearing them at night and I love seeing them. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8391.119999999999s)]
*  And I photographed them. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8393.88s)]
*  I've, I've had a, I've had many moments where I've been engaged [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8394.84s)]
*  in a standoff with them. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8399.52s)]
*  I filmed it and, um, and so I kind of was really mad for a minute. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8402.0s)]
*  And then I thought, well, you know what? [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8407.08s)]
*  I think I like the coyotes more than the chickens, to be honest with you. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8408.12s)]
*  So I'm just going to kind of figure out a way to kind of, you know, control [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8411.68s)]
*  the situation, but also, you know, watching your show with, uh, forget [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8415.560000000001s)]
*  who it was, but it was a expert in this area and talking to people, apparently [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8419.800000000001s)]
*  like, if you, if you try to, again, this is all theory, but apparently if you [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8423.52s)]
*  try to completely control the population of coyotes by, it just makes more coyotes. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8430.84s)]
*  Dan Flores. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8435.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8436.44s)]
*  He wrote a book called Coyote America. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8436.92s)]
*  He was one talking about that where the coyote actually, um, [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8438.64s)]
*  the female coyote has more pups. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8442.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8443.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8444.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8444.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8444.88s)]
*  So that was what I was talking about earlier, where they were prosecuted by [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8445.32s)]
*  the, or persecuted by the gray wolves, because gray wolves and coyotes don't mix. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8447.599999999999s)]
*  So when the gray wolves would kill the coyotes, the coyotes would expand their [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8452.519999999999s)]
*  range and then they would repopulate new areas where the gray wolves weren't. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8456.92s)]
*  And the way they would find out how many coyotes are around, they do, [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8460.72s)]
*  they call out to each other. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8464.839999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8465.8s)]
*  It was on the show that I heard that someone is not responding. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8466.44s)]
*  The female starts to panic and have more pups. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8469.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8472.039999999999s)]
*  Not amazing. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8472.44s)]
*  It's pretty wild. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8472.88s)]
*  And that's why they spread all across. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8473.16s)]
*  During the whole country. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8474.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8475.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8475.76s)]
*  During every city in the United States of America. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8475.84s)]
*  They're in the cities now. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8477.68s)]
*  Yep. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8478.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8478.84s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8481.28s)]
*  It's pretty nuts, but I love them too. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8481.76s)]
*  I think they're awesome. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8483.76s)]
*  I definitely wanted to kill them after they killed my chickens. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8484.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8486.52s)]
*  But that's also, it's like, I'm not in the country either, bitch. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8487.28s)]
*  I'm in a fucking suburb. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8490.0s)]

*  Right. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8492.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8492.64s)]
*  You don't want little small wolves in the suburbs. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8492.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8495.0s)]

*  Coyotes are downtown. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8499.24s)]
*  They're everywhere. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8500.84s)]
*  They're all over the place in Los Angeles. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8501.72s)]
*  They're just little wolves. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8503.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8505.48s)]
*  I, I, I remember they used to come up to my place, that place in LA. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8505.68s)]
*  That was, that we did the web show. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8512.4s)]
*  Coyotes were a lot of coyotes. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8514.48s)]
*  I saw Bobcat on that street once. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8515.76s)]
*  Those are cool. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8517.36s)]

*  Right. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8519.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8519.88s)]
*  I was pretty stupid actually when I was there, cause I first saw the [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8520.12s)]
*  coyotes and I had this idea, Oh, I like the coyotes. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8523.92s)]
*  And I would want to go grocery shopping. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8526.24s)]
*  I'd buy some chicken gizzards and I'd throw them on the hillside. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8527.64s)]
*  And then they really started coming around. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8530.44s)]
*  So I stopped doing that. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8531.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8533.24s)]
*  Duh. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8534.04s)]
*  You can't feed coyotes. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8535.04s)]
*  I'm sure a lot of people in Hollywood do though. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8537.12s)]
*  I'm sure they feed, feed deer. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8539.12s)]
*  I'm sure they feed coyotes. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8540.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8542.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8542.44s)]
*  I know people in my neighborhood feed deer. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8542.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8544.92s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8546.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8547.32s)]
*  I know a guy who's got a, not in my neighborhood, but he's got a, like [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8547.76s)]
*  20 pieces of 20 acres of land and he's got at least two feeders. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8551.240000000002s)]
*  So like at every day at 5pm, he could look out his window and see deer. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8557.6s)]
*  Cause they're there to get fed. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8561.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8562.720000000001s)]

*  But, no, the people, the people would love to have you up there. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8590.68s)]
*  You know, not everybody, but, but a lot of people would love to have you up there. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8593.84s)]
*  You know what it's like? [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8597.04s)]
*  People with blue hair up there. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8597.640000000001s)]
*  They don't want nothing to do with me. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8598.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8599.720000000001s)]

*  And then it's, it's people that. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8605.36s)]
*  I love Canadians. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8606.16s)]
*  They're awesome. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8607.240000000002s)]
*  I've always said Canada has 20% less douchebags. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8608.12s)]
*  It's, it's, it's, it's just very similar to, to what it's like here with the division. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8611.28s)]
*  It's the same division, same issues, same bullshit. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8615.720000000001s)]
*  Well, that's why you have to stop it. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8617.880000000001s)]
*  It's, it's not just the same divisions and the same bullshit. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8618.400000000001s)]
*  That's true too, but it's also a ploy that's being used to separate ourselves [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8621.08s)]
*  while they enact more control. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8624.480000000001s)]
*  And that's what's scary. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8626.04s)]
*  That's what's scary. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8627.36s)]
*  It's like the underlying mechanism. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8628.08s)]
*  Like what's, what's, what's actually happening behind the scenes? [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8629.6s)]
*  Well, they're trying to clamp down and control the population. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8632.720000000001s)]
*  That's, that's scary. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8635.36s)]
*  They're trying to clamp down and control the information the population gets. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8636.720000000001s)]
*  That's fucking scary. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8640.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8641.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8642.880000000001s)]
*  As of, because that doesn't ever come back. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8643.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8645.320000000002s)]
*  Once they get that power, they don't give it back to the people. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8645.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8648.68s)]
*  Never happens. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8649.0s)]
*  So you had a fight to stop that from happening. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8650.36s)]
*  You can't let them decide what you can and can't do because they're just people. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8652.84s)]
*  I mean, there would be outrage in Canada if your show got banned, if got, got, got blocked [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8657.36s)]
*  because people, everybody watches your show. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8662.52s)]
*  I mean, it's just, it's like here, everybody watches your show. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8664.560000000001s)]
*  Everybody loves your show. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8666.560000000001s)]
*  It would be outraged. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8667.640000000001s)]
*  It would be a political. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8668.480000000001s)]
*  It would be political suicide. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8670.04s)]
*  It could happen though. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8671.44s)]
*  It could happen, especially if there's some new COVID type thing happens. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8672.560000000001s)]
*  And I have contrary experts on, I have people on that are, are like Robert Malone, the [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8677.44s)]
*  guy that they maligned and said it was a conspiracy theorist and that he was a, you [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8683.36s)]
*  know, it wasn't a qualified expert to talk about the subject, even though his vaccine [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8688.76s)]
*  injured himself, even though he owns nine patents on the creation of mRNA vaccine [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8693.480000000001s)]
*  technology. I mean, he's a legitimate scientist that worked on that technology. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8698.68s)]
*  I think the Canadian public values freedom of, of, of expression and speech. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8703.28s)]
*  Right. But the Canadian government doesn't. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8708.84s)]
*  That's the problem. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8711.04s)]
*  It's, it's, again, it's, they haven't passed that law and, and. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8712.08s)]
*  But the thing is, if they do, if they try to, and there's calls to do it right now in [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8716.64s)]
*  America. There's also calls to do it from the World Health Organization to try to put [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8721.24s)]
*  a kibosh on any information that doesn't jive with what they're saying in the case [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8727.08s)]
*  of another situation, another pandemic or another. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8732.039999999999s)]
*  I mean, Google released that thing where they were saying that they had some new [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8735.76s)]
*  regulations that would be put in place in cases of a special event or anything of [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8740.76s)]
*  extreme social or political, like some thing where they're going to be able to stop [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8746.4s)]
*  air quotes misinformation. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8751.48s)]
*  That's fucking terrifying because oftentimes that information turns out to be correct. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8753.4s)]
*  I love your approach to it and your, your stand up, your new stand up. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8758.0s)]
*  It's hilarious. I won't say it, obviously, but it's just hilarious because, because, [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8761.52s)]
*  you know, it's, it's very self-reflective too. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8767.68s)]
*  And I just thought it was just amazing because you're, you know, you're kind of, I [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8770.119999999999s)]
*  won't say it. I don't want to say it because obviously you got your show coming up. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8773.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8775.72s)]
*  But, but, but I thought it was even people that may think they disagree with you on [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8775.88s)]
*  some subjects probably are going to really find it quite pointed the way, the way you [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8782.6s)]
*  address the issue in your standup set. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8787.12s)]
*  I thought it was awesome. It was hilarious. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8788.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8790.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8790.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8791.2s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8791.640000000001s)]
*  Well, it's obviously something on everybody's mind. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8792.36s)]
*  It's just, we're in a weird pivotal moment where technology and our awareness of [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8795.36s)]
*  corruption is all meeting in this battleground in the middle of the fucking field, like [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8800.960000000001s)]
*  Braveheart, like, that's what's scary. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8806.36s)]
*  What's scary is these two things are colliding and I don't know which one's going to [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8809.76s)]
*  win because we could turn into a dictatorship. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8812.36s)]
*  We could. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8816.68s)]
*  We could turn into something that's closer to a dictatorship and then something that's [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8817.44s)]
*  closer still and continue to go down that line, especially if there's some need to clamp [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8822.12s)]
*  down on society because something happened, whether it's a solar flare or whether it's a [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8828.6s)]
*  terrorist attack or whether it's just flat out war. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8834.0s)]
*  It's all that we need. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8837.44s)]
*  All they need is some reason. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8838.52s)]
*  When they need to completely clamp down on your ability to express yourself, platform's [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8840.6s)]
*  ability to distribute information that's contrary to what they're saying. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8845.640000000001s)]
*  Any of those things, anything that they can do to stop that, to put a clamp down on people [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8849.44s)]
*  like disrupting the narrative that they're trying to distribute. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8857.52s)]
*  It's wild that COVID was essentially one of the catalysts that got me to leave the city. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8861.08s)]
*  And, you know, it started with the van. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8869.56s)]
*  I got the van and I'm out in the remote desert and I'm loving it out there. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8871.88s)]
*  And I was, you know, it was my bug out van. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8875.56s)]
*  I mean, I had probably could have survived in that van with a solar power battery system [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8878.48s)]
*  and my food. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8885.76s)]
*  I'd freeze dried, you know, meals ready to eat, you know, camping food, boil water and [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8886.560000000001s)]
*  pour it in the bag and lasagna. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8891.16s)]
*  This is amazing. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8893.08s)]
*  You know, I could have probably spent, you know, months out there without even having [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8893.960000000001s)]
*  to go anywhere, you know, and you start to go, hey, this is kind of cool. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8896.960000000001s)]
*  You know, like I'm self-sufficient out here. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8901.720000000001s)]
*  I'm not, you know, you know, I've got 26 gallon water. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8903.880000000001s)]
*  You didn't get lonely? [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8906.560000000001s)]
*  Well, I would drive out to a cool place for three or four days and then I'd go to another [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8908.12s)]
*  location and then... [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8913.92s)]
*  So you'd go and hang with people? [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8915.8s)]
*  No, I wasn't. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8917.64s)]
*  I was just doing this sort of... [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8918.599999999999s)]
*  Isolation. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8920.679999999998s)]
*  I was doing this. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8921.48s)]
*  I was really actually kind of getting into videography again. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8922.24s)]
*  I was, I got some, I got a, I shot this video on Sony a7S III, but I've started getting [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8927.48s)]
*  back into cameras. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8932.599999999999s)]
*  Right, but you weren't around any people? [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8933.64s)]
*  Well, I was... [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8936.0s)]
*  When you went to cool places, did you go hang around people? [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8936.88s)]
*  No, no, I was just alone. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8939.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8940.039999999999s)]
*  And, and, and, and I was making these, it was just Charlie and I, we made this sort of, [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8940.279999999999s)]
*  you know, film. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8943.76s)]
*  How long did you go without being around any people? [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8945.44s)]
*  Well, cause then I would go... [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8947.52s)]
*  Cause when you came here, the last time you did the podcast, I had the distinct impression [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8949.640000000001s)]
*  of a man who just got rescued from an island. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8953.640000000001s)]
*  It was Tom Hanks. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8956.44s)]
*  You had the fucking volleyball. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8957.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8958.92s)]
*  You seemed... [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8960.32s)]
*  It was like that, yeah. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8960.800000000001s)]
*  You seemed a little manic. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8961.68s)]
*  It was, it was somewhat of a creative experiment as mixed with real paranoia as well. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8962.68s)]
*  Cause I do sort of, I think sometimes like, like I said, you know, I got testicular cancer. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8970.24s)]
*  How the fuck did that happen to me? [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8976.039999999999s)]
*  So I'm just like, okay, this is everything bad. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8977.119999999999s)]
*  If this is happening, it's going to be bad. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8979.08s)]
*  So it's going to be bad to me. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8980.8s)]
*  So I'm just going to... [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8981.76s)]
*  And then... [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8982.28s)]
*  So how long did you go without being in contact with any other people? [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8982.88s)]
*  Well, so I was still had my house in LA, so I hadn't sold my house yet. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8987.6s)]
*  So I had this van. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8992.32s)]
*  So I would drive out in the desert for a couple of weeks and basically go on a camping [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8993.08s)]
*  trip and then I'd go back home. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8996.08s)]
*  And then... [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8997.48s)]
*  Were you around people when you were back home? [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=8998.359999999999s)]
*  So it was still that people would come over, we'd hang out outside. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9000.16s)]
*  It was that kind of whole thing for the first few weeks or whatever, months, a couple, however [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9005.32s)]
*  many, I remember it was a couple of months. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9009.119999999999s)]
*  Would you like cover your mouth and then you'd all run outside, hold your breath? [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9010.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah, kind of. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9014.4s)]
*  I would just hang outside for a couple of months, go to the dog park and see people [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9015.16s)]
*  there and stuff like that. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9018.439999999999s)]
*  It was that, you know, that initial stage where, cause you know, you weren't in LA then [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9019.92s)]
*  no. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9024.8s)]
*  So it was wild. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9025.039999999999s)]
*  I was in LA. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9026.519999999999s)]
*  Were you in LA at the beginning of COVID? [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9027.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9029.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9029.4s)]
*  I moved during COVID. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9030.24s)]
*  Cause I did, I came on your show in LA when it was at the beginning of COVID. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9031.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9033.96s)]
*  That's right. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9034.4s)]
*  And the second time I came on your show was here. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9035.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9038.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9038.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9038.64s)]
*  Okay. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9038.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9039.0s)]
*  That was like... [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9039.599999999999s)]
*  Cause remember how they were like... [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9039.96s)]
*  You're avoiding the question. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9040.8s)]
*  Remember how there were military helicopters going over? [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9042.16s)]
*  You're avoiding my question. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9044.279999999999s)]
*  How long did you go without being around people? [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9045.32s)]
*  I mean, a couple of months or something like that, you know? [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9049.359999999999s)]
*  How many months? [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9051.279999999999s)]
*  Like, well, couples two, a few is three or more. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9052.72s)]
*  Uh, maybe it was three. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9056.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9058.560000000001s)]
*  You sure it wasn't more? [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9058.92s)]
*  Uh, well then I started doing the van thing. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9060.560000000001s)]
*  So there was nobody where I was going anyway. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9062.560000000001s)]
*  So I had an excuse, you know? [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9064.28s)]
*  Right. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9065.480000000001s)]
*  I was on a camping trip. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9065.720000000001s)]
*  But still being with no people. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9066.400000000001s)]
*  How long were you with no people then? [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9068.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9071.560000000001s)]
*  I mean, it was a few months for sure. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9071.76s)]
*  I'm not, I mean, it wasn't... [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9073.12s)]
*  But all told, how many months do you think you spent of that year without being around people? [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9073.92s)]
*  Well, first of all, one thing that's interesting about it as I happened to be single at the time. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9078.08s)]
*  Are you a lawyer? [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9082.2s)]
*  The way you're answering these questions, you're like a goddamn lawyer. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9083.2s)]
*  Well, it's a bit, it is a bit embarrassing, I guess, to think that I was isolated, but I also found it kind of fun. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9085.96s)]
*  Right. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9093.4s)]
*  But how long? [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9093.679999999998s)]
*  I guess like, like it was about three or four months or something like that. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9095.56s)]
*  But then the van, you weren't around people then too. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9098.48s)]
*  No, but that was... [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9102.039999999999s)]
*  That's isolation too. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9103.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9104.32s)]
*  And that, but that was, that was more like I was enjoying going out into nature by myself and making videos. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9104.56s)]
*  But you were still by yourself with no people for how long? [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9108.279999999999s)]
*  I'd go for a couple of weeks and I'd go back to LA and I'd be in LA and uh... [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9110.56s)]
*  And you'd be around people. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9114.24s)]
*  I'd recharge a bit and be around people a little bit and then I'd go back out again. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9115.24s)]
*  And then, and then as things died down as they did, you know, I started being around people like everybody else. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9118.64s)]
*  I couldn't imagine going months without being around people. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9125.44s)]
*  Well, the thing that was weird about it was I, you know, you know, I'm not married. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9128.56s)]
*  I was single. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9133.76s)]
*  I didn't have a girlfriend at the time. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9134.24s)]
*  So like I actually... [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9135.64s)]
*  No responsibility, true freedom. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9137.32s)]
*  That's what made it weird was I didn't, you know, I didn't, I could imagine if I had a girlfriend at the time, we just said, okay, we're going to isolate together. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9138.84s)]
*  Now you're just with your significant other. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9144.16s)]
*  Here I was, okay, I'm going to isolate and I don't have a significant other at the time. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9147.0s)]
*  So it was like actually the first time where I've ever had this sort of self-imposed or whatever maybe was imposed on us, you know, or I took the, took it. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9151.8s)]
*  I took it as an opportunity to be by myself and go out and make videos in the desert and go to these really crazy remote places. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9161.8s)]
*  And I would seek out places where there wasn't going to be other vans and other people. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9167.92s)]
*  But when you were out in the desert, a lot of times you'd go to somewhere and there'd be other people out in their vans and you'd hang out and have beers with people out in the desert and hang out. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9171.2s)]
*  And then you go think of a more remote place. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9177.88s)]
*  And I started discovering some amazing places like that, that, you know, the rabbit hole you go down when you, you know, COVID aside, isolation aside, just going out into the American Southwest in a camper van that's self-sufficient is pretty wild, the stuff that's out there. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9179.92s)]
*  I mean, I think I probably talked about Chaco Canyon the last time I was here, because I think I'd just gone there in New Mexico, which is, you know, Pueblo Native American ruins of, it's essentially like a stone ruins of a city that was built in the year 875, 875. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9199.64s)]
*  And it's like Machu Picchu level type city that they didn't even discover until the 1950s because it was buried. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9218.08s)]
*  And now they've, you know, and it's in this beautiful, it's on the Navajo Nation Reserve, you know, on the Navajo land. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9224.76s)]
*  And you feel this sort of, I felt sort of somewhat shocked, I guess, that there's all this stuff out there that you don't really hear talked about constantly. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9235.96s)]
*  Like I hear about Machu Picchu. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9248.8s)]
*  Somebody brings that up once a week. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9250.88s)]
*  Nobody's ever brought up. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9253.199999999999s)]
*  Who are you talking to brings up Machu Picchu once a week? [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9254.04s)]
*  I don't know, it just comes up a lot. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9256.36s)]
*  People talk, it was probably you, I think, you know, you talk about the pyramids. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9258.04s)]
*  I rarely talk about Machu Picchu. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9261.0s)]
*  You know, talk about the pyramids a lot, right? [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9262.68s)]
*  Yeah, I talk about that a lot. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9263.960000000001s)]
*  Like, you know, talking about, you know, ancient cultures that have built these incredible structures, right? [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9264.92s)]
*  And right here in New Mexico, just up the road from here, you know, like 11 hour drive from here, right? [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9272.36s)]
*  You know, just outside of Albuquerque, Navajo Nation, there's this, it's a huge canyon, completely empty, no one there. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9277.08s)]
*  And so it's this realization that there was a civilization there that was, and they've studied this place quite extensively. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9284.68s)]
*  In fact, Mike Judge, you know, from Beavis and Butthead, his father, Mike Judge grew up in New Mexico. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9295.48s)]
*  I found this out after the fact. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9301.08s)]
*  So I started looking up information about Chaco Canyon to try to learn a bit more about it. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9302.64s)]
*  And his father, James Judge is his name, was one of the predominant researchers of this particular archaeological site, right? [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9307.28s)]
*  And so he wrote this book about it and they dived, you know, he spent his life diving into details. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9315.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9320.68s)]
*  That's so fucking cool. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9321.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9322.28s)]
*  So I spent like, you know, a day there. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9322.48s)]
*  And there was no one there with you? [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9325.24s)]
*  I was there with Charlie, yeah. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9326.72s)]
*  And just you and Charlie? [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9328.039999999999s)]
*  Just me and Charlie. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9329.36s)]
*  And I shot a video, there's this video on my YouTube channel too. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9330.08s)]
*  I was doing all this for my YouTube channel. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9334.2s)]
*  I was really getting to the filmmaking side of it. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9335.480000000001s)]
*  You know, I had my drone, I was going out and filming stuff and all these. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9337.2s)]
*  Isn't it crazy? [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9340.52s)]
*  You're just allowed to walk around there? [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9341.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's wild. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9343.2s)]
*  And see that part, the bottom left, see that sort of structure there? [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9344.12s)]
*  So that was a five story building at one point. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9347.800000000001s)]
*  And you can go walking through there and there's wood that they've used as beams that's still like within the, within the, it's a bit [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9350.24s)]
*  petrified wood or whatever. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9359.16s)]
*  It's within the stone. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9360.08s)]
*  And, you know, it's wood from the year 875 to 1100. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9362.12s)]
*  It went like the people left there in 1100 because of a drought. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9367.44s)]
*  Like they were gone before Columbus, right? [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9373.28s)]
*  See the wood there? [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9375.28s)]
*  That's from eight, you know, between 875 and 1175, whenever that was particularly built. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9376.6s)]
*  So, and this area, they've done all these studies of this area. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9381.64s)]
*  So they know like, like they found macaw feathers, speaking of my old pal Rex, they found macaw feathers there. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9385.28s)]
*  Now macaws are from the furthest north as Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9391.08s)]
*  So they knew that people were coming from Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, Peninsula Mexico up here to trade with them. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9396.32s)]
*  And they found, you know, evidence of all these different things that sort of indicated that people were coming from as far north as [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9403.84s)]
*  Canada, as far south as South America to come to this area. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9414.32s)]
*  And that whole Chaco Canyon area, once you get in there, is like this, I don't know, not to get all like, you know, voodoo about it. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9419.0s)]
*  But, you know, when you talk, people talk about Sedona and there's the energy there, you feel this sort of, and it may be just because it's so beautiful and it's so quiet. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9431.24s)]
*  And it's this natural kind of amphitheater where it's silent and the wind is dead. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9438.88s)]
*  And then you're just all alone and you're walking through this structure. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9443.96s)]
*  I share the fascination that you have for the pyramids. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9450.08s)]
*  I want to go there someday. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9452.32s)]
*  I think it would be, if I could snap my fingers right now and just be somewhere, it would be the pyramids. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9453.279999999999s)]
*  I'd like to go to the pyramids someday. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9457.92s)]
*  I've never been there. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9459.08s)]
*  So here's me walking through it with my camera. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9460.08s)]
*  And so you're walking through this, you know, by yourself. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9462.08s)]
*  And, and you're just going like, wow, like there was all this stuff going on here. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9465.6s)]
*  And apparently they've, they've determined this was like a meeting place for, for people from all over North America that would kind of come here and share information. [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9470.92s)]
*  They actually believe that there was a, you know, sort of almost like a festival type atmosphere that would happen there where people come and trade and share information and all this stuff. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9483.12s)]
*  Are there similar Native American construction sites like this? [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9493.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9497.44s)]
*  So then you go down this rabbit hole and you realize that they're all over the place. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9497.72s)]
*  So then there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, I mean, there's, there's many of them. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9501.44s)]
*  There's up in, there's these ones called the cliff dwellings, which are that, that one there is actually, this one here is actually later. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9505.76s)]
*  That's, that's post-Columbian. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9515.44s)]
*  This one, this was a Spanish, probably, I think this one's built around 1500. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9516.8s)]
*  Similar construction style. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9522.84s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9524.04s)]
*  It's amazing, right? [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9524.84s)]
*  When you look at it, they go, they were building stuff in 800 before Europeans had come here using the same kind of building techniques as that. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9525.52s)]
*  And, and it's weird when you're there and you're touching it and it's like solid and you're going, wow, that's actually, so they've got these cliff dwellings. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9534.16s)]
*  There's lots of them where they've built into the, the cliffs of Colorado. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9540.84s)]
*  Yeah, those are cliff dwellings. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9547.8s)]
*  I went to one of those ones. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9549.08s)]
*  There's one, there's one that's called the Gila, Gila. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9550.52s)]
*  It's a Gila National Forest. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9553.560000000001s)]
*  It's a New Mexico. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9556.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's right on the, yeah, it's up in the border. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9557.04s)]
*  It's up in New Mexico. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9559.640000000001s)]
*  I think, yeah. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9560.52s)]
*  And that's a wild story there because it's a national park, you know, and, so you go walk around there and that one, there were a couple of people walking around. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9561.400000000001s)]
*  They drive down. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9572.560000000001s)]
*  There's a, you know, people. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9573.2s)]
*  Did they dig these caves or these caves always exist? [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9574.480000000001s)]
*  They're natural caves that they've kind of sort of utilized as, as, you know, they built the walls up around the bottom of it. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9577.8s)]
*  And yeah, they've done something to it. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9584.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9586.64s)]
*  And so this place is wild. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9587.119999999999s)]
*  This, and the stories you pick up when you go to these places, cause then you go down the rabbit hole, you start reading about it and you go, wow, this is, I never knew about this. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9588.72s)]
*  They didn't just, they, no American had ever been there until the mid 1800s because it was Apache territory. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9595.08s)]
*  And if you went there, the Apache, you know, would kill you before 18, whatever it was. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9607.039999999999s)]
*  I forget the date, but it was like, you know, the 1700s, early 1800s. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9612.519999999999s)]
*  And this place, I haven't been to this place yet, but I want to go here. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9616.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9620.119999999999s)]
*  And, and yeah, I talk about like, when you started thinking about, you know, UFOs and stuff, you just, you look at some of these petroglyphs and you go, what's that? [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9621.0s)]
*  There's a lot of petroglyphs out there too. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9628.48s)]
*  What's that? [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9630.279999999999s)]
*  That looks kind of like a spaceship or something, you know? [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9631.0s)]
*  But, so that's honestly the real reason I was out there in the van by myself so long was because I got addicted to it. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9634.24s)]
*  I mean, I was just, and that's actually kind of why I ended up moving. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9642.359999999999s)]
*  I was like, I love being out here alone by myself with my van and my camera so much. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9644.599999999999s)]
*  I want to live in the country again. [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9648.48s)]
*  And how'd you find the spot in Canada? [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9649.88s)]
*  Well, I got kind of lucky. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9653.8s)]
*  I just kind of, I, I, I just honestly just started looking on the internet, you know, just like looking at real estate listings. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9655.16s)]
*  And I started looking for a farm near my hometown and, and I just kept looking and searching every day. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9662.76s)]
*  And I was lucky that it just kind of fell in my lap right at the right place, right time. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9668.52s)]
*  My house sold in LA immediately. [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9674.32s)]
*  And I was, I drove back and that place I put in an offer and I got it and it's just, you know, just all worked out and it all worked out. [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9676.880000000001s)]
*  So, and how long you been out there now? [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9683.6s)]
*  Be coming up on three years in July. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9686.68s)]
*  So it looks like you're having fun. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9688.52s)]
*  I'm loving it. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9690.04s)]
*  The videos of you online are very interesting. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9690.92s)]
*  I'm like, look at Tom Green. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9692.880000000001s)]
*  I'm enjoying it. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9694.64s)]
*  I'm living in the woods by himself. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9695.36s)]
*  It's like, there's a lot to do that is stuff that falls outside of anything that would fall under the category of what I would consider to be work. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9697.72s)]
*  Right. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9710.64s)]
*  But it is work, but it's different work. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9711.12s)]
*  It's like, I've got to feed the chickens or we built a fence this year for the, for the, for the mule and the donkey. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9712.92s)]
*  So it's this patent rail fence, you know, that is made out of cedar. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9721.0s)]
*  That is literally these hundred year old cedar rail fences that are on the property that have fallen down in the woods and, you know, have gone by the not used anymore. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9725.4s)]
*  We went back with a fence builder, you know, and everybody out there is, you know, in the country is a guy whose family is traditional fence builders whose grandfather built these fences. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9736.080000000002s)]
*  We went and salvaged all this wood and then built, built new fences out of them. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9747.2s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9752.0s)]
*  And so you're kind of, you know, it's nice to find something to do that is a you're outside, you're getting exercise. [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9752.6s)]
*  And you feel like you're actually doing something. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9763.560000000001s)]
*  I feel like you're doing something. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9765.84s)]
*  And, and it's the first time I said this earlier, I'm never going to leave this place. [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9767.64s)]
*  Like it's the first time I've ever lived somewhere where I know I'm never going to sell it and leave. [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9771.8s)]
*  So every, every step of my life, as like everyone, as you're growing up, you got your first apartment, you know, how long am I going to be here? [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9776.44s)]
*  Till I move here? [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9783.24s)]
*  Right. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9783.68s)]
*  How long am I going to be here? [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9783.92s)]
*  So now I'm just kind of like, now I just in my head, I have like, oh, I'd like to maybe build a log cabin someday and on the back woods, you know, so that's sort of one thing I'm kind of like kind of thinking about. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9785.2s)]
*  How I want to build a log cabin, like the way the, you know, the, my, the house itself that I'm in was built in 1857 and it's, and it's a log house. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9795.76s)]
*  So then you can see the. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9805.84s)]
*  Do you have photos of the house? [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9807.800000000001s)]
*  There's there's yeah, there's on my YouTube channel, there's a tour of the house. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9809.800000000001s)]
*  I haven't really, there's, there's not a full tour, but I think if you can see some of the logs on the YouTube channel, I did a couple little sort of sample podcast where you can see the wood in the background. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9814.4s)]
*  That's fucking. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9825.0s)]
*  This is just, this was last week. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9826.0s)]
*  You live in a log house from the 1800s of the wood burning stove behind you. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9827.36s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9831.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9831.880000000001s)]
*  And yeah, so it's like, and it's, it's interesting. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9832.32s)]
*  So, you know, you start to realize, you know, I'm doomsday prepping in the van, you know, like, oh, I have, I could be self-sufficient in this van. [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9834.44s)]
*  Well, I also, you know, and again, it's, it's, it's fun, but it's also kind of very, uh, functional. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9841.68s)]
*  Like I have unlimited fuel. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9848.36s)]
*  Okay. [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9850.560000000001s)]
*  Cause there's, there's wood falling in the forest forever. [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9850.960000000001s)]
*  And, and, and I, every summer you can go out and I've got a wood splitter, right? [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9854.04s)]
*  Like a, it's a gas powered wood splitter and you, you know, you chainsaw up the logs, you drop them in the wood splitter, splits them. [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9858.8s)]
*  And it's sort of an efficient way of getting firewood basically. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9866.64s)]
*  So they'll never run out of wood out there. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9870.36s)]
*  The house has actually got propane, uh, sort of a furnace as well. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9872.2s)]
*  So it's runs on propane and the propane truck comes every, you know, there's no natural gas or [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9876.08s)]
*  anything running into the house to heat it. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9880.84s)]
*  So you have a propane truck comes every couple of months and fills up this propane tank in the winter. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9882.2s)]
*  But, uh, you know, if, oh shit, you know, shit hits the fan and the propane truck doesn't show up, you know, I can still heat the house fully with wood. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9887.72s)]
*  There's two wood stoves. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9897.2s)]
*  Um, do you have solar? [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9898.84s)]
*  I have solar. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9901.24s)]
*  Uh, there's a solar system that was there actually that, but it doesn't actually, not actually connected to the house, but it's connected to the grid. [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9902.52s)]
*  And it's actually selling energy back to the power company. [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9909.84s)]
*  But not to you? [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9913.4s)]
*  Not to me. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9914.4s)]
*  No, it's, it's, uh, it's, uh, what kind of scams that? [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9914.880000000001s)]
*  Well, it's paying me. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9917.68s)]
*  It pays me. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9918.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9919.68s)]
*  I get paid. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9919.84s)]
*  It pays you to not be self-sufficient, to not be connected. [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9920.2s)]
*  Well, I know if shit hits the fan, I can unhook it and plug it into the lights. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9922.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9925.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9925.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9925.84s)]
*  I could. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9925.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9926.24s)]
*  Do you? [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9926.48s)]
*  And I actually know I have lots of solar though, outside of that system. [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9926.800000000001s)]
*  I have, uh, I have, uh, actually, you know, the van has solar panels on the roof and there's, uh, [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9929.4s)]
*  That's for electronics? [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9936.6s)]
*  It's for electronics. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9938.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9938.92s)]
*  And you can't really use solar for, I've learned all this from the van. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9939.64s)]
*  So I work with these guys who've been really cool, battle-born batteries, they're called, [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9942.4s)]
*  and they are, uh, make these batteries, lithium batteries, right? [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9947.039999999999s)]
*  They make them for boats. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9951.88s)]
*  They make them for now off-grid houses. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9952.8s)]
*  And, and, uh, and so I have like a couple of bunkies, you know, like the one I built [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9955.84s)]
*  and one that we kind of set up. [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9961.88s)]
*  It's like a prefabricated building that we put back in the woods and with a wood stove [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9964.36s)]
*  in it and, uh, you know, this, this, uh, trailer that I have solar panels on that butterfly [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9968.4s)]
*  out that I can take anywhere on the property, which has these battle-born batteries in it. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9976.16s)]
*  It's constantly charging. [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9979.88s)]
*  So I do have some solar and the barn as well. [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9981.24s)]
*  So the barn I have, and these guys helped me set this up. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9983.68s)]
*  It's really cool. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9988.279999999999s)]
*  Like it's, uh, I mean, I jokingly say the podcast that I'm going to do in the barn is [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9989.0s)]
*  going to be, I'm sure it isn't, but I'm saying it's the first solar powered barn [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9994.48s)]
*  cast. [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9998.16s)]
*  Okay. [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9998.64s)]
*  Maybe, maybe, I don't know if there's one, but it, but it's like, cause there's no, the [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=9999.2s)]
*  barn has no power running to it. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10002.76s)]
*  It's off-grid. [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10004.039999999999s)]
*  Uh, but we have, you know, it's, you know, 200 yards from the house. [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10005.119999999999s)]
*  Uh, but we've up in the loft got this battery lithium battery array, solar panels that [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10008.76s)]
*  charge the batteries. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10016.2s)]
*  And then up in there, I can run all my cameras, lights, everything. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10017.08s)]
*  And, uh, [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10021.44s)]
*  Don't the batteries degrade on those things? [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10022.88s)]
*  Um, like solar panels. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10025.16s)]
*  So lithium batteries have a really good life to them. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10026.76s)]
*  Um, um, but they eventually degrade. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10030.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10033.24s)]
*  It might be 10 years or something like that. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10033.439999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure, but it's, it's the, that's the, the lithium batteries is kind of newer [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10035.08s)]
*  tech. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10039.439999999999s)]
*  Like it's like, it's, that was the thing that kind of, you know, when I, when, when [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10039.84s)]
*  COVID happened, I want, I want to get a van and go in the desert. [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10048.56s)]
*  So then I, I, I, you know, I figured out who was making these vans and, uh, I, I, I, [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10050.96s)]
*  then I found out about the battery systems and then I was like, Oh, like you can just [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10059.48s)]
*  have a regular, you know, plug in the van. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10063.599999999999s)]
*  You can plug in your camera and charge your camera batteries. [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10066.16s)]
*  You can run your laptop. [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10068.359999999999s)]
*  You can phone your, you charge your phone indefinitely. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10069.72s)]
*  Um, and you know, spending, you know, so many years of my life running around making [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10073.839999999998s)]
*  goofy videos, you know, when we were doing the Tom Green show and stuff, you know, you'd [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10077.72s)]
*  go on the road and then you have to go back to the hotel at night to charge your camera [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10081.519999999999s)]
*  batteries. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10084.56s)]
*  Right. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10084.96s)]
*  The idea that you can go into the middle of the desert and just film indefinitely and charge [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10085.439999999999s)]
*  your camera batteries because the sun is recharging these batteries. [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10089.279999999999s)]
*  It's pretty dope. [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10092.08s)]
*  It was dope. [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10092.96s)]
*  I built a recording studio in the van. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10093.519999999999s)]
*  I was making music and beats out there and just kind of getting into it. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10095.519999999999s)]
*  But so it's, uh, how long did it take before you felt comfortable around people again? [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10100.24s)]
*  Uh, I was ready to get around people again. [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10104.84s)]
*  Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty much. [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10107.960000000001s)]
*  Uh, you know, I was, I mean, it's, you know, it's funny after I came on the show last [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10109.6s)]
*  time and we talked about this, like there's a general perception in the world all of a [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10116.92s)]
*  sudden that I was living in my van. [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10126.880000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10129.04s)]
*  Which I wasn't actually living in my van. [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10129.36s)]
*  I might have been responsible for that perception. [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10131.04s)]
*  No, it was hilarious. [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10132.24s)]
*  Oh, I heard you're living in a van now. [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10133.599999999999s)]
*  People would say to me, I'm not living in a van. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10135.279999999999s)]
*  I'm going camping and making videos in the desert. [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10136.96s)]
*  No, but you were living in a van. [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10139.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10140.32s)]
*  I was, I was, I was just had the ability to live in a very nice house. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10140.56s)]
*  You wanted to. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10143.599999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10144.119999999999s)]
*  I wasn't actually, no, it was funny though. [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10144.48s)]
*  It was, but, but it was, I mean, I'd hope I, I, I mean, sometimes, you know, you think [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10147.119999999999s)]
*  you are and you go, am I a loser? [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10152.039999999999s)]
*  But like people would sort of say it to me. [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10153.519999999999s)]
*  Like they were sad. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10157.119999999999s)]
*  Like they were sad. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10157.759999999998s)]
*  Oh, I heard you're living in a van now. [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10158.64s)]
*  Because you could be, like most people don't live in a van on purpose. [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10160.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10163.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10163.32s)]
*  So it was kind of like the Chris Farley sketch. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10163.96s)]
*  I am living in the van down by the river. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10166.16s)]
*  And, and it was funny how, I mean, again, the power of, of social media and the size [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10168.52s)]
*  of your audience, you know, it permeated out there pretty big that like pretty much [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10175.279999999999s)]
*  everybody I meet thinks I'm living in a van down by the river now. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10181.6s)]
*  Well, that's like how we describe Hans Kim. [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10185.96s)]
*  Hans Kim used to be living in a van. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10187.76s)]
*  Like, look at him now. [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10189.84s)]
*  You know, no one goes from, you know, Tom Green to living in a van unless things have [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10191.400000000001s)]
*  gone horribly wrong, except you. [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10197.08s)]
*  You did it on purpose. [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10199.24s)]
*  And it was, it was really driven by the fact that this power system allows me to go make [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10200.76s)]
*  videos in weird places and stay there. [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10206.36s)]
*  You know, like these places, Chaco Canyon, it's not easy to get there. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10208.52s)]
*  I mean, it's, it's easy enough. [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10211.76s)]
*  I mean, it's two and a half hours out of maybe, no, maybe it was more than that out [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10213.44s)]
*  of Albuquerque. I forget the distance, but it was quite the drive and you're driving [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10217.32s)]
*  through. It's not on a direct route to anything. [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10220.08s)]
*  And then once you get to the perimeter of it, really bad dirt road that you got to go [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10223.039999999999s)]
*  down, it's not maintained properly. [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10227.36s)]
*  I suspect that in some ways it almost feels suspicious that like, do they want to keep [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10229.48s)]
*  people out of here for some reason? [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10233.24s)]
*  Why is it not talked about more? [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10234.44s)]
*  I mean, I sort of discussed this a little bit on the video. [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10235.72s)]
*  Like, it seems strange that it's not more celebrated by, you know, our society, that [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10238.32s)]
*  there's stuff out there like that. [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10242.92s)]
*  That's, it's, it's incredible and amazing and beautiful. [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10244.039999999999s)]
*  It doesn't have a good publicist. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10246.68s)]
*  That's all it is. [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10248.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10249.16s)]
*  You know, because there's certain things that have like Machu Picchu. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10249.92s)]
*  It's a great publicist. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10252.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think it forces people to confront the idea that, you know, what happened to [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10253.68s)]
*  the Native Americans in this country too, and in North America and Canada, you know, [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10257.48s)]
*  like we weren't that nice to them, were we? [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10260.76s)]
*  So, so it makes us have to think about what happened. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10262.640000000001s)]
*  But you were just saying that that place was abandoned in the 1100s. [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10265.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, exactly. [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10267.960000000001s)]
*  So that has nothing to do with sure. [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10268.960000000001s)]
*  But just in general, just talking about pre-European. [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10270.28s)]
*  Not now, right? [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10275.68s)]
*  But, you know, I think there was probably a period of time when, you know, they were [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10276.76s)]
*  settling Europeans, not just America, Canada, too, right? [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10282.6s)]
*  Settling North America where they didn't really want to acknowledge that there was [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10286.72s)]
*  civilization here before, you know, it was, it was more like they were, you know. [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10292.16s)]
*  Eminent domain. [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10298.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10299.0s)]
*  Yeah, they were trying to claim it. [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10299.24s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10300.960000000001s)]
*  I think there's definitely that. [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10302.16s)]
*  There's a guilt attached to the way people feel about Native Americans and also the [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10303.16s)]
*  just the understanding of what a reservation is. [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10308.36s)]
*  You pushed them into this area that sucks and forced them to live there. [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10311.88s)]
*  And all of their traditional land is gone. [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10315.36s)]
*  It's all been absorbed by these people that just got here a couple of hundred years ago, [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10319.44s)]
*  which is nuts. [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10322.68s)]
*  It's so hard to imagine how different this place we're sitting in right now was just [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10324.08s)]
*  200 years ago. [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10329.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10330.16s)]
*  I mean, they find these all over the place. [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10330.84s)]
*  A friend of mine has a ranch. [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10334.32s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10336.48s)]
*  That's a real Comanche arrowhead. [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10337.960000000001s)]
*  That's a big one, too. [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10340.28s)]
*  That's probably some something they used to shoot a large animal with. [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10341.36s)]
*  Wow. [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10346.16s)]
*  That's probably elk. [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10346.76s)]
*  They had elk out here. [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10349.08s)]
*  They used to have elk were in like most states. [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10350.2s)]
*  They had always a lot of deer out here, a lot of different animals, but that's a big [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10353.2s)]
*  ass arrowhead. [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10358.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10360.0s)]
*  See, and it's like... [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10360.92s)]
*  Because there's some small ones, too, that they find, just find the little tiny ones [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10361.880000000001s)]
*  they might have used for like small game birds and things like that. [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10364.72s)]
*  But that's a big fucker. [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10367.880000000001s)]
*  See, I personally, the second I touched this, I felt sort of a sense of kind of shivers. [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10369.72s)]
*  Wild, right? [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10376.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10376.72s)]
*  I feel like, and maybe it's my mind just thinking about the history of it, but there's, [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10377.08s)]
*  people talk about energy and I was like, is it? [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10382.64s)]
*  I used to hear people say when they go to Sedona, the energy there is amazing. [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10385.0s)]
*  And I'm like, what are you talking about the energy? [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10388.36s)]
*  Right. [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10389.64s)]
*  But then when you go to these places, is it because you're just alone and you're relaxed [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10390.24s)]
*  and you're thinking about it so much, but it's like you touch this and you go, Hey, [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10394.960000000001s)]
*  you think somebody actually like carved this, right? [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10397.880000000001s)]
*  Somebody made this and then they survived with this, right? [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10400.56s)]
*  It's like however many thousand years ago or whatever. [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10404.16s)]
*  And you go, Whoa, that's incredible. [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10406.56s)]
*  You know? [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10408.44s)]
*  They napped that thing and made it sharp. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10408.6s)]
*  And they did all these crazy techniques that they had learned how to make these fucking [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10410.880000000001s)]
*  things. [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10415.960000000001s)]
*  And then they hunted with it. [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10416.28s)]
*  And these people lived here forever until these Europeans just came in like a wave of [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10418.0s)]
*  locusts. [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10422.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10423.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10424.24s)]
*  So when you, and so that's the battery system allows you, you know, the van and the [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10424.76s)]
*  self-sufficiency of it. [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10432.12s)]
*  Cause normally if you drove there, let's say you drive six hours to get somewhere, [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10433.880000000001s)]
*  right? [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10437.52s)]
*  Right. [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10437.960000000001s)]
*  And then the sun's going down and there's no hotels nearby and there's nothing. [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10438.84s)]
*  So you're going to, you've got a camp in a tent or something. [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10441.8s)]
*  So then it's like not comfortable and you don't have, you don't have, [[02:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10444.16s)]
*  You're in your van. [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10446.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10447.72s)]
*  So now you can drive there and stay for a while. [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10448.199999999999s)]
*  And then it's like, you just have to make sure you have gas and water. [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10451.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10454.48s)]
*  It's a different experience because now you're waking up to the sunrise over that and [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10454.76s)]
*  making coffee by yourself. [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10461.599999999999s)]
*  And thank God you didn't run into like the Manson family or something out there. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10463.359999999999s)]
*  I had a few moments of, of, uh, wacky people. [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10466.84s)]
*  I had a few moments of, I don't know if they were wacky people, but your mind starts [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10471.0s)]
*  telling you that you got to be careful. [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10474.32s)]
*  You know, like there was a moment, uh, you know, there was a moment out in the [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10475.84s)]
*  desert where I, um, you know, was all alone out there in a, uh, a truck, uh, [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10479.72s)]
*  so on the Mexican border actually, and, uh, trucks coming from Mexico towards me. [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10485.64s)]
*  And there's, you know, there's signs out in the desert when you get to this, this [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10491.4s)]
*  was actually in the Arizona, Mexico border. [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10494.8s)]
*  It's this place called the Cabezza Prieta wilderness area, which is a decommissioned [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10497.519999999999s)]
*  section of the former Barry F Goldwater Air Force Base test range where they [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10502.4s)]
*  would test bombs in world war II. [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10506.68s)]
*  Right. [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10508.44s)]
*  And, uh, and, uh, and, uh, it's like really beautiful, like this, the [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10509.24s)]
*  cactuses and, uh, you want cigar? [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10515.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10517.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10518.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10518.279999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10519.72s)]
*  I bet you that's a good one too. [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10520.359999999999s)]
*  I'm sure it would be smoking some swisher sweets or something like that. [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10521.72s)]
*  It's not a, it's not a century Sam or, uh, Philly's blunt. [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10524.92s)]
*  What, what, what are they? [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10529.44s)]
*  It's a company called foundation cigars. [[02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10530.68s)]
*  They actually made us our own cigar. [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10532.24s)]
*  It's got a JRE logo on it. [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10534.32s)]
*  Nice. [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10536.119999999999s)]
*  They're really good though. [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10536.48s)]
*  I was skeptical. [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10537.72s)]
*  I was like this company, but it's actually my man, Nick from foundation, really [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10538.56s)]
*  no cigars and, um, the whole deal goes down to Nicaragua later as well. [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10544.32s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10551.72s)]
*  You know how it works? [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10552.4s)]
*  Push down on that black thing that yeah, there you go. [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10553.039999999999s)]
*  So what was the most sketchy of encounters while you're out there doing that van life? [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10561.48s)]
*  Well, you got it. [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10568.64s)]
*  What was the sketchiest? [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10574.72s)]
*  There was never anything where I actually was in danger, but there was, there was [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10577.48s)]
*  the feeling of being in danger. [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10580.84s)]
*  So, well, actually it might've been in danger. [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10582.32s)]
*  It was definitely a feeling of being in danger. [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10584.56s)]
*  Uh, you know, so the vans coming up to you. [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10587.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was like a truck truck. [[02:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10590.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10591.8s)]
*  You're in the van. [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10592.039999999999s)]
*  And there was, there was like, you know, I could write it off in my head. [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10592.52s)]
*  If I'm trying to be, you know, positive, they were hunters, but they, you know, [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10594.96s)]
*  they didn't necessarily look like hunters to me. [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10599.96s)]
*  They were, they were not in hunting gear, but they all had guns. [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10602.32s)]
*  They had, but they were rifles. [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10605.08s)]
*  They weren't, they weren't like, you know, assault rifles. [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10606.16s)]
*  They were hunting rifles. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10609.279999999999s)]
*  And so they could have been hunting. [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10610.359999999999s)]
*  Uh, and there was four, four guys and they, you know, they were [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10612.08s)]
*  openly brandishing their rifles. [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10615.32s)]
*  No, they were sitting all four of them. [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10616.84s)]
*  This is what was weird for them. [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10620.119999999999s)]
*  You know, there was probably hunters who probably going hunting. [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10621.24s)]
*  I, I, but they were sitting like this and they were sitting like this [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10622.72s)]
*  and their rifles were standing. [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10625.439999999999s)]
*  They were holding the rifles like that. [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10627.64s)]
*  So I, I kind of, I kind of assumed that they were going around and looking [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10629.88s)]
*  for a deer or something like that. [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10632.84s)]
*  But, but it was, you know, when you're all alone out there and you see a truck [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10634.0s)]
*  coming towards you and there's no one around, no one's going to hear anything. [[02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10640.119999999999s)]
*  You know, you get a little nervous. [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10644.4s)]
*  So I got, I did get in the van and I locked the door and I'm in the van. [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10645.32s)]
*  I'm looking out of the van and they pulled up by the van and they're [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10647.56s)]
*  looking at my van and I see the guns in the van and I'm like, okay. [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10650.279999999999s)]
*  Are they speaking Spanish? [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10653.56s)]
*  Well, they were, you know, they were, you know, whatever, 50 feet, a hundred feet away. [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10654.96s)]
*  Do you hear any words at all? [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10658.68s)]
*  No, no, I hadn't, I was, I was locked in the van, you know, hiding. [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10660.6s)]
*  I was hiding in the van. [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10665.48s)]
*  It just turned 50 years old. [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10666.6s)]
*  So they never got close to you. [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10667.6s)]
*  No, no. [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10669.24s)]
*  Then, then they drove away, but there's this sort of, uh, you know, five minutes [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10669.72s)]
*  of watching the truck get closer. [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10675.16s)]
*  And so you go to the Cabeza Prieta wilderness area and it's along the Arizona [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10677.039999999999s)]
*  Mexico border and you know what the border's like. [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10680.279999999999s)]
*  So, so, you know, it's, there's a lot of, of, uh, you know, human trafficking and [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10682.359999999999s)]
*  drug smuggling going on there. [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10686.92s)]
*  And as, as well as immigration going on there and, and people coming across the [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10688.4s)]
*  border illegally and all this stuff. [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10692.16s)]
*  And so there was actually a sign when you drive in there that says danger, human [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10693.92s)]
*  smuggling, drug smuggling, do not travel alone. [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10698.84s)]
*  Okay. [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10701.64s)]
*  So I still go cause I'm with Charlie, right? [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10702.039999999999s)]
*  So I'm cool. [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10703.679999999998s)]
*  But, uh, so I, I, you know, but the side, I got a picture of the science. [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10704.480000000001s)]
*  It was kind of interesting, but it's also, [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10707.76s)]
*  is that sign on your Instagram? [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10710.12s)]
*  Probably is. [[02:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10712.560000000001s)]
*  Y'all for sure. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10713.480000000001s)]
*  It is. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10713.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10714.2s)]
*  If you scroll back to, uh, you scroll back to, uh, whatever that was three years ago. [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10714.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10719.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10720.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10720.84s)]
*  And so, um, yeah, danger, human smuggling, drugs, smuggling, do not travel alone. [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10721.44s)]
*  Right. [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10727.08s)]
*  So I, of course, stupidly go out there and I'm camping out there for a week, but [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10727.6s)]
*  then you haven't seen anybody for five days, you know, and you're out there making [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10730.400000000001s)]
*  videos and making, you know, ambient music, you know, drinking beer. [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10733.36s)]
*  I have a fridge in there, a nice fridge in the van too. [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10738.44s)]
*  So I've got beer, I got some whiskey. [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10740.640000000001s)]
*  I'm just having a good time out there, you know, making music by myself and [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10742.44s)]
*  streaming on like some, not always, but sometimes you'd have like internet, you [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10745.6s)]
*  know, so you'd stream, you know, that was sort of a connection with the world, you [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10749.480000000001s)]
*  know, streaming live from the middle of fucking nowhere, the world's so crazy [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10755.04s)]
*  now and making beats in the middle of nowhere, but, um, yeah, so that was, that [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10758.28s)]
*  was, you know, this moment where you're going like, Oh, maybe I should, shouldn't [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10763.28s)]
*  be here by myself. [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10767.800000000001s)]
*  And, uh, and, uh, that was actually when I, that was actually what that moment was [[02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10768.76s)]

*  I got the seven shot. [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10866.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10870.0s)]

*  No, honestly, I just I honestly didn't really actually think about it. [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10873.640000000001s)]

*  Well, it's better to have that gun than no gun. [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10887.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10890.080000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10890.400000000001s)]

*  you because I was going to lots of places with bears. [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10893.880000000001s)]
*  And so I figured it would be good protection for bears too, because I was [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10896.44s)]
*  going up into like the, you know, places in New Mexico where there's bears. [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10899.160000000002s)]
*  And I go hiking by myself and, you know, you want to lug a shotgun around with [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10903.080000000002s)]
*  you all the time. [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10906.84s)]

*  And that's smart. [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10911.84s)]
*  But but also, I mean, you know, it's honestly just kind of. [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=10912.800000000001s)]

*  You were, you were out, you had figured it out before anybody. [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11048.439999999999s)]
*  You had a full internet talk show running from your house. [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11051.039999999999s)]
*  And when you had me as a guest on, it changed the course of my life. [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11054.64s)]
*  Cause it really did. [[03:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11058.72s)]
*  Cause it really was like, I remember like light bulbs just going off my, like, [[03:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11059.439999999999s)]
*  why don't I do this? [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11063.119999999999s)]
*  Why do I do that? [[03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11064.32s)]
*  I didn't have the money to do this. [[03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11064.759999999998s)]
*  You know, so I started off with a laptop. [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11067.32s)]
*  It was like the idea came out of you, man. [[03:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11070.439999999999s)]
*  Well, I just think it's the coolest thing that you, you know, shout that out and, [[03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11073.359999999999s)]
*  and say that to me. [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11080.08s)]
*  And, you know, because I, I appreciate it because it's like, it was when you came to [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11081.0s)]
*  do the show, I was stoked that you were coming to do the show. [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11084.56s)]
*  You know, that was, you know, I'm doing my little web show and you came up and did [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11088.08s)]
*  the show. [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11090.279999999999s)]
*  I was, you know, that, we had done a couple of things already, right? [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11090.56s)]
*  Like we did that celebrity pool show. [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11093.24s)]
*  Remember that? [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11095.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11096.52s)]
*  That was just kind of a, one of those. [[03:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11097.32s)]
*  That was fun. [[03:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11099.6s)]
*  Yeah, it was fun. [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11100.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11100.84s)]
*  And, uh, we did, we did a bunch of stuff. [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11101.64s)]
*  I'd always seen you around, but there it is. [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11104.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11106.6s)]
*  Bro, it was like 2007. [[03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11106.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11108.68s)]
*  We were drinking beer. [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11108.960000000001s)]
*  I was like, this guy's got it nailed. [[03:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11109.92s)]
*  We're on the internet. [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11111.68s)]
*  This is incredible. [[03:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11112.48s)]
*  I was so happy. [[03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11113.56s)]
*  I was like, this is how to do it. [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11114.960000000001s)]
*  Look how bad the video was back then. [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11116.6s)]
*  The kid is drinking with us online. [[03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11118.16s)]
*  You know, what's fun about that is like, so that's Skype. [[03:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11120.52s)]
*  We're taking calls on Skype. [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11123.08s)]
*  And so we kind of, I had some real good guys working for me. [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11125.28s)]
*  I had, you know, my, I had my Jamie there. [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11129.68s)]
*  It was like really, you didn't, you never had a Jamie bitch. [[03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11131.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11135.560000000001s)]
*  He was sort of, we were trying, we were trying to build stuff, you know? [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11136.08s)]
*  So, you know, you guys had a whole server room. [[03:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11138.92s)]
*  I remember walking to your server room going, this is crazy. [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11141.4s)]
*  I feel like I'm at like some big corporation with all these lights are [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11143.76s)]
*  going off and I'm like, Thomas is wild. [[03:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11147.52s)]
*  So there's a microwave antenna on the roof of the house. [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11150.2s)]
*  So that was the way we were able to stream. [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11152.92s)]
*  Cause back then you had to get like bonded T1 lines or something like that, [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11154.2s)]
*  which were expensive, right? [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11157.8s)]
*  I had a little bit of monetization, not much, but you were working with [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11159.6s)]
*  the company out of Denver. [[03:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11162.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11163.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11163.880000000001s)]
*  Then they were kind of the first people that I saw streaming. [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11164.08s)]
*  So I was like, how's that work? [[03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11167.16s)]
*  So I called them and then, so we had a little, like a very small budget, [[03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11168.2s)]
*  but enough to get them. [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11171.24s)]
*  What happened to those guys? [[03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11172.08s)]
*  They just kind of, I don't, not sure, actually, I don't know. [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11173.52s)]
*  I'm not sure, but they, they were, they were interesting guys. [[03:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11176.04s)]
*  And so I basically started with them and then I went off on my own and. [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11178.52s)]
*  Well, listen, I'm glad you're going to do another one because you're a very [[03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11182.44s)]
*  compelling and interesting person and you always have a really good perspective [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11185.64s)]
*  and you've led a fucking wild ass life. [[03:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11188.8s)]
*  And, and I appreciate you. [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11190.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11193.4s)]
*  Thanks for being here, brother. [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11193.76s)]
*  Thanks. [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11194.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11195.039999999999s)]
*  And I think the shows are all sold out this weekend. [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11195.48s)]
*  So I'm tough shit motherfuckers, but sometimes even if the club does sell [[03:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11198.2s)]
*  out, we have a sign, like a neon sign, this ticket's available now. [[03:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11202.96s)]
*  What happens is sometimes people can't make it babysitter cancels, who knows, [[03:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11206.76s)]
*  but every now and then even on sold out shows, there's tickets available. [[03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvLrMU2efOE&t=11211.0s)]
