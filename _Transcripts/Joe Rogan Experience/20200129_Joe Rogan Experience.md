*  Three two
*  All right, what's up, how are you brother I'm doing great it's great to be back great to see you man
*  Congratulations on win the title appreciate that fantastic achievement
*  I mean beating Gagard Musasi who's you know top flight one of the best in the in the sport for sure
*  Yeah, and to beat him and win the Bellator midway title. That's
*  Gotta make feel happy. It was surreal. It was something else and
*  When you hear the story about everything
*  Man it takes it to another level. Yeah. Well, this is why you're here. We're here to talk about that
*  and
*  What just I guess you should probably just explain what's going on
*  well, I
*  Guess I'll just kind of take you through the the order of events here
*  you know that was my tenth fight fighting for the Bellator title and
*  And
*  In all my other nine fights previously it was never required for me to get a brain scan done
*  Just due to the to the different states that I was fighting in at the time the Commission's there didn't require it
*  In the US it's California in New York and then Europe
*  You know requires a brain scan. We were originally scheduled to fight in January at the forum in California
*  The same event that just happened this past Saturday night
*  And so we were gonna fight
*  2019 at the forum in January and that fight got postponed Musasi was injured and
*  We eventually got rescheduled to fight in June in London
*  So I already had a brain scan scheduled
*  for December
*  To get approved for that fight in January, but I got the news about the fight getting cancelled
*  Like the week of that scan a couple days before so I cancelled it. I don't need to go get that done now
*  And so fast forward, you know, I basically stayed in camp the whole year
*  Training, you know with that fight on my mind all the way from November when I started the first camp for the fight in January
*  You know into the new year waiting for the the new date
*  And it was March
*  That that I got the word that we were gonna fight in June in London
*  and so, you know, I was basically training all year and I just picked right back up into camp and
*  Fast forward on into the very beginning of May
*  I
*  Was you know already a good month into like the serious camp
*  And I was just getting ready to fly to Brazil Kudachiba
*  To get into the you know, the hardest phase of camp. I was gonna be there for three weeks
*  and I
*  Had to get my MRI done, you know, and I wanted to get it done before I went to Brazil just to check it off
*  the list
*  So this was actually the week I had I had two good buddies of mine
*  Jake mapes and Sam Alvey were in Oklahoma training with me and we had a great week of training everything's going
*  really really well and
*  And it's Thursday. And so I go get my brain scan done to get that done
*  before I went to Brazil and
*  I'm in there and you know, we're we get through the whole process and
*  The machine is done. It's not you know operating anymore
*  But they haven't called me out of the room yet and I could kind of just since something was going on
*  So finally and they say okay, come on out and the radiologists with really no like no
*  Candor or like like an easy soft way of saying it was like dude
*  Have you seen your brain before?
*  There's some stuff in here. You need to see and he you know pulls me into the room and shows me on the on the screen
*  He's like pointing out these
*  You know look like little balls
*  Obviously it looked like something was wrong didn't look like a normal scan, but I'm not I don't know, you know balls like like
*  shades of
*  You know discoloration like according to the the scan itself like you could see that you know
*  It wasn't normal
*  And he didn't even know what it was at the time and he was like, let me let me look this over tonight
*  and I had my paper and you know to get signed off that everything looks clear and normal and
*  you know, and he was just like, you know, he asked me if I had any concussions and
*  If I've had any issues and I said no no and he's like well this doesn't look right and you shouldn't be doing what you're
*  Doing I'm like, okay
*  So are you gonna sign this paper and he's like no and he's like come back tomorrow and I'm gonna give you some more information
*  I say, okay
*  So I go back Friday
*  And he tells me that you know, he did some research and he believes that I have a disease called cavernoma
*  and
*  You know, he kind of hits me with that
*  I had no idea what cavernoma was
*  and
*  You know, he says look I'm not signing this paper
*  you need to go see a specialist and
*  Get this looked at but as far as I know you should not fight, you know, you should not be fighting and
*  Then the next morning I fly to Brazil
*  For my camp, you know to go down there for the the hard sparring and everything that I like to do
*  you know stuff we talked about last time and
*  so I'm like
*  Going I'm you know in the airport getting ready to go to Brazil for this portion of my camp for this fight
*  That is like the biggest fight of my life, you know, I've already waited an extra six months for it
*  I've been training for it all year and
*  Yeah at this point I'm like just in shock of
*  what is going on my health and
*  you know, I saw my googling everything that I can about cavernoma and trying to understand what it is and basically
*  It's a disease where probably her like I probably got it from one of my parents. It's a it's normally a hereditary disease and
*  your brain
*  forms these extra blood vessels
*  and these blood vessels grow and
*  They can accumulate and sort of bundle up together into balls
*  almost like like like weeds or vines, you know, they they wrap up together and
*  These blood vessels are very prone to bleeding
*  now they don't
*  bleed so much in a in a in an instance where
*  You know, they could cause a hemorrhage. It's more like a slow that they use the term oozing effect
*  So it oozes blood out over time
*  Very little little by little and as they accumulate, you know those balls
*  Are very you know much more susceptible to bleeding and
*  You know reading about it
*  While I'm getting ready to go, you know, I'm flying to Brazil. I'm in the airport. I'm taking off
*  You know, there's so many like extreme cases of this disease where
*  People have to have multiple surgeries to get them removed
*  You know seizures vision issues
*  Come people go into comas and then of course worse worst case is even death and
*  You know, obviously
*  Googling and you know not talking to a specialist and just kind of doing my own thing is not the best way to
*  To get in for information and so I just have all these thoughts running in my head
*  About you know what I'm dealing with in my health and like, okay
*  I'm going to you know, Brazil to you know train and spar and and I have this fight and I'm right now
*  I don't have anyone signing off on this paper. You know, is this gonna happen? What's going on? Like all these questions and
*  So I get there and you know at this point the only one that that knows is
*  My girl, you know and I'm confiding in her. I'm just like talking to her and you know, she's shocked
*  I've never had any issues. I don't even really get headaches. I've never been knocked out
*  You know, there's never been a time in my life where I thought
*  Man, I should get my head looked at you know, I think something could be wrong, you know
*  and so
*  You know talking with her and then I have my coach Marcio. He's my head
*  MMA coach and my Muay Thai teacher
*  And he goes with me down to to Kudachitl and he's like, I'm gonna go to the gym
*  And he goes with me down to Kudachiba and we train there at his brother's Academy Andre Dita Adidas Academy at Luzon time and
*  You know we fly Saturday arrive Sunday start training Monday and I'm just like I'm trying to train this first day and I'm just like
*  What am I doing? You know, and I'm getting hit in the head and I'm like, man, am I slowly killing myself right here? Like
*  You know, what am I training for at this point? I'm not gonna I'm not approved. Like what what am I gonna do? You know, and
*  And so we we talk it over and we're like, okay, obviously we need to get more opinions, you know
*  And I'm down in Brazil for three weeks. Basically all of May the fight was June 21st
*  Or 23rd something like that and and so I'm spending all of May there
*  so I need to see some Brazilian doctors some doctors down here and could achieve it and
*  So we've just begin the process
*  Let's get a prescription to speak Portuguese
*  I'm not a hundred percent fluent, but I can get around I can do pretty well on my own down there
*  Just from all the trips that I've done over the years
*  So, you know, thankfully my DCO his brother Dita
*  They have so many connections down there, you know
*  Being who they are and the history that they have
*  You know teaching martial arts
*  You know you get to know everybody right and so they were able to make things happen quick for me
*  We saw a doctor got a prescription for another MRI
*  Get scheduled to get that MRI done
*  Which happens on Friday the end of my first week there. So I'm going that whole week training, you know
*  trying to
*  Stay positive
*  But I'm wondering
*  You know what? You know, what am I doing? What's going on? You know what I mean?
*  Yeah, I can't I can't begin to describe
*  the
*  The thoughts and emotions they can't imagine that it may be so distracting during sparring as well. Oh, yes
*  Yes, and you know, they go harder down there
*  Put it mildly. Yeah. Yeah that place is known for like some of the most ruthless killers to ever come out of Brazil
*  100% 100% that's a shoot the box exactly. Yeah
*  I'm not sleeping well. I'm
*  You know, I'm
*  Emotional wreck basically. I'm calling my girl over FaceTime
*  You know multiple times a day who we're looking at each other on the screen. I'm crying
*  I'm confiding in my DCO and Shange he better was also there with me. I had an Airbnb with Shange
*  So thankfully I wasn't on my own 24-7
*  outside of the Academy my DCO always stays with his family and
*  You know, I'm just like man when shot Shange arrived
*  That Monday or Tuesday and I tell him what's going on. I'm just like dude. I'm a mess right now like I
*  Don't know, you know, I'm just so uncertain of of my health and what's going on and hmm and
*  You know
*  like I
*  Man, I just can't put into words, you know
*  but I'm trying to stay positive I'm trying to stay positive and
*  We get through that first week get the MRI the new MRI down there in Brazil
*  So then we have you know, the Brazilian MRI to take two Brazilian doctors. And so then the second week we
*  start seeing neurologists and
*  And
*  you know specialists to get their opinion and and see what they have to say and
*  That was the hardest week ever because
*  Multiple doctors were all saying no
*  You know when you look at the scan right off the bat it just like it doesn't look good, you know
*  We have a picture of it
*  and
*  Actually, I don't have
*  Sorry, I don't have one with me right now
*  But you know you just see these gray like
*  Little shades of circles like in the lot of them. Well, I have multiple and most of them are very small
*  like popcorn size and
*  You know those aren't that dangerous at least yet
*  But there is one accumulation on the backside of my the right side of my head
*  you know back here and
*  That has built up and and it looks it looks big
*  like how big
*  Probably probably
*  like somewhere between a
*  Like a baseball size like golf golf ball to baseball in between there Jesus it's it's pretty big
*  But it's on the very outer rim
*  so
*  It's not
*  Like in the middle of my brain. It's on the outside, you know
*  So if you were to go right through my head, it could be right there
*  You know, you could essentially pull it out without having to go through too much stuff
*  Is that something that might actually have to happen
*  No, not it not now not now
*  I'll fast forward, you know
*  to the doctors I end up seeing here in the States who clarify a lot of this but
*  That's but the doctors in Brazil all say the same thing. Well, they're kind of just I mean, you know
*  fighting already
*  Isn't good for your brain. You know what I mean getting hit in the head isn't good for your brain and I think
*  And I think
*  Just looking at it when you see it and then you know that I'm gonna get hit in the head and what I do
*  You're you're automatically gonna be like
*  Hey, you know, there's already this extra bit of of danger that we're putting in to a dangerous situation
*  Let's not let's not play. Let's not roll the dice, you know, let's not play that game
*  And so we were getting multiple
*  doctors
*  Saying no, you know and
*  Even one was like
*  You know, they said that jujitsu could be dangerous that's me getting my blood cut off like in a choke
*  You know cutting off the circulation to my brain that could be dangerous
*  And so this week I am literally not sleeping at all
*  I am crying multiple times a day and I'm just like man. What am I doing? I'm going into the sparring
*  You know and I'm training and I'm not I'm not gonna get approved
*  I'm not gonna fight, you know, and this has already been like a six seven month training camp at this point, you know
*  And it's for the belt. It's my life's work. It's everything for me, you know
*  so I was just crushed day in day out trying to get through and on
*  Thursday of that week
*  I'm doing MMA sparring and
*  You know, I kind of had it coming. I shouldn't have I shouldn't have been going as hard as what I've been going
*  but I was like
*  Trying to you know, stay positive and stay ready. Like what if I need I need to be ready for this fight
*  You know, it's Masasi like I got to be at my best
*  And in reality, I was just
*  training
*  Like garbage I was I was having my worst training camp my worst fight camp, you know because of everything and on this day
*  I'm in my third round of MMA sparring and I I strain my hamstring bad
*  I go for like a double leg and the guy has a judo background
*  He overhook like wizards me and goes for like a Uchi Mata. Harae go she type of throw
*  I'm wearing wrestling shoes. I try to drop my hips, you know, so he doesn't elevate me and
*  my legs my knees go straight and my foot gets stuck in the floor with the wrestling shoe and
*  My hamstring just snapped, you know, like a loud like pop up and
*  I just scream and I let it go and I you know, I get thrown down and I'm just like and I you know
*  He knew something was wrong. We stopped right there and my leg is just
*  throbbing and
*  I tried to get up. I couldn't get up. So I had to like walk on my hands scoot off the mat
*  I got carried out of the Academy that day could not walk
*  and I'm
*  Sitting down on the edge of the mat and I just like I'm bursting the tears and I look to look up to my
*  He said I'm like man
*  It's not gonna happen. Like there's no way, you know, all this is going on. I'm not approved. I'm training horrible
*  my I can't walk now, you know and
*  So, you know that was the end of week two all knows
*  We have one more doctor to see
*  Who's like
*  the
*  Professor of many of the doctors that I already saw he's very highly regarded one of the best doctors in the south of Brazil
*  neuro specialist neurosurgeon
*  We were so lucky to get in to see him and
*  You know because he's booked up booked up booked up
*  But we managed an appointment time for Monday of the third week Monday night
*  so
*  You know, I'm like I've basically given up I
*  Can't walk. I'm at home that whole weekend and Sean G
*  He he had seminars on the weekend, you know, he came down there to support me in camp
*  But on the weekends, he was going off to teach seminars in different areas of Brazil
*  And so I'm laid up in this Airbnb
*  All weekend and I'm like just facetiming my girl. I'm like, you know, baby like I
*  Don't think this is happening I can't believe come this far, you know
*  to the title shot
*  This much training, you know for the camp like going from November of
*  2018 into the end of May of 2019. That was my that was it was just this fight with Masasi and
*  You know it took everything for me like this sounds funny but
*  The the house the Airbnb the the host, you know, she's like a great host
*  She left so many chocolates and all this food in the house like sweets and
*  I just wanted to pig out and eat all these chocolates, you know
*  I kept telling Sean G bro. You got to eat these things like I I can't look at these
*  I'm so I'm such an emotional wreck right now
*  You know and I'm in I'm in the the spot all weekend by myself
*  And I'm ready to give up I'm like I'm gonna go eat chua scaria
*  You know what I mean and eat all these chocolates and just like, you know
*  Cuz I have to diet very strict to make 185. What do you walk around around?
*  210 to 215 is my normal weight, you know
*  So, I mean that weight is kind of normal like most guys at 185 or around 210, but I'm already tall
*  I'm already naturally pretty lean. So I have to be very strict
*  And I it took everything for me to not just pig out and just like totally give in
*  But you know, my do you see I was just like hey, we have one more doctor one more doctor
*  The whole weekend. All I did was just put CBD cream on my leg
*  Resilient CBD shout out to them and my sponsor
*  I'm a very good doctor. I'm a very good doctor. I'm a very good doctor
*  Resilient CBD shout out to them and my sponsor
*  And I use using the mark Pro on my on my leg
*  So it's a mark Pro. It's like
*  similar to like a tens unit
*  Okay, but it has different frequencies and you can go really deep in there
*  And so I'm just like, okay, let me just try to recover this thing as much as I can
*  I couldn't train couldn't do anything. I was basically stuck at home
*  And that's all I did and I just said okay Monday night. That's it if he says no
*  It's done and at this point I hadn't told anything to me. I let my manager Ed know but we hadn't said anything to anybody else
*  literally the only ones that knew were my girls Sean G. Maiti SEO and Ed and
*  so we go see this doctor Monday night and
*  Man right off the bat. He kind of captivated us because he was the first one to be
*  Just chill and just like okay, what's going on? What brings you here?
*  Didn't look at any pictures didn't you know didn't rush it and I tell him yeah, you know, I got my scans
*  It looks like I have cavernoma. Da da da da. He said, okay, let me see your scans and he's like, yeah
*  Yeah, this is this is a cavernoma for sure
*  how do you feel the first one to ask me how do you feel and
*  so well, you know
*  This is all a big huge shock. I've never had any problems. I feel great. I'm fine, you know, I you know
*  I don't even get headaches and
*  He's like, okay
*  You know, he talks with me and he's like, let's go do an evaluation
*  We do an evaluation and do some tests everything's norm like just simple like, you know, stand on one leg and all that kind of stuff
*  You know and everything's fine and
*  So we go back to the office we sit down he's like, let me just see what I can find
*  But I guarantee I'm not gonna find
*  anything that says
*  head impact or trauma is gonna increase the risk of your camera cavernoma bleeding and
*  so
*  he starts looking up, you know journals and
*  You know studies all the things that doctors have access to and he literally finds nothing
*  You know, there is no studies that say that getting hitting your head is gonna make your cavernoma worse or
*  Cause you to bleed and and something's gonna happen
*  He's like look
*  You can bleed, you know, you can be oozing blood at any point in time a little by little
*  and
*  It could become an issue at some point in time
*  But there is no treatment there is no we're not gonna do surgery like
*  there's nothing that's gonna happen until you have symptoms until you show signs and
*  because I can't find any studies that say getting hit in the head is gonna make it worse and because you are
*  You know a normal like healthy functioning person at this point. I
*  Think it's fine for you to fight you should continue doing what you do until it becomes a problem
*  And if it does become a problem, we'll go in there and we'll take it out the big the big mass
*  And you know, then we'll move forward
*  And so I'm just like
*  You know, I started getting emotional already and I'm kind of like wow
*  So you'll write a letter saying this you'll you'll support me. He's like, yeah, sure. Sure. No problem
*  Super calm guy just and he was the oldest doctor we had spoken to as well
*  Most experienced and
*  So we get this letter man walk out of that office me and my issue and
*  as soon as we we leave the door and we'll get to the elevator man, I just I
*  Just like burst into tears. I just I can't believe that
*  There's some hope like this this can still happen and me and my issue embrace and just we both cry
*  Like oh my god, we got the letter we got the letter
*  so I
*  send the letter to Ed and
*  We begin the process of trying to get approved
*  We get everything into Bellator. Let him know they got the scans
*  They send it over to the Europe Commission. They use an organization called safe MMA
*  and
*  you know, we kind of like
*  We're happy we're positive but at the same time
*  I'm still not approved. It's still not on you know, but
*  the letter is like
*  That was the missing piece. That was what we needed to be able to move forward
*  so I
*  finished that last week
*  unable to
*  really move
*  You know, I can't wrestle I can't kick and my last week in Brazil, you know
*  I'm literally just hitting mids like this and I'm like, okay trying to stay positive. I still have like a month
*  Let's get this healed. Let's just keep sweating. Did you get an MRI on the hamstring? No, I didn't get MRI on the hamstring
*  It it didn't have any discoloration. So it wasn't a tear. It was like a severe
*  Strain but with the popping
*  It didn't turn black and blue and so without that color discoloration. I didn't I
*  Almost didn't even want to know I was just like, right, you know, like when they start feeling better
*  It didn't really I actually still feel it now
*  Yeah
*  It was a situation the whole way
*  But I could stand
*  So I could stand and all I'm doing is boxing now at this point because I can't throw kicks and I can't change
*  levels to do takedowns
*  and so that was a whole nother thing because you know as I'm waiting to
*  To hear back on if I'm gonna get approved
*  I'm only punching mitts like I might as well be doing like a cardio kick kickboxing class, you know without kicks and
*  That was the last thing that I want to do with my saucy is just go in there and box, you know
*  Right. That's not what I do, right? So
*  The the hardships and frustrations were just continued as I'm dealing with my hamstring
*  But at least we had some some hope
*  So I finished that week fly home
*  And now I'm finishing like my last couple weeks of camp at home in Oklahoma
*  Shonji comes to Oklahoma, you know, I'm out of you see was there and
*  I'm trying to put together some great training one of my best training partners from Kudo Chiba. His name is Chris Cristiano
*  He came to Oklahoma as well
*  And you know, everyone's aware of the situation as far as my coaches my team. I did not tell my parents
*  I
*  Didn't want anyone to know I didn't want it to get out
*  and so I was just dealing with it with them, you know, and
*  And so we send everything in
*  And we're waiting we're waiting
*  The this guy his name is Yanni. He's on the Commission with safe MMA
*  He reaches out to me like after the first week
*  And he said hey we need to talk and so I give him a call and
*  and he's like
*  We we got the letter. We're looking at your scans
*  We've actually created a panel of doctors to talk about this
*  And
*  At this point, it's 50-50, you know, I just want you to know we're unsure if we're gonna approve
*  and
*  I just want you to hear you know, I just wanted to touch base with you wanted you hear from me
*  We see everything but you have to understand where we're still not sure so bear with us. I'm like, okay
*  Try to get through the next week
*  Hey, I had some decent days with my hamstring
*  where I could shoot a little bit and work some takedowns, but
*  If I had a good day the next day I had to take it real light because it's just it was so tight
*  So tight so tender
*  Did you get a massage at all?
*  Oh, yeah, I was doing everything everything possible. I mean
*  getting it worked on
*  Doing hot cold like, you know, I'm I'm pretty
*  like
*  Anything out there that is for recovery. I have probably at my house, you know
*  I'm big on really taking care of my body
*  so I was just trying to be as smart as I could and just get through it and
*  You know we come to this point now where the fight is two weeks away and
*  I don't know if it's on or not
*  You know, and I'm just trying to put together as good of training as I can
*  Stay as positive as I can but at the same time, I'm just like man
*  I need the yes, you know, I need to be able to focus
*  How are you staying conditioned when you barely can use your leg?
*  Man it was it was really hard. I
*  Was heavier I was walking around heavier than what I normally would
*  For for my fights, you know by this time. I'm normally below 205
*  In the 200 to 205 range. That's where I like to be
*  And I was still 210 to 212
*  You know, it was hard like I couldn't I I could box, you know
*  And I could box hard and I could spar boxing but without wrestling
*  I didn't feel like I was conditioned the way I wanted to be
*  I couldn't sprint I could ride the bike
*  The bike didn't put too much pressure, but I couldn't go to the gym
*  I couldn't go to the gym. I couldn't go to the gym. I couldn't go to the gym
*  The bike didn't put too much pressure, but I couldn't go all out the way I would like to like an air dime
*  Yeah air dine
*  Everything was
*  Not the way it would normally be done. Now, you know, you're never a hundred percent
*  You're always dealing with something, you know, I've had a broken nose before cuts rib things like there's always something, you know
*  But but it was it was the stress of both in the uncertainty and if we would get to fight at all, yeah
*  That was really hard and for sure that's why I got hurt, you know, that's 100% why I got hurt
*  But anyways
*  Finally on like the last day that they could
*  Give me the answer. They gave me the answer and I got the email and it said we've approved you
*  You are approved to fight two weeks before the fight. I held off on
*  You know, I'm flying my family there, you know, I mean I have all my my
*  there's the the corner coaches been have a couple other coaches that I was you know gonna fly out there and I
*  Was waiting to purchase these tickets and you know, I had some other guys like hey, where are you staying? What's what's going on?
*  like
*  I'm ready and I'm like, hey, don't book anything just yeah
*  Don't book any cuz I don't want them to buy tickets to London and you know, yeah
*  I'm not fighting and I'm trying to like be cool and not give anyone to you know
*  Too much an idea of what's going on and stay positive. Stay confident and everything
*  Finally, we got the green light and I'm literally flying a few days later to London
*  We left on
*  Tuesday and arrived there Wednesday. I got there like ten days before so I have one weekend before the weekend of the fight
*  and
*  You know at this point it was like, okay once we got that. Yes, I mean we celebrated
*  It was like
*  You know, that's all I wanted. I mean I had already fought so hard just to be able to get to this fight, you know
*  and
*  We you know, we go to London and
*  My leg starts doing a little better and I'm like, you know starting to just feel it like okay
*  This is it. You know, everything's coming together. We're gonna we're gonna finish things on a good note and
*  Friday the week before the fight I met Hodgers Academy in London. How's your Gracie?
*  he opened up his doors let us work in there and
*  And I'm feeling good and I overdo it and I feel my hamstring go again. It wasn't a full
*  Pop but it was like that stretch where it catches it and it just like and it's just like this pain
*  Rushed through and I'm like, oh no, I did it again. You know, I could feel it
*  Tighten up and lock I had to stop training that day and
*  This is a week before the fight now and I'm right back to that. Like I can't I can't change levels. I can't kick
*  And I'm just like, you know
*  once again an emotional wreck
*  And my friend Cameron Shane who's a mobility yoga
*  Guru he's just an amazing guy
*  He
*  You know being that I felt the way I did
*  I don't want to go back to Hodgers and try to do anything because I don't want people to see me and
*  He has these you know yoga connections all throughout the world
*  And we found a yoga studio
*  Where my last few days we could go there and try to do whatever we could
*  Where no one could see you know as far as like other jiu-jitsu guys or MMA guys
*  and
*  man the Sunday before the fight we we go into this yoga studio and
*  we're trying to get a workout together and I'm just like
*  Man, I I break down and I just start crying and I'm like guys cuz I'm literally, you know
*  Hit mitts like this again. I'm right back to that
*  My niece was like just just punch just just to lose the weight, you know, I'm like
*  man, I
*  Need to wrestle. I need to feel my takedowns. I need to fill my whole game coming together and
*  I just break down and
*  all the guys come around me, you know and
*  they just man they they consoled me in such a
*  Special way and I mean we just cut it that day like there was no more training but you know, I I can't I
*  can't begin to
*  Give it as much gratitude and and describe like how much
*  My team was there for me when I needed them because
*  You know, I
*  Was I was not in a good state of mind. I was not in a good place
*  Can imagine your six days out? Yeah in London and you literally can't use your leg exactly exactly
*  and
*  you know, they just like
*  The the love and the inspiration and everything that they put into me
*  I mean we we all fought that fight together. We all fought that fight together and
*  You know we left that day I had a couple more days before we check into the Bellator Hotel
*  the Tuesday
*  Wednesdays when we go to the Bellator Hotel Tuesday, I was able to put together a good day of training
*  Like so it loosened up it loosened back up it wasn't like I said, it wasn't a fool as bad as the first one
*  It just hit me for a second. But I think like
*  You know
*  those moments
*  You know, I needed that I needed to
*  To combine our energies, you know because look how that fight ended up going, you know, I felt like
*  like that that
*  Fight before the fight was to prep me for the fight, you know
*  and
*  You know going there
*  Obviously, I'm a big underdog
*  You know, it's in London. Musasi has so much history there. He's from Amsterdam
*  You know
*  I don't know if anyone out there saw the video that Bellator put out afterwards where I said like
*  You know we did it and you could see how emotional I was this is why you know
*  and
*  Fast forward to when we're backs backstage
*  You know getting ready to go out there
*  I always take
*  My favorite book thinking girl rich from Napoleon Hill. I always take that was that
*  It's just a powerful book for my life. I
*  Discovered it in 2000 the end of 2007
*  and
*  It's just such an inspirational book
*  and really kind of like
*  was the sort of the Bible for self-help books and
*  all the other, you know people that kind of came from that like Tony Robbins and things like that like, you know the
*  The motivating, you know, like the secret, you know all those sort of things
*  Thinking girl rich was like the first and and
*  Anyways, there's so many quotes in there
*  and things that just have stuck with me throughout the years and
*  I love to read certain chapters and portions of it when I'm backstage getting ready to fight
*  and I have like
*  highlighted sentences and notes in it and stuff and I'm backstage and I
*  Open I open the book and I hadn't opened it up to this point on this trip like
*  It was just with me put in my bag and you know
*  I got a couple hours before we go out to fight and I always open it up and
*  As soon as I open it it's on the you know
*  the flap isn't inside in a chapter already in the last place I looked at it or whatever and
*  The first thing I see is a highlighted highlighted portion that says
*  every adversity
*  Carries with it the seed of an equivalent advantage
*  That was the first thing that I saw and it hit me right there. It was like
*  Everything that I went through in this camp to get to this fight
*  You know that is gonna be my advantage that is gonna be what carries me through this fight that that's my power
*  I know what I'm here for. That's a great quote. It's the best, you know every adversity
*  carries with it the seed of an equivalent advantage a
*  Another one of my favorites from Napoleon Hill that I've used on t-shirts and inside a gi before
*  Victory is always possible for the person who refuses to stop fighting, you know, which is that's martial arts, right?
*  Mm-hmm. That's a black belt is a white belt who never quit, you know, as long as you never quit
*  Success is always possible
*  every failure just helps you learn and grow to to you know get to your ultimate objective your ultimate goal and
*  When I saw that, you know, I'm writing that book down right now
*  Yeah, I think and grow rich in a point now. I tell all my all my students all my competitors all my guys
*  I always talk about that book
*  and
*  And that was the first thing that I saw, you know
*  And and like I said like going into this fight all I wanted was that fight like
*  Trying to get approved that whole process was just like hey, just give me this one
*  Just give me this one more don't stop me this short of of my dream
*  You know my dream to fight for the belt to fight a legendary fighter like Musasi
*  Someone that's been you know at the top for so long. That was how I envisioned
*  you know fighting for my first big world title in MMA and I
*  Mean I was going out there like that was the last fight of my life
*  Like it could potentially be the last fight of my life
*  You know and all this stuff with my health like
*  you know when I'm thinking about my my parents and my family, you know, like
*  Wondering, you know, am I gonna get hurt? Is this am I?
*  You know gonna do something where selfishly where because I want this I want to fight
*  I want this this title that something could happen to me and and you know
*  I'm not gonna be healthy. I'm not gonna be the same and I'm gonna break their hearts
*  I had all these emotions and thoughts and and you know, it's just like
*  Like I was literally kind of I mean
*  And it's so to speak going out there ready to die like ready to just let it all out like this is it
*  you know, all I wanted was this opportunity, you know and
*  and I could feel how
*  All of that was to prep me for the fight, you know everything that we went through that fight to get to the fight
*  and
*  My dad's in my corner, you know, he's in my corner for all my fights. I
*  Have the guys that went through everything, you know those that last
*  four or five weeks before the fight to get approved with me and
*  When I saw that I looked around at them and I smiled I said guys we're gonna do it
*  we're gonna do it, you know, it was like it was destiny and
*  And
*  And I don't know, you know if you've ever seen but I've posted before
*  Some clips of my dad who is a professional organist or former professional organist, but he still plays the organ. He's a musician
*  and
*  When I when I walked out for this fight I
*  I had them play a clip of my my dad playing the organ
*  And
*  You know growing up when I first started training martial arts, my dad was playing the organ at that time
*  professionally and
*  And that was that was what I did the time that I spent with my dad. I was at church
*  listening to him play the organ and then we would go to the Academy and
*  and we would you know, we would train or we would train at home and
*  you know, my father's in my corner and
*  you know, this is
*  This is our work, you know, I am who I am because of him. I'm a martial artist because of him
*  I have my brothers the guys I've been training with for over a decade
*  You know, it was it was
*  It was our destiny. It was family, you know, we were going out there to fight as a family and
*  And walking out to my dad playing the organ
*  You know, it just really it
*  It
*  It took me to this place where it's like I'm gonna give everything I absolutely have
*  Win or lose. I'm
*  I'm you know
*  I'm not gonna stop. I'm gonna do my best my absolute best and
*  And then you know the fight went the way it did came down to the fifth round, you know
*  that's where that fifth round came from was
*  Was for them, you know the the love that they gave me to get me even just to get me there
*  You know, cuz I was ready to break man. I was I I I
*  I was in pieces so many days in that camp. I
*  you know, it was a
*  It was just a roller coaster of emotions
*  But having them, you know, my father my brothers behind me
*  that's where that strength came from and and everything
*  We went through before the fight
*  but that's why I was so emotional in the cage, I mean you'd be emotional anyways for a title fight, but
*  You know, it was it was something else
*  just to
*  Just to get there, you know and and have that opportunity
*  And you could really I'm out of you see oh, I mean my do you see oh he
*  He's right
*  He's right there with his hands like powerful moment right there. Whoo
*  Did it bother you that he was he had a lot of sour grapes after the fight Gagard did
*  It did it did he didn't didn't really credit you for the fight he was just saying mostly that you're on steroids
*  My mom. Yeah
*  Paying her respects giving him a hug. I
*  Mean I understand that he felt bad because he lost but I felt like the way he handled it was
*  Uncharacteristic for him. He was a true thing. We were so respectful before after the fight
*  I went up to him, you know before they made the decision. I went up to him. I shook his hand
*  I said man, it was an honor, you know so much respect for you
*  it was an honor to battle with you, you know, I think them thank you and we shook hands and hugged and and
*  And
*  You know, but then he didn't stay after they raised my hand. He walked right out. We didn't shake hands again and
*  Then everything else. Yeah, really surprised me. I
*  Think it was just hard to fathom because you know, this was my tenth fight. He'd already had over 50. He was a big
*  He was a big favorite. I just don't think
*  you know he he
*  They were very confident. They were very confident
*  leading up to the fight and
*  I don't think anyone imagined me to walk out of there with that belt
*  Especially with one leg
*  He didn't know about that hurt really bad after
*  I'm sure
*  But you know, I didn't feel it like I that's when the adrenaline's pumping, right?
*  You know, I I didn't it wasn't till like an hour later. I was like, whoo
*  Right. It's pretty tight
*  Yeah, why do you think he did that? Why do you why do you think I mean he's lost before I've never seen him
*  Just attribute
*  Essentially attribute most of your success. He was just accusing you of taking steroids
*  Yeah, and not a little bit of steroids you're saying like monkey steroids. That's what he said. Yeah, I
*  Don't know, you know his camp had a I
*  Felt like Musasi is genuinely like what I would call
*  You know a real martial artist. He's a he's a martial artist and he doesn't really ever
*  You know trash talk anybody
*  And we were very respectful but you know his camp was they were saying and doing some things that were a little
*  Edgier I would say when we will do sheer. Yeah. Yeah when we
*  When we were at the press conference and we were going on for the face-off
*  you know all this camp were always yelling a bunch of things and and
*  You know when we were walking up one guy yells up to me dead man walking and of course immediately on my mind
*  I'm like I have this brain disease, you know that
*  You know may or may not be an issue here in a couple days when we fight, you know and
*  And I have my family right there. I'm like
*  Hmm, and then I have to look at him in the eyes, you know, but now I'll never forget that I thought about that
*  You know dead man walking
*  And I was just like this guy
*  you know and
*  It was a lot it was a lot to take in to step into that cage
*  But I think maybe some of the people he's around maybe
*  That doesn't I mean that doesn't cause him to say those things when he was
*  Sitting at the dot the table with the microphone in front of him. What did you respond to that?
*  No, I mean
*  That was right when we were walking to face off and the price of press conference was basically done at that point
*  So I had nothing to say to that, you know
*  That's that person yelling that and you know, no, what I mean after the fight when he was accusing you steroids
*  did you ever know I never never had a
*  Moment to you know, I we never have another haven't had another fight
*  Haven't been never did an interview or anybody talked to you about his act
*  No, who was I did one Luke Thomas Luke Thomas
*  Didn't interview with me. I like that guy a lot. Yeah. Yeah
*  and I think it was
*  After
*  No, yeah, it was before he fought machita. It was before he fought machita
*  and he talked to me about it, you know in an interview about the fight and everything and
*  You know, I didn't have too much to say other than I just felt like it was a little sad because it was a great fight
*  you know, it was a really great fight and
*  Good fight close fight. Yeah super close. I feel like we kind of
*  you know, I he probably thinks that he was under par and
*  And I made a lot of mistakes too
*  And I wasn't too happy about some of the things that that happened in that fight as well
*  I thought I could have done a lot better but in a way
*  I felt like we kind of brought out the best of each other, you know his jujitsu very much impressed me
*  he was a seasoned pro just like always calm and
*  You know then
*  When he had his moment he had his moment. He started taking over, you know, and
*  And I you know, I it brought out the best of me in the heart that I showed coming back in that fifth round
*  and I just felt like it was a great fight and we should be applauding each other for our performances and
*  And all this, you know trash-talking is really taken away from that. Yeah
*  and
*  anyways
*  We were supposed to fight Saturday night
*  at in LA
*  couple days ago
*  We you know, we set up
*  The fight in November. I signed a bout agreement
*  he went out there and got a win against machida happy to do the rematch and
*  You know bringing this stuff back up
*  I'm in I'm in camp. I've already started camp for this fight in January
*  It's November and I get a call from
*  Well, the same person I spoke to Yanni from safe MMA says hey we have a doctor we've continued studying your scans
*  We've had a doctor
*  Look at this that didn't see it before the fight. His name is dr. Healy. He's from Ireland and
*  He really wants to talk to you. I said, okay
*  Haven't give me a call and let's let's talk
*  So I'm actually in Austin. I'm training at the on it campus
*  Getting great training down there
*  you know getting my camp going and
*  And I get this call from dr. Healy and we talk and he is very adamant that I should not
*  continue fighting and
*  He says it's a mistake that I was approved and able to fight
*  in in London and
*  and
*  Moving forward I would not be approved in Europe again
*  So at this point now Europe is a no now. What is his credentials?
*  Why is he so respected above the all the others? What did he see in the scan? He's a neurologist
*  He sees the same thing as everybody else
*  he just says that
*  They made the wrong decision and somehow he didn't see it before the fight
*  He didn't see the scans before the fight
*  No, but why is his opinion respected above all the other doctors that approved you? I don't know. I don't know the doctor and Corchiba
*  He's part of this panel that safe and may created they continued talking about my scans, okay and and
*  Discussing it further
*  You know, it's a rare. It's a rare thing, you know cavernoma is I
*  Mean it's not that rare but it's like one in two or three hundred people
*  Have it in in the US and they probably don't know about it. Exactly unless they have symptoms
*  And in Europe, it's like one in five hundred
*  you know, and so being that it's a rare disease and
*  Throw that into me doing something that not very many people do, you know
*  You know, I don't think there's been too many cases where a professional fighter has this disease and they have to make these decisions
*  And so I get that call from dr. Healy and
*  You know, I'm like and of course, I've already started another camp now. So the same things are coming up
*  We're like am I gonna get approved?
*  I'm driving up from Austin to corner one of my guys
*  At the border of Oklahoma and Texas
*  for his Bellator debut and
*  And so I'm at Bellator like the next day this call I got from dr. Healy was on Thursday Friday
*  I'm driving up to Bellator to corner one of my guys and so I'm there and I and I end up talking to rich and
*  And I tell rich. Hey, man, I just got this call. I'm a little nervous, you know, because in my mind up to that point
*  I thought well since Europe approved me I should be okay to continue getting approved and continue fighting and
*  and
*  So I'm like man, maybe we need to go and start the process now. Let's not wait, you know, it's November
*  Let's not wait till December to to get everything into California. I can't do another camp with all this uncertainty
*  and rich agrees and he's like, yep, okay, I'm on it next week and
*  You know, we got in in Matthews is the
*  coordinates all the medicals for for Bellator
*  we start, you know getting organized and like
*  literally a little over a week later, I'm flying out to LA to see doctors here and
*  and
*  You know check up on everything get new scans and see what they say
*  so
*  I get my scans done
*  I
*  Talk to a neurologist
*  He is not favorable of me fighting
*  But he the last thing he says is you really need to see a specialist like a neurosurgeon
*  So there's neurologists and then there's neurosurgeons ones that actually do brain surgeries
*  And he says you need to see an actual specialist
*  You know, that's the last thing he says and so boom I'm right on the phone with Ian
*  He the guy recommended a couple people
*  Ian's able to set it up where the next day I go to UCLA and I see a neurosurgeon. His name is dr. Wong
*  The next morning and not he's he owes with me Ed's with me we go see dr. Wong and
*  He is very very similar to the doctor I see in Brazil
*  He is very calm his younger guy though
*  But he has a lot of experience with people with cavernoma
*  He's actually I mean that morning he actually operated on someone
*  Before we saw him
*  That had cavernoma and had a bundle very similar to mine almost in the exact same location
*  It took him less than an hour to get it out and that person walked away
*  You know, how are they getting into the brain?
*  I don't I can't tell you the specifics of the the surgery
*  But I mean they they're able to to go in and because it's on the outer rim
*  They can pull it out and it's very it's a very minimal like
*  Turn around as far as your recovery and I mean you're the person got up and walked away
*  So this is just a large bundle the small bundles are not of concern exactly
*  the large bundle has
*  Already shown a history of a little bit of bleeding, you know, they could see where like some blood came out and dried up
*  And you know if that continues
*  You know and it keeps getting bigger
*  Then it's more pressure on your brain and you know more likely for him or hemorrhaging and things like that
*  But he says that it's in like the best location possible
*  And the fact that it's on the outer rim would be easy to get out if they needed to and I asked him I said
*  Well, should we just get this thing out now and then I can try to get approved
*  Just so it doesn't look so bad, you know and and make make people feel better and he recommends against it
*  He said no, we're not gonna do surgery until you have some symptoms or some problems
*  and
*  You know until then like live your life. He's operated and worked with
*  NFL players and boxers
*  That have cavernoma and they were able to continue on no problem
*  And he was very positive
*  I have a letter from him on my phone and he's talking about like the percentage of something happening being less than 1%
*  With it as it stands, yes
*  Yes, so he's giving you the full go ahead. He's giving me the full go ahead. And so we're very positive
*  We leave thinking that that's gonna be enough
*  and
*  I continue with my camp and
*  It was in December that
*  You know rich and in Bellator they you know, and let me just say
*  They have been super supportive Bellator
*  You know, they
*  Organized me going out and seeing this doctor getting into the you know, UCLA to see the neurosurgeon
*  And you know, they've been really helpful and tremendous in working with me to
*  Keep this dream alive of continuing to fight
*  I mean it was a dream to become the champion and now I mean I've only done three fights with Bellator outside of my home
*  State outside of Oklahoma my last three, you know, so I'm at this point now where like I was gonna fight in LA
*  You know, which was gonna be amazing
*  All the friends that I have here for my career in jujitsu, you know and
*  Already looking ahead to I mean, I actually I was I was shooting for us to fight in Japan
*  They just did their first Bellator Japan on New Year's Eve and I thought oh with Masasi's history in Japan
*  Maybe we could fight there, but they wanted us in LA which was fine
*  but you know starting to see that hey these big arenas and and you know,
*  Really just like
*  The big the big shows were right there like at grasp
*  you know putting on for for my team for my family and and you know for where I'm from like
*  we're about to be there, you know and
*  You know, so
*  Like I was super excited super excited for this fight, but
*  Bellator they're in say, okay, we're gonna get this into California sort of
*  Under the table, you know, we're not gonna put in the official application
*  Because if they deny, you know
*  now that'll be two commissions on paper that say no and
*  So
*  you know they
*  Kind of put this into the athletic Commission's hands
*  Andy Foster the California State Athletic Commission say hey, you know
*  We have a guy who has this condition
*  Just tell me what you guys
*  would do with this situation would it be approved or not and
*  It was like mid-december
*  the word came back that
*  it wasn't gonna be a no and
*  So that's really you know why I'm here right now is
*  you know people I've committed myself to to
*  Getting back into grappling and jujitsu right now. I have a match lined up next month
*  and
*  I'm sure you know, there's questions. There already have been questions. I had already told my students
*  I mean I had signed a bout agreement and everything for for January and I had students buying tickets to come to LA to
*  To be here at my fight
*  You know and I've been like
*  Like oh, you know, we got we got postponed we got delayed I haven't said anything to anyone other than my I mean
*  I just told my parents a few weeks ago, you know, I finally told them
*  I didn't your parents have this they gotten they haven't gotten scanned yet
*  but the plan is for them to get checked out for sure and
*  that's a big a big reason why I'm here today Joe is to to
*  you know create awareness for this because
*  You know who knows and it's it's it's really
*  Giving me a different outlook like we get physicals. We go see the dentist. We get our we get checked up, you know
*  But how often do you think
*  Let me get a brain scan done to know what's going on with my head, you know to know how my brain looks
*  You know, I've thought about doing and I'm actually nervous. I don't blame you. I
*  Don't blame you
*  Now I man I totally get that
*  Before like I said, I went into it. So like oh, this is just a routine thing, you know to get approved to fight. I
*  Fought nine times already. Mm-hmm. Imagine who else could be out there
*  with something either in their living a regular life or maybe in an extreme life where they're doing combat or
*  You know in some sort of extreme sport where they're getting hit in the head
*  But it was never required of them to get a scan done
*  And they never just had an issue so they never thought about it, you know
*  And you don't really know what's going on up there until you get it looked at so are you officially retiring?
*  I'm not officially retiring. I
*  Am sort of I guess indefinitely on
*  the sidelines
*  Right now I am I am actively
*  Seeing more doctors and working towards
*  Learning more about this. I want obviously I want to keep fighting this gentleman in LA
*  Dr. Wong's over him. So he had done these operations on you said MMA fighters
*  I don't know if he operated on he mentioned boxers and NFL players
*  I don't know if he operated on them. He had seen it in them and
*  He had seen it in them and
*  Helped them continue their careers and he keeps like a close eye
*  So, you know, I need to get scans done at least once a year was yours that patch the large patch in the back
*  Your head was that particularly troubling to him more than the other ones? No. No
*  He said like it that it was in the best location possible to get to yes and because it's not
*  Deep in it's not in an area where it could affect my
*  My cognitive functions my memory things like that what goes on back there?
*  Back there, you know, i'm not 100 sure. Uh, they made it. I mean he made it sound like
*  Nothing too important happens there. It's more like it's where I know like the back area as far as what i've learned
*  This far is more like
*  Every day type of stuff, you know, it's not your memory. It's not
*  in a position where
*  you could
*  violently lose your temper or kind of like have like a lapse in time, you know where you
*  Kind of become someone else and then you come back like, you know that all that kind of stuff happens more deep inside the brain
*  Where it's at on the outside in the back is just sort of like the regular stuff, you know
*  Obviously, neither of us are neurosurgeons. We were describing the regular stuff. Ah the area of the regular stuff. Yeah, so
*  Are you thinking about going in there and getting it removed?
*  No, no, it is
*  Is recommended against why is doing because why do brain surgery if I don't have any symptoms? That's that's what he says
*  And you know because I was up for it. I said hey, should we just do this and he was like look
*  It'll probably be six months to a year before I would say it's okay to go back into sparring and things like that
*  Um, you know, you're gonna be able to walk out and be fine and do your day-to-day stuff
*  But I don't want you getting hit in the head for a while and why I mean, it's a low risk surgery
*  But why take that risk if you're not having symptoms?
*  the the the treatment or the care is always just to keep an eye on it see how it develops and
*  If you start having some problems, then we're going to go in there and remove it
*  But if you say that you're indefinitely on the sidelines, it's it seems to me that unless you get it removed
*  You're permanently on the sidelines
*  Well, I you know
*  This is where i'm at now, you know, um, this is such a rare and unique thing
*  No one really knows too much, you know, i'm getting some people that are saying no no way
*  And then i'm getting these other, you know specialists and people that have really dealt with it that are like yeah, it's okay
*  I am like I said, it's indefinite
*  How I just want to i'm 36
*  So you're in this
*  I mean realistically athletically this is sort of the last chapter of your career. Oh, yes
*  Yeah, and this is how I wanted to end it, you know as the champ trying to
*  Settment myself as one of the great champs of this era
*  and um, you know defend that belt as long as possible and
*  You know say goodbye
*  um
*  but
*  I still have hope I still have hope that
*  Um
*  If I can continue seeing more doctors and getting more knowledge
*  Um, you know andy foster from the athletic commission has recommended another doctor to see i'm not officially declined
*  For the california state athletic commission at this point
*  Did andy foster talk to this dr wong who specifically said he didn't think it was going to be a problem
*  No, not yet. Not yet, but he recommended another doctor at ucla that actually used to work on the athletic commission
*  Um that could be a big help
*  And I mean this is i'm right in the middle of this
*  So i'm just going to keep seeing more doctors and try to learn more about this
*  And you know if it's if it's really unsafe and i'm not going to get approved
*  ever
*  I finally got to a place where I can accept that you know, and uh, and i'm going to move forward
*  on with my life teaching and doing what I do, you know, uh at home and uh,
*  And with all of my students worldwide
*  but um
*  but as
*  If i'm still getting people like dr wong and the doctor i saw in brazil
*  And I can find more doctors who have experience with this if they keep saying that they think it's okay
*  then
*  Uh, and I can you know have hope of getting approved. I'm going to keep fighting for that
*  Where can you get approved what states could approve you right now?
*  well
*  that's tricky to know because um
*  you know, uh
*  As far as in the u.s. Only new york and california require brain scans
*  and so that's you know a big thing of what I want to talk about, you know, or what I wanted to bring awareness to is like
*  You know all these other states don't require scans. So
*  If you if you fight in those states
*  you know, um
*  It's to me
*  It's of your best interest to on your own if you have the means if you have insurance or whatever
*  Get a scan done, you know to see what what's what it looks like for sure. Um
*  but i'm hoping that
*  Through this we can figure out
*  if cavernoma is safe or not the more doctors I have looking at this and
*  um
*  You know talking about it bringing awareness to it
*  That we're going to learn and understand more of this disease and if it's possible if it's not possible
*  um
*  but i'm trying to keep the hope alive that if if it's
*  Six months a year even two years that maybe I can at least get one more, you know, at least get one more
*  but the thing is
*  Then putting me in a state that doesn't require a scan doesn't necessarily mean i'm going to get approved because these other commissions have a
*  responsibility to speak up and say hey, we don't think it's
*  Of his best interest, you know health wise to to compete
*  and
*  you know, i'm not I don't i'm not uh
*  I'm not against the commission. I totally understand and respect that andy foster is one of the very best in the business
*  He's so ahead of everybody else and he they they opened up a time for me to come out next month
*  And speak with them face to face
*  You know and
*  Get to see the people that are making the decisions and
*  Learn more and understand more of their position and you know how they feel about it
*  Um, and i'm just trying to gather up as much information in the meantime
*  Would it be possible to do that with dr. Wong? I hope so. Um, that's the plan and hopefully a few more
*  um
*  That's uh, that's what i'm working on. That's what i'm in the middle of and until then
*  I'm just going to keep training and trying to stay positive. Who do you have a match with a jujitsu match?
*  Well hasn't been announced yet, but i'm going to be facing
*  I mean it's about to come out. It's less than a month away now. Um, february 21st
*  I'll be facing roberto cyborg in a no gate grappling match
*  Um, is a big fella. Yes. Yes, what was that dude way?
*  Probably in the neighborhood of 240 maybe a little more
*  Yeah, we've had a few matches in the past and he's a great guy
*  He's a legend as well. Like just you know, one of the best ever
*  from my time and uh
*  It'll be fun and that's what I want to do in the meantime is keep myself sharp keep competing
*  Keep training and hopefully get another opportunity
*  But if not at least learn more about this
*  and hopefully
*  you know
*  Inspire others to get checked out, you know, even if you're not in your combat sport
*  You know or doing anything risky just like the same would same thing you would do like to go get a checkup
*  You know, hey at some point in your life it wouldn't hurt. Yeah to get a scan done
*  Yeah, you know, it just really opened my eyes
*  To how we don't know what what's going on up there and something could happen, you know, and
*  You don't have an answer to it
*  um
*  But if you knew what was in your brain, maybe you would have that answer
*  Yeah, it seems like such a tricky situation to be in because if you do decide
*  To do something about it
*  You really kind of almost have to do it now
*  Right because at 36 with a full year off of no sparring at all
*  Or he said six months to a year. So he would have to see you a couple times
*  Maybe do another scan and see where you're at. Let's say six months. Well six months is like an acl surgery
*  Not that bad, right? But a year is like, oh now we're into 37 37 and a half
*  And then you got to get in real
*  Tip-top shape again
*  um
*  If you really wanted to fight again, it's funny. I understand the doctor's position. Why do the surgery if you don't experience symptoms, but
*  Most people aren't fighters
*  Yeah, the the thing is though. It doesn't take away the fact that I have cavernoma
*  Like there's multiple locations and so just removing that one doesn't change
*  The condition so the it's possible the commissions wouldn't change their evaluation just based on the scan with the the other areas
*  Exactly, and is there anything that mitigates this is there any medication or diet or anything that you can do? Um
*  I don't know about um
*  you know
*  Treatment like that for cavernoma specifically, but I did see another doctor recently
*  Through the help of justin rin big pigmy
*  um doctor amen
*  Who's actually a psychiatrist or psychologist by trait and then he?
*  Um, you know kind of went into studying the brain fully and he created the spec scan
*  um, he's released a numerous, you know, um
*  Books that were new york times bestsellers done ted talks
*  And I actually saw him just a little over a week ago. Um, and
*  You know, he has some some different supplements
*  Um, then he recommends he also talked to me about using the hyperbaric chamber
*  um
*  Not the the hard shell hyperbaric chamber because he thinks that might be too much pressure
*  But like the soft one that you can zip up
*  um
*  He thinks could be beneficial
*  But it's more just for
*  overall
*  brain health
*  It might not really make too much difference of cavernoma specifically
*  But i'm going to do it. I'm going to do whatever I can. Um, I want to be healthy
*  Uh, obviously, you know just just for me and whether I get to fight or not, but um
*  You know, like I said, i'm just going to stay positive and in the meantime look
*  I don't want to hold up the division
*  like uh, you know, I don't want to
*  You know bellator is is being
*  Being very kind with time as we're going through all of this
*  But I understand, you know, there's guys out there to deserve to fight for the title
*  Um, and if they
*  Need to set up a fight to determine the new champion, you know, um, I understand
*  You know, i'm going to be over here doing everything I can
*  To hopefully get approved to come back
*  but um
*  You know, like I said, it's sort of an indefinite retirement. I'm just working through this
*  And as people see me competing, I didn't want them to think that i'm just not trying to defend my belt or you know
*  Whatever with one bellator
*  If they have to move forward, you know and make another fight for the belt
*  um and people wondering what's going on with me like this is it like this is what i'm dealing with and through this i'm just
*  hoping to
*  um
*  You know help others that might have the same condition. Have there been any cases of people with cavern over that have gone into remission?
*  Uh, i'm not sure i'm not sure I don't know
*  um
*  Well, I don't know
*  The doctors didn't talk to you about that. No
*  You didn't ask that no
*  That would be like the first thing I would ask like has anybody ever like made this go away
*  Yeah, I don't think it I don't think that's possible it just is what it is. Yeah. Yeah, I mean there's
*  I I wish I I should have brought in the pictures. I have
*  Several little spots. Yeah, I'd like to see it all over. Um, they're actually in my car
*  Um, where's your car right outside go get it. We'll wait. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, no worries man. Let's go wait. No worries
*  Gotta see it, right?
*  I mean how often do you get a chance to look at a dude's brain?
*  I'm scared to go into my brain dude, but there's like pitchforks in there and shit
*  All sorts of like sometimes I wonder like
*  I was googling that there's a something called a gamma knife
*  Surgery gamma knife surgery. Yeah that might is your girl gonna go get it for you. Okay gamma
*  Jamie just found you an option. Well, I don't know
*  He's a doctor he just uh
*  Sides as a producer without cutting open directly. I think it's some sort of radiation treatment. Oh, it looked it looked
*  It looked crazy. I'll pull up gamma knife treatment
*  Need to bring you to some witch doctor
*  And they put this it's I mean I can't imagine what you're going through man and what you have gone through
*  Oh, jesus christ, then you go into the machine like this
*  What the fuck?
*  Okay, so folks that are just listening to this it says brain
*  Stereotactic radio surgery at the mayo clinic and it looks essentially like an mri machine
*  Uh, and they got this guy bolted down his head. Well, it's kind of screwed into this fucking harness
*  So I guess you can't move and they roll you into this machine and what does this machine do?
*  I think it then does this I saw this picture in a video of it where I guess radiation just hammers your head
*  I'm planning on going to this place the mayo clinic. They're gonna make you smarter. That's what's gonna happen with that
*  You're gonna get superpowers and shit
*  How dope would that be if you came out if you came out of that and you could read people mind?
*  Would you tell?
*  I wouldn't tell anybody. I don't think I would if I came out and I'd read people's minds
*  I just shut my mouth and just let all these assholes a lot of me
*  That's a crazy looking machine man the fucking this the harness on the head
*  Holy shit, that looks uncomfortable. Do you take a pic go to that lady?
*  That lady right there with the white thing. She looks so uncomfortable. Look at her. She's like, ah, go in there with my head
*  Yeah
*  Are you girls at the door? Okay
*  All right. Here we go. We got the uh, the scans rafael's brain dun dun dun
*  Um
*  Um, so this uh, this is a treatment for cavernoma
*  I was looking up cavernoma. Yeah, and this popped up. I don't know
*  I'm sure there's since he's gone to see multiple doctors for it that there's multiple treatments that are going on
*  This seems to be one treatment for a variation of it. That's interesting when you looked up
*  Like how do you get us? I just started digging digging down the hole
*  This is what I found the fact that you can do that while producing a podcast is quite shocking, sir
*  Kudos to you
*  These are just the pictures obviously they look better on the disc. Okay. Oh shit. I can see it from here
*  Wow, dude, that's crazy. Okay folks. Well i'm looking
*  Fuck let me hold this up
*  So people you can see particularly
*  This one is there any claire? That's the one on the outside. Look at that of the right
*  That is a fucking big ass spot on your brain
*  Yeah, you can see there's a few in there, but that's the big boy
*  But yeah, all in all that doesn't look good and that's what I saw when I was on my way to brazil
*  Going to train that would especially you're gonna shoot the box. That would freak me the fuck out
*  You can see the little ones. Yeah that are around
*  Yeah, they weren't too concerned with those
*  Yet it's the big one and a little bit of this one here that's more on the inside
*  It's not big big like that one. But
*  You know all of these are on the outside of the brain. No, just this one inside the brain. Yeah
*  The inside the brain so it's gonna scare the shit out of me
*  That's crazy to look at man. It's gotta be weird looking at the inside
*  Of your head
*  And seeing all the stuff that makes you you all your personality your memories all your skills all your knowledge
*  All in there and it's got weird spots on it
*  Fuck man
*  Yeah, that's crazy. It was heavy. It's it's still heavy, but
*  I'm you should put that on your instagram
*  Well, this is my
*  My coming out party, I guess you could say fuck man. That spot's creeping me out
*  But you know, this is a hereditary thing that you the the extreme ends are you live with this and it's never a problem your whole life
*  The other side is it's a problem right from the beginning and you have to have multiple surgeries and bad things happen
*  You know people go into comas
*  seizures
*  even death and
*  so
*  You know, uh, you could have this and not have any idea about it. Obviously like just like me
*  um, and so in so many ways
*  The fact that I fought, you know
*  helped me
*  understand because it was required for me to get this done and
*  Thankfully, um, I found out now before anything happened
*  But I want to learn more and try to understand this and see, you know, because so many people
*  Say, I mean look I can show you the doctor
*  letter
*  um from dr. Wong
*  And look at the percentages that he's talking about here
*  Uh, you know 0.25 percent, you know
*  um, I don't know if you want to read it, so his his concern is that
*  Well, he doesn't have a concern the athletic commission's concern is that the the european commission has
*  Rejected you and then california is taking the opinions of a panel of doctors some pro some con
*  And but you think that this dr. Wong guy is the one who knows the most about it
*  He's the first one that I found and he's definitely the one that i've talked to that is
*  The only one i've talked to that's actually been in there seen it
*  You know done surgeries on people and help people continue their careers that have it and you said boxers and football players
*  NFL players, so those are he mentions that in his letter. Yeah
*  What about jiu-jitsu are you concerned at all that jiu-jitsu with the you know
*  hard no
*  no, um
*  I mean there of course there's us accidentally butting heads or an elbow or something. Yeah
*  but
*  No, but believe me that day that uh that a doctor did say that, you know a choke or a strangle
*  Um would be dangerous and I had the thoughts or anything in my mind of never being able to jiu-jitsu again
*  You know training such a geek guy you want a choke like this
*  Well, i'm both but you're both for sure i've done a lot of that I know but you automatically went
*  Look at these hands, man. Look at that. That's that's from gi. Wow this thing in my hand, but what is that? It's like a
*  Ruptured tendon or something. I don't know it just burst and you just left it that way. Yeah, basically
*  It was like almost 10 years ago
*  Someone broke my grip and it popped
*  but
*  For me, it's like
*  I train with my dad, you know what I mean? Like we roll together
*  my
*  You know my family teaching like all my students
*  But jiu-jitsu is that's going to be there forever
*  um
*  and you know, it took a lot of soul searching and
*  and talking and just sort of meditating and you know getting to a place where because
*  You know working so hard to get to this point
*  um
*  You know and seeing those big shows and finally, you know gonna start getting paid
*  Well, you know what I mean? Like working up to that point. Yeah, you're the champ now
*  Yeah, I just got a new academy and definitely was thinking that
*  You know the the championship fight paychecks were going to help pay off the the investment that I put into the school
*  um, you know and just different things and I you know have worked so hard for but
*  I felt like it was kind of getting taken away from me and um, and I had to really process and talk to all my loved ones and
*  And i've gotten to a place where you know, i'm i'm I know i'm going to be fine
*  Like if I never get to fight again, you know, I still have so many things to be grateful for life is amazing
*  And I just want to now
*  You know learn more and hopefully through this experience help others
*  That may have this condition or something else if I can just if someone if I can just help people get a scan
*  You know and just know and be able to rest assured that they're okay
*  Or learn to find out that maybe they have something that they need to take care of in their brain now
*  Is this a condition that will require you to get regular evaluations to make sure it's not progressing?
*  Yes, so how often do you have to do that now?
*  I think at least once a year if not every six months, um, just to see if they're growing or new bundles
*  Come together or whatever
*  I'd really like to know if people have cured it or if anyone has ever gone into a period of remission where the
*  You know those
*  Things went away
*  Yeah, i've never seen or heard anything like that
*  Yeah, and they don't know what causes it it's just some sort of strange genetic yeah, I think it's hereditary
*  Um, and I and I believe it's you know from what i've read it's more common in the hispanic community
*  Um, and that's the doctor that I saw in ucla. He said that and
*  He brought up, you know being there in la that he's seen a lot of hispanics with it boxers
*  Um, but they were able to continue fighting. So I wonder you know, um
*  How that worked? Yeah
*  And uh, and that's what i'm trying to learn about and figure out and see if it's safe or not
*  Um, I don't want to do anything dangerous to my health
*  but
*  If it's possible and it can be done in a safe way. I definitely want to continue, you know
*  I just now feel like i'm tapping into my
*  My mma black belt level now
*  so if
*  Doctors come to a new more
*  In-depth understanding of this disease and what the consequences or the risks are it may be possible that they would say
*  You know what?
*  We were a little bit hasty or we didn't we didn't have all the facts now that we do we feel like you could fight
*  I think so. That's what i'm hoping for. Yeah
*  That's what i'm i'm trying for and this mayo clinic thing that you're gonna you said you're gonna visit
*  Are they supposed to do that same thing to you that crazy?
*  I'm not sure bruce banner thing. I don't I don't know. I don't think so
*  Um, I should ask them to do it just for the fun of it
*  Let's find out what they can do
*  Yeah, i'm just gonna keep trying to see the best people that I can
*  And so, um, is there a guy like a nationwide guy like one person that stands out?
*  That's a cavernoma expert that you should see or have you seen basically those guys yet?
*  Not that I know of. Um, I mean the mayo clinic was definitely brought up
*  Um ucla which i've already been and i'm on uh, there there is another doctor that works out of ucla
*  That now specializes in in um
*  pediatric neurology
*  um, so
*  You know he deals with kids now, but he
*  Uh was on the athletic commission. He was on the board
*  Um is one of their doctors for like 10 years and we just found out about him and i'm trying to get in to see him
*  um as well
*  To get more
*  more light on people that actually have you know
*  Sort of experience dealing with combat athletes that may have this condition
*  and uh
*  You know just get more knowledge and and see what what's possible what's safe for me
*  Um, and like I said if I don't get to fight again
*  I'm now in a good place to be able to accept that and move forward. Um
*  But i'm i'm hoping that I do even if it even if i'm 40 even if it takes that long and I could just do one more
*  So I can I can say goodbye, you know on my own terms, you know
*  And and have one more ride with my family with my team
*  You know if that's if that's what it takes. That's what i'm gonna do
*  Um, I just would love to have one more at least if if it's safe. You've got to take some
*  Some
*  Good feeling out of the fact that you were able to overcome that camp because that seems like
*  Probably one of the most trying times of your career
*  I mean that that's to to go through all that to find out about that while you're flying to curatee
*  But blow your hamstring out get through all that stuff and still beat gator bin sassi to win the title
*  I mean that it is that is an amazing accomplishment. Thank you. Thank you, but it wasn't just me that's
*  You know, that's uh, what I really wanted to get out there like
*  If it wasn't for my loved ones, man, there's no way there's no way I would have got through that. They gave me the strength
*  they
*  They uplifted me when I needed them. They
*  I I felt like it was all of us, you know, and uh, and I just wanted to
*  Make them proud. I wanted to
*  I wanted to be
*  The one that made them world champion coaches, you know my my my muay thai mma coach maricio
*  He is so good. So special and I wanted him to be able to say i've coached someone to be a world champion
*  You know, he deserved it. I wanted to be the first he bedo shi jitsu
*  Mma world champion representative, you know
*  um
*  I it was it was family, you know, we we did that together
*  And um, you know, i'm just forever ever grateful for them and you did it against arguably
*  One of the toughest guys in bellator if not in the world in that division
*  I mean gayguard mousasi had beaten chris wideman. He he's beaten so many top guys
*  He's in my opinion like one of the greatest middleweights of all time. I mean, he's just a phenomenal fighter
*  I was actually really bummed out when he went over to bellator because you know
*  I I saw the negotiations go south and I was really hoping that he was going to stick around
*  I wanted to see him fight for the title. I wanted to see him versus robert whittaker
*  I wanted to see him versus yolo romero
*  You know, um, so your accomplishment was even more impressive considering that you beat that guy. Thank you
*  I appreciate it man. I'm bummed man. I'm bummed for you, but
*  i'm also
*  I'm also happy that you were able to pull off what you pulled off and I mean and you have your health, you know
*  You and you can still compete in jujitsu, which you obviously are incredibly accomplished at that as well and think about
*  How we were supposed to fight in la first?
*  Who knows if I would have gotten improved there right and then this doctor from ireland somehow missed it
*  He wasn't a part of the panel in the discussions before the fight
*  It really was destiny that I was able to do that fight and i'm just so grateful
*  That it happened and obviously i'm i'm very happy that I won but either way
*  The where I had to dig to to to be successful in that fight and the experience the the journey
*  learning
*  So much about myself and and the ride that we did. I mean we had this dinner the night before
*  Um the fight and after the weigh-ins and everything with all my most cherished loved ones, you know
*  Um, and they didn't know they didn't know
*  Most of them didn't know just a couple of them
*  And everyone took a minute to say something special
*  about
*  the process and and
*  You know me getting to this point and and you know, they're they're my rest my wrestling coach and jujitsu
*  Salah was there, you know all these people
*  Um, my my parents my girl like they all said something
*  special about
*  The family that we have us being together and then me, you know getting to that
*  getting to that moment and uh,
*  everyone cried, you know, everyone took a minute and everyone cried and
*  You know that is something that will live with me for the rest of my life and
*  I'm just so grateful that it happened and and we got we got to be there and uh,
*  and you know
*  Because it there's so many factors where maybe it wouldn't have happened and I like if we would have fought in l.a
*  The first time who knows if I would have gotten approved right?
*  But it went to london and somehow this doctor didn't see it, you know, and
*  Yeah, i'm just this part of you think it might be better if you didn't fight again
*  Like even if the doctor did approve it is this part of you think like why why risk this?
*  It I can't say that I haven't thought that
*  You know
*  but I feel like
*  You know with the ones that are saying that it's okay
*  It's just confusing. It's confusing. Yeah, you know, i've been very confused for months for months
*  But that's why I just want to learn more and joe. I hope
*  Here very soon you get a scan done too. You know, I hope everyone i'm scared everyone out there does
*  No, I really should I think we all should I think you're absolutely right
*  I think that's very good advice, especially coming from someone like you that just experiences
*  Incredible turnaround in your life this big twist of fate
*  um, so
*  Bellator is aware
*  Where you stand? Um, have they talked to you about stepping down and about having a new title fight or are they?
*  Prolonging it and waiting to see with more results and more different doctors
*  We're in on this. We had a good conversation yesterday. I got together with scott and rich and we all sat down and
*  Um, you know, once again, they're being super supportive
*  Uh scott's like man keep keep fighting this thing like keep seeing more doctors and
*  You know, uh, let's let's learn more and see what's possible, you know
*  um
*  And they've been very generous with the time, you know, uh and not seeing anything to anybody
*  um, and they were
*  They were okay with me taking more time
*  but I told them that I felt like this was the best route because i'm
*  i'm also sort of pleading to anyone out there if you know, you have a lot of great minds on the show and a
*  Lot of great minds listening to this show if there's some doctors some neurologists and neurosurgeons out there that that have
*  Um, you know experience and and would like to get involved in this process
*  Please reach out. I would love to
*  To hear it, you know
*  But uh, you know, uh, they're supportive
*  And you know, they're willing to wait a little longer
*  Or they were and I said hey, you know, uh, I want to put this out there now
*  Um, and so who knows i'm kind of giving them the green light
*  Uh, if they want to do something different here coming up in the spring and set up another title fight
*  Um, in my opinion, it should be salter musasi for the 185 salter has definitely earned his shot
*  um
*  He just got a big win and and if they did that I would be
*  I would think those are the two most deserving people to fight for a vacant title
*  um, but um
*  You know, like I said, i'm just gonna be over here. This is what i'm doing
*  I just want to let everyone know this is what i'm going through and what i'm working on
*  And I hope to be back in a healthy
*  Way that everyone's confident with and you know, rest assured
*  but if not
*  You know, then I will I will have to be saying goodbye officially at some point
*  Um, but I believe that um, you know, there's some
*  Some some things for me to still do with the company with bella tour scott was open with the idea of me
*  Maybe me being some sort of ambassador, you know
*  um
*  and uh
*  And you know in the meantime, I just you know
*  All the other mma fighters out there that are fighting that have never had a scan done in places that don't require it, you know
*  Hey, uh
*  Please get checked out get checked out and just know, you know, whether it's this or something else, you don't know, you know
*  um
