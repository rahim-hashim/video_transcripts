# Joe Rogan Experience #1418 - Don Gavin
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 23, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPDRlhgblZg)
*  3, 2, hello Don Gavin. Hello Joe Rogan. Good to see you sir. It's good to see you, it's been a long
*  time. Yeah it's a pleasure to get you on here man. I'm thrilled to be here. We've talked about you
*  I don't know how many times, many times. I've heard that before my son, he says you mentioned
*  my name glowingly. Yeah well hey man you were a giant inspiration to me when I was coming up.
*  That's good to hear. Well you know I've talked about this so many many times but that era of
*  Boston comedy when I started in 88 and you guys had already been through the ding ho and all that's
*  been gone and it was the heyday of comedy it was an amazing time and you know I was very fortunate
*  to be able to see guys like you and and Sweeney and you know and all those guys Mike Donovan
*  and Kevin Knox and I mean you go down the list over and over and over again Lenny Clark and
*  which is some amazing time for for stand-up back then. Yeah that was certainly the heyday.
*  I came in I started it around 79 and it'd been going on for one or two years but going on meaning
*  not much going on you know and then it built and built and built and then to the point that
*  that explosion as you said wow it and and I always like to think people talk about a Boston style.
*  There wasn't a Boston style other than being very aggressive maybe. Yeah. There were but everybody
*  had different ways to do it because we didn't know it wasn't like an LA style or New York style.
*  There was just all different approaches coming out to the same end. Yeah you started in 79 so that
*  was really like the beginning of comedy clubs right? Yeah well they weren't even comedy clubs.
*  You mentioned the ding ho. Ding ho used to be a like a saloon and the guys that were sitting at
*  the bar and we first went in there they refused to leave so they stayed at the bar and all they
*  would do is when we put somebody on the up on the stand you know they'd turn around and say shut the
*  fuck up we're trying to drink here. We couldn't get we couldn't get rid of them so finally we
*  were able to help because they could so tired of hearing the microphone but that was that was
*  just a drink that's all you can say you know and became a Chinese restaurant. Yeah.
*  So it wasn't a Chinese restaurant at first? It was just a saloon I think you know and
*  and then suddenly this guy came in it was supposed to put comedy in there and Barry
*  Kerman was one of the guys originally Lenny, myself, Sweeney as you mentioned. Yeah. DJ has
*  people like that Jimmy Tingle and there was a bunch of us that came in at that time and once again
*  no particular one style other than the fact that we kind of created that the headliner would be the
*  host. Yeah that was a weird Boston style like when you have the Don Gavin show yes you would go out
*  there and host and you do a few minutes in between each comic. Right. Yeah and well we didn't know it
*  was weird because I wanted to be in charge and if Joe Rogan went on and you're supposed to do 15
*  and you do great great now Bill Johnson comes on he blows I'm going to go up and take the mic after
*  about six minutes yeah that was that was Bill Johnson and then go on to the next cut yeah and
*  then at the end that headliner would close the show. Yeah. So you had that much control but when
*  you started doing more and more shows like I started Nix in Boston initially it was a joke it
*  was supposed to be a tax write-off and they tried to sabotage it that used to be a stake joint.
*  Really? Yeah. Nix stake joint and so when we did it one week the stage was collapsed next week there'd
*  be no no sound next week no lighting the doors would be locked and then eventually more and more
*  people coming in then they got upset because we were getting in the way of the people going to the
*  steak pot and then they said well maybe we can make money on this we'll go upstairs there was
*  an upstairs there and that was used only on one night of the week for Greek belly dances
*  where they were paid two hundred dollars the next was two hundred dollars in fact these Greek belly
*  dances the productions they brought in their own liquor so they only made two hundred dollars for
*  the whole weekend so once we were going up there to one show then show and eventually and around
*  the time when you came in we were doing five shows my night on Saturday night five shows in
*  the same place upstairs and downstairs. Yeah I remember that that was before I was getting paid
*  so I was really an amateur but I remember watching there was a show in the upstairs room right and
*  then there was a smaller downstairs room and then there was another time where they did it in the
*  disco right they had which is it is a disco now right if it is a very sad disco well it was sad
*  then too yes but it was strange that everyone was cycling from room to room right and you go from
*  upstairs to downstairs and again the first week we tried that with the fire show you were trying
*  to host it was impossible to go but yeah I mean the guy on the side of the stage was going you're
*  supposed to be on downstairs I'm going well I haven't just I just started up here and it was
*  so confusing that you get on stage and you say good evening ladies and gentlemen have I ever
*  already said that? It got to the point and also with a few drinks involved by the fifth show
*  yeah there was some repetition sometimes. Well that was the thing that was also about uh that
*  was interesting about Boston comedy was that the partying like they you guys were a bunch of
*  fucking savages I mean that's what I remember. Uh yeah it was pretty widespread at that point
*  but again we didn't know uh and almost all of us get in trouble with the IRS because you get paid
*  in cash right and then you just kind of forgot that's what I said to him when I got called in
*  I hadn't paid taxes in seven years and I got called in and I said to the guy I thought it was
*  humorous they said oh I forgot and he didn't think there was that humor so so that didn't that went
*  on and on and on and on and on to finally get that cleared up. How did they catch you on something
*  like that? How did they calculate? Because I was on the cover of a calendar magazine in the Boston
*  Globe there was a group shot of about eight ten of us and there was my picture and this guy had the
*  picture and you know when he confronted me he goes how come we don't know anything about this so you
*  know did they pay for this? What do you do for me? You know used to be a teacher where's that money
*  you know so yeah so that was how I got caught so a little bit of infamy of fame I guess that I had
*  this went yeah everybody got done in with the IRS. Wow. I know Donovan he got done in. Oh the whole
*  crew the whole crew. How do you clear that up like how do they decide how much you owe? Oh that's
*  certainly that's a give and take type of situation they have a an appeasement thing I mean I had guys
*  knocking on my on my door at seven o'clock in the morning and and then you'd have to meet with this
*  guy and then that guy would get fired and would start all over again and and lawyers and yeah it
*  wasn't it wasn't pretty but it finally got cleared up you know they they took extra money they knew
*  they weren't going to get the whole thing so they took some of them. How many years did it take to
*  clear it up? For me it was quite a lot four or five years I think. Wow. Yeah yeah. Jesus Christ how
*  much they hit you for overall? At one point I was a little behind I think it was 128,000 and that was
*  the figure that they came up with and but 90 80 percent of that was in interest on the you know
*  the fact that they didn't pay them the 400 dollars that 400 finally would go up to 1500 dollars you
*  know so that's how the the deal was but somebody somebody thought it was a gold mine to attack
*  the entertainers and that was us once once they got one they get another another and the dominoes
*  kept falling. Oh did anybody skate did anybody wind up actually paying their taxes? Oh almost all of us
*  no but did anybody like not get in trouble? Oh yeah there were some a few intelligent people
*  like who? Other ones the ones that had families and yeah it's come the normal ones I guess that
*  actually paid yeah the ones that were not at those parties yeah. There was a thing about you guys
*  though like it was for us young guys coming up like you guys were like Peter Pan's like you were you
*  were living this life as you know Boston's a very blue collar place right very hard working place
*  all of New England and we stumbled in as amateurs as open micers to this environment that you know
*  where you guys were the kings and you guys were fucking wild men like there's we heard those
*  stories Nicks would pay you in coke and it's just everybody was drinking all the time and it was
*  like everyone was laughing and yelling and I was like how is this possible how do these men get to
*  live this life? And when I was doing my first I was a high school teacher yeah I was so teaching
*  and doing this that getting out of the clubs at three or four in the morning and then attempting
*  to be a teacher about three or four hours later. When did you quit? I got out of teaching in 84 I
*  think so I did maybe crossed over the two together and that was that was a rough patch there because
*  I knew something had to give yeah and I tell the story that I was coming home from teaching
*  and not from the clubs at night but teaching and I fell asleep at the wheel and this was on the
*  highway and I was hitting the stanchions on the side of the highway bang bang bang bang and eventually
*  as I'm going down this gully you know you'll have to pass in front of you no what passed in front of
*  me was how am I going to make it to the show tonight and my head went through the windshield
*  I came up climbed up out of the gully and I'm trying to thumb to get home and I've got blood
*  running down his face I had no idea how bad it was and then I had to go to the hospital so I go
*  my friend we go back and I was going to get the car out of the gully the car was total you know I
*  mean beyond total and there's hair and blood on the windshield I said oh I better pick one
*  job over the other so the comedy comedy won't help. Did they have open mic nights in 79? Oh no
*  in 79 no. When you first started what was it like? Well the first time there was only one place in
*  existence that was the comedy connection and the little one the one on warrenson street yeah yeah
*  probably yeah yeah 150 seats at two and two guys ran that yeah I think there was Sean Mori was the
*  guy that had been on the tonight show so that's in our days that was like oh my god you know so he
*  ran a comedy class and two guys took the class Billy Downs and Paul Barkley and they decided to
*  you know maybe we'll do this comedy thing but again people didn't know what a comedy club was
*  what you mentioned that like when Jay Leno was way before us there wasn't no comedy clubs he worked
*  maybe strip joints or like at an auto place or this or that there was there was no place to go
*  to and even people say what's a comedian you know other than watching tv you didn't know really what
*  stand-up comedy was even so so the beginning of it started off slow and I remember my first paycheck
*  once I got paid eight dollars that was your first eight dollars yeah wow and I still have that I
*  have done a copy of the checks do you really know a copy of it I actually cashed it I needed the
*  eight dollars of course yeah but so that was what Billy Downs and and Barkley did that and in those
*  days you are auditioned instead of a open mic night so it was just the two of them and I had to
*  go in front of them and I looked at the two of them I said I don't I don't I don't really like this
*  because I said I don't know at least one of the you two are not going to understand what I'm doing
*  you know because you really don't look like a brain trust yet and and I got hired and I immediately
*  was really good and the next show I did was really good I'm doing the same 10 minutes because I was
*  a bartender and had some patter right and the third one they called me like a night before and
*  said you know somebody fell out can you come in and what I had done I had written 15 minutes of
*  comedy that day sure yeah you know but in my mind that's what I thought and it was the worst death
*  of the world that's I got about two minutes in and people always say you know what happens when
*  you bomb well you don't you don't really don't you don't really bomb after you've been doing this for
*  a while but that two or three minutes seems like an eternity you know it was I've seen like hours
*  and then I just went back into some of the old stuff and I get out and I actually got into a
*  fistfight with Lonnie Clark about it because he was he kept on saying me you know do you work in
*  New York where you know you've been I said I've never been on a stage before in my life you know
*  and so we were not friends at all at the beginning and we got into we got into a little go at it and
*  he got set up this well he said yeah he said oh that was a great set he was shitting on me
*  and his friend saw him with witness to the fight and broke it up and he says to Lenny he goes he
*  goes he said what's all about it he said he said you just said he had a good show he sucked he knows
*  it let me and you're being an asshole to call him you know call him out and when they made me
*  we became fast friends after that that's hilarious yeah Lenny was the second guy I ever got paid to
*  open for really yeah the first guy was um god damn it uh Warren McDonald McDonald yes wow right
*  Bill McDonald's brother it was uh George McDonald's brother yeah wasn't it Bill McDonald no
*  it was there was George and George McDonald was the host of the open mic night he could have been
*  yeah yeah wasn't there a Bill McDonald too didn't he have another brother named Bill uh
*  not that no no I'm fucking it up no Kevin Kevin was a fighter Kevin McDonald that's right Kevin
*  wound up going away for a little bit yeah he visited that's a couple places a couple places
*  yeah that's right yeah that's right okay I fucked it up right so but I opened up for Warren we
*  opened up for Warren and Norm LaFoe gig in western Massachusetts very good memory yeah that one yeah
*  Warren was one of the original way back yeah and then another Norm LaFoe gig was uh when I opened
*  up for Lenny wow that was Jays in Pittsfield did you ever do that one I don't remember that no
*  that was a good one really yeah it was a good one three and a half hours away and well worth it yes
*  well it was for me because I got I got to know Lenny and Mike yeah and just to get on just stave
*  time yeah get on the stage yeah yeah because there were so few places that were in effect doing
*  comedy but but during the time when I was an open mic or things exploded I was very fortunate
*  that was when there was three clubs on warrenton street alone right right there was nix there was
*  the connection and then there was a comedy club of the charles above the connection that duck soup
*  that was across the street yeah but do you remember when mike had the comedy club at the charles above
*  the comedy connection for a brief period yeah yeah so there was three and then there was duck soup
*  that was on the other side so it was four oh within like a hundred yards crazy and they were all
*  packed yeah and their lines would be out on the street the middle of winter I remember going out
*  at my show on the sati there's people there were two inches of snow on their head and I'm going
*  you're actually waiting to see me there's something wrong with you people yeah it was something
*  magical about those times because comedy clubs just overall were only a couple decades old
*  in the whole country I mean you had the earliest ones were like comedy magic club comedy connection
*  catch rising star in new york right he had a couple of clubs that were open before
*  you know before the the boston explosion but this is all real recently so like imagine an art form
*  that takes over the entire country and it really only started in the year 2000 yeah the from the
*  incentive that's what it'd be like from the inception to the explosion yeah it was not a mature
*  art form at the end maybe 10 years 12 years right you got lenny bruce in the 50s george carlin in
*  the 60s prior you know and then all of a sudden you're in the 1980s this is it's a couple of
*  decades and these clubs were fucking packed I mean I really wish somebody had done a documentary on
*  it back then because it was such a strange time if you could get real footage what I know fran
*  solomita had that one document when stand-up stood out but I would like to have just shown like how
*  crazy it was people were scalping tickets yeah I said oh my god but it wasn't anywhere else like
*  that chicago never had an explosion like that boston had the weirdest explosion and there was
*  a multitude of people that were talented yes it wasn't just you know a few there was a lot
*  because I used to go down in new york and you actually had a scene in the in LA had a scene
*  but not nothing as expansive as that and and why I started after those two had already been done
*  yeah the boston scene was a different animal because you could work everywhere the thing is
*  you could work in town and you can get paid in town you could do you know although it's all the
*  different places say it again played against sam's right stitches stitches all those different clubs
*  but then there was all these satellite rooms all the dick dory rooms and all the connection had
*  rooms and boston comedy had rooms they were everywhere there's hundreds of rooms and they
*  were good rooms and then I think that the demise at least like from the real apex I think came when
*  the comedians were no longer running the clubs that you know his owners came in and the greed
*  factor and every every corner store you know if a tire company would go out of business oh that's
*  a comedy club now oh the gas station a bowling alley so many bowling alleys to be working in
*  those days and so one after another and I think what happened was it gets so uh diluted that
*  people would go to a show and say I don't know what oh this is all about this forever because
*  it's this is they didn't get to see the good community right well there was a there was about
*  12 of you you know there was like 12 murderers who would just run around and to this day I swear
*  I tell everybody I think they're the best comics I've ever seen in my life to this day there was
*  moments at the at the uh next comedy stop and it stitches where I'm like that is about as good as
*  standard comedy ever gets and some of those moments like the the comedy stop next comedy
*  stop used to do a dirty trick when a famous comedian would come into town yeah yeah an outsider
*  they would have some poor bastard like uh you know like um you know fill in the blank you don't even
*  need to name it just someone who didn't didn't do comedy that often richard lewis let's say him
*  he would be the headliner right but before him would be you and sweeney and kenny rogerson and
*  donovan and it would just be a murderer's row of fucking savages yeah uh mike mcdonnell yes
*  and this these poor bastards I saw I came to next comedy stop right after billy crystal had bombed
*  I like came up the stairs and they were talking about it like you guys had set them up
*  and you know people were saying like you never seen nothing like in your life this poor guy's
*  a movie star and he went on stage just ate plates of shit yeah after yeah after five people had just
*  been destroyed destroying for an hour right like so you got like each guy's doing 15 minutes and
*  you've got all these guys going up there just and it wasn't unintentional it was oh yeah why is this
*  guy in our town yes yeah yeah that's it well that was the thing about boston like when a guy came
*  like if you do stand up in any like you do stand up in philadelphia like if you showed up in
*  philip people go oh let's go see don gavin they would want to go see you right you do stand up in
*  boston you from out of boston everybody's like fuck this guy they just just set them up and the
*  club would set them up that was what was so crazy well the reason the reason they would bring these
*  outsides and they would get plugs possibly for on the tonight show or something like that none of
*  us were on the on the on the scene or on the you know on the on the radar so they would bring in
*  like george miller was the guy i remember you know nice sweetheart of a guy but no he was just
*  what you said yeah running the gauntlet uh it was before you know before he got off what did those
*  guys think when they watched that they must have been fucking terrified richard lewis went on tv
*  almost in tears complaining about and they put all the scars in there you know where they got all
*  these guys and and and i did it the first night and then they did a second night and i don't
*  understand what they have against me and and and i think she said well maybe they're funny
*  you know i was one of those comments yeah well it was uh it was a dog eat dog world there you had to
*  be able to survive in boston and the the tension span like the way the the stand-up was it's like
*  they didn't let you guys like i should say they you didn't let anybody breathe there's a boston
*  style of comedy it's like here's a fucking punch line there's another punch line there's another
*  punch line take a breath boom there's another one and these other guys that would come in from
*  out of town were not accustomed to that style of performing more laconic and yeah like this
*  and i i was told that i talked 70 words a minute gusts to 100 yeah i have you know i'm going to
*  those uh phs tips and i play some of those one time recently i'm going i have no idea oh i know
*  why there's people laughing but i have i have no idea what i was saying oh my god yeah well you
*  had sneaky punch lines you would sneak punch lines in it would look like you were done and the sides
*  would come in and boom or a tag here and a tag there and move over there did you just develop
*  that style on your own yeah i didn't again what don't i know about style i just that's just the
*  way it was i was always a fast talker you know you come from big irish families and if you don't
*  talk fresh you're not going to get the bread or you're not going to get the food so yeah you know
*  so i had three brothers and uh and downstairs my cousins lived there were six there so you know
*  so there was always bang bang bang bang bang so that and was all everybody was an irish catholic
*  basically that was on the comedy scene you know yeah it was certainly not homogenized by any
*  means well that's also interesting too because it was in a lot of places it was more of a jewish
*  thing sure sure but boston it wasn't boston it was like a lot of and big guys too that was the
*  other thing everybody was like six foot three everybody's a big af fucking gorilla yeah and
*  they're all doing coke and drinking and it was like whoa this is a crazy place it was almost like
*  well you better be funny and also if a fight breaks out you'd be better better be good at that
*  yeah i just be sort of good but certainly you're not backing down but that was this thing about
*  it's like comedy and a lot of people's eyes is thought to be something that like nebbishy
*  you know sort of insecure people get involved in you guys were all fucking savages so it was
*  weird for me because like people would say oh i always felt like comedians hated themselves
*  they're all real insecure i'm like i didn't really see that like you not not where i started i can
*  remember battle at the ding hall that i mean it was a pretty good brew at the end it started
*  i think it started outside the club as they were coming in and it emanated that it was inside and
*  outside at the same time and at the end we don't we ran over finished doing the show and at the end
*  all people were talking but nothing about the show was just but hey man that tingle really held
*  his own didn't he you know i said you don't ever see so and so with the two headlocks and this
*  and they're going what about the show oh yeah that was good but then nothing to do there was a lot
*  of brawls i remember brawls i remember a lot of brawls breaking out of clubs but it was just to
*  me i didn't realize how lucky i was to start there in in 1988 i really did when you came in
*  in the beginning i always thought when you came in i'm saying wow this guy has good something but i
*  thought it was a little too dirty i thought i thought that wasn't going to work for you but you
*  are but you knew kind of you had it in your head what you had to do you knew that you had to measure
*  up or you could be pushed to the side yeah when you came in don't you agree with that well there
*  was not much room you know you had a you had to be good like even if you wanted to go from being an
*  open mic or to hosting or to getting a gig you know on the road you had to be good boston didn't
*  leave you any room for for scrubs there was it was too many right too many good comics yeah that was
*  definitely dirty but i was that's all i was interested in you know i mean like when i was
*  21 i was a fucking savage all i cared about was sex yeah sex and i came from fighting yeah so like
*  that's all i didn't know anything like so it fit in that one yeah what i thought was funny was
*  you know just it was kind of and i was talked into doing comedy by guys that i trained with
*  right so i didn't think that i was funny i didn't think i was going to be funny i made them laugh
*  but i thought well you guys are fucking psychos of course i'm making you laugh my my sense of
*  humor is wrong it's all fucked up they're gonna think i'm an asshole so i was talked into doing it
*  and uh the first comedy show that i ever saw i went to stitches open mic night and uh i went
*  and watched and i remember seeing going sitting there watching all these guys go up on stage and
*  seeing people do it for the first time and i realized oh a lot of people suck like you could
*  do this like i'm better than that guy i'll probably be better than some of these people at least
*  yeah when i first came in that audition thing i talked about i went in a number of those people
*  were talking about were on stage and i was prepared to do this audition i was with this girl at the
*  time and she goes what about the audition i go no no i don't think so so i just i just left but
*  didn't even explain it and i went back the next week and then again real good guys but there was
*  one guy i won't mention his name you you wouldn't know the name but i'm going oh finally someone i
*  know that i'm better than this guy and that's when i auditioned that night but he got me in the show
*  business i will mention his name gene friends was his name he may still be alive i don't know but
*  he has no idea that he got me into comedy so well that's richard jenny said that once that
*  that's the purpose that really bad comedians serve they inspire people to try it it would work
*  it's there's something real to that but i remember uh my first open mic night um
*  when when i went up you know i it wasn't very funny but uh i got to see teddie bergeron teddie
*  bergeron performed that night and he fucking lit that place on jonathan katz was the host wow yeah
*  jonathan katz was the host and there's a guy you talked about that was kind of uh you know a
*  different different directions different style smooth yeah and so slow easy going yes and yet
*  he was a fan favorite yes hilarious great comic and then went on to do that cartoon dr katz yeah
*  which i did that yeah that was fun yeah but watching teddie go on stage this was teddie was
*  in his prime it made me want to quit i was like oh jesus christ yeah he had been he had already
*  been on like the tonight show and then the gold diggers with dean martin and stuff so so when he
*  was you know when he was sober yeah on his game wow oh my god yeah to this day he's one of the
*  best i've ever seen he was so smooth yes yeah i'm a polished where a lot of the other guys were
*  rough-edged yes it was different and he had more pauses and he was like he's slow he dressed well
*  and yeah he almost stood out just because of that but he kind of classy you know he looked like he
*  could do no wrong so when he would have a problem with uh drugs and alcohol i was so confused i was
*  like how that guy yeah i was like that guy's the smoothest ever yeah because you know when i saw
*  him he was like in his 30s he was he was young and just uh fucking on top of it right i got a i got
*  a chance to work with him a bunch of times yeah weird gigs like the mattapoiset inn and this
*  but how do you remember all these things i don't know it's my curse there's a bunch of strange
*  names for places well we had other places down the cape and the one night is yes yes yeah those
*  were great though i mean boy you talk about seasoning you would get a a lifetime's worth of
*  seasoning on the road just traveling all these different places and seeing all these different
*  weird bar crowds and standing on a fucking milk crate doing stand up into a shitty microphone
*  all those gigs and yeah and once i got into it full time that you know that encompassed that was
*  your whole life that you and you were working six nights maybe seven nights a week and probably five
*  or six different venues yeah and sometimes three or four venues in the same evening yeah you get in
*  the car and go over here and go over there go over there i mean i don't know how many years it was
*  before i realized you could date someone that was not a waitress i wasn't even aware of that
*  yeah that was a weird ecosystem right it was like comics and waitresses hand in hand yeah well you
*  know we're just so fortunate that we were from that we started our our our comedy in boston because
*  it was it was a magic time and when i would talk to people that are from like arizona like how'd you
*  start out like well i had to drive two hours to tucson and like fuck yeah there was nothing i was
*  told that when i moved out here for a brief period of time i lived in studio city i was told
*  that i would be driving sometimes two hours to make a hundred dollars i go yeah right right and
*  four months later i'm driving two and a half hours to make 75 dollars i'm going wow that was somebody
*  knew already what was going on here yeah when when i thought i was coming out and signed with the
*  agency spotlight wasn't him oh i remember that everybody was supposed to be the people that
*  ripped everybody off right they promised everything and never delivered on the on the word and so i
*  was one of the few that owed them money because i heard something was going south so when they
*  when they finally called me and they looked to get lawyers about and i sent them a note back saying
*  uh dear so-and-so uh i know that i owe you 35 000 just take it off of what you owe lani clark and
*  we'll be all set you know they owed him like 80 grand or 100 grand they owed him a lot more than
*  maybe more than that yeah yeah but i said just take it off and that never hurt from again
*  i think they beat millennial for over a million dollars yes they beat seinfeld they beat everybody
*  too yeah they beat everybody yeah there was one agent that was a dirty agent that was pocketing
*  all the money yeah there was a bunch of those situations like that though right bob uh williams
*  yeah we're still in the business no yeah out of branson yeah real oh branson that's right leni
*  told me about this that's right yeah fucking jesus i don't know if he changed his name or whatever
*  i changed the entry but he he's in branson apparently he's doing quite well and never
*  paid everybody back no no no wow how does that clean see oh my god if somebody owed me a million
*  dollars yeah but they used to have this thing you know do you like money you want to say with this
*  we'll give you if you make this and this and they you know it was contractually written
*  how old were you back then oh i didn't start comedy until i was 33 wow so i was much later
*  i had been a teacher and a coach and and i had two kids and uh so i get into this much later than
*  most people what brought you into it uh i think probably because i was usually reasonably funny
*  in life and then as a bartender i was a wise guy bartender you know and uh like for instance
*  people would sit i only had 22 seats four guys would sit and say what's your cheapest beer i
*  said root beer get the fuck up screw you know i said those seats i said if you tip me 20 dollars
*  before you order then you can sit there and then people would do it and so so that kind of that
*  kind of mushroomed that way there but yeah it was again the same aggressive bullshit thing so that
*  it was easy to carry that on into the art of the stage but i had never been on a stage i thought
*  it was kind of like you were there a feverish type people you know doing stage stuff you know
*  yeah i got i like how you danced around the words there
*  feverish i think i made a word up even yes yeah it was effeminate yes it was not for manly men
*  yes not at all no i was playing basketball and college and i was waiting either to get picked up
*  to go to the djinn or whatever and there was a play going on in uh you know rehearsals at this
*  college and i'm watching them going and it really pissed me off that two of the actors didn't really
*  didn't seem to be putting their effort into it and i don't know why but i'm going i could do better
*  than that so that was one of the things in the back of my head about being in the state but i
*  had never been i never had a mic in my hand and i used to wear loose pants because i thought they
*  could see my legs shaking yeah and that's why if you know my act i sit on the stove most of the time
*  so i so that way they wouldn't see me you know in effect being you know for the first year or so
*  you shook that much i think so yeah though not in the drug
*  and but the uh and taking the mic out of the mic stand i thought they
*  rattling and there's nothing worse than seeing it you know if they're doing
*  you know this thing bang bang bang with the were the drugs there from the beginning
*  um let me think ah pretty much yeah yeah pretty much make it's like in the old it's like in the
*  old days you know this you know the story about your mother says don't you know if somebody off
*  your drugs don't take them i said well they don't offer you have to buy them but initially you didn't
*  have to buy them that was the thing everybody everybody was doing you know it's like smoking
*  when i was growing up with a kid 95 percent of people smoked and why because other baby ever
*  smoked you know i stopped smoking he had 2000 my clock and i had a bet and none of us were having
*  had a cigarette since so apparently it wasn't addictive but everybody smoked so the same thing
*  in those days everybody was either a drinker or doing that doing the blow or smoking the bones
*  and you had at least two or three vices a lot of a lot of debt chairs to throw off you know did you
*  have any of those vices before you got into stand-up uh no i think it grew pretty much
*  it blossomed once i get in it now they think of it uh yeah i used to smoke there was about it but
*  nothing no nothing else no drinking uh not heavily at all hardly not heavily and i covered
*  up for i made up a lot of ground i can i mean now all the guys are hey i'm like the only one left
*  drinking and i notice it's much more liquor everywhere i go there's always liquor now yeah
*  everybody cleaned up yeah yeah yeah they're they're looking at you look you're the last mohegan
*  yeah it's like uh bobby nickman a comedian and a writer and he said that he first got into a
*  because he needed the stage time you know take it up and talk in front of a crowd but he was one of
*  the first guys that kind of cleaned up and then this guy and then this guy and there's very few
*  now well a lot of guys came from a and that's how they got their start you remember dave fits
*  jerald well sure funny guy yeah he got into comedy from alcoholics and honest because he
*  would go up on stage and tell these crazy old drinking stories and people would laugh and then
*  he polished those stories up sure made him tighter and then started doing stand-up yeah um but uh it
*  it uh when you in the we'll say in the mid 80s the early 80s if if you weren't a drinker you were
*  the exception of the rule again wow so you weren't a drinker before not really you just started
*  hanging out with these guys and was not blaming any of them on it no hey look i'm not even but was it
*  right away like just you just walked into this lion's den of people doing drugs who was the
*  fucking who's patient zero like who because it was wasn't that many of you right well i think that
*  i think that it it came to a culmination at the ding hole because we basically ran and owned the
*  place and we'd stay there until i can remember walking on them many times going ah beautiful
*  it's not even light out yet it'd be six thirty in the morning right but we were serving drinks and
*  half the people they'd be 10 12 comedians sitting around and and four or five other guys and the
*  other guys are cops they're in there drinking with us too so we weren't going to get busted
*  i mean kenny wrighton first got there he walked in the door there he got there i don't know how but
*  he got there around two in the morning and there's six or seven of us you know they're either smoking
*  joints doing doing some lines and drinking and we're up on the stage playing cards you know for
*  money and he goes where is this place paradise yeah he had no idea he goes someone said we went
*  for drinking who were the tequila drinkers and everybody goes nobody you are so so then he's
*  getting all that stuff so and he he made up for lost time too that was what we had always we'd
*  always heard about the ding ho like it was like some legendary place you know when we were starting
*  out it closed in like 84 or something uh i don't know about the maybe yeah right around there
*  i started in 88 and we had heard about the ding ho it was like it was spoken in hushed tones yeah
*  it was like you know that's where it started well closed in a heartbeat because the the owner lost
*  lost the club and playing chinese dominoes no he lost 240 000 dollars in one night and it was my
*  night then i had my show there on fridays i come in and i never saw uh chains of padlocks bigger
*  than that in the front and back door never to be reopened as a comedy club it became a
*  indian restaurant except but it just went playing chinese i don't even know what chinese dominoes
*  are that's good probably god i mean it's it's crazy how something like that can happen where
*  there is just this one place and one core group of people and then the comedy club scene branches
*  out from that like houston used to have this place called the laugh stop did you ever work there yeah
*  that was the same thing for houston houston had a great scene houston was a little crazy
*  it was wild too yeah it was wild yeah yeah and when i first went there it was when it was at its
*  wildest it was after kinesin had gone and bill hicks had left and all those guys were gone
*  and yeah collar bowl was yeah yeah uh jimmy pineapple yeah jimmy worked with me the first
*  time i ever did a weekend there and the first time i was ever there i was like wow this place is like
*  a lot like boston like early like these are a bunch of wild fucks they had an open they had a
*  show going on in the main room and then in the bar area they had another stage and the open mic
*  night started at eight went till two o'clock in the morning so you get done with your show the show
*  be over at ten and you go out to the bar and you'd be fucking hanging out there for another four
*  hours because the show's still going on yeah it was it was crazy it was because i don't remember
*  a good story there i was you used to walk from the hotel to the venue and i'm and it was all the you
*  know cowboys basically down there and so i get i'm walking i get hit in the back with the water
*  balloon but you would have thought i was shot with shot by a rhino gun you know bang i think
*  i was soaking wet when i get there i had to put on one of their t-shirts and i'm going i can't
*  believe how how this guy hit me that could so when i get to the club i see the car it was
*  recognizable i go they oh they're coming to see me so i went inside got a hammer and went out
*  during the show in the opening i broke every window in their car including the directionals
*  the side thing and i comment on the stage i got hit by this water balloon i said whoever did it
*  nobody took climate i said what but what a great aim you had and but i didn't mention about their
*  car that's hilarious did you go out and watch oh yeah check to their window what they do they were
*  not i mean i put i wrote those little tiny you know directionals on the side of the car i mean
*  every window because anybody can flatten it yeah if you break every single window that's
*  that's an accomplishment that is an accomplishment and that's a lot of work to get that fixed
*  yeah it was especially with no lookouts you know change the tire pretty yeah you had no lookouts
*  but that scene the houston scene was similar in that there was a lot of drugs involved a lot
*  of really funny comics but and aggressive too yeah very aggressive yeah well texas you know
*  wild fuckers down there but when that club closed that scene died out for a long time it's
*  apparently it's got a resurgence now the scene's coming back yes there's some real good comics
*  coming out of there right now but that scene was dead for a long time it wasn't wasn't much
*  going on down there and like i was like that's interesting how a scene like a place as good as
*  houston could close down with one club one club goes under and the whole thing just throws well
*  they have lived that happened in chicago chicago used to be a terrific uh city it was my favorite
*  city to travel to fall comedy they had an improv they had a catch they had uh the la factory uh
*  they had you know not just second city because that's different but and that was in the same
*  thing zanies is i think is the only one that's still in existence yeah and and that went off the
*  cliff right away too and again i blame owners you know greed and not paying people and things of
*  that type wow they start treating it like any other business yes comedy clubs became that a
*  business it's a asylum that needs to be run by the inmates yeah yeah that's exactly and when we ran
*  it when i booked all these shows yeah there didn't seem to be any problem we i think we
*  weren't making much money but we didn't seem to care you know whatever you made you spent
*  right so if you if you had 800 bucks in your pocket wow that's it i got 800 dollars you know
*  yeah not not thinking about you know i guess i might want to eat next week too next week is next
*  yeah yeah that's that's way in the way the comedy store works is essentially that way i mean mitzi
*  obviously ran it but she let the comedians run it for the most part right you know she let everybody
*  work out their own issues and solve their own problems and she would just book you right just
*  tell you when to go up and it was just a madhouse yeah and to this day still very similar still the
*  thing oh it's packed every fucking night now now it's crazy because the internet now people hear
*  about it and they know about it and you got people flying in from australia and england and ireland
*  just to come down and see comedy all the time all the time always meeting people there that are they
*  they basically have comedy tourism from europe they fly in to the comedy store like any night of
*  the week because the comedy store on monday they'll post the schedule for the week show and so people
*  read the schedule and they go all right let's fly in on tuesday so they'll fly from fucking england
*  11 hour flight and come and see see comedy wow because there's no comedy club like they have a
*  comedy store over there in london but it's not affiliated they just stole the name and they
*  skirted into international law by you know it's like they made their own 7-eleven we're 7-eleven
*  too like it's not the same thing i don't know what the comedy is like over there in terms of
*  the comedy store but you know they when they want to come here they they fly and so on any given
*  night you run into people that are from all over the world wow yeah it's crazy you should come
*  yeah it's not you should come just to see it you know years ago way back but i haven't been around
*  it's different now it's fucking madness yeah lines around the block i mean it's like in a lot of
*  ways it's like nicks in the heyday three rooms there's the original room the belly room in the
*  main room all three of them are going at the same time multiple shows a night fucking madness well
*  yeah it's it's it's nuts but without the coke there's no coke no fights it's really pretty
*  yeah it's pretty that used to be a pretty uh pretty scary denizen out in the back there yes
*  it used to be yeah it's it's much more calm there's a lot of marijuana that's about it okay a lot of
*  weed sometimes mushrooms but that's about it yeah so nothing nothing too crazy yeah but it's funny
*  when we were doing it uh even though we were doing it for a living it was
*  seemed like it wasn't a business yeah like that's why i'm promoting this album that i have
*  and uh i had this album done before and it was great but i never had anybody produce it you know
*  just made some copies of it it's called don don gavin live with the manhattan live with the
*  manhattan and i was almost like a bootleg i sell them you know maybe a few after show at the back
*  of my trunk but finally releasing it that's one of the reasons about it now when did you record it
*  i recorded it in 2011 and well something 10 years ago but my material hopefully doesn't get stale
*  it's because i don't do a lot of current events and i don't do politics so it's still uh
*  i mean i have uh some jokes that are older some of the people that come to see me now did you like
*  when you when you put that out is that the first thing that you've ever put out yeah that's the
*  only thing and i and i owned it but i didn't do anything with it so now when i get to uh to a
*  virtual comedy network with jose sir excuse me with jimmy serpico he uh we did another album a
*  compilation of guys in boston and he uh saw somebody says about me my album because
*  i know he had an album and he got a copy of it but oh my god this is something like discovering
*  something so he kind of came into my life to help out see if we can produce this thing and now it's
*  on serious xm now and pandora and then it's going on all the streaming devices starting next week
*  but right now it's uh uh i think they have the uh what do you got the rights just for those
*  two stations so if somebody wants to get it how they get it right now they can get on a serious xm
*  all pandora and as of i think next thursday it's on streaming live and okay because if it's on
*  serious you have to wait for it to air right you can't just it's a serious doesn't stream right
*  i gotta be honest i'm not good about any of this i don't think so do they stream jimmy you probably
*  searched it yeah they have downloadable stuff and whatnot oh okay so on the app as opposed to on the
*  actual thing that you in your car okay yeah i am so i and everything mechanical well i'm proud that
*  i think you sent me your first text ever oh yeah which took me almost an hour and a half
*  because i'm going okay here's the t here's an h over here you know i mean that's how slow i was
*  in doing that but you used to teach you don't know how to type no now i had girlfriends and
*  i went through a bunch of them because i had to write a lot of papers and so
*  now i never type one one letter so that's legitimately the first text message you ever
*  sent and you thought it was a joke and that it was oh thanks no mike clark was telling me yeah it
*  was my friend and then i sent the next one i realized you could use the microphone thing
*  and it came out in some foreign language latvian or something that i sent you well it's because
*  of your fucking accent no but this was yeah i know but the iphone's probably what the fuck is he
*  saying that's probably it yeah and they said well eventually eventually they'll get used to your
*  voice apparently not no it's never going to figure out your voice no that's for regular voices oh
*  shit okay the accent is too crazy i still have an accent oh yeah a little bit yeah but the thing
*  about like all those guys from that day is very few guys put things out you know barry put out a
*  couple specials and louis ck produced one of barry's specials lanny of course had a few things he was
*  on the danger field special he did some stuff but a lot of like dunovan like how do you go find
*  donovan's best stuff like you got to go see him yes yes that's that's the craziest thing about
*  boston it's like these guys are world-class stand-ups some of the best that have ever done it
*  and there's no recordings well i think this special i think that i was not unique in in the
*  fact that i was not a businessman yeah we just we did it for the not just for the love we enjoyed
*  the money and that is spending money yeah but it really never entered my mind like jimmy was asking
*  about you know today how did i release this thing i never i don't know what you mean released it i
*  just made a thousand copies and i saw a few after show and that never did anything with it you know
*  you never thought once no i'm an idiot but you must have seen all these hbo specials and all these
*  different things oh yeah yeah yeah eventually you never like yeah i should do one of those yeah yeah
*  maybe yeah maybe maybe i'll get discovered so at the age of 106 so now that you've done this and
*  now that you're releasing this do you think you'll put out more oh i plan on this opening
*  hope hoping this is going to make a difference you know because uh for years i was called the
*  best kept secret in boston and in comedy and i'm going you know what i'm kind of tired of that
*  term i'd rather not have a secret anymore i'd like to maybe maybe get out there and well you can still
*  get out there i probably 100 percent the whole thing about the internet is just content just keep
*  putting content out what you have your hilarious comic so i'm sure your album is awesome people get
*  a hold of it and then they'll go hey where's the next one put out another one next thing you know
*  you could tour nationally yeah i really firmly believe that i hope you're right no i guarantee
*  i'm right it's it's just a crazy thing about that scene is that no one did that everybody stayed in
*  boston because the money was so good there was so much work and he didn't have to yeah you basically
*  didn't have to go to him because you had worked there yeah so it in a way it spoiled you but a
*  way it spoiled you rotten you know the other right you never really attempted to make it and do it
*  you know some guys did get that gumption to go up to you know to new york and some came out to la but
*  as a rule a lot of us just stayed in boston how long did you stay out here when you came out here
*  oh just about nine months and people said what you like about i said the weather and that was about
*  that was my only answer what was it like going back to feel like home like i felt like i really
*  hadn't left you know i just moved to florida a couple weeks ago so that's the first time i've
*  ever what are you doing in florida uh getting warm and yeah yeah it's a good time to move to florida
*  middle of january yeah well that's going to be i hopefully once i get things unpacked i'll enjoy
*  it there but the you know there's a lot of clubs down there and there's a lot of corporate stuff
*  and then i do a lot of the golf things and that kind of stuff and i do a lot of cruise ships and
*  then most of them go out of this so it's about time i moved and the weather primary that's the
*  primary the weather yeah it's a big difference but i would think that after all these years you're
*  going to miss headlining the boston clubs i will i will yeah but uh i've been working less and less
*  in the boston area because i do a whole lot of these cruise ships things you know and the cruise
*  ships that industry has become bigger and bigger and bigger i mean i just got off a ship
*  the four or Caribbean 6100 passengers on it whoa yeah that's a big boat i live in a town in the
*  hunt and remember that near marblehead yeah 3 000 people living the whole time they just double
*  that on the on this ship you know that's insane yeah yeah do you like doing those cruise ships i
*  enjoy it a lot of a lot of downtime you can read and write and like you said maybe a second of them
*  yeah i've got material for you so we'll see if we can get the first one up and running how do you
*  write do you just sit down mostly yeah do you just sit down with an idea or do you have an idea
*  ahead of time you jot them down like in little notes and then try to flesh it out like like this
*  you know just this thing oh like right you got right yeah whatever you know that type of thing
*  i like i'm simple this is not a whole joke but just the other day i'm thinking
*  about stoners you know and it says why can't we where can we kind of why can't we just all get a
*  bomb so i thought that was that's that good i didn't say it was good you write stuff you throw
*  it away i didn't throw it away right so these ideas pop in your head and you write them down
*  and then do you flesh them out on stage or do you flesh them out on paper on stage you know but you
*  know that if some new thing you know have to figure where am i going to incorporate you're
*  not going to put it first you know how to close with it right you got to weave it in somehow
*  sometimes i'll open with the thing really yeah it's kind of ballsy because i want to dig a hole
*  i want to see yeah because i sometimes i feel like i know i got some good jokes that i could
*  do after this let me just see you've got the notoriety and fame so you feel that uh that
*  that is a strike against you that they're going to be acceptable to everything is that why you've
*  it's a strike against you if you eat shit yeah yeah that's that's what you open with something
*  that you're not sure of yeah well i've i gotta know there's something there before i do that
*  but i like to do that sometimes because maybe four out of four out of ten times
*  a punchline will fucking pop into my head out of nowhere and it'll be good like i one of my
*  best bets from my last special about harvey weinstein came the day he got arrested the day
*  his shit went down i went on stage that day and i had i had a couple drinks in me i was feeling good
*  and i just went on this rant about it and this is not something you're getting already written
*  out no no i had a couple sort of ideas about where i was going to take it and the basically
*  the gist of it was that if like all of you if harvey weinstein did this to my daughter i'd want
*  to fuck him up like all of you i go but if harvey weinstein was a woman if harvina weinstein came
*  to my son with a solid contract i'd be like dude you're gonna be batman and this is the this is
*  the gist of the bit and i'm telling you that dude you're gonna be batman came out just came out on
*  stage and the day he was arrested everybody's going fucking crazy it was and then i was saying
*  like nobody nobody gives a fuck it was an ugly old lady that was fucking handsome young men
*  nobody would be mad right nobody would be mad and it just became this giant chunk of man i'm like i'm
*  mad at that guy he's disgusting fuck him lock him up forever but if harvina weinstein and then i so
*  this did the audience believe that you just didn't know or did they know you just came up but at that
*  point they knew that it couldn't be old because the thing just happened yeah but sometimes like
*  four out of ten times that'll work right and then the other six out of ten times you go well so much
*  for that yeah move on but it's like the only way new jokes get made his chances get taken and the
*  biggest chance is to go up first with it just open with it i'm gonna have to attempt that i don't do
*  it all the time but i feel like the first couple of lines anywhere more like just saying hi and
*  getting to know everybody and every now and then you throw one out there and it sticks and you gotta
*  go oh i got something there i record all my sets i'll listen to it would you have trouble remembering
*  a if you did a particular thing yeah because especially if you have a couple drinks in you
*  and you're just riffing you don't remember exactly what you said because you're in the moment you
*  can't go oh i gotta remember that because then you'll break the spell my son chris does that to me
*  all the time saying dad is that that's something new i go no i just said it he goes well you gotta
*  write this shit down well dunovan is the guy who convinced me to record all my sets yeah dunovan
*  told me get a tape recorder he had all this fucking this brick that he would bring on stage with him
*  he goes he goes you never know he goes you'll have a line just one line and that line will make your
*  bit 10 times better and if you fucking forget it you it's gone forever yeah it's like quick you have
*  one when you're in bed and you think of something if you don't get up and write it down or if you
*  don't record it that next morning you try to remember that good luck to you when i'm with
*  my family i will if i got an idea in my head i just say to my wife got an idea and i just run away
*  i run away i'll run like a block away and just start talking into my phone because if i don't
*  it'll go away yeah yeah because i've had so many times like oh that's a good idea and then my daughter
*  i was like stop touching me they'll fight with each other and my wife over there what are we
*  doing and i'm like hold on i got an idea stop stop stop so now when i get this idea i just go i got
*  an idea i just go and then i come back i got a good idea this is a good idea this is solid okay
*  i'm back i like it then i'll put my phone in my pocket but having a phone is the best because
*  you got a notebook you got a fucking recording device it's all that i used to keep a real notebook
*  but it takes too long to write shit down you lose it sometimes but you if you were to say it into the
*  voice notes you actually say the idea then you can keep it you can capture it but you have to
*  that means you have to carry your phone with you yes you don't carry your phone i'm an idiot again
*  i don't carry your phone at all i do now but now that i'm trying to be aware of what's going on
*  i mean up until like two years ago i had a real deluxe flip phone you know there's something to
*  be said for those too though yeah the flip phone's nice yeah you can certainly avoid people yes that's
*  one yeah avoid text mat ari arshafir he has a flip phone he doesn't well actually doesn't now he
*  actually went back to an iphone but he put a timer on it so he can only use his phone for an hour
*  well yeah because otherwise he starts playing with his phone and going on the internet and
*  going to social media apps you don't have any social media do you uh we will soon oh we're
*  in the process now that's it that's the deal so 2020 yeah yeah i just i just uh i'm kind of a slow
*  mover like a turd that's racist by me are you gonna do it all yourself are you gonna post
*  tweets and all that shit yourself oh shit i don't know about that i just found about instagram
*  today i thought there was a pill that you took but uh so the i'm on instagram now as of like
*  yesterday oh what is it just don gavin uh comedian don gavin how many pictures you got up there

*  gone he he gave me a lot of gigs i have nothing but love for that guy really starting out yeah he
*  gave me a lot of gigs he paid my rent many times well he had a lot of little clothes yeah like his
*  satellite clubs yeah the huts comedy huts yeah the aku akus he had one time was uh when he was
*  he was a musician yeah way back it was dick darty the majority yeah he was like the highest paid

*  dick darty comedy vault remember the vault yes yes right that was another one the vault was right
*  down the street from warrenton street not far at all right right across the street there yeah yeah
*  he had a ton of rooms yes he did yeah yeah and and uh he oh yeah that's true i mean he did work a lot
*  more comedians than than other places didn't have that many avenues yeah well he would headline
*  you early too like where i really probably shouldn't have been headlining really didn't
*  really have a solid 45 was patched up but uh fit simmons and i started out together we were like a
*  week apart we started a week apart from each other open mic nights yeah he mentioned that yeah we did
*  a little funny and you didn't know each other previous no no no we met each other like at open
*  mic night that's funny yeah both same age it was it was fun times but we both have the same feeling
*  like we would talk about you guys you know like you and all all the guys that are from that era
*  it's just like it was a we were very very fortunate to be able to because there was no
*  hacks like hacks were not tolerated in boston no yeah but and even the audience i always thought
*  the youngs were great but they weren't patient either no you had to you had to produce and produce
*  quickly they had high standards too yeah because you guys were so good like the standards of comedy
*  the level of comedy was very high in the town yeah i remember i had a friend of mine who came
*  to visit me from new york uh and uh he was shocked he was like there's so many good comics
*  here that nobody knows and i was like dude they know him in town they know him in boss these guys
*  are selling out every fucking night and he's like this is crazy and i was like yeah these are like
*  the best comics in the world and people don't know who they are it's funny colin quinn was one guy
*  he came into boston and the people but when they introduced him he's from new york i mean he was
*  getting booed before he said a word and then he's gone oh my gosh you know and but they got the
*  crowds did eventually like him yeah but when he first worked there there was a sound booth
*  on the side of nicks and he hid he got off stage and hid in the sound booth until the show was over
*  because he didn't want to have to walk through the crowd he was in there he was in there for over two
*  hours i'm not making that's hilarious well the first time i saw doma rara was at the at nicks
*  comedy stop and he went through the gauntlet and survived oh he that the people loved him he they
*  loved him well he's lovable yeah well he's a great guy but he was the only like national
*  headliner that i ever saw that went through there and made it through yeah yeah and and and with
*  flying colors yeah so he killed and even at the end of it he was like he said uh he goes ladies and
*  gentlemen uh thank you for coming tonight i was amazing you guys are pretty good and like he just
*  the sarcastic silly way of doing comedy he was the best he fits in anywhere oh yeah yeah but he fit
*  in boston like a glove i mean that's where first he's a philly guy yeah and that same kind of thing
*  he was a pretty good jockey one day he was a pretty good basketball player yeah yeah so i so he had
*  kind of the same type of mentality as some of the some of the people he's still fucking great yeah
*  he's still fucking great he still kills the comedy star all the time yeah he's and he's always on the
*  road too he's fantastic he's uh he's a real comic you know there's a few of those guys it doesn't
*  matter where you put them you could put a show on the moon and he yeah i think i like rock in the
*  pool sure yeah that just just hey how you doing and he gets a laugh yeah you get a laugh for that
*  it's a good laugh yeah yeah it's um i mean when you think back on your life could you imagine
*  yourself have ever i mean i know you were a teacher at one point in time but can you imagine never
*  having found comedy uh i'm very grateful that he did find it i think if i was teaching it in
*  a different venue where i was teaching more advanced kids i was in a vocational school where
*  they didn't want to do you know one week they'd be in shop the next week they'd be with me
*  and they didn't want to be with me you know coaching was different i coached basketball on
*  track and that was terrific and i spent most of my energy in that but uh so i think if i was in the
*  right surroundings as a teacher i would have stayed in teaching you know and probably uh have done a
*  lot less of the evil things to my body and but maybe i wouldn't have found comedy but you've held
*  up well you intellectually you're still there i mean i haven't seen you do stand-up in a long
*  time but i know everybody says you're still fucking killing well it's still working yeah and
*  you're the one guy that's still drinking uh that i'm aware of yeah but i don't really look around
*  that much but that did you ever think about quitting no not really no not at all oh when i
*  was in the hospital i had a hernia operation but then rogers and smuggled some booze into the
*  hospital so that was it yeah yeah he brought he brought in the thing of a varka and a claw
*  and a magnet so he's gonna he's gonna pull out the uh the staples that i have you know the steel
*  staples you put in when you get stitched up he thought that was funny he went he went and stole
*  a big magnet that's funny but he didn't bring booze into the hospital how long were you in the
*  hospital four oh just you know whatever four or five days so you almost quit for four or five days
*  oh yeah almost almost yeah do you never like when you see all these guys going into a and cleaning
*  up you never went huh maybe uh maybe that's for me no no never never did i mean we stopped the blow
*  and all that stuff right but i never was much of a smoke smoke or the grass but uh the drinking
*  you know that's pretty consistent with that you find something you like stick with it when did
*  you stop the blow oh oh a long long time ago yeah yeah but um i don't even remember exactly when
*  80s 90s you don't see any people doing that i don't know i don't even know is there still a
*  scene where people do not comedy no no not a comedy scene with blow not that i know and you
*  remember like we talked about you said the comedy stuff was you know you could go don't sit there
*  you know because it'd be similar headlines under this thing don't go over there and wherever you
*  went you know well they would offer to pay you and get the giggles in tamper florida they honestly
*  do you want all your money and blow or do you want some cash i go i'd want it all in cash and
*  then if i wanted to get ball i could do that i mean you can't go into a grocery store and say
*  you know i got these three items is this line big enough that doesn't work is that place still around
*  that giggles i don't know i don't might that's where you get the name from you know my class
*  by the giggles and sagas but uh i don't know but that was another one of those real successful
*  clubs at one time as you know there were great clubs in a lot of places and sadly most of them
*  have gone down yeah i'm mentioning the comedy works in denver it's a still one it's still great
*  oh it's still great that was such a successful and still is such a yeah i always thought that
*  was one of the best-run clubs in the whole of the united states well wendy the lady who owns it runs
*  it she's fucking awesome she's been around from way back i go to see her every time i'm in town
*  and sometimes i still even work that club really yeah i work that club too i'll alternate between
*  the big theaters then i'll go back to her club i love that place was electric yes and she's got
*  another one she's got a yeah once i rebuilt another one yeah she's got a second one but yeah
*  there's uh you know the zanies in nashville still really good right there's a bunch of real good
*  clubs still on the road well maybe i'll rediscover these i'll stop going out on the ships i've been
*  out floating too much maybe i'll come back yeah you would enjoy it now if you did do that would
*  you take someone on the road with you like how do you do it when you do the ships is it just you or
*  somebody with you just me yeah how much time do you do uh varies you know usually you do like a
*  headline spot you do like a 50 55 you know and do two of those but that you can do the same straw
*  you know that type of thing so so you only need you need like an hour and a half stuff total
*  right i guess is what it was but it is kind of a lazy cement job you can do the same sets you know
*  that's right i just found an interest in talking to you about incorporating something new at the
*  beginning that's uh that's gonna be challenging i'm gonna try that it's not i've never tried
*  never tried it the best idea i think is probably to sandwich it in between established jokes like
*  you have a joke that you know is gonna work you get their confidence and then you slip in a new
*  one yeah and then but every now and then i'd like to open with a new one just to see what the fuck
*  is up i like it just to fucking test it take that little colt and see how it can run on those legs
*  kitty up yeah you know yeah no fear joe i got some fear believe me but sometimes that fear is what
*  makes the punch line comes out yeah you know the the punch lines that come out of note you know
*  how it is like sometimes you ad lib and it'll just come out of nowhere like where is that what is
*  that coming from when you have an idea and it just pops into your head and makes its way on just and
*  and then it gets a big laugh and then you know it's the right thing to say right there right you know
*  it and just out of nowhere now and you know the other thing you travel everywhere is there one
*  particular area that doesn't seem to click as much canada canada can eat really just that one
*  statement shit all of canada can go fuck off really yeah my friend chapelle lacy i told him how bad
*  connecticut sucks and he was just there this weekend and he sent me a text message he goes
*  you weren't fucking kidding this place is terrible i wasn't expecting that one one place from new
*  england something about brook island great road island's fantastic new jersey awesome love it new
*  york love it connecticut eat shit wow wow when i was doing the travel the only place i had one that
*  they positively hated me memphis oh well i talk way too fast and i also speak english and uh they
*  boy they hated me yankee yankee i said no the red sox you know they had their own
*  queen and uh they they booed me again like like before even going on stage and they had one of
*  those clocks like the ones they have that was in uh back to the future that ping-ping clock was
*  you can see it and you had 45 minutes and i'm going shit i gotta be close to done i look up
*  i had done 11 minutes my god this is how i got off stage and went table to table and heckled
*  people at the stage then they went back on stage and realized i still had 15 minutes more to go
*  oh my god they hated me what year was this uh seems seemed like it was a whole year when i was
*  there just during the one week that was so quite quite a while ago that's all but they i mean they
*  and i did i was there for the week that's the point so it wasn't like anybody was saying hey
*  you gotta see this guy people were saying you can't you shouldn't see this guy and it was it was
*  hard does it suck every night yeah yes yes yes it did yes it did yeah it was so bad and it was
*  we had harold boyle there was like a thunderstorm and and you know you know the ones that there's
*  only 20 people going to be there was sitting there for this not 20 people we don't do a show
*  right we had 16 people and i'm going how beautiful we're going to get paid don't have to do a show
*  and two cars come up i went out and knocked in the windows he said oh yeah we got terrible plumbing
*  problems see you guys later come back come on see you later and i forced him to leave so i wouldn't
*  have to do the show oh my god that's hilarious boston comics one of the things about guys that
*  when they would go on the road they had so much regional material boston comics had so much boston
*  comedy right yeah i don't yeah you don't i was gonna say that like sweeney has a lot yes yes like
*  sweeney in boston is a goddamn murderer sure but some of that stuff he can't do in other places he
*  has to kind of rearrange his acts yes yeah yeah mine is more it's always been more universal yeah
*  more observational than yeah and i don't really have many boston per se boston jokes other than
*  something about the accent but that's it that's about it but uh now i can ask you one end of the
*  where's the other end where's where's like a favorite um i love texas texas is probably one
*  of my favorite places to go yeah i love austin i love dallas i love houston i love going there
*  really yeah they're wild fucking people i mean they're the remnants of the wild west right that's
*  what it's like i mean they're the wagon trains that made it all the way to california and a bunch of
*  people made it to texas and they went we're good right it's gonna stop right here and they're just
*  wild it's just a different kind of people they're real friendly real real nice folks
*  it's one of my favorite places to go cool i love it now what about uh foreign countries like england
*  when you mentioned i love england i've been to england a bunch of times doing stand-up that's
*  great they're fun they like to drink yeah i did it too but i did a tour there they did like me
*  especially the drinking part oh they're rowdy people i met a bar when everybody's doing the
*  shot i said and i wanted some ice and the guy said oh and everybody's drinking just shots and
*  and beer and i'm drinking liquor and i said i wanted some ice and the guy goes oh the ice
*  machine is broken i said well when i was about 10 i went back i said a lot of times if you hit it
*  some ice will fall out of you because well it broke over a year ago i said oh okay never mind
*  forget it they're just not interested in ice yeah if you buy a soda over there sometimes like you
*  get a glass of soda it comes with no ice nothing like what is this where's the and then when i did
*  australia australia was fun that's kind of a rowdy place too oh i love it over there australia's
*  amazing and they get into just willing to the women that's just show stuff out to you yeah not
*  necessarily heckling but just show them things you know what do you mean by that you know
*  they like to drink there too yeah i did a whole set over there about uh halloween and it went
*  absolutely nowhere and i and i kind of rewrote next night nowhere and i'm saying why is this
*  thing not working and it's a guy says to me what is this halloween they didn't in those days didn't
*  celebrate halloween there he said you send your kids to strangers houses to beg for candy why not
*  for food when they go get food or money i go halloween he didn't know what it was that now
*  they have halloween but as it like 20 years ago they didn't have halloween halloween is only 20
*  years old in australia yes yeah that's hilarious yeah and you would think that would be a universal
*  thing but it was not they have a lot of comedy over there now yeah i mean they they have really
*  funny comics now especially in melbourne they have uh yeah i love melbourne that was a Melbourne's
*  great the comics lounge i performed with uh tony hinchcliffe there when i was there back a lot of
*  comics from la fly over there and do that place yeah you mentioned to get richard jenney i work
*  with him over there at the hilton which is right across from the tennis center where they play the
*  big australian in australia yeah richard jenney was one of my favorites god damn he was good
*  terrific he was so good he's like probably in my opinion one of the most underrated guys ever
*  yeah yeah you know where to this day like people forget how goddamn good he was and he's prolific
*  too oh so prolific yeah you know you remember eastside comedy club in long island yes yes he
*  worked at eastside comedy club in long island i remember it was me and a couple of the other
*  guys that were were there were were stunned because the host said i go hey how was uh jenney this
*  weekend he goes not only did he murder was it he not only did jenny murder every show but he did
*  four different hours wow he did a different hour two shows two different hours friday two different
*  hours on saturday he goes he did four different hours he goes he didn't repeat a joke and he goes
*  and he was on top of his fucking game on fire and we're and like that was like 80 i guess it was 91
*  92 yeah he was if he wasn't the best in the world he was right right but he was so honest about
*  this i said you know you're something about your life he says there's two things in my life comedy
*  and porn and he said i spent a lot of time on both of them that was that was a cult well that's why
*  he was so good he was he was obsessed yeah i mean he was a an interesting cat it was a real bummer
*  when he killed himself yeah he was uh for sure one of my favorites i got to see him live a bunch of
*  times and what i loved about that guy is he would take a subject like save the subject with cigarettes
*  yeah he would beat that subject into the ground he would find every fucking angle he would cover
*  every piece of every possible way you could talk about that bit kind of like when george colin would
*  take a bit that i would have you know an idea a premise we'll say right i could get three and a
*  half minutes in he'd get 15 minutes yeah of gold yeah yeah yeah but jenny would be like punchline
*  punchline punchline god damn he was good yeah we've seen a lot of great comics in our day
