# Joe Rogan Experience #1462 - Kurt Metzger
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 23, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17pIBFcGB0k)
*  And we're live hey look at you so I blunt I know I've this is your celebratory blunt
*  Holy shit, dude. I'm still a little bit
*  That felt like getting an AIDS test
*  But you clean I know it's but you knew you were healthy you feel good. Yeah, I haven't felt like I had something
*  So you were worried you one of them asymptomatic people yeah
*  They said as many 60 to 70 percent could be asymptomatic right so like I don't want to I don't have open
*  Drive all the way that's why it's such a creepy disease like there was a Anderson Cooper thing
*  I was we were talking about earlier where the mayor of Las Vegas was on with Anderson Cooper. Oh, yeah, and he was
*  Describing to her how one asymptomatic people person can go to a restaurant
*  And it showed this chart of all the people that infected got infected by this one
*  So you try to get infected just the air just the air yeah, so he's trying to tell this is completely theoretical first of all
*  I don't know
*  The people that are saying this from China
*  I mean, I mean maybe they touch the same things maybe there's a bunch of different factors
*  I don't know. I'm guessing it was just because of the air, but I don't trust a goddamn thing
*  They're saying that's coming from China. Yeah, anything. They said if they're saying something. It's been approved by the government, right?
*  You know I mean, it's not like this paper the epic times. There's like a paper that I think yeah epoch times
*  That it's like they'll be critical of China, but I think the guy that owns it is a Falun Gong guy
*  So I've seen criticism well Falun Gong's that that persecuted Tai Chi religion in in China
*  Oh really China's fucking crazy. Do you know times is a multi-language?
*  Newspapers founded in 2000 by John Tang and a group of Chinese Americans associated with the Falun Gang spiritual movement
*  So who is he again?
*  I don't know who John Tang is no no Falun Gang
*  Falun Gong is like it's like Tai Chi, but I guess China considers it a cult
*  what so they crack down on them like they're Uighurs and
*  Yeah, and it's uh yes, just like meditation shit
*  I don't know it's mentioned in Qigong exercises with a moral philosophy centered on tenets of truthfulness compassion
*  Forbearance, holy fuck I might have to join
*  Looking for a good call the epic times guys get I've been saying this for years
*  I want a good cult like come up with a good one
*  Yeah, that doesn't try to fuck me doesn't take all my money, and it's not like they're all you know to bang everybody's wife
*  I'm gonna bang your face. They always play out like that. That's they do that gorilla that fucking classic chimpanzee right right right
*  Dominance thing where you lose face and balls and then yeah
*  Well, I would say Jehovah's Witnesses was a good cult if I stack because I'm not really bitter at Jehovah's Witnesses
*  Well, let's tell everybody doesn't know you because people might not be aware of your background you you grew up as a Jehovah's Witness
*  You're one of my friends that has like the most
*  rock-solid rules are not tolerating horse shit and
*  Because when people start bullshitting and saying nuts you you're always the guy that's like I know where this goes
*  Yeah, well for something like that. I am hyper
*  I am very like hypersensitive to cult II yeah
*  I just don't want to go along with a thing because you have to go along with it and like come on
*  We're doing this that is important. Well. I just that's the reason I left
*  Jehovah's Witnesses of course I didn't want to have that then when I got out in the world that you can't escape it like the
*  People all these people that claim to be secular that that jump down your throat like online or something
*  It's all the same shit, but they just let got rid of the
*  Jesus Christ they just got rid of that and it's a pattern. It's a pattern. Yeah, like I guess a set of habits
*  Yeah, it's comforting a comforting routine
*  I guess but it's I mean the thing when people do it to people like it's it's almost like whether they're doing it because you're
*  Not a believer in Jesus or you doing it because you're not a vegan or you're doing it because you don't support gender pronoun freedom
*  Whatever it is like that hard core sort of you can sort of fit that mind into a bunch of different slots
*  Yeah, there's a this is what I do believe from religious people
*  There is a human need for yeah what religion fails, and it's like you know hey great
*  You got rid of Saddam, but now who's taking over?
*  I'm not so gung-ho on
*  The like we all we need to get rid of like the bill mahr level of atheism. He's like grow up or die
*  That like I think he's not understanding
*  You know people some people need that and and it's not nothing to do with smart or stupid
*  It's a just a very deep feeling of belonging and if you don't get it from God. There's gonna be
*  You know there's worse shit to get it from
*  Yes, yes, there's some moral tenants if you
*  Like you really adopt Christianity some of my favorite people are Christians and pretty hardcore Christians people that are really like well
*  Here's one oh good Chris listen if you ever met a Christian they're delightful just they're like unicorns
*  There's probably like three of them the rest of people are on a football team
*  You know who's a real Christian like in like an admirable sense the word is Chris Pratt
*  Guardians of the galaxy yeah, I've heard that I've never met him one of the nicest guys I've ever met
*  He's so nice and genuine and right there with everyone right he's very religious
*  But I'll tell you what man if if that's what it is it's like if following those
*  Tenants the way that guy does it turns you into that kind of a person. He's an admirable person
*  That's how you're supposed to it's not supposed to be you know you're preaching at people
*  Your behavior is supposed to be the witness right and so people come into it a lot of times
*  That's why they do they go well. I saw this guy
*  I'm like if that's what that is I want to be that you know it's like it's like the God had
*  Abandoned the goofy stories if they just came out and said listen. It's our belief that living in this way
*  With this belief in a higher power and that holds you to a higher standard of behavior
*  If all that along with these tenants you know loving thy neighbor and treating each other as brothers and sisters as if we were
*  All one if we just saw that you just got to stop saying someone came back from the dead you got to stop
*  So even those stories even those goofy stories, which I always would say that was saying that but you know when I left but a
*  Lot of them work is it still work as metaphors you know yes the ones that
*  There's people at all levels of smarts, and they all need a thing to get on board
*  So some people need a goofy story to get on board like I said
*  I don't think that's the linchpin that's harming it
*  I think it's just I don't I don't believe that it transforms people's hearts like there's people
*  That I saw when I was in my in Joe's witnesses that they had a fucked up life that they turned around
*  Okay, but I don't think that that it fundamentally changed anything, but their behavior
*  They were just who they were and this gave them a window to be you know like a good person
*  Scaffolding you just need something to sort of build on a structure hold on to a lot people about a structure right right right so so
*  You know it, but if you're a psychopath. It's not gonna change you into a not a psychopath, right?
*  It's gonna make it's gonna be horrible because you can apply your psychopathic tendencies to the religion when you see that right?
*  The worst of the evangelists, that's what you're saying right you're seeing a con man who's found a tool that's beyond reproach
*  well some of them are just like you know they're like
*  Almost like same as Marilyn Manson when he you know he had his thing that he did Marilyn Manson
*  But he was ultimately like a guy that's gonna play golf like Alice Cooper like
*  He's a hey, man. I'm doing a show here. That's what those guys. You know Steve Martin made that movie
*  What is it called where he's?
*  Leap of faith he plays like a TV preacher and and he because he saw this documentary about a real guy named Marjo
*  Who copied Mick Jagger so he'll go to these churches and do like moves like Jagger
*  For these old ladies, and they and he would talk about it
*  And he was just openly saying how it was a scam anything you're making money off of like that
*  It doesn't go together for you know that's how you know
*  Automatically the guy's full of shit because he's making a ton of money off it if they're a preacher
*  Yeah, you're not supposed to get rich
*  How come Jesus didn't get rich right and especially when you get like arena rich like you're buying a
*  Like what's that guy's name rich enough that yeah, Joel Olsteen. Yeah, see guys come out of nowhere
*  He's trying to do the least hard singers still like pops
*  Yeah, right
*  I don't know about him until they get so huge that they break through the public vernacular like it's like pops like I just
*  Learned who Billy Eilish was I?
*  Didn't know this whole time yeah, she doesn't know who Vanham my sister had informed me about Adele
*  She goes you know that song hello. I go. No. I don't know that song
*  You never had heard it. Just like no no I've been fortunate to
*  Her not in a bad way against which I think she's got an amazing voice
*  Don't you just haven't seen a lot of horseshit? I just dude. I'm you know very talented old white guy who likes rap music and
*  classic rock
*  Hey, I'm just an old one. I like my classic rock. I like Led Zeppelin. I'd like oh, yeah
*  So you knew who was not like Billy Eilish. Oh, yeah, of course
*  Dude Van Halen, but it's just like at a certain point in time. It's like I'm taking in too much music
*  I don't have time for all this new stuff. Yeah, well
*  I was like weren't we just talking about a different yeah something I didn't care about like well
*  You know what's interesting about music is like our lifetimes and our parents lifetimes
*  Like the first times in human history where people had music collected
*  Oh, they could listen to it over and over and over again, right? Yeah, they're our grandparents
*  It was like probably the first like my grandparents came over
*  From Italy and from Ireland in the early 1900s. So when they were coming over here, I guess they had record players
*  But how prevalent were they and what kind of music did they have and like, you know
*  I thought they had like stand around the window of a rich person's house like
*  A
*  Slave cranks the handle but like where was the recordings?
*  You know I'm saying like they weren't that prevalent if there were right there certainly were some, you know
*  They had recorded music before then but it's not like it was on your phone
*  Didn't we send you know that that gold record we sent into space that has like a picture of like a
*  Transphobic picture of a man and a woman
*  Dresses a woman of address the woman has a dress and there's just those two doesn't she just have breasts
*  She's she looks like see if you get it's hilarious
*  You know music oh like yeah blues guy like old old catfish Willie or you know, like some time. Yeah
*  Yeah, just got some cool shit to make us look interesting. It's a very drawing. Yeah
*  It's on goal
*  They sent it on a gold plate, you know
*  It's like a gold plate and then but the drawings made me laugh cuz they are like stick figures like I
*  I
*  Watched that movie contact the other night with Joey fall. Yeah, it's amazing
*  Holy shit is that a good my love it's good, but you weren't in the way that
*  The aliens are like we're gonna look like your dead father because you couldn't handle
*  No, I can handle seeing aliens
*  Is it is that
*  But there's images
*  You got to flip it over to the B side yeah, there it is
*  Yeah, where's the man and woman?
*  Wasn't the last two tits on the bottom where?
*  Where is it?
*  Yeah, I thought there was hmm. Maybe it's something else we're thinking of I
*  Don't know but I swore there were images on that
*  So like why is different discs have different images? There's not more than one disc is there are we sending mixed messages?
*  to them
*  Something's coming up, but it's not a picture on the gold thing are there titties on this record
*  What do they look like is it recognizable?
*  It's it's like a someone just drew it though on piece of paper and like I said, this is on there the pioneer plaque
*  Okay, the well whatever it is in the movie
*  Contact they got that recording and they sent it back to earth
*  Yeah
*  It had a cool like how it might go down thing about it so much about it was cool
*  It's just the end and it was like come on man and the guy who blew himself up like the religious to to brew himself up
*  Like that was a little cartoon. I swear. You're just gonna say the guy who blew himself. I'm like well. That was an interesting part
*  Yeah, who's the guy that blew himself up? I think it's Gary Busey son. I think Jake Busey. That's right. Yeah, he's great in it
*  I met that guy recently and also the idea that uh, you know, it's something he's great in this movie
*  This was like a piece of paper called. Oh, that's it. That's it right there
*  This is not the same as that gold thing. Oh, this was 72. The gold thing was 73
*  Oh, okay. Well, this was the first then and then the record was a different thing. Oh, so they've said okay
*  We conflated it to so go to the image again. Let me see the image
*  Let me see guys the guys don't as it go to the one on the left that one right there
*  Yeah, make that one big
*  Is that what they're gonna think dogs are he's like hi, here's my dick and cheers now most human dicks don't come past the balls
*  And I like how they have the woman built like a real woman. She's not like a porn star woman
*  Well, where's her game a little bit of an ass her penis? Yeah, he's like hi. Where's
*  Here
*  I mean, it's a show up and think we're down to party and everybody's all bundled up
*  Well that that image is showing us how ridiculous we
*  Like assume the aliens would think our clothes are what?
*  Yeah, what if the aliens send theirs back in their fully clothed and like why did you guys?
*  Despise this an intergalactic dick pic and it's an unnecessary dick pic too
*  Like no one looks like that and when they're waving to you, right? That's very like that's sending a bad message
*  I'm naked here. I am. No, you know
*  Hey man, where the fuck did you come from?
*  Can't just look at my dick and balls. This is weird. I like that. They didn't really put a vagina
*  They just put tape like here's the important parts
*  Well, you see the penis clearly and the vagina and then she Barbie dolled they Barbie dolled the the woman is a little Barbie dolled
*  Where's her pubes? Where's everybody's pubes? Oh this is
*  Set this is a porno set. How come they got hair in their head? They don't have hair in their box
*  Well, when was this sent out? They probably did have 72
*  Hairy as fuck. This is misleading
*  This is so they were very futuristic
*  They were really in a porn. They were way ahead of their time. Why does the guy has such Caucasian hair?
*  That's my other question right right what percentage of the population has hair that looks like that
*  It looks like a young gnome Chomsky's hair
*  It's just a weird image it's very weird hi aliens. Yeah, here's my dick
*  But also it's like it's weird and just that
*  We're kind of acknowledging that superior intellects would think clothes are weird is that what that is
*  Yeah, we're letting him know like underneath all our Adidas and our fucking jeans
*  They must have argued about that too. They must have had like a long conversation
*  These fucking the people that are funding this are like really we draw on a dick and send it out to the aliens
*  What who is funding it?
*  I know I mean who was making the call sounds like the cowboy guy from the Simpsons was probably a Nazi. Oh
*  Yeah, that yeah, honestly like legitimate. That's right. Didn't we get all like Werner von Braun or?
*  Dude Werner von Braun was a legit Nazi these to hang the slowest Jews in front of his rocket factory in Berlin
*  Yeah, Jesus in front of every oh, dude this Simon Wiesenthal Center said that he was alive
*  Prosecute him for crimes against human the slowest do they have a race they had something where they would make everybody work faster and harder by killing
*  Oh, he's home all the slow do you that's what put the slowest guys the slowest girls whoever they you know
*  She is the Jewish prisoners and they would hang them
*  Yeah, dude. There's I remember him from like a Disney thing about rocket science
*  He was a part of Operation paperclip right there. He is right there an operation paperclip
*  Imported all these Nazi scientists to run NASA I
*  Knew that but I didn't know part of that. I thought he was always like no I wasn't with those guys
*  I was just look at him chillin go to that picture again
*  Just stop and think about that this dude was a Nazi in
*  Germany during World War two
*  Comes back, and he's running our space program with his feet up
*  Do you want to go to space or you want to get hung up on people's Nazi pass?
*  You want to get a dick pic to space or not?
*  They got this
*  Genius bilingual motherfucker to come over here and show us how rockets are done. They were ahead. They were ahead rockets
*  They were ahead with engineering a telgos
*  They're all head besides because they plug an extension cord into a Jew to try to invent a computer
*  He's a guy that like I don't want him to not be doing stand-up. Oh, I know downtime
*  You know he's I don't know anybody does as many sets as Dave like dude
*  I like call because I know what's him calling because he's got there's no you know it says no number
*  it's like a really ungodly hour like
*  He was killing me dude like he wanted to make a prank show called prankest and it's just Middle Easters doing pranks on people
*  the most inappropriate pranks
*  Like
*  Yeah, he shouldn't be taking time off when do you think we know anything we'll be able to stand up again
*  If I was gonna ask you oh
*  Shit, that's the problem right when everyone can get a test for kovat 19. No the problem is when you think that'll be it
*  I don't know. I didn't I didn't realize that the tests were so just they're around. I thought is it just in some states
*  They don't have the test well
*  Some places don't have them and there's there's that there's also that there's some tests that are FDA approved
*  And some aren't and why that that is the case
*  I'm not gonna speculate because I really wouldn't know what I'm talking about probably whoever fucking could be
*  I don't I would be pretending if I knew whoever flew on the Epstein plane with the FDA guy
*  but the company I use is
*  They're very confident that their tests work and
*  They say even though they're not FDA approved if they're well your well-being for your own
*  Knowledge is it that they're incorrect mostly with false positives or they won't tell you and you did have it
*  I don't know it's a good question because if it's false if they tell you that you had it and you didn't that's not quite
*  As bad. Yeah, it's a little more safe than sorry than a he the doctor said they've had many positives
*  They've had plenty of positives and a lot of people that just had like a little bit of a cough for a few days
*  And it went away and turned out to be positive
*  Really? Yeah, and some people with no symptoms at all. Okay, so if you just had a cough and went away in a few days
*  Does that mean you don't get?
*  That's a good question, right? Does that mean?
*  Yeah, no one knows they don't know they really don't know it's a it's a new disease whenever something's new
*  It's like there's guesswork going on. It's like who knows
*  They don't really exactly know they know a few things about it. They're learning. They're getting lots of help from China
*  plenty of help is a
*  The lady the Las Vegas mayor those as well same before yeah Anderson Cooper
*  so Anderson's explaining this to her and
*  He's like in a restaurant in China. She's like China. This is Las Vegas, Nevada
*  This is in China
*  He
*  Actually said her wow, that's very ignorant like it was that's an incredible
*  It was a ridiculous it was it was indicative of how those are first of all is indicative how those are not real
*  Conversations. Yeah, right. You're gonna talk about something that complicated. It shouldn't be you're over there. I'm over here
*  There's like a fucking thing in your ear. You don't even see me right and you're just talking into a camera
*  Yeah, which is what a lot of those are if you love it to Anderson Cooper is one of the ones that loves
*  Love is like pretend performative. Oh, I can't believe this and he's like keep it keep it coming, baby
*  What's it don't remember him was Donald Sterling with Donald Sterling's like when magic had those AIDS
*  I used to pray for him and all that shit and uh
*  Watch Anderson Cooper in the video warning
*  It might be kind of shocking like is it like it looked like he was holding in
*  Jizzing his pants every time the guy would say another word. Well, he's very good at his job
*  He must enjoy some of that must enjoy
*  Catching people saying stupid shit like I mean that's like this is Las Vegas, Nevada
*  Disease doesn't spread the same way people from vague first of all people from Vegas are from the whole world
*  That's what's ridiculous. Put this a ton of Chinese Chinese people gamble a lot
*  Vegas before anywhere
*  well, they
*  Build casinos to the standards of Chinese people like if there's things that are not Feng Shui like in here's an example
*  The MGM you had to walk in through the mouth of a black people and they were like check, please
*  We're not walking through a lion's mouth
*  Yes, it's bad luck
*  You can't walk into a fucking lion's mouth. It does make sense. By the way, it totally makes sense
*  What what are you stupid, you know, I have that superstition now that you mentioned if you're gambling
*  Yeah, like come on take these motherfuckers down and you're walking through a lion's head. You're like god damn. It's a trap
*  I'm so stupid. I walked into the line
*  Figuratively, can they make it like a dragon's head or like a better luck animal?
*  I don't think you're allowed to walk through an animal's head. That means that animals eating you they're more sensible about it than we are
*  What if it's a very lucky dragon and it's eating you?
*  Yeah, it's like you gotta be in the belly of the beast in order to get the magic
*  No, they're not dumb. They're not gonna go through that fucking lion's mouth in on their way to a den of
*  Gambling trying to win money, you know
*  billion dollar maybe if you didn't slaughter every rare animal to get a fucking six inch boner you could
*  You wouldn't have these bad luck problems
*  dude, can you imagine that whole rhino horn thing like you're over some dudes house and you're like
*  Would you like some rhino tea?
*  The principle of it right the principle is literally just because it has a fucking horn that looks like kind of like a dick
*  Yeah
*  Don't have anything dick like on your person as an animal in China because you will they somebody will be like that
*  somebody's got a snort powder of that well, I talked to a friend of mine about this who is
*  He knows a lot about Chinese culture and what he said was that it's not really that they think it's gonna give him a boner
*  Cuz they know about Viagra, but it's that it shows that you have this. Yeah
*  Very difficult thing to get did you ever go there? I've never been to China. I've been to Taiwan though
*  Taiwan is very different. I think I've never been in Taiwan, but I went to the you know mainland the big island of China
*  yeah, and
*  It's very it was the most materialistic like you know you having big labels on your clothes
*  There's all these fake Ed Hardy jackets that I guess are very expensive
*  And and they would have like a like member Minnie Pearl that had that big price tag on her fucking head
*  It's like that big and it'd be hanging off a very obviously not at Hardy
*  There's a sneaker where it's in style to wear the label. We had a shit fit about it on this podcast
*  What's it called again, Jamie?
*  Off-white shoes. Yes. Thank you. It's a giant plastic tag
*  I hope it's a GPS tracker. It just tracks dummies. It might be
*  Dummies with these tags on their feet look at
*  They do the people that keep that shit on their feet, let's see what they do
*  That's the biggest insult you could say someone's like you I heard you're poor like that's like terrible terrible insult there
*  Why would it say I heard you're poor?
*  It's just a way that people insult each other like oh you're poor like oh, that's the meanest thing you can say I
*  Mean it's probably not the meanest like go go walk in a tiger mouth is meanest
*  But did so if someone said you're talking about in China
*  Yeah, so if someone says I heard you're poor that's like the worst insult they could say to you calling you poor
*  No, the I heard part is just that's just how just calling you poor. It's like the ultimate insult. Yeah, so everything
*  It's like an 80s movie bully
*  Yeah, you know what's important about that
*  Whether it's North Korea or China
*  It's important for us to realize that there's styles of living that work
*  And one of the big one that works is freedom
*  Yeah, right and this is the best place for that freedom style of living is right here
*  And then you realize that in this same day and age not a small country
*  But a country with three times as many people as us can be controlled by a military dictatorship
*  Well, dude, I was shocked. It's kind of sounds like a weird thing to say
*  But I was shocked by how much more freedoms they had and I don't mean you're not free to like hey fuck you the government
*  You're not at all. Don't yeah, if you said anything like that, they would come after you
*  No that when I did comedy like you'd say when any political shit you want just nothing about China and at the time
*  I was like, I don't know anything about China. So fine. So
*  But you could just smoke where it wherever like the hospital you could like my friend we went to go eat
*  It's some hot pot place. That was like the only Chinese food. I had was hot pot
*  It's called and we couldn't find parking and he fucking parked on some stairs like the front stairs to a bit
*  He just parked like that and I was like, are you allowed to park here?
*  He goes it's fine. That's late. The cops went home the cops just go home at night
*  Jesus Christ. Yeah, so that's why they had to have that
*  So, you know it is like 1984 ish but that social credit system where they yeah
*  They can't possibly police that many people the cities I went to were like three New York
*  New York City cities all next to each other and it like it's enormous. It's like fucking a judge dread
*  It
*  Looked like over the future as well. It looked like everybody had a mask on I got a theory man
*  And my theory is if you look at all the old old cultures
*  Like so many of the old old colors set for parts of Europe, but a lot of the old Asian cultures
*  They still like they've been around lot like what country's been around longer than that's a massive point of pride
*  It's like you get an inverse kind of
*  Like in America's it's like new money compared to old money like the
*  My point was I wonder if like after a certain amount of years even
*  like a real valid democracy
*  Eventually gives into the weight of people's instincts to control each other. I wonder if like that's
*  Chinese what it's basically it's the longest surviving country, right?
*  Somebody told me that it's there if they've had the same government this entire time
*  You know instead of a dynasty it's just like the the generals kids and shit exactly
*  And so this guy's like their amp it's just been the same way forever and you just change the names of stuff
*  So that's really what communism is. Mm-hmm that the part of communism they're taking is like the state control
*  Yeah, but they have like a very like no welfare system kind of if it feels like an 80s movie
*  Like greed is good. If it has that feeling about you know, I mean and also I was shocked how good the comics were
*  Really like front. Yeah. Well all the streaming stuff is there so, you know, whatever who they've seen all your comedy
*  And so they have like I was just surprised like oh, this is like they like they get how to do stand-up
*  so where they
*  Were they expats were the people that live there shows I did where there were expats and also people from there
*  And that's cool, but it's gotta be a tricky tightrope to walk doing stand-up in China
*  Dude not well, I had nothing to say about China. I didn't know any of the pooh stuff at the time
*  Yeah, but I mean for someone like someone who does stand up there in China like locals
*  You have to more I think we have to worry about is another business because popular people like it
*  But let's see some guy down the block runs a bar. Mm-hmm, and he's jealous that you're getting business
*  He can go to the Interior Ministry people and go they're putting anti-communist propaganda out and then
*  Something about him I and he you know
*  He knew people at the ministry and they go listen
*  We know you weren't doing that but you just can't do shows for six months because merely cuz someone reported it
*  We have to do that. So that's the that's the shitty
*  This is one of the that instinct that people have to do things like that
*  It's one of the reasons why I got so upset when LA started offering rewards
*  Social distancing violator, yeah, so if someone is like
*  High-five and his neighbor or you go over the next door neighbor's house
*  You have dinner or something like that like people are stitching people out for money
*  I was already reporting people for high-fives before this virus people are like
*  They're getting very into well
*  Don't you think they just figured out like the people like that because when this they first thing for his head people didn't
*  It was funny watching especially like the social jihadi is trying to figure out what side of this they're on right?
*  No, I don't know so for a little bit they were like, okay, whatever Trump says I'm against that and then now
*  It's more on the okay
*  You got a social distance and like enforcing it. It seems like that that group went to that now
*  Yeah, and also policing who gets tested. Yeah. Well, it seems like this is the new thing now, right?
*  It's like here's the new thing to be outraged about it's like who is going outside without a mask
*  Who is doing this without gloves? Well, you have to transfer your business like
*  Because that was a big business before this and it's like how do I adjust my business which is because I don't think anyone is outraged
*  Oh, yeah, no one is out. I mean I've do you think they aren't or do you think I know are false?
*  They're they're foolishly focusing on things that are not as important. Well, that's if you are serious about it
*  That's what if you but that's not the people that like, you know make a living off doing it
*  If I see it in the media then it's not sincere. Well, there's a lot of that for sure
*  But there's a lot of things you can't rule out people actually being upset about something that's legitimately upsetting
*  Unless you're making it's almost like the thing we're talking about the preacher thing if you're getting rich off it
*  I don't believe it. Well, the problem is it's like a cry wolf thing
*  It's like there are some things that like did you see the the Elon Musk beef that he got in with?
*  Someone who is a reporter for CNN. Yeah, why okay? Why are they so anti him? I don't know
*  I don't know, but it didn't make any sense because
*  He said a respirator thing and he said are you aware that there's a search function and then they played little Samantha games to
*  Retweeting these different nurses that are showing these respirators and they're like thanking him smiling and and holding up the Tesla sign
*  and he showed all the different places that are getting respirators and explained and
*  They're still like they're not gonna go back on it. Cuz so so now they're not well, they're not technically respirators
*  They're a different kind of thing. It was different ones for different places
*  I believe it's ones hospitals asked him to get and they are respirators. They're not invasive respirator. It's bullshit machine
*  It's a word. Yes, but it's pumping oxygen into your into your lungs, right? It's a type of a respirator, isn't I?
*  Oh, no, I don't have COVID-19. I got tested. Well, you just did
*  Congratulations, I don't know. I'm talking out of my ass, but I do know that oxygen goes into those things
*  I mean, that's that's the whole reason why technically people wear them. Yeah
*  No, they are event they're a kind of ventilator and the hospital said could you get these for us?
*  I had all the shit to give someone a hard time about it's like he's they're out to go in aiding these things
*  He trashed the media he didn't hit any on Twitter be like and what if it doesn't the press suck
*  it's like if you it's like he wrote cop killer or something like
*  If you go on YouTube this guy Alex
*  Or Alec Bostwick, he's a reporter and he's into I caught a video his race explaining
*  It's like cops like the media is like cops and a PR persons your lawyer
*  So you don't ever talk to the cops without a lawyer, you know
*  That you know and they have and we need journalists we need cops
*  But the people that abuse it or they're corrupt which is like a lot of them. There's so many people doing it, right?
*  There's different styles of doing it
*  Well, there's a certain amount of like serve and collect where so now these people they were talking about COVID-19
*  Like they didn't know how to handle this for their business of like we got to condemn people. It's almost like a fossil fuel
*  They're almost out of right of digging your tweets
*  They're like well how far back to your tweets?
*  And it's like there's ones they're saving like okay, we have these old blackface pics of like Tom Hanks or something
*  Yeah, you know like what about these Indian baseball teams? Yeah, right
*  the Braves the Indians didn't they just somebody get mad at Adam Driver because of
*  This one was crazy was cuz he I didn't know he even know he's in the military
*  But he went and served in Iraq because after 9-eleven he wanted to go fight against, you know
*  He said he had a vague he goes nothing against Muslims
*  I had a feeling of I want to go fight whoever attacked so he's islamophobic. There's a whole Twitter
*  Islamophobia thing which is wild dude. That's how far disconnected Twitter is that
*  section of Twitter that does that yeah, that's how
*  Absolutely fucking break from reality
*  Well, it's it's a new form of communication and through this new form of communication people have strengthened ideologies
*  Right for good are for bad and I think that's just part of what that is
*  That's part of what that is with the outrage Twitter
*  But it's also part of what that is with all the good stuff like the sure scientific debate Twitter and people talking about different issues in the calm
*  Collectively looks can't throw out the baby with the bathwater
*  There's something there's a lot of good to what's going on with like weird online social discourse
*  but you're definitely seeing people get in enraged and
*  Enflamed more often. Well, by the way, when you brought up the cult thing in the beginning, that's what it is
*  It's like, yeah, that's a certain kind of cult and you can't talk anybody out of being in a cult like
*  Especially when I was like a deep believer
*  No one would have you wouldn't have shown me any evidence or anything that would have made me
*  Turn for my cult when people leave it's because it didn't when you needed needed to do what it's supposed to do
*  It didn't do that for you when you needed it. So that's how people leave
*  They don't leave because you yell at me tell them they're stupid or any of that
*  So all these sock just types the same way there as it fails for them
*  You could see people now like I'm not doing it. Jamie Kylsteen is one of the first right?
*  Well, he's the he's the best example in my opinion because he's been like really honest
*  Know right how gross he felt when he was like attack. I talked to him after
*  Yeah, and he was like an ex-cult guy. It was crazy. Yeah, and then they went after him and he was like, oh shit like
*  No one's safe. Well, so that's that's the it's the running out of fuel for these fucking things. So so that's why
*  Yeah, I mean, they're just gonna dig through all of it. It's like polluting and it's that's why they go into like 83
*  1983 you touch someone's vagina who was 1983
*  1983 the 1980s one was actually the guy from Star Trek got in trouble who?
*  Picard no, no. No, the guy was always on Howard Stern show
*  Sulu, you know, yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so
*  Wait, he grabbed a vagina you said no
*  He grabbed someone's penis or something. Okay in 1983 or something like that like legitimately like talking about in the 80s
*  I mean it sounds about right. Yeah
*  Yeah, well it never happened
*  but it's like when when they're if they run out of outrage if people like really run out of outrage and they go searching for
*  It and yeah, those are very
*  Like there's a lot of movies that if you went and go went searching for like outrage
*  But you get really mad if you were looking you watch. Yeah, right. Well people looking at me ace Ventura pet detective. Oh, yeah
*  Who is mad at that? Oh part two you which which is the one no the one we goes to Africa
*  I just watched that recently. It wasn't ace Ventura. What was the one where Sean? Yeah. Yeah
*  Was it it was that was right where it turns out he she was a guy
*  Oh, no, that's right. That is part one. All right. Yeah, there's so there's so many old movies man
*  I watched Tommy boy the other day. There's so many movies that have scenes you couldn't do now
*  Fucking 30 Rock is all things you couldn't do
*  Yeah shit
*  Well, you can do it happen. You can't do them on like the network
*  This is the thing it was part of the reason for the mad grab for like outrage things is like stuff like this or anything
*  YouTube or all that shit is eating up their lunch
*  And so they they went all in selling to the fucking whatever the I whatever the idea of a millennial on Twitter was
*  Yeah, that's what people were pandering to and it they called it on South Park, dude
*  Remember the episode of what's his name PC principal where they introduced PC principal
*  So there's a scene when there's two forms like well PC is back. How long you think it's gonna be this time
*  He goes six years and I'll be goddamn it was back in 2015 and now they shits Peter now
*  It's about six years. Yeah, people get mad and then it's like it's like a jackrabbit thing
*  Like there's like populations of jackrabbits. They go up and down like every seven years. It's very
*  That's right
*  I think ideas can very well be like diseases and that you know
*  They they come and go and like a big one stick, you know big I will whether it's a religion
*  the ones that have like this is what I think is gonna be an Ebola ultimately the
*  The social justice thing is this and it's too burnt itself out too much
*  You know too many people inside of it got attacked and felt what it was like to be misrepresented
*  Yeah, and there's no there's no fallback or also not nice
*  Look here like you're supposed to be the good person, right?
*  If you're if you're really like if you someone social justice warrior
*  one of the first thing they think is that they're doing a good thing and that they are
*  They have an intelligent philosophy, right? It's an it's not an idiot's way of looking at the world
*  It's an intelligent way of looking at the world, right?
*  And they only way and they're the guys right because they get ideologically driven
*  But I don't think they realize that a big part if you if you act that way and you're attacking people
*  I think you realize a big part of being a person is learning how to be nice to each other
*  And if you just go out of your way to attack people you don't ever get those people to change their mind
*  What you what you do is you get those people mad at you you get those people sad they feel upset
*  These are internet people you can't you can't like get them to listen to your opinion and take it seriously if you're disrespectful
*  That's just a tenant of human beings, right? And it's they're all yeah
*  They're socially fucked up people that are engaging in these online wars, right and they're doing it for these little
*  Adrenaline bursts and these little dopamine hits and there's I mean that is why I do anything
*  No, it's a it's a weak ass, but that's how you get like that is not having to look at someone and say that
*  Yeah, you know, so so it's just gonna burn out because there's no
*  You know like Christianity is a corral of very that's a corona. That's gonna be around
*  Yeah, that game locked up. Yeah, they've got their own country. Well corona virus
*  You can get it get like there's a forget if I want to become a Jehovah's Witness again
*  And I was like, you know what? I I
*  Repent for every or whatever I did that took me out of this and I want to be then you could go in
*  So so there's a I could become that again
*  Do I mean like Jamie Kylsteen can never be a social justice warrior? They wouldn't let him back. Yeah
*  Yeah, well, I saw people attacking him and misrepresenting him when he left. I was like people told me he raped someone
*  That's the shit that I had that no one whenever no one ever accused him of that and then even when he when he did leave
*  It's like it's not easy attack them. What he was accused of is so crazy
*  It's just that Jamie went all in bashing other people my my feelings
*  He was accused of flirting with girls or something like that. It's so much worse
*  I mean, it's such a long story, but it's so crazy that what the actual story is
*  It's just that he went after people and so when you do have people turn I like well fuck you
*  Yeah, you can't be like that if somebody comes out of a thing. You've got to be cool
*  Yeah, you have to say you would like people to be in real life, right if in real life
*  I would like everybody to be real reasonable when they talk to each other and hang out with each other
*  But on Twitter for some reason like people that think they're reasonable people
*  Will say some shit that you would never say to someone in real life
*  Because if you did you'd be such a fucking asshole
*  If you just look in face to face and you said some of the things that some people would just write to random people on Twitter
*  You would be a fucking asshole, but for some reason well, that's a shocking
*  Clause we can write it down. You would think the cruelty would create a callousness to it
*  You know what I mean, but it's like it's like people say they're crazy shit
*  But I'm gonna be hyper sensitive to anything said right their direction, right, right. It's not that's a good point
*  It's like really both punch each other and that's what we do
*  It's not like that big a deal, but they get more raw. It's it's really like an unsatisfying cult to be in
*  It's missing a thing and the big thing if you want to be right is you got to be nice
*  It's not a nice one. It's not a reasonable one
*  It's an attacking one and an attacking at a lot of things that are very debatable and they just want you
*  There's no debate on this. Yeah, there's a lot of things that are very debatable
*  Well, like when it comes to any controversial issue, there's they're controversial for a reason
*  They're like a lot of them, you know, there's there's debate. There's debate that could be had
*  If you can shut it right down. Yeah, that's that's what uh, that's the one shows witness as the
*  You know, you basically let's say you were like hey something about this seems off and I have an issue with it
*  You wouldn't raise your hand and say that in the because there's a Bible
*  You don't want to stumble your brother, right? Like what if your doubt or whatever you had like keep it to yourself
*  You know, there's a time discuss. I don't know when but the worst thing could happen is you hurt someone else's faith by you
*  Saying the thing that's obvious that's in front of your face
*  so that that that lets in all kinds of horrible when if you hear about like molestations or you know,
*  Jules Winters actually the largest settlement in history
*  Really for that? Yeah, and it's not cuz someone in a position of authority did it
*  It's cuz they did what all these places do and didn't go to the cops
*  They're like we're gonna handle and that's why we a bunch of church things
*  The kid diddling happens and when it happens, it's really a morality issue of probably the kids
*  Like like we have to see if they need to be married now. That's the kind of
*  Well, it's just old-ass bronze age, you know, how crazy is the Catholic Church?
*  Is there another country that is like the Vatican the Vatican is like a country. It's inside of Italy, right?
*  Yeah, isn't it essentially like no, it's a sovereign
*  Yeah nation and is the idea that so that no one can get kicked out like they can't get a
*  You know extradited to the rest of the free world. No, I don't know. I think it's like
*  Like that, I think it goes back a long time. But how weird is that?
*  I mean, how weird is that like if you have got a kid fucking priest in there hold up in a church over there?
*  He's probably the best space place for him, right? It's not a heavy kid population. It's just a bunch of other
*  All religions by the way have roughly as much as the Catholic Church pedophiles
*  Yes, all really all of them some more
*  So it's just you know, they actually kind of handled it more and they didn't do a great job
*  No, but they did it their reckoning came that it hasn't really come for a bunch of others on such a large
*  I just don't hear about that with like Baptists or all of course you do really
*  You should talk to my friend Brooke was in quiver full
*  The 19 remember the show 19 and counting no, I don't with the Duggar family
*  Oh, that's right. Yeah, and uh, and it's like your quiver is supposed to be full
*  So this is all yeah, just supposed to always be having kids and uh
*  There's a good analogy there because if you're one of those assholes as a 20-arrow quiver
*  That's a lot of weight. I could fit 20 arrows in my wife's pussy now
*  Well, it's like there's a there's a quiver analogy believe it or not for archery and particularly for bow hunting
*  Believe it or not for archery and particularly for bow hunting. Yeah, that's probably good
*  You won't want to take too many arrows like one of the best bow hunters. I know my friend John Dudley
*  He only takes four arrows. That's it. You know, it's four because it weighs your bow down
*  He doesn't want a bunch of weight over here on the side of his bow
*  So the analogy is to not have too many kids. Yeah, if you have 19 theirs is like have 19
*  I know but it's a bad analogy like but but the idea like oh, I'm gonna have a hundred arrows
*  Okay, well you got to carry those around stupid who founded it the idea and by the way, it's not its own religion
*  It's a thing that if you're just like you could be a Methodist and you're in that movement
*  Do you know what I mean? I think
*  the founders or some dude who's still there and
*  This chick who former feminist
*  Who who changed to this like she went the other? Oh, wow extreme that happens too. Sometimes
*  Yeah, that way do you see the other way if you thought you didn't like like the the hyper left like kids wait until they become
*  Republicans how much you're not gonna like them? Oh, did their kids are gonna be become Republicans for sure
*  There's a lot of them are gonna flip a lot of them are gonna get older
*  They're gonna we were talking yesterday on the podcast. I did with Owen Smith
*  We were talking about farmers how some most farmers like a lot of them are Christian and a lot of them are
*  Lot of them are right wing
*  Oh, yeah
*  I was saying because there are no nonsense people because they get up at six o'clock in the fucking morning
*  And they feed the chickens milk cows and they have to do it every goddamn day. They don't hear your bullshit
*  They don't they have no time for lazy people that they think everybody's trying to make a fast buck and they're out there
*  Hustling every day. So no no if you've never been around it people have never been around it have the most TV
*  Like dipshit Hollywood idea of what farm yeah, it's crazy hard work really fucking hard
*  Yeah, real strong member. Um, those are different kind of people, you know, Harris Stanton. Did you know him?
*  No comic he's in the accident with Tracy and
*  Then remember that when Tracy's a tour bus gonna hit he was one of them. Yeah, he's a lot
*  I mean, he's not dead. I don't know but I
*  Harris he's that he's from South Carolina
*  He used to be a well
*  He was gonna play baseball or something then hurt his fucking leg and became a comic but he fucking
*  One of the strongest fucking people I ever because he used to do tobacco bales
*  Oh, she was like southern tobacco farming. So it's like what a country strong. It's crazy. How strongly you know, how crazy that is
*  That's actually a workout for CrossFit. Yeah, the kettlebell workout. It's called the farmers walk farmers carry
*  Did you see you take a heavy kettlebell on each hand you walk with it? So you just why did you just get a job?
*  You probably
*  Wow, that is really I would just form at that point
*  Well farmer strength
*  Farmer strength is a real strength like yeah, like wrestlers always talk about farmer strength. That's like a like a expression
*  I mean it sounds so close to retort strength, but
*  You can still say farmer strength, but the idea is you're picking up bales of hay all day
*  like they're doing things all day and
*  Instead of working out which is like you burn yourself out. No, that's the most tremendous
*  Just I do my friend's dad drove a
*  truck, you know a tractor trailer across and his fucking he had like Popeye formed yeah, cuz the
*  Shifter on this thing. I'm sure he was fear some least
*  It was upsetting how strong of his dad was and I just remember like everybody's dad had a job like that
*  Well think about was some jobs like lumberjack
*  Like a lumberjack you immediately think of a giant man. I think I paper towel giant. Yes
*  That did that for that job. He was a lumberjack right the paper towel guy was he a bloody guys on a giant
*  He made his normal. I mean is not the brawny guy. Oh look
*  The brawny guy rip off of the Paul Bunyan character
*  But what is are we imagining the brawny guy incorrectly I have a feeling he's just a regular-sized guy
*  I think it's a handsome the kind of guy men and women want to fuck. That's right. He's like a marlboro man type character
*  He would be the guy that starts the orgy in the LSD camp yeah, it's a regular clean
*  It's just a perspective thing
*  Yeah, see yeah, but the other that's what I'm saying. Yeah, there we go
*  I don't know this guy with the mustache the guy with the mustache on the left-hand side
*  Yeah, he's just a regular-sized guy with some trees behind him the guy no the
*  The guy in the top two is that the same guy or is that different mustache guys the new guy is?
*  That that guy's he died of HIV sadly, and that's why we had this new
*  Like how did I don't understand why they got rid of the old brawny guy
*  I made a totally different guy a brawny guy cuz this this guy looks like he lives in Long Island and
*  Yeah, he looks like Adam Carolla. He owns a travel company
*  He's got out like one of them
*  Second way market ticket sales companies. Yeah, they had a thing strength has no gender
*  What is that? It's a brawny commercial. Please. Yeah, don't say that's real. Yeah
*  Strength has no gender. That's true. I
*  guess
*  Why are they in there well it looks really like a
*  Lesbian book club of some kind like look at the there are definitely women that are stronger than some men
*  Yeah, well, I get it, but I don't know why I don't frisbee
*  I don't know why a paper towel would tell me anything well not only that
*  Why is it assuming that I don't think that women are strong?
*  It's assuming it that's why they have that it's not strength has no gender. Okay, let's say women
*  It's okay, but listen if it was us what if it was a bunch of meathead looking men standing there
*  It said strength has no gender
*  Fuck you we know you're strong right stop stop women are strong too like okay
*  I didn't say you were I just said strength has no gender and here's me and my friend somebody in marketing
*  That's like the the whoever does the marketing they're like what a women who were the Don Draper's that go
*  What do women want? There's like they're white they are angry. They don't think they're strong like that's the that's the purely the it's like
*  The dumb dad on the sitcom thing that's just like a thing that's been going on for I
*  Don't know forever that image at insulting fucking yeah, they're teaching you about life because
*  Because every woman is an engineer
*  But that picture go back to that picture
*  I would feel so sold out if I was a guy and I was really into brawny because you kind of look like the
*  Brawny guy and I go
*  And there's three chicks if you were a dollar position
*  If you felt like the brawny guy, but literally it's like pregnant men, okay
*  The brawny guy is a goddamn lumberjack. I would assume most lumberjacks are
*  Probably big strong men
*  You don't think he became a gay kind of icon a lot
*  I mean I understand that they have three female lumberjacks three well you do the job of one man
*  Jack the lumber of one full man
*  This is gonna take three of these strong lady
*  It's just what are the percentages of women that are lumberjacks and what's the likelihood of three of them being on a team?
*  It looks and in that picture he looks like a guy who's about to take a shit a lot by the way
*  This is an ignorant question. I'm aware if you're a female lumberjack, and you're mad at me right now. I'm sorry
*  I don't know anybody that's a female lumberjack. I'm just asking just asking questions. They're mean they're wearing lumberjack clothes
*  That's what a lumberjack where you should assume me. Are you posing? What is this?
*  if you
*  Valor is a stolen Valor are you pretending you're out there carrying trees you wear a lumberjack shirt is stolen
*  Valor these are lumberjacks. These are models. These are hot chicks
*  With nice nails. They're not out there carrying trees and shit. You know they could by the way
*  You know I'll tell you what the women that do do that job. I promise they're not gonna put on the paper
*  Just fucking put a wig on the guy like that one lady with her sleeves rolled up
*  Are you about to go to work look at her to go to that picture click on that?
*  She's got this really thin body this really thin arms
*  She's got her sleeves rolled up or the flannel shirt flannel shirt on in front of a bunch of trees
*  Are you about to chop trees down ma'am because you weigh 90 pounds?
*  Is to make you think that you feel like a lumberjack while you're wiping your counter down is the is what they're trying
*  I think we need to be more respectful about what the fuck it means to be a lumberjack
*  I would think you would think that that would be romantic until you did that job eight hours a day five days a week
*  And your fucking body's broken down because you're carrying logs on your shoulder and shit you're chopping the trees
*  Oh my god, was your father a lumberjack?
*  This is what I feel you can't pretend you're a goddamn lumberjack
*  you can't take a hot model and cover a face with a little bit of coal powder and
*  Pretend she's a coal miner in West Virginia getting black lung you can't cuz she's not
*  I
*  Believe you
*  You're not a lumberjack lady and that guy okay brawny would what if that was for similac and he was breastfeeding
*  He thought I would be fucking hilarious. Just as likely is that lady being a lumberjack just as likely that the brawny guy is breastfeeding
*  Yeah, I think yes
*  Just as likely
*  Lumberjack is a brutal physical. It's if a woman's doing it that woman's gonna be jacked
*  She's gonna be strong as fuck. What's the one that uh jean shirt? They just left it with that
*  What's the one that kicked off the whole like oh the Gillette one like the one that kicked off the whole
*  Like fuck men advertising
*  You know the fucking Gillette. I don't know what happened a while ago. It's a miss it was like this is some outrage
*  You must have talked about it which one was it it was hilarious it was about
*  Is this the best a man can get and then they would
*  And it was like the me too movement times up fucking the guys looking in the mirror
*  Himself and then it cuts to you
*  Now I remember it yeah, it was preposterous. I am pretty high so no no I remember it now
*  I blocked it out like a childhood molestation well then there was like a
*  Fake debate
*  Always be like I'm never buying you know people are tweeting. They're throwing out their fucking joint razors and um
*  Somebody's telling us great. It's brilliant because it's to the women who are buying the razors, but here's the thing the women are buying rate
*  They're not into that either a woman is buying razors for a man is also not into the fucking Gillette ad
*  So whoever is in charge of the marketing it's their entire like what do you think that is?
*  Do you think that's like someone who decides they're gonna cash in yeah?
*  Well, it's that man, and they just say maybe there's an opportunity here to make some money and dude wait
*  Well you okay? I totally forgot
*  Do you remember look at this the guy men with their fucking sick hunt now? Did you see what they just showed?
*  It's like I put his hand on her shoulder
*  No, it was a fucking sitcom where a white guy grabs his black maid's ass and it's all men in the eyes
*  Right ha ha ha what fucking show was that?
*  This is a guy which is fucking grabs me it's ass and it was like yeah
*  Is there a show like that maybe no children no look at even then let me see it again
*  That's so fake
*  That's such a bizarre
*  But it's you're right you're dead right because it's a recreation of something that didn't really happen
*  What is that supposed to be an example of that's not even like a mashup of anything?
*  I've ever seen, but it's like they made a fake TV show
*  Yeah, that's where that's like here's an example of the type of shows you like no one was watching that but that's not even a show
*  Right that's why so we're even yeah, so it's like a straw man show the whole thing is a fucking straw right
*  But I mean that if they're that that's a weird way of doing it is that what they were depicting were they depicting a fake sitcom
*  Yeah, thanks. I don't like it right which I mean it seemed like it was
*  Frightly how well the weird is that they don't have a real example. How weird is that?
*  Yeah, how
*  Like not even a puppet did shit like that on one of the puppets that comes from the 90s
*  And that's weird to put his hand on that girl shoulder, and she had this weird look in her face like oh my god
*  I know that's the craziest like if a woman
*  I thought it was a Joe Biden kind campaign if you were working with the woman
*  And she put her hand on your shoulder like that you'd be it would be nothing um
*  right
*  Yeah, well, it's not good. Well. It's not a good example to put in your ad
*  I look in a real situation like hey, I felt this weird thing
*  I'm sure there could be a situation that someone puts their hand on your shoulder, and it's weird right oh yeah not automatically or
*  Your they insulted you and they put their hand on your shoulder
*  Why are you putting this the whole point that I can't get past is why the fuck is just why are you talking about this?
*  Why aren't you telling me how great your razors are you fucks you should be begging me to buy your fucking fucking moral
*  They think it causes teaching people
*  No, cuz then you talk about it like on a podcast right and then they're like see you've got engagement
*  That doesn't mean people are gonna buy this shit. I'm not gonna not buy it. I just think some marketing person fucked up
*  I don't think it's representative of the whole company um some marketing person
*  They just they decided they were gonna like yeah, right hatch or hitch a ride onto the back of this movement a bunch of things
*  Did yeah a ton of things isn't that weird when they do that. It's like it's you think I'm so stupid
*  I'm not gonna know what you're doing that you're cuz statistically you are that's they have some kind of research where they're like yes
*  You are statistically it's like the letter from Nigeria to
*  Well, it's like they're trying to be creative right so the creative people that are making up these scenarios like the commercials like a little scenario
*  Here's what I have a guy his bush is too hairy
*  He's posing for the picture with right they're gonna send into space, but they want him to shave his sack and balls. That's the
*  Mean I wanna I wanna like show
*  Good you see what I want to show I want to show the guy going well
*  We we we want to use you but and the guy fuck and then you see him in the bathroom
*  Hold his but you see Joey Diaz's balls were on twitch no they get well
*  Comedy store got in trouble, and there's like a real violation. What is it FTC or FD?
*  FTA by the violated him
*  They do it a comedy store live
*  Because he pulls them out he's bored
*  So Joey Diaz just pulls his balls out and he's holding on to them like he's got two kitten heads and an old ladies pantyhose
*  I mean the fuck they're the biggest balls you've ever seen in your life is that a violation of twitch to fully have you
*  Yeah, they got kicked off at twitch. It wasn't good, but you got to see the video
*  Can you find the video I have it on my phone I saved it here's how good it was it was so good I screened
*  I
*  Recorded because I'm like this is gonna go away
*  They're gonna pull this down because people are communists, and they don't they don't want to see something amazing so watch this
*  So look that's a screenshot of someone filming it that looks like I from do I thought he had fake balls
*  No, those are joke those are real. I've seen them for years. I've said the first time I saw him was in 96
*  He's got a lot of ball skin, dude
*  His his balls are soft balls. They're soft balls
*  stuffed in
*  Flesh cover my god, you know Burt's got his shirt off. Yeah, it's chaos
*  Yeah, I know I just I'll donate money
*  Yeah, god damn. Yeah, cuz I'm just thinking of the amount of distance of scrotum you need to flop them out that amount balls are preposterous
*  He's obligated to take him out so you understand about so you get what he's saying. He's not playing any games
*  So that you get what he's real balls there it is is a screen grab
*  That's probably he'd go to jail for that or something everybody got assaulted. I
*  Well, I might not say that until I saw the size of those balls Bert's in a trap
*  Bert's trapped never put a shirt back. Yeah, he's trapped in and I always have to take my shirt off thing same thing happened at Dignitaro
*  How many ladies oh that's even darker I forgot about tigs
*  Anyway
*  terrible person
*  Yeah, imagine why can't women do that is there a topless female comic because you don't it's not when Bert's taking shirt off
*  It's not like sexual except to like, you know, if you're into bears
*  It's not like sexual except to like, you know if you're into bears
*  Right, it's not a woman that could do that same kind of thing. She has to be not attractive
*  Hmm, but that's the whole Bert thing. Listen G to be a guy. You don't want to be that hot. Yeah, well Bert's
*  because his body's
*  Large I feel like it was why ever of him to have his shirt off than anyone ever taking their shirt off
*  No, because it's part of the fun. It's part of the
*  Brave fuck is it brave because you don't have to applaud him for that
*  Right, just want to but it accentuates the comedy
*  Whereas a girl's big tits don't really accentuate the comedy like Burt's big belly accentuates the comedy
*  I mean, it's like you're hanging out at a pool with Bert laughing
*  That's what the effect is he creates and a girl just pulls her tits out
*  It's just weird if you that kind of a fat guy that yeah, I mean, yeah, I guess it better be like a baby on the end
*  Of it I guess well women could do it
*  We would just have to be accustomed to it
*  The problem is like if a woman just pulls her tits off tits out and starts telling jokes
*  You if it was always like that it would be just like you see on those old documentaries of like, you know
*  Yeah, so we're in Africa. They don't have the bras and it's not a thing
*  It was just like that exactly
*  Which is how human beings all of us used to be the whole planet before anybody figured out how to put clothes on
*  If we Joey Diaz's balls were out all the time
*  We all could uh
*  Well, it's sort of like it goes back to what we're saying about the the couple that they drew on that little plaque that they
*  Shot off into space boy when the aliens find out about Joey Diaz's balls, they're gonna fucking oh
*  My god, that should have been sent to space that
*  That really should be sent to space to represent us
*  He
*  Wasn't Joey who else
*  Was it earlier in the stream earlier? Yeah, what happened?
*  Wait, there was a different guy's balls. Is that Bobby Lee? Yeah, he showed his ass. Hmm
*  Outrageous
*  Context for it. He showed his whole asshole. You know, Bobby Lee's another get naked guy. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he'll get naked
*  I've seen Ari Shafir's balls and dick multiple times as well. He'll pull everything out. No, yeah
*  No, I didn't already do something for skank fest. We were on stage naked
*  You know Ari's trying to become a shirt off guy. He could he's always oh well
*  He'll do it whether if he wants to whether he can or not. He does shirt off walks takes pictures all the time
*  Suns out guns out New York City. Yeah, he walks around here with like
*  Never seen a guy take to New York better than Ari Shafir like a duck to water just
*  Right in his little pond. Yeah
*  Spot as many trips across Asia probably helped him prepare
*  He loves New York
*  Yeah, I'm sick of it. I mean I like I liked it for a long time, but I got very
*  It's a different way of living man. I can't just have I don't want another winter like that goes to April that I have to
*  I can't do it. Mm-hmm
*  I wonder how much of that has an impact like who gets the most?
*  Colds and flus is it people that live in the cold in the East Coast or are they more accustomed to it?
*  So they get less of them or is it people in the West?
*  It's how tightly packed you are packed in you are to other people that are gonna have it, you know, right?
*  That's probably why New York it probably helps your immune system at a certain point in New York because you just
*  Bombarded with fucking that makes sense that it would help your immune system except for something
*  You don't have an immunity to like this coronavirus, which is why I was so bad in New York
*  Because you're me and I don't know enough all those other things I believe you I just have no
*  No enough to know if that's
*  Now it's when you take your balls out. I don't fucking I want to know at the end of the day
*  What what happened? It's just gonna everybody wants to draw a conclusion
*  Long before it'd be awesome. They tested Joey Diaz's balls for Corona when I was testing. He's patient zero
*  You got to squeeze them out like that. So there's a drop of blood
*  What so how long from Bobby
*  Taking his ass out. That's good question, which is more offensive Bobby's asshole or Joey Diaz's balls. It's hard
*  Tough call equally are well one is way more impressive Bobby Lee's assholes a regular size ass
*  Show he gives his balls or their thing of nature like wow, you know, it's like when you see a bird
*  Like a toucan has a crazy beak look at his fucking beak. Holy shit is exactly like that
*  Yeah, like an exotic bird. Yeah, you see other birds. They have normal beaks like even an eagle
*  It's a normal beak, right? But then you see like a fucking like a state talked
*  It would be like oh, he's one of those set of balls. It talks. Yeah like a shoe bill
*  Big shoe bills from Africa that is a you ever seen one of those motherfuckers
*  Call me the shoe bill cuz I got a huge ball my favorite ridiculous bird. Oh toucans got a crazy one
*  He's got a super bright one. Tell me that doesn't get him some pussy
*  It has no I don't know look at that picture. That's you know, I know god damn. That's pretty I
*  Mean come on how psychedelic shit. I want to fuck that bird. That bird is beautiful. It really does look food flavored
*  I thought the cereal was making that up. Okay, if that wasn't real if that wasn't a real thing and someone drew that
*  We go. What is this the new fucking avatar monster? What is that? It does look like an avatar monster
*  It looks freakier than an avatar monster. Look how long that fucking beak is
*  Do you think dinosaurs are like that's probably all the dinosaurs with that kind of crazy point percent
*  I'm by the way 100% not capable of saying 100%
*  I don't know what I'm talking about
*  But I think that's that it's been confirmed that birds are like leftover dinosaurs, right? What are those?
*  Ha ha thing, you know, they're like big two can't nut they're like big dodo's that are they're dead now terror birds
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, we've talked about them a ton of times too much almost
*  It would kill you machine kill by something that's stupid looking like they're like nine feet tall, dude
*  The shoe bills the one I was talking about earlier. Look at that motherfucker. That's alive to kind of duck. It's huge
*  Oh my god five feet tall and they're so evil-eyed
*  I feel like Joey's balls look friendlier than that bird. Look at that. Imagine that thing standing up like
*  Looking at you in the eye moving towards you thinking about eating you and I don't like the around the eyes
*  I see looks like Ray Liotta. I
*  Don't like it
*  Like the Ray Liotta that was here in the helicopters overhead. Yeah
*  Karen Karen I needed that Karen why
*  Look at that fucking eyeball look look at the eyeball in that thing that thing doesn't fuck if you know
*  Like the sequel poster face Jesus Christ
*  Now imagine that but imagine it nine feet tall and that was those terror birds
*  Get a picture. That's a bird. That's alive. That's a bird. That's alive right now. Oh, I thought it was like a CG
*  Dude, I thought that was for one of those were they on discovery where they make the fake. Oh, right, right, right
*  Like they reenact they did it with mermaid
*  No, this is a real bird it's a real bird that lives. Oh my god, that's real
*  Yeah, it lives in the Congo lives in Africa his face really does fucking big man
*  It really does look like a Reebok is fucking head. It's a monster
*  There's a crazy video of one of them eating a snakehead fish
*  It's snatched. Oh, really? Oh, yeah
*  They're super weird snake heads are the ones are like who will take all these snake heads off our hands because there's so many fucking snake heads
*  Well, they're an invasive species. So now we gotta bring in these shoe bells. Look at thing. That's this that's the fish
*  Yeah, and this thing snatches it up and and and gobbles it
*  Oh, and that thing breeds air and this motherfucker comes in that's a crazy dinosaur looking face on that shoe head
*  What's it called a shoe shoe belt? Look at him eating that. That's great. I mean that is a fucking dinosaur
*  It's a
*  Video which is hilarious because they are definitely metal. I would think that was like a even dog. Yeah, you would think that's a fake thing
*  It's a five foot tall bird. Where do they live? Those are in Africa, but where oh
*  Well the documentary that I saw was they're talking about the Congo. Look at his fucking shoulders and shit
*  I don't know what part of Africa they live. Oh in the car. God damn. That's crazy. Yeah crazy now imagine those fucking terror
*  It looks like a puppet they make a realistic puppet for one of those discovery diner walking with dinosaurs
*  Look at that looks like a goddamn animatronic
*  They should never do CG cuz like puppets look more real
*  I know well
*  They have a real hard time with feathers and they have a real hard time with fur
*  It's hard to get fur to look completely realistically like I saw that new movie with Harrison Ford and the dog
*  Is that a fake dog fake dog? Yes, it's so weird. It's weird
*  It's weird cuz it doesn't get past the uncanny valley. I would never get past it's him looking
*  You're like, I know you're not looking at a dog, dude. Oh
*  Call of the wild right isn't that what it is? Yeah, it's all fake dogs fake wolves
*  There's a lot of fake a dog in real life that you could kind of fake it with no man
*  They gotta get these dogs do very specific shit. It's weird. It's real close real close
*  That was trying to put a little flourish in there too. It's you love this dog though, man. Okay, remember
*  It's like
*  Is so it's always a little off who's the person there? They got like a dwarf to be the
*  Mean they didn't do shit man. This is all I mean, he's based on the way staring at the ground
*  Why would you animate like like a dog's a bigfoot or something?
*  That we have to simulate gotta get the dog to do very specific things
*  Well, I think Harrison Ford did look a little bit CG. He probably was this is like a low-key flex
*  The dogs gonna say they should have made it all animated if they're gonna do that
*  Yeah, right, right the people too, right? Oh, it would be kind of cool. You're right
*  Yeah, then it'd be like the Polar Express or some yes, which is so creepy
*  Yeah, like in the future like that that is gonna be a horror movie
*  this is almost like Roger Rabbit if it wasn't funny though the
*  Man acting with the animated. Yeah animal the call of the wild
*  I said this is called the call and I've never read the book to call the wild
*  I was a kid, but this is very different than the book. They took a lot of liberties and
*  There's a lot of things they changed
*  Well, you know and also is it turn into a movie. I don't know who fucking made it. It was really good
*  20th century so yes, it was actually really good. It was a good movie. It's like it's a good movie
*  But in terms of like a family movie, oh right, yeah, I watch movies with my kids, right?
*  So there's a lot of movies that I watched that I know I'll never see that because I don't have kids
*  So I'm not a part of us on some movies that were
*  You know what turned out to be a mistake?
*  Well, not that it was bad, but that watch it with a nine-year-old Jojo rabbit. Oh, yeah, it's more serious
*  Kids getting killed by Nazis like hey, maybe not right now
*  Yeah
*  We switched to Adam Sandler also we tried to watch the first season of lost but we put on the
*  first episode of the first season and when the guy gets sucked into the
*  Airplane engine they show that yeah, my nine-year-old's like cut
*  Fuck this stop this. I'm not watching people get sucked into anything after a plane crash. The fuck is wrong with you
*  I'm nine. She's right. She's right. The kids right. Yeah
*  I haven't had to consider
*  Cuz I'm a kid so I you know, if I see my nieces, you know, it's a
*  That is Adam Sandler movies
*  But which some of them are agree. There's some really inappropriate see which are though like
*  They're newer ones or which are the ones that are like the best is all in so hands one of the funniest movies
*  Oh, yeah, I like this. It is a fucking funny movie. You know, I'll funny. Yeah, I like that movie
*  It's like the end. I was it was like ridiculous. Yeah the singing thing. Yeah, it was kind of preposterous, but it was
*  You got me I'm going with you the whole ride. Yeah, you know, I mean it's just what else is a funny movie man like an
*  unapologetically ridiculously funny movie
*  Oh his fucking no more do you see his Netflix?
*  No, it's very really good. Yeah, I heard is very good. Dana White loved it. He's awesome man. He's a great guy
*  I've met him a few times. He's very very very nice guy, but his movies are so
*  Unapologetically funny like just goes for all the ridiculous jokes. Yeah, well this like you get a
*  Zohan is all of its like dick jokes and sex joke
*  It was like although he got that blowback because of on a talk show
*  He said like I was just going on vacation with the last couple or something, right? That's remember there was like oh
*  I wasn't paying attention. He got blowback
*  Yeah, cuz he said like the ones that aren't that good
*  Like the ones are good. I remember they're like, you know, like I remember Simpsons lines or what?
*  You know like fucking Billy Madison, right? I said he's got a bunch of people remember and then I know more
*  There's like a Gilmore's a classic. That's a happy Gilmore
*  But the ones that I don't know if they didn't do well it like but they're with what's her name?
*  From ET to be a more yeah, I think it's like those ones, but he said something like the last few movies
*  I'm just going on vacation. Oh
*  He said that I think it probably he probably didn't mean it like I
*  Did I don't think he met he was like phone it in Adam Sandler confirms that his movies
*  Also, he could just be being
*  He could be just being funny and you know funny
*  You know because I have done that he's done that since 50 first dates Sandler explained it was written in another place
*  I said imagine if we did it in Hawaii, how great would that be and they said yeah, that's a very artistic idea
*  I've been doing that ever since so he's just saying he does his movies and vacations at the same time. That's pretty wise
*  Yeah, well that it sounds like it got made into a thing by an article. You know what they are dude. They're like
*  They're just funny, right? He just tries to do the funniest thing and
*  For whatever reason some people have decided that that's dumb because there's some movies that don't do that
*  There's like Coen Brothers movies were more sophisticated humor that still are they like you just as hard
*  I like all his Coen Brothers movies, but I never thought of them as like
*  Like the who's the?
*  That's something like that. What's what's a bowling one? Oh?
*  Kingpin yeah, that's Fairley Brothers, right? Yeah, that holds up pretty fucking good pretty fucking good. That's a brilliant movie
*  That's a brilliant movie juice. You know what I saw fairly recently a friend of mine showed me with nail and I you hear that
*  It's from like the 80s, and it's a
*  Fucking George Harrison from the Beatles like produce it. It's a comedy fucking hilarious, dude really
*  I never I heard of the title by never seen it and I don't remember Wayne's world
*  They had that guy was like a roadie who would tell crazy stories
*  Yes, that character they took from this movie, and that's what he's doing. It's the same actor whoa
*  It's that guys in it and this guy
*  Does that help dude I had never seen it is fucking hysterical Wow
*  And what they're like out of work actors and they live in this fucking rat infested like and apart
*  You know because they're alcoholics and they go to the country to get away from their stress
*  I don't always spoil it. It's really got the I'm funny
*  There's some great fucking old movies that slip through the cracks or that this one
*  Like like I like blazing saddles really yeah like of like you could make that now. I like it like that
*  It really is fucking class. I like I never I heard of it never watched it was fucking funny. Mm-hmm. I'll check it out
*  I'll check it out. Yeah, it's a
*  You know who still makes movies the same way is Tarantino. He still makes hyper. I like that new one I
*  Enjoyed it. I enjoyed it a lot once upon a time in Hollywood, but I just have a foot fetish, so that's why I'm in
*  Yeah
*  It was pretty awesome. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was pretty awesome. Did you see a Bruce Lee?
*  Do you believe the Bruce Lee? What do you think that whole Bruce Lee thing is about? Well?
*  I've talked about almost too much, but in the interest of keeping up this conversation
*  I
*  Don't think he's right
*  They he tried he depicted Bruce Lee in a way that made him look like an asshole, right?
*  I think Bruce Lee was very confident, but I don't think it's really any evidence that he was a dipshit and in that movie
*  they make him out to be kind of a dipshit and
*  There was a real instance and this is what I've talked about before like Bruce Lee had
*  relationships with people that were stuntmen in a positive way and one of them was Jean LaBelle Jean LaBelle's a
*  famous guy was a judo champion who taught Bruce Lee a lot of Judo moves and
*  they worked together in several movies and
*  But Jean LaBelle if he had an actual fight with Bruce Lee the way Brad Pitt did Jean LaBelle would have killed him
*  I mean Jean LaBelle was a real a gigantic man a gorilla of a man right was a really strong guy who was also a
*  Judo champion, I mean his grappling's know it's like he had a like a gripe it or he just wanted to make Bruce Lee
*  Look like a build. Yeah, that's the problem. It's like this
*  There's just so so there's Bruce Lee getting his ass kicked by this guy
*  Who's just a random tough guy and they get in this I mean that's what they don't tell you that he was so tough
*  He killed his strong wife on his book. What's that?
*  He was he remember he maybe killed his wife who maybe killed their wife the Brad Pitt guy that beats up Bruce Lee
*  Did he really in the movie they suggested he killed it? What was it from what I'm not trying to remember that now. It's
*  That's why they didn't like him on the set remember like the that Australian lady damn it
*  He was on the boat and his wife's like bitching him out and he's just holding a spear gun and then it never resolves
*  Oh, but it was always rumored that he killed his wife, but nobody ever knew for sure that was like the
*  So when he fought Bruce Lee
*  Yeah, he was a
*  Yeah, he was a carol Baskin a but with sharks this is from your mom's house
*  I
*  Don't know I mean she seemed like she did it, but I don't I wouldn't want to weigh into that
*  Yeah, I don't know I steer clear of tiger people and all good point
*  Who doesn't man don't buy a Porsche get a tie if you want to get laid get a fucking tiger. Yeah
*  Jesus Christ they all start like a little sex cult
*  Around themselves. Yeah, like why is that do you think you think is they're dealing with those tigers? They're feeling
*  I like shooting guns. That's like a feel. It's fun like
*  Walking a tiger must feel like whatever that is like times a million
*  Maybe like if you just hung out with a fucking shoe bill that followed your commands
*  Yeah, you get an ego quick
*  If you were dealing with giant cats all day how freaked out you'd be
*  Well that they're getting off on that this cat's not killing them when it easily could they're all getting off on that
*  It's like exciting to pee and plus a lot of people just love animals so you get to mix like
*  Really primal feelings together like yeah, and then uh that holds pee
*  That's why that lady got her arm bit off, but she's like don't blame the tires
*  And she shouldn't it's her goddamn fault
*  Then she went back to work there. Yeah
*  Once they have a taste you know it's he now
*  That was a big part of the movie. That was a problem after the accident no
*  She's transgender. She's a he now. Oh really
*  Yeah, that was a big part of the controversy that they had misgendered her they misgendered her in the television. Oh my god
*  I thought I had done it no no
*  She you but you did cuz you said she we can blame the fucked up. You can bring the doc
*  Hey, I'm as mad about this documentary as everyone else
*  That was the information I had to work with
*  Bro, that's a dark moment when a tiger takes your fucking hand
*  But okay, you know when they talk about like if a bear gets a taste for human
*  It's bad like if a tiger got taste for specifically my arm
*  Like I don't want to work with that tiger. Oh my god
*  You know there's some moments in that that show one of them where the tigers dragging him away by his foot remember that oh
*  Yeah, and he shoots the gun. It's like you son fucking bitch fucking bitch remember like it's the tiger
*  Let's go, but he's like literally holding on. It's holding on to his foot and dragging him away
*  Wow yeah, I didn't see that part I'm thinking of a dude in Tiger King. I missed that one
*  I haven't seen all of them. I've seen most of it the thing grabbed his feet and was pulling away and he
*  Don't know because it's being a tiger. No, I'm sorry. What was the situation?
*  He was inside the cage with the Tigers and everything was cool, but then one of them grabs him by the foot
*  It's checking out his feet won't leave him alone, and then grabs him by the foot and drags him away
*  Do you mean the way he was?
*  Kind of this cat Wow so he's he's hitting at it with a stick
*  And then he pulls pulls out a gun and when he pulls out his gun he shoots near it, and it lets go oh
*  It's a loud noise. Yeah, it's the loud noise so he it lets go, but he starts screaming out in fuck a bitch
*  So he thinks that in the in the show he said he thinks that someone put something on his shoes. Oh
*  Sardine oil yeah, well that was what the lady had said like to get a cat to eat
*  Carol Baskin by the way. I don't know she did this is just your mom's house
*  They told me to wear it they forced. Do they have a little in our opinion?
*  Not we put that on there. I know right
*  But they anyway
*  He almost had to shoot the cat was pulling him away by his feet for some reason
*  Shoes off maybe have some nice Jordans or something
*  You know I think it probably feels like if it's smell like I would just imagine leather to a cat
*  Unless it's like really smells like delicious beef. It smells like some kind of meat product. Yeah, wouldn't it?
*  I mean, it's probably fun to bite. I mean dogs bite shoes
*  But they just biting it because it's soft and it feels good or do they know it's leather
*  They know it's I don't know it's leather
*  That'd be crazy if they knew oh, I know where this came from, but I mean they know it's not some sort of an animal product
*  Maybe I don't know I don't know a lot of stuff
*  Like for a dog like if you just had raw leather laying around a dog would be like why can't I just eat this I?
*  Know this is food they'd go they'd walk up to him like I had two dogs
*  I don't remember them being any particular way at leather
*  No, but like shoes or things you wear so your smells on me. You just have
*  Yeah, I've that like if some way you're sent out. Yeah, but don't people give their dogs leather chew toys, right? I
*  Never did so I don't know no never no I
*  Think rawhide is leather rawhide toys. Yeah, Rawhide sure I thought they were edible
*  Yeah, they are edible. It's edible leather. Yeah, the leather is edible leather leather is edible. Yeah
*  Yeah, it's just really really tough like a like a jacket
*  Mm-hmm if you were starving you could eat your people in the depression actually boiled their shoes and ate their shoes that was a
*  People ate shoes that's how much people were starving in death that was a real thing Jesus
*  Yeah, yeah eating shoe leather was like would people would talk about like the lowest point of people being
*  Jesus Christ Jesus Christ right oh
*  My god, that's that's real depression. We would have been thankful for bat soup back in that
*  You know what Swanson said to me what he said to us I'm in a text group group text with him
*  He said a friend of his is a sheriff and they said they used to deal with maybe one
*  Suicide a week. You know they're dealing with as many as five a day where
*  I probably shouldn't say in the Hollywood area. No you probably shouldn't yeah
*  Well, I mean this is a very it's crazy
*  But that number like a podcast or something people that I used to do in a like not doing stand-up feels very very weird
*  I get I'm disoriented
*  like what day it is and like cuz I I didn't realize how much I was like
*  Timing my life out from like when I had spots right and depended upon it
*  Artistically too right yeah, absolutely
*  People have they've hit this weird breaking point
*  It's we're like six weeks in right and people are really antsy for things to open back up again
*  So there's like an additional tension that seems to be in the air. Maybe it's time for celebrities to sing us to sleep with
*  Don't stand so close to me
*  That's a creepy song
*  Right is not a song about I guess pre-covid 19 it's creepy, but don't stand so close to me
*  Isn't it about like a teacher and a young girl?
*  Is that what it's about the subject of school? Well if you were saying come close for schoolgirl that was hitting on him
*  He's the teacher and she's hitting on him here. We go young teacher the subject
*  Girl fantasy she wants him so badly knows what she wants to be insider. There's no room
*  Hmm this girl's an open page bookmarking so she's so close now this girl's half his age
*  Don't stand so close to me. Oh cuz they're fucking yeah well her friends are so jealous
*  You know how bad girls get sometimes. It's not so easy to be the teachers pet
*  Temptation frustration so bad it makes him cry wet bus stop
*  She's waiting his car is warm and dry don't stand so close to me
*  Loose talk in the classroom
*  Holy fuck
*  He starts to shake he starts to cough kovat 19
*  To hurt they try and try strong words in the staff room the accusations fly it's no use he sees her
*  He starts to shake he starts to cough just like the old man in that famous book by Nabokov
*  Stan
*  Don't stand so
*  Keep going what else this is that's the whole song okay that song is a pedophile song
*  That's about a guy getting okay. Well don't sing that one
*  Would you say a guy getting tricked into fucking a 14 year old is the song about a guy who's getting lured in by a young?
*  Lolita I mean that's what it's that's that's how he's singing it so badly
*  You know and then then it's not so easy to be the teachers pet are they're all together
*  They're in the car together. It's raining out his car is warm and dry
*  Dude until you told me that I've never in I don't know how long I've heard that song like
*  30 years so however long it was around thought that was what I've listened to it so many times like not that
*  I even saw it out, but just over and over again and never
*  That's what it was that's why it doesn't matter about lyrics like because no it's
*  When I was in high school Spanish teacher
*  My school I knew someone that happened to the song was penned by sting who just happened to have a former career as a teacher
*  Before the rock star and I'm came calling do I told a story about it on?
*  People used to fuck their students back then this
*  17 and then the guy was a James Fanko
*  Handsome young man. He's one of my favorite teachers anyway they fucked
*  I don't know what the rules were back then
*  Was in high school everybody was like a bunch of girls
*  I knew were dating some guy that was like could probably have gone to jail
*  Yeah, but a few people I told a story on our show
*  I knew somebody who like it was a he was in high school and hooked up with his geometry teacher and they end up being married
*  When I was in high school I dated a girl. She was a very nice girl, but she was also naughty
*  this naughty girl fucked an older man who had a boat and
*  Sounds like such a good like
*  Her friend fucked the guy anyway, it was she was a naughty girl older man, but a very nice. She's adventurous and
*  One of the things she said it was like like he gave her a hard time about it
*  She's like motherfucker. I'll turn you into the police. Oh you so much. Yeah, we're doing a prom show years ago
*  You know like I don't they do that here
*  But in New York the clubs a prom season a bunch of like Long Island high schools go to comedy shows after their prom
*  Yes, I did that at Dangerfields. Yeah, right
*  So one of the limo drivers, I don't know who asked him like you ever like because the girls look like kids like
*  Like it was crazy how much they look like kids to me these high school kids, right?
*  There'd be a couple you're like, oh that looks like an older kid, but they are like kids
*  But somebody asked the driver one time a driver a girl
*  I remember she was 16 he said
*  But she did came on to him and they fucked and she goes how much you make tonight and the guy was like
*  I don't know like 500 bucks or shows and she goes I think you made 200
*  It took $300 off this thing. Oh my god
*  Yeah, like that's a really advanced fucking thing to do stole 300 bucks and fucked him
*  It's an interesting call because she like turned herself into a prostitute
*  I just like don't know why you would make that although I remember
*  Remember to catch a predator when they like half those people seem like they would go to anybody who had written back to them
*  I got a theory about that too about why guys are into like high school kids
*  Why I think there's some guys out there that hit a point in their life
*  like maybe like right after they graduate where their life got really fucked up and
*  It didn't I heard this thing song
*  It got really fucked up and it didn't go anywhere and they wanted to like relive their childhood
*  Like yeah, right went back to high school. Like maybe they have a lot of regrets. They got they got clowning
*  Then what I knew man, they got beat up, you know
*  But it is that kind of thing where it's like you want to go back
*  You're you stuck in a certain. Yeah. Yeah. Well, there's a thing with women, too
*  That's why a lot of women wind up fucking high school boys, right women that are teachers like how many times you heard that story?
*  How many times I heard it growing up? It's constant
*  The funny thing is they barely get arrested like most of the time they don't do any time
*  I saw one recently a lot of places. She was fucking a 16 year old boy and
*  They just said don't do it anymore and they gave her like one year probation. Where was this?
*  I forget they gave record order knock it off
*  It was probably Kansas or something like that. They like stop it just
*  Stop listen guy people what you call farm strong
*  But if it was a guy that was fucking a 15 or 16 years happy, it's not a cousin go
*  What this is happy? It's not a guy the guy was doing it
*  They would they would want that guy locked up in a cage for sure. It's interesting. I mean, I agree with it
*  It makes sense, but it's still it's right kind of crazy. I
*  Yeah, I don't man I guess to someone's teachers blow their students
*  I mean, it's just it's just the only ones you hear about are the ones where these pussies can't keep their mouth shut
*  Well, I know somebody to go to their mom and go to the teachers and go to the cops
*  You know what? It depends if you're a fucking kid or not like I'll tell you find out
*  What if if I was like 16 when I was in high school like 16?
*  I was as kid of a 16 year old you can be because we were religious so okay
*  I had no really what I mean
*  So do you think that those are the guys that they try to fuck or do you think they go after like the young football?
*  player guys, I
*  Think it's all kinds of different
*  Like if you're a crazy girl who wants a relive childhood relive high school, so you go
*  I think somebody just I think some strikes your fancy and they probably never thought it would be like that
*  I think it's like maybe they think like some pure
*  You know, maybe they think like when I was in high school that boy wouldn't give me the time of day if I was in high school
*  With him, but now I can fuck him because I'm 32 and I'm the teacher. Do you think is that thought through?
*  100% it's all planned out. There's journals and schematics and
*  They got a map of how they wanted to go down and all the friends are connected one of those little
*  Circles with all the lines that come out with different names
*  Who was the one that they made that movie about with Nicole Kidman?
*  Where she gets I mean there's a real story of someone which something you know, the teacher got the kid to kill her husband
*  Oh
*  Right. That was and then uh, that was was that in New Hampshire. Where was that? Yeah, then there's a documentary about her where it like me
*  It's a fucking crazy story was that was that Pam smart? Yes, Pam was fun. Yeah, I remember that man
*  Everybody had jokes about that
*  When I was everybody does in the 88 when I was just starting to do stand-up
*  It was right around then that it happened when I was an open mic or so everybody had like Pam smart jokes
*  To die for yeah, they go
*  What did the real Pam smart look like not that good? Well, keep in mind that's imprisoned. Well, it's just not fair
*  That's there she's pretty cute with some fucked up revere hair look at her hair go back to that picture again
*  What year is that?
*  What year of hair was that?
*  Cuz I remember that when like that's in the 80s for sure girls on here like that
*  Yep in the 80s. Yeah to die for was 95. Yeah, you're not it's hard to fuck with a
*  1995 Nicole Kidman, right? That's what year it was
*  Yeah, here's another version of it to the hell and hunt I'm not as good. Oh, yeah, it's fine
*  It's more accurate
*  But I think like well the kid man was supposed to be just a character based on her
*  But it's funny right because if you're doing an actual real-life story
*  You would really if you had a teacher that looked like Nicole Kidman it would change the narrative like there's a weirdness
*  You know it a hundred percent. Yeah, there's a weirdness if it's a big fat lady, right?
*  The guy that I knew the guy that I knew the teacher was hot and everybody was like
*  Yeah, exactly what we say today for is like
*  Loosely based on that movie loosely been inspired. Yeah. Yeah, so here's the problem with that
*  It's like Salma Hayek like hot Salma Hayek from the dust to darkness
*  That one when in her prime remember when there's another foot thing with Tarantino. Oh, yeah
*  Shot off her feet no when you hear it, and then you look back you're like wait a minute
*  There's a 20-minute foot scene in every
*  Fucking kill Bill. She's like now wiggle your toes. It's like camera hangs on toes for a while until they move
*  She was so hot if that's how my high one to fire 16 year old boy
*  What what kind of a chance does he have a saying no? He's got zero chance
*  Mythological creatures based on that
*  We're hot she was yeah, right fuck out of here, man. She was so smoking and still is she's still hot as fuck
*  Yeah, you know without a foot fetish that foot thing is like I would do that. Yes exactly exactly. She's beautiful now
*  imagine if she is the teacher and
*  some 15 year old 16 year old boy
*  If she at the teacher, let's not say it's her let's say it looks like it could be like her cousin or something like that
*  But really hot just as hot as her let's not say it's her let's not be disrespectful
*  Someone on an equal scale of hotness to Salma Hayek fucks your 16 year old boy like what chance does he have a saying no to that?
*  How about zero that some might consider their own zero you know beyond?
*  Beyond consent you know that's I think that's the entire idea of it being a kid the thing about it
*  Yeah, but the thing about it is if he was 18 you'd be psyched for him
*  Just two more years if he just lived 24 months
*  That's who somebody said it to me maybe any sense me she's like if it is just like a year like why can't you wait
*  A year or something I think it's uh I think it's like arbitrary
*  Look grown women that want to fuck 17 year olds don't have a year to wait those bitches are all crazy. You know they don't that's right
*  That's right. I have no time to wait
*  Oh my god credit card debt is fucking
*  Trying to chase him down. How will a high school student help your credit card?
*  You know it's really some of those women are married some of those weren't a married
*  I think a lot of the people married and they wind up fucking their students I
*  Was never around that I never experienced that as a kid where a teacher a female hot teacher fucked any of my friends
*  Yeah, no, I never had that
*  It's if it's somebody in my school I remember a female gym teacher
*  I was a male gym teacher and somebody else but that makes sense. I think he just got fired
*  But wait just now you know I could be wrong
*  I think the guy that the weight room the school had a weight room
*  You know he would go to after school and the guy I remember hearing some shit like that about the guy that was like ran
*  The weight room that he's one of the gym teachers. I remember he was very always very grabby and like I didn't think it was just
*  It was very Joe Biden II
*  Like shoulder rubs and you know like I got hairy legs
*  He just wanted to press your leg hair down and then you'd press his leg hair down no big deal
*  Just press his leg hair down everybody likes it look kids playing with their leg hair. It's fun
*  Yeah, just don't totally normal to talk about too if you're running for president
*  Dude that fucking is that from the corn pop thing what the corn pop speech?
*  Yeah, the thing about I got hairy legs
*  Something about going by the pool
*  Yeah, no he was a lifeguard and he fucking stared down the local gang leader corn pop
*  Is that what the story is yeah, and he had a chain and then they were good instead of fighting
*  They were good they became friends huh, and he was like I'm sorry
*  I called you Esther Williams her front with razor wielding gangster named yes
*  They used to rust their razors in a rain barrel. That's a real story
*  The whole story it's the same with the pool dude
*  It's just I only heard the the legs in the pool part
*  I think I didn't know about this other guy because now I might need to hear this these are
*  We allowed to play this is this news. How does this work? Yeah, okay? Let's hear the audio to what it says
*  And there were a lot of through the three meter board and you fell off sideways you landed on the dam the darn cement over there
*  And corn pop was there a laugh track on this one corn pop is a bad dude bad boys
*  When I did and back in those days and shot things have changed
*  One of the things you had to use if you use pomade in your hair you had to wear a bathing cap
*  And so he was up on the board wouldn't listen. I said hey Esther you off the board
*  I'll come up and drag you off well he came off and he said I'll meet you outside my car
*  This was mostly these were all public housing behind it my car. There was a gate out here
*  I parked my car outside the gate and I he said I'll be waiting for you
*  He was waiting for three guys in straight razors
*  Not a joke there's a guy named Bill right mouse the only white guy and he did all the pools
*  He was the mechanic and I said what am I going to do he said come down here in the basement where?
*  Mechanics where where all the pool?
*  Filter is you know the chain used to be a chain that went across the deep end
*  And he cut off a six foot length of chain he fold up
*  He said you walk out with that chain and you walked in a car and say you may cut me man
*  But I'm gonna wrap this chain around your head. I said you kidding me. He said no if you don't don't come back
*  And he was right
*  So I walked out with the chain
*  And I walked up to my car and
*  That's that most days used to remember the straight race you'd bang them on the curb get him rusty put them in the rain barrel
*  Get him rusty
*  And I looked at him, but I was smart then I said first of all I said when I tell you get off the board
*  You get off the board. I'll kick you out again, but I shouldn't have called you. That's the Williams. I apologize for that
*  We're almost done we're almost done go ahead keep it going for a second
*  It's only a few more seconds ago
*  He said you apologize to me. I said I apologize, but I'm not for throwing you out, but I apologize for what I said
*  He said okay close the straight razor my heart began to beat again
*  That how polite were those children being by the way during that fucking um that was one of the things
*  I was gonna say when I pause it like no one's paying attention to him all those kids are talking
*  They all went to a happy place. They're all just talking you guys running for president, and they're behind him
*  He's on stage. What is this a president a president stomp thing? I thought something else
*  I don't know what it is, but he's running for president while this is going on for sure
*  He's got it was look. There's that thing the city of where is it because it says it on that little city symbol
*  That's on the front of the podium Delaware
*  So who've set this up where you have a bunch of kids on stage behind him not paying attention while he gives us long-winded story
*  about razor blades and chains and
*  Basically they apologize to each other and then it's crazy that he's a presumptive. It's crazy to run him
*  It's absolutely fucking crazy. It's weird man. It's weird
*  You know you know what's interesting some I it was interesting talking to Owen Smith yesterday because I love Owen
*  These are a really brilliant. Oh, yeah
*  Brilliant comedian like one of the best guys I know
*  And we were talking about and he said I like the Biden makes me think like makes me feel like things would be normal again
*  Like I think he's saying of the people that go like go for Biden and that's not a small amount of people
*  Yeah, there's like so Obama rubbed elf on it, but yeah, Biden was never a guy who's gonna get elected before that
*  He's certainly not now
*  It's just trying to get that that feeling back, and it's not coming back
*  But you've never seen a greater example of
*  Team loyalty that yeah, then this this one right here
*  That's what this is a hundred percent because no one on the left wants to talk about these crazy long-winded
*  Speeches and things that don't make sense the lefties. I learned about it watching. I think Jimmy Dore
*  The people on the left. This is why they lost I mean I say that they lost when fucking Nanette came out, but
*  like
*  people
*  People on the left didn't want him and no and they weren't on board Bernie like Bernie saying hey go along with
*  Biden people were following Bernie because the what they thought his policies would be not necessarily like a cult of personality
*  So they don't give a shit if Bernie says vote for Biden. They're like they were voting for
*  Way more lefty shit. Yeah, and not the normal feeling in fact
*  They they hate those the real lefties can't stand like a Owen Smith Democrat right above all else
*  They wanted it changed they wanted the real lefties want everything
*  The Republicans had to have their thing where Trump just trashed
*  He trounced them when he came in right and they had they're like what they they're like his bitch now
*  And so they had that fight. There's no one Joe
*  Bernie was never gonna make do that with the Democrats
*  It's all about like ability and electability like that's really what it's all about
*  When the people like simple clear message dude a simple clear message
*  And see the Biden thing you're right that I just people just want to feel normal again like yeah, I don't know
*  That was Owens take those how he felt him personally. Yeah, if they could make that into a slogan
*  I just want to feel normal again. That would be like a MAGA for them, but somebody's got to come up with that
*  Well, dude, you got to look back in time
*  And you look at history all the mistakes that were
*  Made throughout history, you know, that's what you're reading about when you're reading about lost wars and invasions that went terrible
*  You're hearing about trials and errors and mistakes. Let's me see people's fucking principles. How yeah
*  Because I mean wasn't especially with Biden the thing of all the people that were crowing about believe her and all that shit
*  Right that are like well, you can't believe sometimes people are lying. Oh, are they now?
*  Yeah, that's really despicable me yeah
*  Well, there's only a few people out there that don't do that that are in like the media that are in this that sort of
*  The media loves this shit more than I mean
*  How they hate Trump when it's like 90% their fucking fault part
*  It's there's a lot of different things going on. Did you see an issue like sports? It's like you want your team to win
*  It's a lot of that huge amount of that, but you know, it's like
*  You want your team to win it's a lot of huge amount of that but you know that movie Annihilation with Natalie Portman
*  Yeah, that was the one where they there was the by the same guy who made X Machina, right? Yes
*  Yeah, that was really good. Remember the ends and Natalie Portman and there's like don't spoiler alert it for everybody
*  This is quarantine people could see that movie now. All right. Well when you see the
*  They've had enough time to watch it
*  I'm just kidding
*  When she's there's a thing of her that's rainbow colored that's like a duplicate of her that right right right and she's trying to run
*  It's pressing her against the door
*  She's fighting it and then she stops for a minute and then she gives it a grenade and pulls it and walk and gets away
*  By being caught the more she would fight it would give equal reaction back at her. That's what these people
*  It's like Trump's your fucking reflection and you you hate it and the more they fight it the more it presses them back up against
*  A door and and that's that's there's no they're never gonna figure out how to just like give him the grenade and pull the pin
*  and walk away because they can't like
*  He's definitely makes mistakes, but they are also so wrapped up in everything that he does
*  In a way that they distort even things that probably turn out to be a good idea. He plans for that
*  He does not every the people that just could get ruined by one minor thing. You're like, I'll do a thing every fucking day
*  And what are you gonna do and people like these go like a bunch of you just don't follow him
*  Are they like it's genius do I you if you hate his guts? You can't say it wasn't very smart
*  So wound up that this is look
*  Anytime you get too emotional about things your view of things get distorted
*  It's one of things that happens in fights all the time
*  You see fighters talk shit to each other, right?
*  To each other because they're trying to get the other person emotionally invested in the fight, right?
*  They're trying to get him angry and pissed off where they're gonna do something irrational. They're not gonna be logical, right?
*  That's what you're seeing you're seeing that with him, you know instead of them
*  Analyzing it it's like everything is a personal affront and he's like a done
*  It must be slain people that vote for a feel like that Obama feeling. That's what it's such an offense
*  It's it's not about anything Obama did or didn't do it's the feeling that yeah, it's it's been offended right?
*  Well, that's what I want that back always said about him like forget about his policies
*  Like he was a great statesman the way he would talk. Yes. That's the thing. Yes
*  He was reserved and he was articulate and smooth and when you would hear him talk like that's an excellent representation of the United States
*  Yeah, right. That's our that's our one of our top dudes makes sense. Yeah, right
*  Yeah, and and like even keeled didn't get angry. I expect certain bourgeois norms
*  Yeah, right. Where's like the thing with Trump is that he's you know, like you said, he's not really a politician
*  So he's just being the guy who's always been and everybody's like I thought you were gonna be a president though
*  I thought you were gonna act like we need because you want to be called po I thought people got him for
*  Specifically the opposite of that. It's like and that shit's done now. So people still want that the West Wing or whatever the fuck like
*  That's what it is. It's like you're West Wing kind of people if you want reform real reform
*  You should be kind of happy that he exposed it. What I think it exposes is how not rigged it is
*  Because if someone controlled it no fucking way
*  Do you know you know like control some of it you can yeah, yeah based on yeah, the fucking of Bernie
*  Yeah, and getting in not that Bernie was gonna win the fucking of Bernie though is it's crazy
*  It's like you're watching and Bernie's not fit to be present
*  If you get bulldozed like that, you're not right, I think he's a genuinely good man
*  I think is why he's unfit to be the president. Yeah, can't this is not a job for that
*  Well, this is one of the reasons why they're so scared of Tulsi Gabbard because she doesn't lay down like that
*  You see yeah, once she had that moment with Kamala Harris in the debates. Oh, yeah
*  She's that was great by the way, it's fucking amazing instead of saying wow, this lady is dynamic
*  They're like, oh shit. We can't really control her
*  She's gonna tag our top lady. Yeah, that's a panicky people
*  She's saying things that you know, you're really if you you want your team to win
*  You're not gonna give up those cards so early
*  But well, they haven't there's an internal thing
*  You got to settle with all the people that are let the actual left that are like mad and they want their Trump
*  Yeah
*  so they're not gonna go along with the same cuz cuz I
*  Think a lot of like just liberals don't get that the the lefties hate you more than they hate a Nazi
*  They hate you more than any right winger just a regular liberal
*  That's who they want to get them. That's why they turn on Ellen or whoever the fuck
*  Yeah, cuz they're waiting to have a reason to turn on you right?
*  There's no one's gonna pass the purity test. No one they're just looking for something and
*  I think that again it goes back to the thing like that's not nice
*  Like if all your you're constantly now is not the time to be nice Joe now is the time for rage. Yeah
*  There was someone that someone wrote something about oh
*  That guy from CNN. What's his name? Brian?
*  Stelter Stelter looks like divine out of drag. That's that guy. He wrote something about
*  About the like angry journalism. I forget what he wrote, but it was like widely criticized
*  Why well because it was like basically he's admitting that this is like you're not you're not doing journalism. This is like
*  Editorial it's an editorial
*  Very yeah, it's like you're that guy Jeff Suckers calling for activism more than you're calling for just marketing the news
*  It's just my and just believe that you're correct. So you're gonna like push your idea
*  I mean, this is what we would go to the news
*  Well, we really want is someone who's gonna tell us exactly what happened without any political bend to it
*  That's what we really want and we expect by the way
*  Oh, I still even saying that I still expect I'm probably gonna see a little bit of it people figure in there's probably gonna be that
*  And when I was a kid, it was like that but not near to now where it's become like a miss
*  Cattie gossip mixed with news. Yeah now it's fuck cuz it's all to it's all because women shared more online
*  That's why they're targeting the emotions of women that that's specifically this is my design
*  This is what the same thing we're talking about with the Elon Mustang like how could you say?
*  That he didn't do that when he can he can show you all these tweets
*  Like how can you well, how can you accuse someone just out to get him dude?
*  I mean they have a thing for them, right? Like how is that? Where are we in the news?
*  It's like if you some rapper talking about how the cops won't leave him alone
*  like he's like a guy like
*  The cops are always gonna bother him. Well, you know like
*  That he just got on the bad side of it's an institution and all these institutions if you talk about they hate
*  You like though they have it in for you. It's crazy
*  They get like a cop that's corrupt going but well the thin blue line and blocking it
*  But you're a fucking dirty like yeah, but we're good. That's how they are with Elon Musk
*  So they are with a bunch of people. That's so crazy. It's not like so much about justice
*  Let's say as it is about processing in the system and shit. That's what they that's their job
*  Okay, and that's what they that's what they fucking did you find his quote a
*  Bunch of people had made a meme out of it and we're passing it around was him calling
*  I forget the expression that he used but I read I really wish I could remember because I
*  Looked at someone's tweet about it or Instagram about it and they were saying finally, you know, you're admitting what you really do
*  Finally you're admitting that you're rage journalistic instincts are showing. Oh, yeah, right. It's rage journalism, you know
*  It's been open for they've been opening like that for a while. I feel like we need somewhere
*  That's gonna give us the information just clear
*  100% dedicated to factual information without any political bend at all
*  No one's doing that. Somebody would be like it's not possible. So it might as well be my politics. It's got to be possible
*  Possible. Yeah, it's got to be possible to just just read the news
*  Because if you if you look at every like there's gotta be some ever does that will start getting views and you know
*  Somebody who fills that niche right it will be successful because there's gonna be people who should be able to report on
*  Maybe dumb shit that Trump tweets and also report at
*  Report on the the really important things that are happening that are good for this should just stop reporting on Trump's tweets
*  Just try it just fucking try it for a minute. You're playing right into his hand for it's like annihilation
*  Look what each set like he and then while while they do that he gets like a judge in or something
*  He does it all the time. Yeah, it's very savvy, dude
*  You always very savvy in a lot of ways. It's like the the fake not sophisticated language that he uses
*  It's almost like he uses that to kind of throw you off the trail. I'm like Don King with crazy hair
*  He's got his own crazy hair. It's almost like in some ways it throws something about crazy hair that really
*  It throws you off the trail
*  It's you know, there's no there's no newspaper or no no thing that I subscribe to or I don't get at least some
*  Political bias one way or the other, you know what just clearly mark the stuff that's editorial or like, you know
*  This is not news just market is that but there has to have news and then the news you save one for the part
*  That it goes. Yeah, everybody just do their job
*  You don't have to fucking do the Daily Show
*  I blame a lot of this on the Daily Show not because it was bad a whole bunch of people that became news for them
*  Right and so then all like fought all the other ones like why don't we have it like Daily Show?
*  But more news than comedy. That's so true people. It's terrible. It's terrible. It's such a good point that I never even
*  Yeah, I mean I didn't make it up. I thought it was must have said it
*  I'm sure someone said it but it's a it's a great point. It's right. That's news for a lot of kids like college kids
*  Barely paying attention they're flipping through Comedy Central and John Stewart's and they're telling them what's going on in their hilarious way in a hilarious
*  Trevor Noah want like that's a different generation cuz I would just be like why is it I?
*  Am by way, I like I know I met him before like I like him
*  But I'm just a fan like why you have some guy that shows not an American
*  Why like what is with a guy with a foreign accent here? It's beautiful all these all these shows that are like the American
*  It's always someone not from here. That's interesting like John Oliver
*  Same things and I even like him. I like just he's they seem to have a fucking
*  what do you call it like I
*  don't have that kind of feeling of like I like a
*  Wait, I always have a level of that like the fuck you right
*  Like I can't imagine going to England's doing a political show about their politics. That's true
*  This is kind of funny so
*  That's just like a thing that
*  You could probably do it like if you went to Ireland
*  Holland yeah, he had a show in Holland that wasn't even the Tom Rhodes show
*  He had to play a character the character was a talk show host. Yeah, well like he couldn't just be a talk show
*  No, no, no, so instead of Tom Rhodes
*  He'd be like I'm Pete McGillicuddy like you had it, but then it's a talk show
*  It was like the Pete McGillicuddy show starring Tom Rhodes or something like that not Pete McGillicuddy was the name of it
*  That's right. Kevin Master Show starring it wasn't a sitcom though, right?
*  No, but it was like a talk show host where a talk show rather where he would play a guy
*  That was different than Kevin Masters
*  I mean did that what they did or they just call it the Kevin Masters show and he would say I'm Tom Rhodes
*  Is it I don't know. Oh, is it like a joke of like?
*  I don't know. It's a joke. You could only pull off in Holland
*  When everybody's high on mushrooms and tired from going to the whorehouses
*  You're pretty much right
*  It is as Kevin Masters was a generic American and the producers used to fill in until they find an actual host
*  Holland's a fascinating place man. It's a fascinating place because it was like one of the first place where people go to get high
*  I haven't either but it's also the place that produced some of the best kickboxers ever
*  Why did I kind of knew that?
*  Came out of Holland man Holland is like the motherland for
*  Badass kickboxers like when you hear about a kickboxer you hear about from Holland
*  It's like hearing about a jujitsu black belt was from Brazil. You're like, whoa like Holland. Yeah, why is that?
*  Jim had a lot of like Van Damme kind of people too. I'm sure they do. I don't know anything about Belgium
*  With black and white checkered vans on
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, there's
*  Holland has also really large people like I think the average height for a man is six feet tall
*  Is that right? Yeah women are really big there, too
*  They have a bunch of great heavyweight kickboxing champions like Peter Aerts. He came out of Holland
*  There's so many of our Nesta who's an Astro who's just like one of the most brilliant and beautiful technicians of all time
*  He came out of Holland
*  Kickboxing that of like that in jujitsu is at the two in MMA
*  Is that like the things like you everybody basically just have to know? Yeah, you have to know wrestling too. Yeah
*  But wrestlers have to know submissions as well and everybody has to know stand-up because you're standing up
*  Yeah, you got it. But it's the pay there's a few guys like stand-up comedy, you know
*  stand up like
*  It's two different types two different types of stand-up when you say stand-up you mean striking
*  This is like I got my judo. I got a spot to store hilarious
*  So I didn't even think about it that way I have in my mind
*  I have two different types of stand-up that I don't even I just say it
*  You got to work on your stand-up like people people do say that like you got to work on your stand-up
*  And that's funny. Holy shit. I don't you got to work on striking. That's right
*  That's what it means, but it basically means stuff that you do on your feet
*  I'm working a lot on a stand-up. Do you remember you ever seen like I remember seeing it on like a Star Trek
*  Episode or anything any kind of sci-fi where they're trying to the martial arts of the future
*  Like this martial art is all the culmination of all and they did it on a Star Trek
*  Like this is their future martial arts. It's nothing like MMA. I don't remember that it's like ridiculous
*  It was like a ridiculous high-kicking like
*  Well, that's where Bruce Lee was brilliant. Yeah, I kind of figured it out
*  Bruce Lee in a lot of his movies sort of depicted mixed martial arts fights
*  Do you think in real life that Bruce Lee could beat Brad Pitt?
*  In real life though, I don't think he would have fought anybody man. Not like that
*  That's that was if you get back to that story about Quentin Tarantino's depiction of him
*  I don't think he would have done that. I think he would have behaved like that. He wasn't a buffoon
*  You know, he was a he was a tough guy. I'm sure he was very confident
*  When you read the things that he wrote and when you see the interviews that he gave where he talks about things
*  He was a very deep thinker. He wasn't he wasn't a buffoon. He would talk about things in a very profound way
*  So just the way I didn't like how they portrayed Charles Manson either in that movie
*  Gotta read this you gotta read this book. You can't even get it right now
*  Oh, it's Tom O'Neill's chaos Charles Manson the CIA and the secret history of the 60s
*  If you just I listened to the audio version of it and he gave me this but the fucking podcast I did with him
*  Balloon my mind. Oh, yeah, dude
*  It was all crazy
*  But this one this one's even more crazy because it's all about these psychiatrists that were experimenting on
*  Hippies with acid isn't that why the Uniball more fucking yes, because they did a hippie experiment on him when he was like a teenager
*  He was part of the Harvard LSD studies. Yeah. Yeah, that's fucking crazy, dude. They did it to a lot of people
*  That's what this this book ultimately turned out to be about Tom O'Neill wrote this over 20 years
*  Took 20 years for him to put all this together
*  He started as a small story like I think it was like a 5,000 word story for Vanity Fair or no premier
*  Premier magazine that magazine eventually went under and then he got a book deal and he missed a deadline
*  Because he kept diving deeper and deeper into MK ultra and CIA. Yeah, dude. Oh, it's crazy. Did I?
*  This book is a mindblower because it's all factual
*  He's got 60 pages of references and citations at the back of it
*  I will totally listen to this book since I can't get it. Yeah did um, they sold out
*  Didn't prepare. Have you ever read his the manifesto with the Uniball?
*  I didn't I didn't it's crazy how how almost reasonable is this?
*  Like technology is going to be a problem
*  It's very weird just like I don't see the connection of we blew these people up for the you're real point
*  You all agree with but it almost they're so rational
*  It sounds like he came from the future and he had to make those bombs. I bet that's what he thought
*  I mean it that it it reads like that. It's wild, dude. There's a guy named Jolly West
*  That's a part of these MK ultra experiments and he's connected to the Manson family and all these other different people
*  But that was why the Manson family because Charles Manson was a guy that for sure
*  They gave him acid they gave him acid in prison at least the way they're describing the possibility
*  he was even talking about certain doctors and he name has the the last name the doctors the last name of the doctors a part
*  of this program and
*  Doctors that treated him while he's in prison and he comes out of prison and there's evidence that he gets released over and over and
*  Over again every time he violates parole
*  Someone on high wants him out on the streets and he's got a large supply of acid and he's got very sophisticated
*  Techniques that is utilizing that he learned in jail
*  Sophisticated techniques of how to how to brainwash hippies on acid get them to fuck each other
*  By the way, get used orgies if you're just a very manipulative criminal criminal
*  It's not you can figure out how to manipulate it
*  You certainly don't need training for that, but we're talking about within two years. He's got a murder in people
*  I think the pimp lessons he learned helped him do that. You know, it's they are the
*  Dissociation with reality through LSD through through constant trips daily trips
*  I think it's useful to I think like for brainwashing. I'm just saying I don't I'm sure you did that
*  Yeah, I don't know that he did it for the CIA like I could easily see him for his own reasons
*  Brainwashing people that let me clarify when I say he was a part of a CIA experiment
*  I don't mean he did what he did for the CIA what I mean is they let him do what he was doing and they
*  That's very believe gave him drugs that's like the story of yes
*  That's very believe if if you're letting this guy keep getting released every time he robs a car or someone's house or when you know
*  You think he's gonna somehow or another be locked up and you want him out on the street
*  Doing this thing and they were trying to discredit the hippie movement and the anti-war movement back
*  Right and that's part of the way they did it
*  They infiltrated these groups in one way or another and one of them would be to take a guy like
*  No, yeah, I like the mayor the old Mary Hill boatlift when they dropped a Cuba empty their prisons into America
*  Yeah, fuck you. Yeah, that's a good stuff. Yeah. Well that that's a pretty well-known thing the thing about the drugs like well
*  It was just you know, yeah, it's a pretty well weed out the weak elements of society and we'll get a lot of information
*  Well, it's also they didn't exactly know what would happen when you dose people up with acid back then
*  There was a lot of experiment got a lot of great info from that not to go
*  It's not so easy to get those I'm sure part of those programs too, right
*  The Japanese guy who's like worse than fucking Mengele, I can't remember what it's called though
*  it's so crazy the shit this guy did to people and
*  He he got up they wanted to know what he learned from his human medical experiments. Oh, so they let him off
*  Oh, Jesus, I wish I remember the name of it's a Japanese
*  It's but it's so it's mostly done to Chinese, you know prisoners
*  But like, you know cold and pressure and all like it's fucking grizzly dude
*  Yeah, and it's just he did so many aim world like
*  Experiment he there's knowledge that helps you make it even they got
*  Same reason we go put that great golden record in space
*  The people had useful knowledge. Yeah, it's not crazy. So
*  The educate yourself if that's they're like look it's more important that you tell us
*  How many pounds of pressure it takes to crush a little kid's head? Yeah, we did not know that officially officially tell us what you got
*  Christ it just let him go
*  Imagine being that guy who killed like hundreds of people and they just let you go
*  No, imagine you like eating ice cream at a diner
*  Just fucking sitting by yourself. I doubt you have to eat a cup of coffee
*  Nice cream. No, it even knows no, thank you. I'd like one more piece. Didn't they have that uh, oh here is she
*  Right. She that's the guy. That's the guy
*  Jesus Christ
*  He led in development and application of biological weapons at unit 731
*  And how do you say that word man? You go where man? Chukwu? Oh man, Chukwu?
*  Oh, I say that man Chukwu. Yeah, but in Chukwu the you and the oh together. How do you say that?
*  Sneeze it basically to cool Mexico
*  Anyway, uh, how are we say it during the second? See no Japanese war from 1937 to 1945
*  Including the bubonic plague attacks. Oh and it was Chinese cities. Oh my god and the planned attack against the United States
*  In operation cherry blossoms, holy fuck man. Oh, isn't that the one where they would send the balloons across the country?
*  Yeah, it didn't yeah, it didn't work or these bats or something. What were they gonna do with the the
*  Operation cherry blossoms at night. Imagine just like this is my plan
*  Operation cherry blossoms at night. Bio warfare. They're gonna drop
*  bubonic plague, cholera smallpox. Oh my god. Oh my god
*  So they were gonna do that to America in balloons
*  Is that what they're gonna do? I think the thing and to come at us in the through our most vulnerable way our love of balloons
*  No one would ever want them for
*  fucking song 99 red balloons go by that was about
*  That was a big song when I was in high school, you know, the girl was cute
*  Yeah, okay these killed six American civilians near Bly, Oregon
*  I thought they crashed into a farm in Medford, Oregon and caused a short circuit on the power supply power lines
*  supplying electricity for the nuclear reactor
*  Cooling pumps in the Manhattan Projects production facility. Holy shit, dude. Did you know what were they dropping on him?
*  I had balloons with bombs attached to him. But was it supposed to be with plague or something?
*  Well, I don't know Jamie said that was part of it but what I did here on
*  There was an episode they did about this on one of my favorite podcasts, which is
*  Radiolab Radiolab did a whole series or a whole episode rather about these balloons that people would find
*  These non detonated balloons and I think people accidentally blew themselves up a couple of times. Wow
*  Yeah, I think people found them and then they they they found out after the war about the project
*  But I think a bunch of them made it here and some of them went off and some of them didn't go off
*  It's contaminated fleas
*  Contaminated fleas. Oh my god, that's so dark
*  Jesus Christ, I'm so glad we're friends with Japan now
*  In China all the all the bad guys and like you I'd watch like the local TV
*  So everything is about a mean Japanese general and like a brave Chinese somebody is really yeah
*  That's like how like Nazis and we win Gloria's back like yeah Nazis are a pop culture
*  You go to like we always use as a villain. Yeah that Japan is that to China. Well, you and I had this conversation about
*  Don't say a person's name but
*  Someone's saying why isn't it? Okay to punch Nazis like
*  Oh
*  Yeah, right. I've had that same conversation with people. It's totally you and I both like yeah by all means punch a Nazi
*  But I want to just see your Nazi detector. You're you
*  When you're Nazi dowsing to find these Nazis, I'd like I can't just go off your word
*  Like no, I'll handle it. I've read someone calling Ben Shapiro a Nazi. I know there's a guy
*  I think maybe you were gonna have mom but I like him
*  He's a guy on YouTube that reviews comic books that he fucking got it's crazy what they did to him
*  Oh, I've heard the story. Okay story. What is it called something comics? What is it?
*  It's called her it's called
*  I don't know. His name's your boy Zach. I forget
*  What is his comics matters what your boy Zach is an answer is
*  And so what happened with him? What was the story?
*  They made him into like some kind of dude's crazy made him some kind of Nazi
*  I mean, he's the most reasonable the reviews are so utterly reasonable
*  Okay, where
*  And by the way guy gives credit to people when they're he thinks they're good
*  Like there's nothing if you actually looked away said there's nothing there at all
*  But because he mocks like the dumb shit they do in comics now, they made him they're like he's a white nationalist
*  Well, they're doing he has a lawsuit because they do that them injecting social justice warrior credos in the comic books now, right?
*  Well, there's a little power if there's a little fiefdom of like Portland weirdos that I guess run comics
*  I didn't know this fiefdom of Portland weirdos is the best
*  Besides blame the Daily Show. I blame Portlandia for the other half of problems. Just so you know
*  Before you guys fucking unleash Cthulhu out of there. Oh
*  We're gonna have some laughs and fucking
*  Do that so true they are the that is the liberal epicenter that's Mecca like the comic stores Mecca for comics
*  That's Mecca for social justice war and it's like in a really annoying
*  Like I didn't know I did a show comedy show at Stonewall one time and uh
*  You know stone what like the historic like with a gaze fought the cops and where is that? Where is that in New York?
*  Okay, and I thought it's gonna be a good show cuz you you know this back in the days of you know, we're Joan
*  Rivers was like a gay I come you know, like right so I assume it'd be a great crowd. It was awful
*  Really? Yeah, and the guy was cut my hair. He's like no do that. You don't go, you know, that's not really cool
*  Gays are fucking Stonewall. That's like it's some dipshit
*  Living out their worst fantasy of being gay like so I didn't realize it was like it's like going to hate Street in San Francisco
*  Yeah, you're like jerk off. It's not 67 fuckface. Yes
*  So I think there's a lot of that setting in right they're trying to bring it back
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, anytime there's a place where hippies it's like that's a fire. I miss it. It'll burn out hippies hippies
*  Were a lot more fun, right but they they burn out it burns it's like there's no fuel there it eventually
*  it goes away the kind of newish thing to me of that is the the Twitter like
*  Certain groups just got marketed to based on lazy
*  Right following like oh, what does Twitter say like that should never be an article anymore
*  Like Twitter is saying that should never be a thing. I need to know about ever. Well, that's what we're yeah
*  So so that got catered to so much it created these bubble around people that's fucking crazy and they and they're getting fed
*  It's still just to sell them products and now you know, there's this virus is gonna fucking pop that bubble
*  That's it's like bad real estate right now being a fucking being woke
*  There's a real estate market that has is gonna being upset about stupid shit when real shit's going down
*  Yeah, always the values way down. Yeah, it's out of fashion
*  Well, that's where it came from in the first place came from not enough real problems
*  Yeah, yeah, that's right
*  No, I get we're not same thing like I never could get emotional about whose president
*  I was in a doomsday cult dude, like right thought
*  Like I took I was gonna kill all of you by now was how was what how I absolutely thought
*  Yeah, any minute now this is gonna so then you know, and there's so people think that's the end of the world
*  Like they say that but have you ever seen unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt? Yeah, that's a funny show. Do you really?
*  Yeah, the first episode of it. I mean I didn't live underground with John Hamm
*  But but certainly that mindset yeah, it's a funny fucking show
*  It's just communal reinforcement keeps you in thing and also the people around me were nice. Like I
*  Mm-hmm. I'm not bitter about it. It's just like I can't ever be
*  Or don't stumble your brother like I'm not saying kind of courage or anything like I'm compulsive
*  Well for a guy like you it's always important for a guy like you to talk about it
*  Especially a guy like you who's all the way out and is now comic
*  It's very because people need to understand that it's a trap that you can get sucked into
*  It's like a pattern of behavior and thinking and you get like this confirmation from all the people that you're around
*  We all could get sucked into I think I'm only less susceptible to that now just because of
*  Growing up in that mm-hmm. So so because it's such an obsessive thing to me
*  I'll see it I'm more likely to see it where it's not than not see it
*  But some people are not they're not gonna understand that
*  If you didn't go up in religion, if you didn't grow up in a religion where you had to do it, right?
*  You have no idea. You don't understand religious people and it shocks me to the level that people don't understand
*  It's almost like we need another word
*  Because you know what you're saying that like social justice warrior behavior in a lot of ways
*  It gets very religious. Yeah, it is like and it gets religious also for Republican conservative type of behavior
*  That gets very religious to like you. I can tell you a religion when it becomes called woke
*  Devoted to right where you said at that team thing like well, we gotta stay on the team
*  Have you ever had a conversation like here's an example with right-wing person who doesn't believe in climate change?
*  Yeah, I used to always argue with Nick
*  Nick
*  Yeah, we're doing
*  No, no about that, but the Palo is always like we would be on that lucky and I was the hulu thing that Louie had
*  She's I'm so fucking I Louie the horse and Pete. Oh
*  So Nick like he's the he's awesome to hang out with waiting to shoot something was like it was he was awesome
*  But arguing about political shit. He gets like it's heated. It is like what do you love Obama?
*  Immediately goes that
*  But uh, yeah, but you know, I
*  Like him. I like I think I wouldn't want him not to say what he thinks what he said
*  I don't know something about Obama. I don't know some stupid
*  Guinea shit
*  You should be able to say whatever you want to say and I have no issues engaging people like that
*  I'm used to knocking on strangers doors. So nobody want to talk about their thing
*  Threatens me in any way like proselytizing does not bother me, you know
*  It would bother me like you're if you're not I'm not allowed to hear it because I don't need someone to tell me what I can
*  do you think there's less examples of that on the right than there are on the left of people like within and sort of
*  Compulsive speech like this compulsive. I said I think that the people that are on there the people that whoever needs to worry about
*  Are all the people that aren't too far to one or the other right? I agree and and you know
*  There's every degree every goddamn thing it it's now there can't just be two parties
*  Which is the good one and then the immoral evil ones. Yeah
*  That's crazy that there's by the way 68 fucking genders and only two sides of politics
*  That's fucking incredible. It's so true. It's so true
*  Yeah, so that's what happened that guy
*  Your boys act you got fucking you're with us or you're a Nazi. Yeah, that's the problem. They want compliance. It's a game
*  It's not just people that have an ideology and some people agree with it and some people don't it's a game of compliance
*  Did you see the new mute?
*  Did you see the new mutants thing mutants the new mutants the comma the Marvel? No
*  Marvel's reboot of the new mutants
*  You said earlier the new comics, okay, remember right, but what is the new mutants?
*  It's not it's it's what is it called? Did you mean the TV show the new mutants not the new?
*  I'm sorry not the new mutants the new warriors. Have you seen the most the most woke?
*  No, what is this gonna look like you're gonna think it's a joke really?
*  Yeah, so this is the kind of thing he would be laughing at okay, and people cuz I haven't read comics for like so I was a kid
*  Yeah, I like comic book movies, but anybody likes the movies, but they should
*  It should be easier than ever to give kids the comics. Okay, what is this?
*  Okay, we have talked about this snowflake and safe space. Yeah, so this is like some kind of trolling
*  But basically they've been doing this in comics for the last, you know
*  It's like a nerdy is happening comics and like Star Wars and all that shit was like nerdy
*  guys that don't get laid stuff at one point and
*  Then it became kind of cool to be a nerd and then it became a high property and so now got claimed by
*  Like the ones the Cthulhu Portland thing that's what the what comes of it this unironically look how unironically they swap the gender colors
*  Well people are mad and pink yeah people that are fucking
*  I don't even know
*  Whose jurisdiction this is but people were mad at this the people they're trying to pander to were like I don't dress like this
*  You better not
*  It's ridiculous if you dress like that even people that don't want to make fun of you will start making fun of you
*  Well, it just looks like I would give up. I'm like I can't mock you better than you're doing yourself like what okay?
*  I mean if I was gonna if I was like hey
*  Why don't you make fun of the create the stupidest woke comic you could think of that would be my characters
*  Bro, her bulge is bigger than his balls, too. If you notice that well, how do you know? That's the woman?
*  Well, I'm assuming
*  The hips like a woman is the woman and the one that's built like a man. I'm assuming that's a man
*  It's a trick question
*  Woman
*  The answer is you're a piece of shit you fucking pig you cisgendered ass fuck
*  Yeah
*  Well, wait, then here's well be negative isn't as funniest. Oh wait. Where's the girl at the backpack? That's the other one
*  Holy shit time he's goggles over his eyes because he was exposed to his grandfather's internet gas his grandfather's experimental
*  Where's the she's fucking hot
*  That's the old warriors. Oh those the old ones. Yeah, that's back in the good days shit. Where's the girl with the backpack?
*  No, that's not a sweet. Do you think her power is her powers eating cake? No what it's a magical backpack that has
*  Unlimited snacks no, I'm making that up. She just has a magical backpack
*  Oh my god a pocket dimension with seemingly infinite space which you can pull out useful or random objects
*  Okay, so look at the joint so it's not always under her control though
*  She claims to get her power from God, but not the God you're thinking of Jesus Christ. I can't do this
*  But look at the drawings. Let me see the drawing look her in the eyes while you say well
*  She looks strong like she can carry a lot of stuff on her back
*  What a magical she eats too much you can't be a superhero you too much
*  It's like you know how door like how Wendy from Wendy's got real big when they showed her again
*  This is like what happened a door the Explorer she she got a whole turn I gave one up
*  I can't they want something that like that's a troll. That's that's that like that. That's a luxury
*  That's like when you have the luxury of being like like Gillette
*  Like are you good enough to get Gillette as opposed to being like please buy our thing. We're in here
*  We're a fucking razor company
*  That's what this is fuck you to the people that are into that shit
*  Which you can only do in a good economy like now people better love your shit
*  You don't get to just troll them right good point. Oh, right
*  It's gonna be harder to sell things or troll me and make me laugh
*  Oh, like I will give it to that guy who made that up right well
*  That's where the benefit of bad things actually comes in sometimes like some of the best things are bad things that are good by accident
*  Right yeah, like what like that the room movie?
*  movie yeah, we I used to introduce that movie in New York for
*  I did it for a promo thing for Comedy Central first, but then I had never seen the movie
*  So I kept going back and like hosting it and then we made a fake sequel to it
*  This guy George glass and he he knew Tommy so Tommy would leave me these long messages. It's fucking
*  That's how long ago. This was and the guy who played oh hi mark Greg his name is
*  He wrote that book that they made the movie that guy's cool shit. Oh the guy who plays mark yeah, and
*  But the other guy the one who got a blowjob, and he had like who's like
*  Oh, he'll shiver me timbers or something mm-hmm cuz he left his under I left me under wears in your remember that guy
*  He gets a blowjob and on on
*  What's his name's we zo's couch?
*  God I don't remember that yeah, I remember every character. I saw it a bunch of times
*  I don't think I've ever seen it all the way through
*  Dude, I think I've only seen scenes. I've never gone now. I never went to
*  It has like well at the time
*  I don't know if it does now, but I had like that Rocky Horror Picture Show kind of thing
*  I never did that so at movie theaters people go and this movie group watching it
*  You it feels like right to yell at it. I swear to God like I am I thought it was like a
*  I'm not gonna get I immediately was like oh this I really understand this
*  And people yell sometimes all the band playing and like
*  Yeah, it was great it was fucking awesome, but the Rocky Horror Picture Show they do that because they actually like it
*  Yeah, but this is a different vibe. Yeah, it's very hard. I mean he's genuinely a fucking maniac
*  And hard to deal with I had to have dude
*  I know my girlfriend and another friend dress kind of like slutty and distract him
*  So he wouldn't see the parody thing we made before we showed it and look at the reviews
*  Yeah
*  But that did nobody listen to make a thing that's watchably bad is like
*  That's a beautiful thing that can only it is rarely happen. Yeah, it's it's interesting like the the room is so unfeasibly bad
*  It has become a cult hit
*  Trust me. This is the worst movie you will ever see ever in your entire life ever
*  But it's it's like but it's amazing because when they say worst they have to be I mean
*  Watchable where it's not boring. That's the thing right? It's just not for easy
*  So I think that's like a real lightning in a bottle
*  It's the worst movie because they're trying to make a good movie. It's not the worst movie to watch I
*  Think it's the best to go to a thing a theater of people. It's like the best
*  People are shouting at the screen because you have cancer
*  Shouting at the screen because you have cancer
*  Your lady with cancer it's it's such a crazy movie
*  When did you see it? When did you I've only seen I've only seen it on like I guess it was DVD at the time
*  Mmm, or what and I only watched like part of it and then I had shut it off. I can't do this
*  Did you ever see the time remember that I remember those billboards Jamie when I when I lived here early in the Hollywood days
*  And right after they made this movie, I would drive around see that billboard. It was up there forever
*  Forever
*  He had the room the movie and we were like, ah the room movie comm he drive by it. Like what year was that?
*  I'm trying to remember I might have made it up because I'm like I've seen this I feel like I've seen it in person
*  Really? But I don't know what he might have had it up. He might have had it up still he was he had a billboard up forever
*  Yeah, but what year was the movie made doesn't three it said what? Yeah, how's that possible?
*  Well, I missed it I would have thought it was way earlier than that
*  But he knows multiple billboards. It's one where it was coming soon. How old is he? Nobody knows
*  Yeah, I never saw the top one coming soon. How old is he? I don't know. He's it looks like an older fella
*  But there's a couple movies like that like showgirls is a movie like that where it's so I don't remember it
*  I just vaguely remember. That's a good. It's a good one
*  At the end of Elizabeth Berkeley after that
*  Oh
*  That's hard to bounce back from some of those movies, but because the movie is so bad or because it was uh, you know
*  Who knows man?
*  She went from saved by the bell to being a dirty girl
*  So to screech
*  They brought back saved by the bell. Yeah, it's later. Look at this Wow
*  Looking good freak. I just made it
*  Mario Lopez looking good. Everybody's looking good. So what are they coming back as the other the parents?
*  Zach is
*  a bunch of jokes referring to it and there's a bunch of new jokes about like iPads and
*  Screech was out there doing
*  He was me in the book behind the bell or something like that
*  Screech was doing stand-up. There was a skippy from family ties. Remember when he was doing stand-up? Yes
*  Remember lived with him Judah Freelander was his right. Oh, that's right. Yeah, he said that's right. We're just like be in his room
*  He's like he would smoke pot all day and then he would come out and be like, did you eat my it was like a
*  I'm gonna have a sandwich and I'm not gonna touch it for a while, but I want that sandwich
*  So and he would always come out freaked out about missing a call to something what happened to him
*  Does he still do stand-up now or no, I don't know now. I'm skipping with
*  I used to remember. I was this thing. Is that what it said? He'll go. Yeah, like he's dirty now
*  Oh, give you with nuts get it. I don't know
*  He would always be there like I never met him
*  I don't think and maybe I made him one time but he would always be on the wall
*  I come in next week scape you from family times
*  I remember those the first guy that I worked in a club where he worked and I was like, oh, yeah that guy from TV
*  It's coming next week. Yeah the oh who I met at TV
*  You know the first guy I remember I saw from TV and comedy where I like saw him the club was a legendary wid
*  That guy yeah, we saw him walking down the street
*  There's me and a big Jay we're doing the
*  What was his schtick?
*  He's a prop guy. That's right. He's that used to be on making me laugh all the time. People don't know that before carrot top
*  Prop guy was a genre. Yeah, and prop guy. I don't like when they get political property
*  Pulling out signs it's all like that let's see in the in excess video
*  Remember that Bob Dylan scene one of the old Bob
*  Oh my god, so the lady had placards and she's throwing them up there or did Bob Dylan have the placards he had it
*  It's like a couple different Pete. Yeah, they've done that more than once right the people hold up signs and choss. Yeah
*  It's a it was real whatever I didn't find it
*  To be shit, but I know it's a legendary thing of throwing your placards. Yeah, Jesus Christ
*  Yeah, it's there it is Bob Dylan oh yeah, right oh I'm thinking of you too
*  Didn't Bono do this after he might have done it too. Maybe in tribute. I'm thinking of the you too thing
*  I'm pretty sure in excess did it. I've never seen Bob. I had no idea Bob. He was the first I only saw the remake
*  He would do it to his the lyrics to his song
*  What it was you cards everywhere subterranean homesick blues?
*  And so he would that's actually him singing the words
*  So he's doing a music video, but refusing to sing he's just holding up these pieces of paper that have all the different lyrics on them
*  Yeah, I know I never saw this version. Yeah, it's
*  Who did the music and who did the thing that I'm thinking of the there made a really excess did it was it?
*  Yeah, I think it was in excess in excess
*  Who's the one the lead singer is one of those dudes that choked himself to death jerking off?
*  Yeah, wasn't
*  No, no, I'm asking is it well that who knows?
*  Once you're dead can't ask you questions
*  Somebody told me like I like cuz lies musicians are her ex heroin addicts
*  So the only thing that's close to the endorphins of that is a good choke choke
*  Jerk it off. Yeah choke jerk. So they do that. It's something very specific
*  Jamie that was it ten different videos here that did a lot of people do oh these all different people that did it in different different songs
*  Okay, go up to the NSX one well, I've never seen you thinking of the top one
*  Yeah, that's right. This one's pretty famous
*  Yeah, that's right, I'm thinking it Wow I had dude I actually had no idea
*  first
*  I
*  Only know the an excess thing. Oh, yeah, Bob Dylan was the original
*  Do you think that this guy was he a heroin guy? Is that why he was a?
*  Big he was an ex heroin guy. Just like you burn out your pleasure centers of your brain
*  So you need some that don't dance like an explosion of sensation from a choke jerk
*  I never thought of it until you brought it up, but it totally makes sense
*  Right if you do fucking big J
*  Shoot up anymore and you wanted to get that rush
*  He wanted to make this as an invention like a shark tank invention
*  Which he means dead serious invention makes me laugh so it's a big deal
*  Which he means dead serious invention makes me laughs on it's a belt with like us it let's go like it's got a sensor for
*  In case you got a jerk off to your dad. It has like a sensor to just release you when you
*  But if he lets you go in your unconscious you might bang your head off the floor and die anyway
*  It almost makes you want to try it
*  That's such an embarrassing way to die though. I know it's too
*  There's a preacher that died he had a wetsuit on he died doing that he had a
*  He had a giant dildo
*  For the wetsuits
*  So hold is coming and it's like no, I'm just jerk. I'm just guessing I would bet it was like a compression
*  Hold on that butt to plug the dildo so he's got this dildo up his ass and then
*  Sucks it all in place so it can't go anywhere so his ass can't shit it out
*  I mean is it that hard to lose a dildo in your ass you need a wetsuit your ass would want to shit it out
*  Immediately and I think he's probably and then the tension formed by that
*  Probably been to other rodeos and so he's realized. Yeah, what gets him thrown. I didn't think he just started at wetsuit level
*  Time in the wetsuit and the noose Wow and he's a preacher that's a lot
*  No, it's a lot happening
*  You know what I believe in more than ever yeah imagine that God called to him said listen
*  I'm gonna bring you to me, but you got to do it in a humiliating way. That's like
*  Imagine if God look God didn't God try to get people to kill their sons. Oh
*  You're talking about um, what was the story? I am an Isaac. Yeah
*  It's to see if you would if you do it your son it's not yet
*  It's not a creepy game. God was playing didn't actually go through with it, but it's a creepy game
*  It we yeah, well, you know you're not a fucking
*  you're not a
*  like a cave Jew from the
*  Imagine the God's ages imagine that same God today, but he's only around occasionally and he comes down
*  Fucked up thing is the view of your son as property see this is the old world
*  It's like right like God will give you ten more sons. That's in like job. That's back when you owned your right your family
*  Yeah, and by the way, if you didn't know them somebody would kill them or do something. That's just how it was
*  Yeah, it's terrible. I don't judge none of their shit, but here's the here's the reverse of that
*  I'm not taking any judgment like what if Moses saw you doing that like I don't it's not his fucking business
*  But imagine if God was real but God only came down occasionally and try to get people to do fucked up things like kill their son
*  Imagine if one time he was like a Steve-O in his early. Yeah. Yeah, well every night. He's like he was like an impractical joker
*  Well, he's like Banksy. Nobody knows what he looks like, but everybody's pretty sure he exists
*  He comes down
*  Occasionally he's not into giving large-scale advice, but occasionally he goes down talks to this preacher and says I want you
*  Thank you for believing in me. I know you're a true believer and I'm gonna bring you to heaven but you know
*  You sounds like you have too much ego you hold on to too much ego and I want to humiliate you in death
*  This sounds like the original
*  script of Prometheus by
*  This is what he was originally going
*  Prometheus is a weird one, right? I gotta like it. It's like very stupid, but I like it
*  As much as I like the next one the next alien movie was really good covenant. I like that one, too
*  I love that one. I know people didn't like it. That was a good one
*  It's also features. Justy Smollett before the allegations it does. Yes. He's in it. He is
*  He's one of the dudes in the ship. Is he a guy who fucking he's one of the do you go to the cops and say?
*  A white alien popped out of his back
*  It popped out of my back and it said this is a Magga shit
*  Oh
*  Welcome to magic
*  a Magga system you're about to enter
*  Yeah, he was one of the dudes piloting the ship with
*  What the fuck's his name Kenny? Oh, right. Yeah the comic the hilarious guy from
*  From the foot fist way Danny McBride. Yeah, he's on it too. He's hilarious
*  Yeah, I like yes, there's justy Smollett. I know Wow. It's a fun fucking movie. Hey look you got jacked BAM
*  What is that cinemag?
*  Is that in the movie is that a scene in a movie where you got oh my god
*  How did he audition for that that go right through his the back of his head?
*  Yes
*  Now I want you to imagine a cock coming out the other end of your body like I don't have to my favorite
*  Part in that movie is when the one lady locks the lady and the infected guy
*  Inside that room after the thing burst. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, that was cool, dude
*  That was a heavy fucking scene man. That was a heavy. So that was a really good scary horror movie scene
*  Yeah, that was genuinely a fucking good
*  Oh and that alien that they made at the end that one that you're showing a picture of Jamie that thing
*  That was more in the beginning that guy no no he was towards the end
*  I think he was the the combination alien well
*  The dark one I thought that oh, oh, that's the one that came out like later that stowed away
*  Yeah, that bit the girls shoulder off remember. Oh, yeah, remember that but I thought this one was like a can't like it would eat
*  It wanted to like eat them. Yeah, it was trying to eat them. Yeah, that's what it looks like
*  Look at it. That's what it looks like when it came
*  I'm sorry I thought you're talking about covenant. No, I'm talking about covenant. Did remember when they were downstairs in the other David's
*  Don't play as a black alien was it I thought it was white. No, that's it. That's what comes out of your back
*  The white one, but I thought there was a white one in that movie that it might have been one comes running in at the end
*  It's kind of it looked like that. It's lighter skinned. Yeah
*  Remember that Jamie I'm not making anything up
*  There was a scene towards the end where they realized that this
*  artificial intelligence guy had started breeding these
*  Aliens together and combining their DNA with people with other things
*  And it came it came in and where he put his all it put its arms up the alien
*  Like he did like a hand wave and it went like that
*  He did like the fucking came in the Joe Diaz hand with space wave and it was a
*  It came running out and it bit her on the shoulder look at that this alien looks like Joey Diaz's balls
*  I don't think this is no it's um, it's when he was downstairs in that
*  It sounds like a pink one. It was a weird color
*  it was like a whitish color and it was down when he was in the
*  The dwelling where that guy would draw and do all scientific. Oh, no, no a face hugger got him
*  Well, there was another one. There was a full-grown alien down there
*  Anybody who's like a real alien fans probably so mad at us right now. Yeah, this is it can feel it. This is it. Oh
*  Oh, he gets mad someone shot it's kind of a white thing. It's called a neomorph. I guess. Yeah, they killed it
*  He's all mad
*  What is this
*  Music that goes with it. Okay. Yeah, that's it
*  So there's a scene but there's a scene where it gets a girl I think I'm pretty sure I
*  Think it was yeah. See so it's kind of a pale-looking thing. Sorry. What is that?
*  You're like of entertainment in the last 15 minutes ladies. I forgot what you think it was
*  I know it's romantic with this song. Well, that was a cool part of the movie that he had been there for so long
*  He'd been experimenting with these aliens and making different kind of right
*  Yeah
*  And it was also interesting to like the difference between the the new version where they had cut out creativity
*  Creativity in the old version or he was wait they cut out creativity in the artificial intelligence guys, you know, there's always
*  Oh, yeah, right, right, right though. He's like, yeah, there's always a robot. I tried to kiss himself for something
*  I love you. That's what it looked like Jamie. That's that's exactly what it looked like
*  That right there you just had it bang so
*  that's what it looked like and then it came out and its whole mouth opens up and
*  Bitter shoulder and like took a giant chunk out of her if I remember correctly, I'd be I was very scared
*  What is all that different lighting over it? Do you know? I don't know. It's good question. Those are some of my favorite movies
*  Yeah, no, I like it. I just wish they he showed the fucking engineer. I don't like they space it out another
*  You know extra movie and he has really something about somebody who like a space Judy
*  Someone like that haircut that fucking fights aliens
*  It's up to this last space Judy to fucking
*  Is that what it was and that music are we fucked now?
*  We're gonna play the sound. Oh good
*  It's uh, I mean those the series of movies and some of the best horror and science fiction movies of all time
*  You got to go back to the original one that original alien holds up. Yes, great holds up. That's a
*  1979 movie about aliens and space and it fucking holds up
*  You know, I mean it's still the the the the technology looks goofy like the little
*  It's going off in the other computers in a fucking older
*  They don't know what they're doing nothing looks worse than like a 90s tech movie like hackers or something. Oh, is this a Pentium?
*  future
*  Yeah, but what were they right about back to the future? They were probably right about a lot of shit, right?
*  Wasn't Trump president and back to the future to see my role imagine
*  Was he I think he was president of the Simpsons the Simpsons predicted it. Yes
*  There's a great video about how accurate the Simpsons were about so many different things
*  Yeah, and that Matt Groening must be some sort of a time traveler. I
*  Don't I think he just like said whatever the most hilarious thing he could think of was and turn out to be true
*  13 Simpsons predictions that could not come true, but still could all right
*  Let's oh that have not come true. Oh, it's still good
*  In vodka 2028 is probably 100% gonna happen
*  They would if it was said Melania that I would go Oh time do you think people step up Melania and Michelle Obama
*  They're the hottest first lady we've ever had
*  She's for sure the hottest any argument will start a fight, right? There's no who's a close second
*  To Melania Trump. I mean, it's not even fair to not fair. Yeah. No, it's not fair
*  But Melania and Michelle Obama together
*  Michelle probably was the most the unite the parties. Wait. Oh, yeah, Laura Bush was a was a
*  She was not bad was not bad pretty lady
*  Hillary Clinton when she was younger fucking Barbara Bush was like it was like a legendary joke how unfuckable the first lady was
*  The entire 90s there was like some work. I would punch Barbara Bush in the face
*  Naked gun. Yeah, there were so many Joe J. Be falling down the stairs people loved it, dude
*  So many jokes about Barbara Bush, dude, she was like like she was legendarily ugly
*  I understood she was the first lady and also she was one of the ugliest
*  It just came through over and over again on the all media. So this is all the first lady
*  Do they mocked her on every format of whatever they did. She was declared ugly they did it was like
*  Yeah
*  Nancy Reagan was always Jackie. Oh, though was one of the first ones you could see abortion or thing. Oh, really?
*  Yeah, member there was pictures of Jackie and hush

*  Yeah, they just gonna try to make they thought it was gonna be like a playboy hustler mansion playboy
*  Well, he did open up some casinos
*  Nancy Reagan used to get Ronald Reagan to listen to astrology. Yeah, right
*  She like had like a White House astrologer they would run all the decisions by you believe in astrology
*  Do you do astrology? Oh every day. Oh, I don't in fact, I'm doing it right now. I'm a Gemini and we're skeptics
*  Oh
*  First ladies never married to presidents never made other women. Oh the the side pieces wait
*  But they were still considered the first lady. No, no, no the ones who this is just a trick
*  Yeah, it's a true national first lady's library
*  Turn that over you son of a bitch. Why do we are the society that's us the side piece society of
*  It's like the sons and daughters of the the daughters of the revolution I
*  Can't wait for a woman to become president just so we could see what we call the guy
*  Is that not settled unless she's a lesbian which should be even better. I
*  Hope that we find out we don't have to address the problem to see to run the country
*  Whether you love pussy and you have one or you love that's how I would run if I was lesbian like hey
*  We all know it's important. You'll have to be willing to eat boss
*  We all love pussy. I
*  Wait, is this what am I looking for? Oh
*  The weed weed the weed
*  I thought you I thought he was posting it on the screen the elation for your coronavirus test and then the weed together
*  Something punch an AIDS test was not as stressful really yeah, I didn't feel is
*  It's um
*  It it's probably
*  It's just because there's a long car ride, so I'm just like oh shit. It's probably the most stress inducing
*  thing
*  Any of us have had to go through
*  except for the people that have been to war or first responders or people that have
*  Find it strangely calming because it's so
*  Beyond my control of a so beyond yeah, I got an accident you had Barry Crimmins on here one time didn't you?
*  Yeah, so we were on a tour together. We almost died in this car accident really yeah the car
*  We were in it was when black ice and who's driving?
*  Dude I won't say any input anyway
*  So he's driving I'm in the passenger seat Barry's behind the driver
*  And we were going about 65 on the highway which wouldn't be too bad except. It's black ice cuz it's winter
*  He's trying to pass this tractor trailer, so as we're going the car starts wobbling and uh oh my god
*  Yeah, so I remember I said what the fuck three times. I this how much time there was I didn't like
*  Anything because I saw the trailer we we just started my side started going in under the fucking oh my god
*  I just remember going well. I guess I'm dead like and then at the very last second it's fun
*  Like cuz it was wobbling and then the back where no one was sitting that got grabbed and the window blew in and then we
*  Spun into the middle of the highway
*  It was crazy, but afterwards like I remember that me and Barry for I felt like high
*  I remember you tell me the story the driver was weeping
*  I felt high and the reason was it was it was so out of my control
*  I mean it was so like cuz I was definitely sure my house gonna come off guys
*  went like that and uh
*  It felt so out of my hands. I was like oh like it it felt like oh
*  It's a but I thought I was gonna die all kinds of times
*  But usually it was like you know I mix some kind of drugs or I did something where you know it made sense
*  So some I think I was trained to from you know end of the world kind of feelings since birth
*  From being in that thing and I think I just have them where it relaxes me more than
*  What would they tell you the end of the world you know?
*  Whatever the everybody says like what do you mean like like when you say it was an end of the world cult like what?
*  Did what did they do they call him? Yeah that God's
*  Revelations gonna happen and Armageddon
*  God's gonna destroy the wicked system of things it has an appeal to it
*  For sure and then set up a reasonable survive of course
*  Well Joe was when is his people that some people live on earth in a Garden of Eden
*  restored paradise
*  Have you ever seen the literature they show that I believe it's paintings of Hawaii
*  No, you ever go to Hawaii. It's beautiful. It looks like gorgeous. That's what their heaven is maybe that's the moon
*  That's what the guy painting it in the things I saw when I finally went to Hawaii
*  I was like oh, this is the pair. That's what I thought of a paradise my entire
*  Life of you know the Garden of Eden and who does Hawaii looks like that
*  Imagine if Hawaii was all it was left
*  But there's an amount of okay, there's enough people but imagine if that's it well there'd be a lot of meth
*  I'll tell you that but how many people like what Hawaii is supposedly I think the
*  Spot in the world that's the furthest away from other spots
*  Like it is completely isolated in the middle of the ocean. It's a hawaii. It's like the earth's vagina. I think lush
*  Yeah, it's gorgeous, right? It's amazing, but I think it's also
*  Five hours by plane to anywhere I
*  Think the closest you can get is like Guam or places like that, but it's really
*  It shocked me. I got there at night when I went to kawaii
*  I didn't I I heard is like the good one to go to quite awesome
*  So never been but it was pitch black when I got there at night
*  And then I woke up and I looked like fucking Jurassic Park or like it was crazy
*  That's where they filmed your eyes. I was on like a cliff
*  And then there's like it was like every kind of biome in one spot. It's magic
*  At least from the photos. Well, I've been a one one five days five days perfect
*  Yeah, like ever you go crazy after that dude. It would become a beautiful hell that
*  That you you're only joy in life besides math amphetamine would be showing new people that come the island
*  The movie weren't they on Hawaii and the show lost they're desperately trying to get out
*  An island like Hawaii, but they filmed it. I thought in Hawaii. Oh, yeah for sure they did right
*  Yeah, and you're ready to go after unless like you're it was like a place you go after you die it felt like well
*  Some people go to like Maui and they they live there. I've seen dog the bounty hunter. I know oh
*  I know
*  Steven Tyler was there a bunch of appears brahling lived up the block from where I stayed did he really yeah
*  I think it's the climate kind of destroys property. So it's very expensive the upkeep of like owning a home there, dude
*  I was just reading about Malibu how much beach Malibu's losing and they're trying to do all these different things to try to save the
*  Beach like a comb over from another
*  Like as they don't acknowledge there's a problem they're literally much like I do with my hair for many
*  They were literally calling it a beach Botox
*  Really? Yes. Why they try to last
*  Because it's like a little quick fix so they pour all this
*  Sand into this area and then the ocean swats it away
*  I thought they have a way to make artificial sand dunes that work
*  They have a way to do some walls
*  But the thing about it is it affects other beaches
*  So like if you put up a beach wall over here, it's gonna affect the beach of the people down there
*  And so they're like hey fuck you you're gonna ruin our beach because you want more beach, right?
*  Because there's only a certain amount of water. The problem is though. The water is rising
*  Yeah, the water starting to take over so then everybody should have extra water
*  Good everywhere. Well, they're saying by 2100. It's gonna move all the way through
*  There's gonna be there's gonna be none of those houses. This was what the story was saying that by
*  2100 there'll be no more beach. There'll be no one
*  No
*  Those houses will exist the beach will be in a totally different spot
*  The water will get so high that it just starts taking over everything
*  No shit, yeah, man sounds like I'm telling you China felt like going to the movie Blade Runner. I bet it did
*  I wouldn't go now. It seems the tensions are high now. Yeah
*  Well, I was there before the 2016 election just before it and they were into Trump
*  Oh really? Yeah, cuz he's like a business that whole thing of your name on everything like mm-hmm change people love that
*  Like they they get him. Do I mean like I don't know now how it is, but um, they were all about him because he's business
*  He's a businessman he was successful. He's a businessman. That's how they fucking well, he definitely it's not commies
*  I'm saying he definitely rubbed them the wrong way with this, right? Oh
*  No, they don't even have a dude if the country of China goes. Hey, that's racist. They're purely playing on
*  American like dippy kind of shit like they don't have any feelings like do you see what they're doing black people there?
*  They're kicking them out now. They they put it on them, you know, yeah instead of the bats
*  What everybody said they're like, oh, it's cuz it spreads because of black people
*  That's what they trying to say that it's because of black people because they also said it was because of Americans
*  Um, yeah, they're like fucking Romulans do whatever whatever it takes to make a narrative the government controls like here
*  It's a bunch of corporations pushing what they want. They're the fucking guy the head guy the papers pushes Winnie the Pooh agenda
*  I think they just passed a law saying that the Chinese guys can't go online and play video games with people in other countries
*  Yeah, well Russia has some laws like that too
*  You couldn't get certain American foods because of the fucking you know, after they went to Crimea. There was like a
*  anti-american sentiment, but the government was like yeah America's are they really still I watched that
*  Interview you did with what's his name Snowden? Yeah, it was interesting
*  But I thought I thought it really stuck out about it how it blows up
*  Because Putin could be like failing if not for same way Trump wins
*  Right, it's not for the constant like this guy's the devil in the boogeyman and it gives them status
*  Yes, you know smoking commercials where they go
*  Quit smoking and and that they say they don't work because all it does is put the word smoking in your head, right?
*  That's what they've been doing for fucking fire. Don't don't Trump but all you hear is Trump
*  Well, that was what Trump's play when running up to the election to say more outrageous shit. They would
*  I mean, that's great. You called the system up. Yeah, but they used that to show how bad Trump is
*  I have been doing that on purpose. I think that's something he's done
*  Yeah for many years, but I think with them like they didn't even know what was going on until they were checkmated
*  Like they're fucking greedy. They were making money off it. Yeah, yeah for sure
*  Yeah, it's a great thing people want to see the dumb shit that he says they want to get outraged
*  They tune in to it. So I mean maybe next time I'll crack down on comedy people want to hear someone not observe
*  Your fucking stupid like somebody they want someone to ace venture
*  Adventure, but they're handing your food plate and your monocle falls out
*  So that used to be like my job, but now you this is like the most
*  My now my job is being an ally or some shit
*  Not that and Trump Trump gets to do everybody's job of just saying whatever crazy shitty one
*  He gets to be Tracy Morgan now
*  And Tracy Morgan has to watch it. That's that's the system that we have
*  That's a good way of putting it like nobody tells crazy Morgan stop saying crazy shit
*  He's the one guy who can't be
*  Stopped for not damn by the way. Why shouldn't he say crazy shit?
*  you could say the most reasonable shit in the world and somebody will the shit with you with a
*  Bernie where they're like
*  He better. I was he supposed to do like like throw away your not even direct endorsement
*  I said is I'll probably vote for him. Yeah, like he was supposed to like like denounce you I
*  Swear to God I read this I have a huge bit about it now
*  I almost want don't want to go into it because I'm hoping that comedy will return. I'll be better
*  You gotta go ten new minutes. You gotta guard your precious bits
*  In this COVID-19
*  The real bang we can I really go back to comedy like what's a comedy club gonna be like when it returns and when I asked you
*  When do you think like I was gonna ask you well, that's that's when the problem right cuz none of us fucking have an idea
*  Yeah, we're all I got a podcast. So I guess that
*  I'm basically I got a podcast. I'm gonna start farming tigers is my what I have going on
*  Pussy handled plenty of tigers, so I don't gotta worry about getting pussy. I'll get put
*  That's the move right if you have tigers people the fucking tiger guy
*  Yeah, he does yoga. He does yoga and tigers that guy that guy fucks. Oh the guru guy
*  Yeah, what does he call himself? Bhagavan Giga?
*  Any white guy call themselves Baga Vida fuck yeah, oh god, that's hilarious
*  What does it mean? What does it fall for that that blows my fucking mind?
*  We fall for Manson same way you become a social justice warrior same shit people want to belong your mom kicked you out for having
*  A pot pipe that's how that
*  There was an FBI raid at your house because you bought drugs in the park a lot of the fast food restaurant you worked at
*  Oh, yeah
*  Bhagavan look at the girls a bug even I know looking good, bro
*  Congratulations to you
*  Like he looks good in a tie nice bow tie
*  But that show the beautiful thing about that show is that those are real people and this is real life
*  And it's like oh, that's there too
*  No, I kind of get why the Chinese are grinding up tigers now for dick pet. I mean obviously it works
*  I don't even know why I was criticizing
*  You could keep the tiger alive and get the same pussy. That's all I'm saying it is yeah
*  I don't do do they have tiger bones or something like that. Is that one of their ailment?
*  These tires like the chairman Mao his like old sayings of
*  Like his physician wrote a book after he died know what he's saying
*  He's like filthy like he he had like syphilis
*  He wouldn't brush his teeth and the doctor like you listen you got to brush your teeth and here we go
*  I swear you go does the tiger brush his teeth
*  What do you even have to say that's like saying this is New Orleans
*  This is Las Vegas
*  Traditional Chinese medicine tiger bones are believed to help cure conditions like rheumatism and arthritis along with erectile dysfunction
*  Rhino, oh my god, you put a rhino horn on your ass. You're up some tiger powder on your fucking balls. You're ready to go, baby
*  Yeah back when they all had syphilis and they just died of it and it rotted their skin out their teeth
*  That's so fucking what you see the Johnny Depp movie where he gets the nose fall off syphilis. Oh, what was that movie the libertine?
*  No
*  Yeah, no, I didn't see that one. I don't I don't I don't really kind of remember it
*  But I know at the end he's all fucking syphilitic and it looks like he looks like a dead man. Tell no tales
*  Pirates of the Caribbean ghost. Oh god, but that was a common thing cuz you just get syphilit
*  Look at his eyeball to his got a dead. Eye. He's got makeup on the wig. That's how people lived
*  You imagine what they stunk like back then? I know that's the thing I have
*  rotting
*  syphilitic
*  With a wig on sweating under the wig makeup cake skin and oh
*  Imagine no soap
*  But a pair of boots from and you've got open sores probably all over the place because of the syphilis
*  If you lost your nose, it's not all you're losing you got holes all over your fucking body
*  Is that right you get like new nose holes besides just nose holes, dude
*  Go to syphilis wounds like syphilis autopsy that your fucking head falls
*  More holes to fuckers that syphilis talk
*  No, I know holes in your skin like where you could see your skull
*  I know it was making me out feel gross
*  Yes, is it really like that yeah
*  The whole powdered wig thing came from no yeah came from people that had syphilis
*  Particularly to I believe there was French gentleman who were royalty that were young and they contracted syphilis their hair fell out
*  And I started wearing wigs look at that guy's face. Holy shit
*  Who's pussy to he oh my god, he looks like a little kid too. What is his lips are gone his nose
*  How would that be it just it just rots your skin out leaves holes in your oh my god, dude. Yeah
*  horrendous a
*  Powder wigs not gonna fix that. No, so what happened? Look you get holes in your skin and shit. Look at that guy
*  No, put away that shit
*  His fucking head into his brain
*  So anyway a nice comfortable wig on top of that
*  That must feel fucking amazing. These wealthy guys were like the shit. What does it say syphilis? What is it? What is it?
*  By the way syphilis or gonorrhea that came from the New World did it you know
*  I like their flu that killed all the fucking well, they brought back
*  I
*  Yeah, either gonorrhea or syphilis so he came from Native American month assume his revenge. Oh wow, is that true? Yeah
*  It's the world. I mean I assume that's what killed Al Capone to write didn't it
*  They say that but there's a new movie coming out with Bane in it. What's his name?
*  And he plays a
*  Have you seen the Ed Hardy
*  And Hardy I love Tom Hardy, how dare you yeah Tom Hardy's gonna play a syphilitic
*  And yeah, this movie seems to be about that. He was faking it. Oh
*  I don't know who fucking knows when someone's dead for 50 years. You can make up shit about him. Yes
*  Oh, it's like who cares start making up what happens out of like yes
*  I mean I could believe he probably had several course he had syphilis
*  Probably had everything and I don't think he's getting enough meth like at least like the
*  JFK and Hitler were getting their meth to come yeah cocaine injections and testosterone shots. Yeah, what is this the trailer?
*  Brandon
*  The Al Capone based on true events, but you could just say that based on true events
*  You can kind of fucking do whatever you want. I yeah true. So anyway, do you just mean events?
*  That's what events are things that happened. There was a guy who lived in the house and everything else were made up
*  Yeah Al Capone was a guy so the big wig thing came from these guys who were rich guys who wore these powdered wigs
*  That's what a big wig is. Yeah, and other people wanted to copy them
*  And so it became fashion a lot of them had syphilis and the more expensive your wig would be the bigger would be
*  So that's why I don't know because he'd have like a lot of like a real a lot of hair in it
*  You got to really distract from the rest of the part
*  Apart from
*  Dude and then they were still fucking hoping their dick wouldn't rot off
*  It's still fucking I think a lot of times the dick would rot off wouldn't
*  People just turned into cheese gradually back then yeah, they just had holes in their face that guy has a hole in his face
*  Oh, dude, he's key. Look, he's trying the the painter made him flattering, right? That's the worst fucking part
*  Yeah, look at that hole in his head. That is under selling make the whole idealize the hole in my face
*  Right, that's not a mole right? No
*  Pull it up pull it make it larger
*  So this guy is a syphilitic hole. Is that a word? Yeah syphilitic hole in his face and
*  Other than that looks great
*  With his rosy lips Lucy's got some lipstick on
*  Nice outfit that's how foundation and
*  If you were a royalty back then you probably fucked all the peasants, right?
*  They know you would fuck a cousin and then whoever attends to your cousin in the castle
*  Well, you would breed with a cousin, but you probably fuck a bunch of people on the sneak tip too, right?
*  Yeah, probably. Yeah, you're a royal and you got a hole in your face and you know how much time
*  Right. How much time do you think you got left when you can see your teeth on the side?
*  It's well, that's what Chairman Mao did he fucking stepped up his stepped up his horn
*  I told him he was sterile and Chairman Mao took it to mean erectile dysfunction, but he just met no
*  Oh, I'm a sterile am I I'll show and he just spread a whole bunch of
*  And the girls were proud of it. They would say I caught the fucking
*  Syphilis from Chairman Mao. Yeah, cuz that's a fucking cold in the half
*  Yeah, now that's your mom's house shirt I got syphilis from Chairman Mao have a hoe with like half her face hanging out
*  Yeah, I do and he wouldn't want it. It's crazy the details
*  Do you imagine that they were proud if that is that's real like the car leader do listen
*  What didn't the chick from Smallville get a brand of some guy from like us, right?
*  Multi-level not even a cult like a multi-level marketing seminar
*  Yeah, no brand my ass
*  right
*  Right. It was like that vitamin company. I did that without any tigers. He did that completely tiger free
*  How did I do that? He got women to be his tigers. They would go out and get other women
*  Make them feel comfortable. What do you think? But but was there acid involved? Was there any kind of?
*  No, just group manipulation. That's it. Yeah acid
*  That's why it's so stupid those experiments cuz like I feel like I like somebody could have told you I like nothing
*  That's just like a seasoning on top of something that's already there, right?
*  That's not there's not a drug that puts a thing there that that wasn't there
*  It's it let something out that was in there, you know, so that I don't know if you're right
*  Don't you write about about acid religion gets to who you are
*  Like if you were something you devoted it's something that it gets to who you are
*  I'm sure that's what people can't leave because they're like that would be like I wouldn't exist anymore
*  Because this is what I am. I'm sure that's true without any acid and without drugs
*  But I do think that they showed that you can do things to people if you
*  Get them daily acid and manipulate them. I think it was a pretty good disorient
*  I'm sure you can disorient people and fucking well, they even thought there's they're pretty sure
*  I don't think they plan for people to do things
*  I get people to commit murder get people to do things that would never do those things. I mean
*  Well, I'm sure that it doesn't help
*  I just don't like Ted Kaczynski like I can see that looks like something getting out of hand like right our acid experiment
*  Created a thing we didn't expect not that that was the end goal. Right, right. Right. I agree with you
*  Yeah, I think with Kaczynski what happened was he just made sense but he made sense in a way the people like yeah
*  But you don't blow up the guy who's the issue. I don't get it's just like, you know, hey, I don't get why
*  Okay, great the trains run on time, but why would you have to kill six million?
*  Like how how does one correlate to the next right? You know, like like that's why I said seems we came from the future
*  Cuz so you're really like that's exactly what's going on right now and he knew ahead of time
*  You got a brilliant guy and then dose him up with acid at Harvard
*  Yeah, right. So he probably thinks hey, I made it to Harvard. He's all scrambled up. I'm still yeah still smart, but it's all like fault
*  What was a brilliant mind that movie? Yeah, right. Yeah Russell Crowe member
*  Was it that brilliant for him to figure out to go hit on the ugly check?
*  So the hot chick he won a fucking Nobel prize for that
*  I don't think that was the point hit on the seven over the ten was his big
*  Remember when he went crazy
*  In the movie. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think that if you just gave him acid, he probably gone crazy, too
*  I think there's a lot they say that acid does that if you have mental it can definitely get to yeah
*  Yeah, you can shake that shit loose. Yeah, so can pot
*  Is that what the guy from the Beach Boys said happen?
*  He because he smoked so much pot which one the one that hung out with the Mansons because one of the one of the boys
*  Wilson he hung out with the Mansons. He's in the book a lot
*  He's a lot in that book he had like a guru who was like his own personal like nexium guy for a while
*  Oh, he said he smoked pot and wouldn't come out of his house
*  I'm not surprised. Yeah, he blamed marijuana. But yeah, it's not like a
*  Panacea medicine for all your problems. Well, not only that marijuana can fuck you up if you're not ready for it
*  It can especially now. I don't know. I like to find good mids
*  Again, yeah mids you don't want to get too deep sometimes like I think in this podcast there's many times
*  Well, I don't know what we're talking about. Yeah
*  Cuz I smoked a fucking blunt
*  By the way, it was to get at that tobacco in the leaf. Of course you want it. Yes
*  It's like when I want at this body of that delicious tobacco that sweet sweet nicotine soothing me and celebrating no kovat 19. Yeah
*  How worried about you are you?
*  How worried about all this are you and is it something you get anxiety over you really just I mean
*  I need those road dates to pay my rent. So that's worrying. Yeah
*  But I'm not worried like the end of the world. I mean, I just don't even have that I
*  Wonder what's gonna happen in terms of like the restructuring of society when things bounce back
*  It's gonna be like China do just be just like China a bunch of people look like Naruto
*  Everybody's got a mask on like everybody's a ninja
*  That's why I saw a bunch of people in masks
*  It looked like Blade Runner kind of like it's just gonna be worried about that. That's not gonna be good for us
*  Well, I mean hopefully it helps with this whole kovat virus I
*  Hope it does help. I hope there's something better even I hope there's some some sort of medication comes out of this
*  Well, we well at a certain point it'll be like a tamiflu if it doesn't deliver on the amount of deaths that it's promised
*  And people that's what people be like. All right, come on. Yeah, no, I think you're right
*  Um, yeah, I just wonder I wonder how long that's gonna take
*  Like what seeing how Vegas wants to reopen like and then Anderson
*  I see their ads with it like hey, listen Vegas don't even worry about Vegas right now. You just quarantine
*  Vegas is still here. Yeah, they're still advertising like don't forget about Vegas. I saw an ad like that for a car
*  They're just showed an empty road. Don't even worry about driving stay home dodge
*  Yeah, I think I was I despise that people like whoever the Don Draper's are they same guy that made that Gillette ad
*  No, is it check? It was a
*  Australian like oh really? There's a whole new like crop of like young ish, you know kind of like
*  feminist drizzle
*  But it's like in ads. It's like, you know what against yeah
*  But it's a what that's I know woke was going because once it's commodified like hey kids your woke right?
*  We're a corporation like another corporation said it's been dead for a fucking right. It's corporate created punk rock
*  Yes horrid
*  It's that makes it grow like when it was some granola kids spouting not it was more hilarious
*  Yeah, really like everything you hear about colleges like those kids, but they all a lot of them came out in the real world
*  And what's interesting what's interesting to me about the thing almost as much as the kids himself is the intelligent adults who should know better
*  Yeah, well that's that's the kids to push the radical ideas because they thought of those kids is almost like the soldiers in the
*  Forest far left. Yeah, throw them onto the beach and they don't understand that they're the first ones to go
*  They think the people that think like that. They have no idea. They're more despised than anybody on the right. They hate a fucking
*  John Stewart era liberal more than any does it I mean they're calling boomers
*  Those are all Gen Xers. They're not boomers, but that's how the disdain
*  Yeah, the ones that are really forcing compliance they want to reshape the world they want to reshape the way people behave
*  I know people personally that are like good friends with that are like their feeling is like I just wanted to be like Biden
*  Mm-hmm. So like how oh like because it'll just then they're gonna calm down like no
*  They're not gonna calm down because they got a little taste of power. Yeah, they're gonna
*  full socialism
*  People are gonna it's not like people it's kind of funny cuz a lot of them don't a lot of them are just like fucking
*  Silly upper upper middle class kind of twits that are pretending that they're fucking so but they don't the first thing about it
*  Who's that guy that got the adpocalypse on fucking YouTube from Vox remember that? Yes. Yeah, like that guy. He's a rich kid
*  It comes out. He's a rich kid. Yeah, so that's who does they're not really socialists. They like the feeling
*  They like the shagovera kind of t-shirt feeling they get and then they also like the good life
*  Yes, that's why it's all silly kind of people the people I know that spout that shit
*  Most of them have money. I've never I can't think of anybody not do they don't have real problems
*  Yeah, everyone's a bigot
*  Imagine I mean imagine Karen about fucking just see Joaquin Phoenix talking about dairy like
*  Can you just imagine bringing up milk or like charging on the stairs?
*  Well, that's what I really knew Bernie was unfit to be president when they took his mic twice two elections
*  Oh the black lives matter people first those girls took his mic then two white girls you start letting you let you black girls
*  Do it guess what now white girls are gonna do it
*  Your president has to hold his mic. Yeah
*  Oh was it maybe it was something really important to stop milk bro. How much shit is his security?
*  You think I mean, holy how bad are they?
*  How bad is this security? He should have had all female, you know, like a slick one. I have a female
*  Defense force to fucking crack him in it to talk about milk to run on like Bernie stop the dairy. He's from fucking Vermont
*  He's not gonna stop the dairy
*  Fucking high the land of cheese hippies
*  That's the dairy is gonna get be fine. Listen up in Vermont man. You need that cheese just to stay alive in the winter
*  It just imagine giving a shit about milk like that
*  And imagine thinking that you need to interrupt the president a guy who you probably want to be president
*  You gotta interrupt his campaign speech to get your I feel like you didn't get enough vitamin D milk as a kid to
*  To help you be balanced. Yeah, you gotta eat meat
*  She's got a very topless by the way, don't don't do your message topless cuz I don't care what the message
*  I'm just looking at your tits now for sure. It's not helping you
*  Yeah that if that is your argument about dairy, you might really just want everybody to see your tits
*  Yeah, the older protester kept her shirt on right? Yeah, she probably even know the one was doing
*  Overdoing tits great. She was probably like in the moment like I just was thinking last night
*  Maybe she was like alright, it's out. She's like how are you should fear would do it if he was
*  Always have a reason to take your shirt off. Yes, she should feared it. She should fear
*  Dude, it's already seven o'clock. Oh shit. Really? Yeah, we flew by
*  We did get really high does tremendous that blunt dude, I know this is speed weed shout out
*  Oh, yeah, I hope they make a comeback man. I miss that fuck. That's why I was doing my podcast. Yeah
*  Well, you know
