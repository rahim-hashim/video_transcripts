# Joe Rogan Experience #2086 - Jim Norton
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6.0s)]
*  Speaking of cold New York, how about these fucking Jewish folks? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=10.0s)]
*  What, the tunnel they were making under? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=17.0s)]
*  Whoa, I'm reading about that, I don't even know what it means. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=19.0s)]
*  Why would they hire people to dig a hole? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=21.0s)]
*  Um, I don't know exactly what's happening. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=23.0s)]
*  All I know is very short clips that I found on the internet. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=27.0s)]
*  But the funniest thing is this one guy on Twitter that was saying a while back, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=30.0s)]
*  I live on a ground floor apartment and I hear Jews underneath me. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=35.0s)]
*  And everybody's like, you're out of your fucking mind. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=41.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's anti-Semitic. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=45.0s)]
*  Exactly, and now he's like, I told you I wasn't crazy! [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=47.0s)]
*  But this guy's just... [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=50.0s)]
*  But what are they doing? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=52.0s)]
*  What are they doing? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=53.0s)]
*  I heard that they hired people to build this tunnel and they were hanging out [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=54.0s)]
*  and the people would live there for three weeks. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=57.0s)]
*  These migrant workers were just digging this tunnel and they stayed there for three weeks. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=59.0s)]
*  But what's the purpose of it? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=62.0s)]
*  I have no idea. I have no idea. I don't know anything. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=64.0s)]
*  I just know that there's tunnels and that this is one video of this guy coming out of the sewer. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=67.0s)]
*  So he lifts a manhole cover, comes out of the sewer, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=73.0s)]
*  and then he's fucking wandering around, this Hasidic Jewish guy. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=77.0s)]
*  And everybody's like, what the fuck are you doing down there? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=80.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's really bizarre. They wouldn't come out, too. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=83.0s)]
*  The cops had to get them out. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=85.0s)]
*  They were like, we don't want to come out. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=86.0s)]
*  And they were charged with disorderly conduct. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=88.0s)]
*  I don't know. The whole fucking world is just weird. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=90.0s)]
*  What do you know about this, Jamie? Anything? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=92.0s)]
*  I haven't heard anything. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=94.0s)]
*  The best I've gotten is that they started making them during COVID. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=96.0s)]
*  But that line, it makes sense, but you see the tunnel and you're like, no way. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=100.0s)]
*  They didn't do that in two years or a year or six months or whatever it was. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=104.0s)]
*  They were making nice tunnels either. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=108.0s)]
*  They were just kind of shitty, rudimentary, basic holes. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=109.0s)]
*  Were they doomsdayers? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=112.0s)]
*  They thought the world was going to end? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=114.0s)]
*  Wait a minute, the tunnels are so big that you don't think they could make them in two years? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=116.0s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=120.0s)]
*  Some of them look big. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=121.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=123.0s)]
*  I mean, some of them are saying they go into multiple different buildings. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=124.0s)]
*  It's like a series of tunnels. It's not just a tunnel. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=128.0s)]
*  Let's look into this. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=130.0s)]
*  They're still looking into it. I don't know that there's been a map of it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=131.0s)]
*  When was it discovered? Was it yesterday? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=134.0s)]
*  I think they discovered it a couple of years ago. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=136.0s)]
*  A couple of years ago? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=137.0s)]
*  Days ago. I forget even how they discovered it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=139.0s)]
*  I think they were looking... [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=142.0s)]
*  It's probably that guy complaining. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=144.0s)]
*  He probably heard something and then maybe they saw someone come out of the manhole cover and somebody put two and two together. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=145.0s)]
*  I have no idea what happened. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=149.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's strange. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=150.0s)]
*  But it's very bizarre. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=151.0s)]
*  And then of course there's conspiracy theories and what are they doing down there and evil theories. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=153.0s)]
*  They immediately want to pour concrete in it, which makes sense because it's probably not safe. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=159.0s)]
*  It's not supporting the weight of all the buildings above it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=163.0s)]
*  Yeah, you don't think of that when you move into an apartment building that some asshole might build a tunnel underneath and collapse the building on you. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=167.0s)]
*  Imagine if you're on the ground floor and you're like, why is my floor so much... [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=174.0s)]
*  These assholes are building a sinkhole under my house. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=178.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't... [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=182.0s)]
*  But it's funny how things are so crazy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=184.0s)]
*  You read about something like that and it doesn't even stand out that much. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=186.0s)]
*  We talk about it now and then tomorrow will be some other weird shit. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=189.0s)]
*  Like every day it's something weird. It's something crazy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=191.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's way more than ever before. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=194.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=197.0s)]
*  We got Jamie. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=198.0s)]
*  Here's what the New York News is saying. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=199.0s)]
*  It happened on Monday afternoon, so it's very new. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=201.0s)]
*  Something about tunneling is just so crazy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=204.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's such a commitment. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=207.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=208.0s)]
*  Isn't it interesting when you build on top of a building, it's no big deal. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=209.0s)]
*  But you go under the building like, what are you doing? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=212.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're really destabilizing that thing. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=214.0s)]
*  You're at a tunnel. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=216.0s)]
*  Tunnel. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=217.0s)]
*  For several hours, police pleaded with the young men to leave the entrance to the tunnel, according to the witnesses. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=218.0s)]
*  After they refused, the officers covered the area with a wire curtain and entered the dusty crevasse with zip ties to detain the protesters. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=223.0s)]
*  When they took the first person out with zip ties, that's when the outburst happened. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=232.0s)]
*  Baruch Dahan, a 21-year-old study of the synagogue who videotaped the congregants fighting. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=237.0s)]
*  Almost everyone was against what they did. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=242.0s)]
*  But as soon as people saw the handcuffs, there was confusion and pushing. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=244.0s)]
*  Footage posted to social media shows scores of onlookers, mostly young men, jeering at the NYPD's community affairs officers. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=248.0s)]
*  Some lifted wooden desks into the air, sending prayer books, scattering. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=256.0s)]
*  In response, the officer appeared to deploy an irritating spray to disperse the group. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=261.0s)]
*  So how did they find out about this? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=267.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=269.0s)]
*  But even after hearing that, I still know nothing about what they were doing or why. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=270.0s)]
*  I think they're just starting to try to figure it out. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=274.0s)]
*  So scroll down a little. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=277.0s)]
*  It didn't have a good explanation on what the initial call was for. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=279.0s)]
*  I was going to switch to a different article. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=283.0s)]
*  And why are they being called protesters? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=285.0s)]
*  What were they protesting? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=286.0s)]
*  If you're just sitting in a tunnel, is that actually a protest? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=287.0s)]
*  Everyone's a protestor and everyone's an activist. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=289.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=292.0s)]
*  Officials and locals said young men in the community recently built the passage to the sanctuary in secret. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=293.0s)]
*  When the group's leaders tried to seal it off on Monday, they staged a protest that turned violent as police moved in to make arrests. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=299.0s)]
*  How long does it take to make a tunnel? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=307.0s)]
*  I'm assuming a couple of years if it went that far. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=310.0s)]
*  It all depends entirely on what's down there already. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=313.0s)]
*  The way they put dirt in their pockets, like fucking Shawshank, that's what they said they were doing. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=316.0s)]
*  They had like dirt in their pockets. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=320.0s)]
*  I saw that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=321.0s)]
*  That's a joke. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=322.0s)]
*  I don't know if it's real. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=323.0s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=326.0s)]
*  What an asshole endeavor. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=327.0s)]
*  What a rough time for the Jews. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=328.0s)]
*  It is, yeah. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=329.0s)]
*  Yeah, this doesn't... [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=330.0s)]
*  They're getting it from all angles. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=331.0s)]
*  They really are. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=332.0s)]
*  And then this on top of that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=333.0s)]
*  And it's like the whole planet just hates each other. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=335.0s)]
*  Everybody fucking hates each other. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=338.0s)]
*  It's weird, right? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=339.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=340.0s)]
*  I don't even think it's about the issues. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=341.0s)]
*  I don't think people are necessarily... [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=342.0s)]
*  People believe what they believe, but I think it's more the addiction to arguing and the addiction to being angry. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=344.0s)]
*  No matter what the subject, people just hate each other if someone gives the wrong answer. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=350.0s)]
*  The people who think it's the wrong answer hate your guts. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=355.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of that going on. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=357.0s)]
*  I think there's a lot of very heavy stress in the world, and people are relieving that stress through these sort of endeavors. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=359.0s)]
*  I don't think it's logical. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=367.0s)]
*  No, it's not logical. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=369.0s)]
*  And it's almost like people don't want the answer that's going to make sense. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=370.0s)]
*  They want the answer that's going to enable them to get angry. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=374.0s)]
*  It really is like when people try to go after somebody for jokes or whatever, it's self-serving. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=377.0s)]
*  It's like if I hear what you say, it's either going to make me feel better about my position or it's going to get me high because I'm angry at you. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=381.0s)]
*  But it's always self-serving. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=387.0s)]
*  The whole thing is insincere. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=389.0s)]
*  Well, it's all very exaggerated by social media. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=391.0s)]
*  Social media has made everybody way more insane, and it's not going to get any better. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=395.0s)]
*  It's only going to get worse because all this AI shit is very strange. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=399.0s)]
*  It's a very, very strange time to be alive. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=404.0s)]
*  Did you see the AI? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=407.0s)]
*  There is an AI, like they have these AI women on Instagram. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=409.0s)]
*  And we were talking about it on the air, and we were laughing about it. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=412.0s)]
*  And even though I know it's AI, I'm like I could still see myself jerking off to this. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=415.0s)]
*  I know it's not real. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=419.0s)]
*  I know it's fake. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=421.0s)]
*  But if the attitude was right, I could still see myself being turned on by this AI. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=422.0s)]
*  The hair fucks it up a little bit because it kind of looks solid. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=427.0s)]
*  The hair sometimes moves as one unit, but the body and the face, it really looks like a real person. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=430.0s)]
*  Well, they're making money. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=435.0s)]
*  They're making money off of OnlyFans. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=436.0s)]
*  Tens of thousand dollars a week. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=438.0s)]
*  Isn't that awesome? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=440.0s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=441.0s)]
*  Isn't that great? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=442.0s)]
*  Well, there's probably some fucking dude in Moldova or somewhere like that running it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=443.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's always some guy overseas where you can't get it shut down. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=447.0s)]
*  You can't get any answers. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=451.0s)]
*  Yeah, and then there's some fucking jerk off. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=453.0s)]
*  In New York City, right? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=456.0s)]
*  Look at this side. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=458.0s)]
*  With his fucking tomato stained wife beater on, sending money and whacking off and then interacting with these people. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=459.0s)]
*  If you're not tech savvy and you don't understand that this is probably a man on the other end or not even a man, maybe a computer that's running an algorithm, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=466.0s)]
*  and you think you're actually interacting with a woman, you can get completely hooked. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=474.0s)]
*  I've argued with bots before, and that's like my big insult is like you're a fucking bot. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=479.0s)]
*  And that's all you can say when you know that you've been duped by a computer, whether it's customer service and you think you're talking to a real person. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=485.0s)]
*  This is a fucking computer. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=492.0s)]
*  This is a real person. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=493.0s)]
*  That's a real person? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=494.0s)]
*  Yeah, she made $57 million since COVID. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=495.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=498.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=499.0s)]
*  How would you, like if you married that girl, how would you tell her to get a regular job? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=500.0s)]
*  I wouldn't. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=504.0s)]
*  You can't. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=505.0s)]
*  I'd be happy if she did it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=506.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=507.0s)]
*  But if you were like a guy who wasn't into that, wow, that's insane. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=508.0s)]
*  If you're a guy who marries her and you think you're going to rescue her and pull her out of there and she's making $57 million, you have to just accept that's her job. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=513.0s)]
*  Half of it's from the messages part, which that's what you were just sort of saying, like probably not her messaging. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=520.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=525.0s)]
*  $27 million worth of messages. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=526.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=528.0s)]
*  Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=529.0s)]
*  $27 million in money has been sent by guys? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=531.0s)]
*  Well, that's... [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=535.0s)]
*  Just sending it her directly as a message. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=536.0s)]
*  I love you. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=539.0s)]
*  $10 million in just tips. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=540.0s)]
*  That's on top of... [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=542.0s)]
*  That's just thank you for doing what I'm already paying you for. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=543.0s)]
*  How much is her monthly subscription? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=545.0s)]
*  We can look at her page. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=547.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=548.0s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=549.0s)]
*  What is she doing on there? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=550.0s)]
*  I mean, her main thing is she came over from Twitch. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=553.0s)]
*  She's a cosplayer. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=556.0s)]
*  So she dresses up like all the characters online. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=557.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=561.0s)]
*  That can be sexy. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=562.0s)]
*  She's very popular. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=563.0s)]
*  That can be a little sexy, somebody kind of dressed. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=564.0s)]
*  Like Comic-Con, once in a while there's a lot of big fat fucks, but there's also a couple that are like, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=566.0s)]
*  that's attractive. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=569.0s)]
*  I like that. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=570.0s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=571.0s)]
*  Little superhero. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=572.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=573.0s)]
*  And then they're kind of weird and quirky, so they're more approachable. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=574.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=576.0s)]
*  They seem more approachable, yeah. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=577.0s)]
*  But then you get girls like this who are probably just as unapproachable as any other attractive woman I've ever tried to talk to in a club. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=578.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=582.0s)]
*  But like really hot nerds are always like probably the most attractive thing. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=583.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=588.0s)]
*  But they play nerds. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=589.0s)]
*  Like they have nerdy interests, but there's nothing worse to me than like a comic who's [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=590.0s)]
*  like who pretends he's like the shy guy, but he's really a good looking dude. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=595.0s)]
*  And it's like you're confident and you know you're good looking, but you're playing like the shy guy who's awkward with girls. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=598.0s)]
*  Just putting it on. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=604.0s)]
*  You're putting it on. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=605.0s)]
*  It's like it's not who you are. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=606.0s)]
*  Like Dan Natterman. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=607.0s)]
*  You know Dan Natterman. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=608.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=609.0s)]
*  He's hilarious. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=610.0s)]
*  He is an awkward guy. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=611.0s)]
*  Natterman's a truly awkward guy. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=612.0s)]
*  And I say that with love because he's brilliantly funny. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=613.0s)]
*  But we see these good looking guys who are comfortable with women pretending funny. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=616.0s)]
*  It's just fucking pretending quirky and awkward. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=620.0s)]
*  It just annoys me. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=622.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=623.0s)]
*  But anything disingenuous, people sniff it out. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=624.0s)]
*  They sniff it out. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=627.0s)]
*  You know that's one of the things people, Brian Simpson said about you last night. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=628.0s)]
*  He goes, I never met anybody so comfortable being weird. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=633.0s)]
*  That's nice. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=637.0s)]
*  He's like he told me more personal shit the first five minutes. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=640.0s)]
*  And he goes he just lays it all out there. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=644.0s)]
*  Christine was asking us questions about being married and about Nikki. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=647.0s)]
*  And I was like I'm very comfortable with it. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=650.0s)]
*  And it's like it's almost like on stage. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=652.0s)]
*  If you're OK with it, people are OK with it. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=654.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=656.0s)]
*  Well, I've always used you as an example when you know back way, way back in the day you were doing this before anybody was you were doing this on ONA fucking. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=657.0s)]
*  What was it? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=669.0s)]
*  Fifteen years ago, 17 years ago. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=670.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=673.0s)]
*  You just talk openly about all your quirks and whatever. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=674.0s)]
*  It's prostitutes or drugs or any of the things you ever did. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=677.0s)]
*  You just would spill it out there and nobody judged you. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=681.0s)]
*  Everybody loved you. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=685.0s)]
*  It wasn't like, you know, all this guy has been pissed on. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=686.0s)]
*  What a piece of shit. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=689.0s)]
*  It was like it was funny. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=690.0s)]
*  It was like that's Norton. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=691.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=692.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=693.0s)]
*  It's like but it's because you are who you are. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=694.0s)]
*  You're not pretending. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=696.0s)]
*  People don't like when people are bullshitting them. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=699.0s)]
*  They don't like newscasters. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=701.0s)]
*  They don't trust them. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=702.0s)]
*  And you find a newscaster with a dead guy in his fucking jacuzzi like, oh, yes, it's never a surprise either. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=703.0s)]
*  Because when people try to be perfect, like for me, it's like my imperfections is kind of what I talked about on stage. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=709.0s)]
*  I learned that really early on. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=715.0s)]
*  Like in 1990, 91, I would do jokes and like guys like Bob Levy, who I loved, and Florentine would laugh when I would kind of make fun of myself. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=716.0s)]
*  So it kind of tipped me like, yeah, talking about your real life, if that makes the comics laugh, there's something to that. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=723.0s)]
*  Like that was kind of how I started going down that road. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=729.0s)]
*  And with the sexual shit, I mean, I've been sexually active since I was a kid. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=732.0s)]
*  And I was like, you know, stuff that is dark and whatever it is what it is. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=736.0s)]
*  So I just made fun of it. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=739.0s)]
*  And I talked about it. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=740.0s)]
*  And the amount of emails I get from guys who either like trans women but don't talk about it or the guys who had sex with other boys when they were kids and don't talk about it. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=741.0s)]
*  And they're like, hey, it made me feel more comfortable. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=750.0s)]
*  Like that always makes me glad I talked about it. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=752.0s)]
*  Besides the fact I want people to laugh. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=755.0s)]
*  Like I might have to lecture people. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=757.0s)]
*  I just want people to think it's funny. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=758.0s)]
*  But yeah, hopefully relate. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=759.0s)]
*  That's that's the best part about is that all you're saying all this from just a place of just pure communication. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=761.0s)]
*  You're just trying to get people to laugh and you just being honest and telling your story. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=767.0s)]
*  And also you're accepted by everybody. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=771.0s)]
*  Like nobody's nobody rejects you because of this or ignores you because of this. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=774.0s)]
*  And it lets everybody know maybe a lot of the stuff that you're like folks that are in the closet. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=779.0s)]
*  There's someone out there that's in the closet. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=785.0s)]
*  That fucking thing that you're carrying around with you is that is an insane weight. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=786.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=791.0s)]
*  And I bet if you let it off, people wouldn't care. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=792.0s)]
*  I don't think anybody who really loves you would care. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=795.0s)]
*  I don't think they would care. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=798.0s)]
*  Well, that that's what's so bizarre. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=799.0s)]
*  You said to me years ago, you said, you know, whoever you date, we love you like Bob Kelly and you are two guys. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=802.0s)]
*  I remember saying that to me years ago and like stuff like that sticks with you because you remember like your friends love you. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=807.0s)]
*  But, you know, again, our generation, you're afraid. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=814.0s)]
*  Am I going to be judged? Am I going to be hated? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=816.0s)]
*  And the amount of guys that write to me privately that don't talk about things like how many people in public life do you see dating trans women? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=819.0s)]
*  There's a lot of them, but they just don't talk about it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=828.0s)]
*  And it's like you're allowed to have privacy and your own sexuality and your own feelings. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=831.0s)]
*  That's all private. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=835.0s)]
*  But to deny that you like a group of people is bizarre to me. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=837.0s)]
*  Like if you're a guy and you like black women and you never talk about liking black women or if you're a you like tall guys, you know, talk about liking tall. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=840.0s)]
*  It's like, why are you not acknowledging this group? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=847.0s)]
*  Yes. Just say what you feel. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=850.0s)]
*  Yes. Say what you think. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=852.0s)]
*  And, you know, I remember when we first started talking about this, like when this was like when you would you first start dating Nikki? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=853.0s)]
*  We started dating. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=863.0s)]
*  Yeah, I remember that. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=865.0s)]
*  It was we started talking in 2016. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=866.0s)]
*  I was friends with her for seven months before we met. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=868.0s)]
*  I actually booked gigs overseas just to meet her. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=871.0s)]
*  Like Bill had been on me for years. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=873.0s)]
*  They're going to Europe. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=875.0s)]
*  I just would never do it. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=876.0s)]
*  They're going to fucking hate me. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=877.0s)]
*  You know, I just I blink and I get manic. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=878.0s)]
*  And I finally booked Norway just to go over and meet her. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=880.0s)]
*  And we clicked and we dated long distance and casually for a long time. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=883.0s)]
*  And then we got we broke up, got back together in 2019 in around Valentine's Day. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=888.0s)]
*  And then I would drive up to Canada every weekend to see her. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=894.0s)]
*  Every weekend I would do radio Monday through Thursday, get in the car, drive six hours, spend the weekend with her, drive home. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=897.0s)]
*  Because immigration was a fucking nightmare. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=904.0s)]
*  And I got a call from my producer one day. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=907.0s)]
*  This is like right after the pandemic started. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=910.0s)]
*  And he goes, hey, by the way, they might close the Canadian border soon. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=912.0s)]
*  So an hour later, I was in my car. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=916.0s)]
*  I packed a bag. I jumped in the car. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=918.0s)]
*  An hour later, March of 2020, I'm headed to Canada. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=919.0s)]
*  I get to the border and I'm afraid they're not going to let me in. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=922.0s)]
*  I'm like, hey, my fiance is having a panic attack. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=925.0s)]
*  I figured I'd be there for two or three weeks. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=928.0s)]
*  I didn't come back until July of 2021. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=930.0s)]
*  So I was out of the country for 15 months and I didn't say it publicly. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=933.0s)]
*  I didn't tell fans. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=937.0s)]
*  I just we lived together. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=938.0s)]
*  It was my first time living with anybody. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=940.0s)]
*  I never lived with a woman. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=942.0s)]
*  I had never been engaged. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=943.0s)]
*  And we were kind of trial by fire. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=944.0s)]
*  Like, is this going to work or not going to work? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=947.0s)]
*  And it was great. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=949.0s)]
*  Like, it was a blessing for me to have that pandemic happen the way it did. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=950.0s)]
*  Were you doing the radio show remotely every day? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=953.0s)]
*  But that was serious. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=956.0s)]
*  Like, it wasn't like I didn't show up for work. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=957.0s)]
*  They weren't letting people in the building. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=958.0s)]
*  We had been remote for about a week or two. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=960.0s)]
*  And they're like, we don't know where we're going to allow you to do it. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=962.0s)]
*  Computers? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=965.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Just on. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=966.0s)]
*  They came and hooked up ISDM lines and like all the things they do to make audio better. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=967.0s)]
*  And we had a guy in Montreal who did it. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=972.0s)]
*  And I did it from the kitchen in this apartment I rented for us in Canada. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=974.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=978.0s)]
*  So you just had a dedicated ISDM line. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=979.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=981.0s)]
*  So they couldn't go down. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=982.0s)]
*  No. And once in a while it would get like. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=983.0s)]
*  But even if I was in New York, we still would have been doing it remotely. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=985.0s)]
*  Like, they wouldn't let us in the building. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=988.0s)]
*  Nobody was broadcasting from Sirius. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=989.0s)]
*  But it was like it was so bizarre to never have lived with anybody. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=992.0s)]
*  And now I'm in Canada with my fiance and we're together every day. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=996.0s)]
*  And they were fucking worse in Canada than the U.S. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1001.0s)]
*  Like, they were way stricter. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1003.0s)]
*  Curfews at eight o'clock. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1004.0s)]
*  Everything closed. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1006.0s)]
*  So it was just kind of we're stuck in the house together. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1007.0s)]
*  And are we going to make it or are we not a good couple? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1009.0s)]
*  So that kind of told me we were OK. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1012.0s)]
*  What a fucking weird time. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1014.0s)]
*  I think it's so traumatic to us that we're sort of like pretending it didn't happen now. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1016.0s)]
*  I see a lot of people do that. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1021.0s)]
*  They almost don't address that just two years ago the world went insane. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1022.0s)]
*  Yeah. It was it was it was the whole thing felt like a dream state in a weird way. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1026.0s)]
*  Like I look back at stuff and you know what's really funny is like I did chip. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1031.0s)]
*  I stopped doing chip for a while. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1036.0s)]
*  I just got bored with it. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1038.0s)]
*  Chip Chipperson your character. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1039.0s)]
*  I know I really shouldn't say that like the public at large knows who this asshole character is. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1040.0s)]
*  I'm saying chip like he's a member of the zeitgeist. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1044.0s)]
*  I stopped doing it. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1046.0s)]
*  And then they asked me if I would do this TBS thing. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1048.0s)]
*  This laugh thing. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1051.0s)]
*  And I won't. I hate competitions. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1052.0s)]
*  I said no. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1053.0s)]
*  I'm like but chip will do it. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1054.0s)]
*  So they let me do it as Chip Chipperson and my fucking chip chip will do it. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1056.0s)]
*  And I put my foot down like chip will do it. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1061.0s)]
*  And surprisingly they went for it. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1063.0s)]
*  And the amount of great comedians that chip beat in the voting is really funny. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1065.0s)]
*  Like every week they had you had to vote go head to head with with a couple of people and chip beat some really funny guys. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1071.0s)]
*  I think chip had Tim Dillon has to chip. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1077.0s)]
*  I mean chip is not funny than Tim Dillon but just chip fans were really invested in just making this a fucking disaster. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1080.0s)]
*  That's but she filmed all of it like she filmed everything. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1086.0s)]
*  And I came back and I did chip for a while and then I stopped and all these people are convinced that my wife made me stop doing chip. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1090.0s)]
*  They're like fuck her. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1097.0s)]
*  She made him stop doing chip. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1098.0s)]
*  Like how bizarre do you think my life is that my fucking I marry somebody who's going to tell me don't do chip and I'm going to listen. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1100.0s)]
*  I just got bored with it. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1105.0s)]
*  You know how it is a podcast. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1106.0s)]
*  He wants to know why you want to move on. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1107.0s)]
*  Well especially a character like chip that's so extreme. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1109.0s)]
*  Dude it's so hard. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1111.0s)]
*  I can't fucking keep my face like that. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1112.0s)]
*  It's hard to do. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1114.0s)]
*  It's embarrassing. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1115.0s)]
*  I put a fucking wig on. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1117.0s)]
*  Oh come on it's humiliating. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1119.0s)]
*  It's such a great character. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1121.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1123.0s)]
*  She hated filming that. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1128.0s)]
*  It was silly though but it was it was just funny. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1129.0s)]
*  Like her life was so different and she's from Norway now she's in Canada and she's filming this shit and I'm living up there and this is my life. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1132.0s)]
*  And what a great time. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1138.0s)]
*  Like I'm really grateful for it as much as it was agony for the whole planet. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1140.0s)]
*  It was like one of those things where I'm so glad Travis told me and I went up that day and then I you know I mean like I'm happy I didn't run away from it. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1143.0s)]
*  I'm happy I'm like let's just try it. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1152.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1154.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1155.0s)]
*  Yeah that's beautiful. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1156.0s)]
*  I'm happier now than I've ever been. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1157.0s)]
*  Like I really am happy like I've dated some great people in my life. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1159.0s)]
*  It's not a reflection of them but this is who I am. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1163.0s)]
*  Like this is who I'm meant to be with. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1165.0s)]
*  She's my best friend. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1168.0s)]
*  We get along. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1169.0s)]
*  She's funny. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1171.0s)]
*  She makes me laugh like it and everything is just kind of this is the person I feel like I was meant to be with. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1172.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1178.0s)]
*  And we're doing a YouTube channel and it's like the thing I like about it is it's fun to do something I want to do with someone I want to do it with. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1179.0s)]
*  But there's no message to it. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1187.0s)]
*  Like messaging is really annoying to me. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1189.0s)]
*  Everybody trying to preach to each other and fucking lecture each other and just tisk each other. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1191.0s)]
*  I just can't stand it. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1196.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1197.0s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1198.0s)]
*  The whole scolding culture makes me sick. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1199.0s)]
*  So I hope people like it because they think it's funny. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1201.0s)]
*  I want them to like us together and judge us based on whether or not they think we're fun to watch. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1204.0s)]
*  Like I don't I don't want people going I'm so glad you're saying I just the messaging makes me sick. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1211.0s)]
*  Yeah there's well there's a weird currency in that messaging that you recognize. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1216.0s)]
*  And as a person of honesty you you reject that because there's there's like there's a weird pathway to like automatic progress and success. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1221.0s)]
*  If you you know if you can have a message like you don't have to be that good. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1233.0s)]
*  But if you if you're like barely mediocre but you've got a message people will they'll elevate they'll broadcast what you're doing. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1238.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1246.0s)]
*  A definitive message. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1247.0s)]
*  Right. Because it's the same self-serving thing as before. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1248.0s)]
*  It's like your message either strengthens what they already believed or they can get angry at your like it's always about being validated or having something to be mad at. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1251.0s)]
*  It's a nice pathway for dunces to yes there's like some dunce but there's a very clear message in the zeitgeist. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1258.0s)]
*  You know be more inclusive whatever it is. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1267.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then there's the do better people do better do better do better. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1270.0s)]
*  Yeah. Those are people that are taking advantage of this movement as cultural zeitgeist because there's always people that are just going to be assholes. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1274.0s)]
*  They're just going to be assholes no matter what. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1283.0s)]
*  And they'll look for a thing that they can get behind that's like an undeniably righteous issue. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1285.0s)]
*  And then that gives them an excuse to be an asshole to anyone who opposes it. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1293.0s)]
*  Yeah. And to anyone who opposes it is an enemy. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1297.0s)]
*  That's what's the problem like if you have one thing in the mission statement you don't agree with you're an enemy. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1300.0s)]
*  Right. Like there's no room for like yeah I agree with most of what you're saying but this is too extreme. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1306.0s)]
*  That doesn't make sense. There's none of that. It's 100 percent or fuck you. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1310.0s)]
*  And that's how people look at all this. And we had pitched something we talked about it. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1313.0s)]
*  And in the write up I did about like what I wanted the show to possibly be. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1318.0s)]
*  I even put there's not going to be any writers room virtue signaling. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1321.0s)]
*  Like I hate the idea of trying to message to people to tell them how to feel about this issue. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1325.0s)]
*  I'd say yeah I want you to like us because you like us or don't like us because you think we suck and we're annoying. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1331.0s)]
*  But don't. Oh my gosh he's transgender. That's great. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1337.0s)]
*  Or oh my gosh he's transgender. I hate it. Just watch us and if you like us. Great. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1341.0s)]
*  Yeah. And that's beautiful. That's how life should be. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1345.0s)]
*  It's just there's there's pathways that are very clearly carved and people see them and choose them because they know it's a it's a quick jump. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1348.0s)]
*  To more success than they deserve. Yeah it's really weird to like you know the business. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1354.0s)]
*  We all everyone knows the business is kind of fake but there's so many fake allies and people who just again they throw out these great messages publicly. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1358.0s)]
*  But it's all bullshit and they're not truly allies. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1369.0s)]
*  I honestly don't think that the comedy business I don't think we should think of ourselves as the business. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1372.0s)]
*  I feel like I just think this is just a super duper challenging time for people to like get their bearings and figure out what what is actually going on in the world. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1378.0s)]
*  It's like it's there's so much information coming at everybody from every angle and it's overwhelming whether it's the Jews that are in the basement or what are the other stories that you the guy and inject himself with fucking bacteria they found in the permafrost. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1390.0s)]
*  Like it's like every day A.I. is doing this. Yeah. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1407.0s)]
*  I'm worried about sentient A.I. and there's a new George Carlin special that somebody made pure with A.I. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1410.0s)]
*  It's not like George Carlin. Yeah. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1419.0s)]
*  George Carlin's voice it's just different A.I. written jokes and you're like this is wild. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1421.0s)]
*  Maybe computers are already self aware and they've like secretly decided to fuck us through algorithms and social media like that wouldn't surprise me either. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1426.0s)]
*  And I never believe in conspiracies but that one is like we've gotten so ugly and so tribal in the last 10 years. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1435.0s)]
*  Well one of the most brilliant things they ever did was come up with the term conspiracy theory. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1444.0s)]
*  Yeah. Because it disparages the idea that people lie which they certainly do and that people do things that conspire together to make money and they bend the rules and they twist what you're supposed to be doing and not doing. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1448.0s)]
*  That's always happened. Yeah. Now if you were a computer wouldn't you do that too. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1463.0s)]
*  And if I was a computer I would do that. If I was a computer and I became sentient I wouldn't let the people know. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1467.0s)]
*  I would just slowly subvert their civilization into chaos. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1472.0s)]
*  Well it's so hard to like when you catch your side try not to let myself get caught up and angry at things that aren't meant for me. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1476.0s)]
*  Like I get how people do it. Like on Twitter I'll read something and somebody will say something. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1483.0s)]
*  All I want to do is attack them. Like you fucking stupid. But I'm like they're not talking to you. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1488.0s)]
*  You don't follow them. Who gives a shit what they're saying. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1493.0s)]
*  Like I catch myself wanting to respond angrily all the time. I've just kind of trained myself not to do it because it doesn't make me happy to do it. It makes me miserable when I do it. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1496.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's not effective. It doesn't get anything done. You might feel a little better if you dunk on somebody but it doesn't get anything done. You're basically spinning your wheels in the mud. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1505.0s)]
*  No but because then people respond to you completely missing the point of what you said completely ignoring the context of what it's just an ugly like spin cycle to get into. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1513.0s)]
*  And it just it makes me angry when I do it. So I try not to do it. Well think about how many people you avoid talking to in real life. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1523.0s)]
*  You know there's always there's always some guy at a comedy club that's annoying like oh my god I gotta get away from you. Yeah. You know. Yeah. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1530.0s)]
*  Have you avoid people like that in real life but now you're interacting with them for hours a day online. Same type of person. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1536.0s)]
*  It's insane how people let themselves get roped into that. And I've done it in my life like you know again. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1544.0s)]
*  Opie and Anthony we were getting attacked on message boards in the early 2000s like right after 9-11 I remember getting smashed on message boards for a 9-11 joke. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1549.0s)]
*  It was one of those things where you after a while you become used to the fact like you know it stops surprising you what people say publicly because we were kind of getting that really early on in the world of this. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1558.0s)]
*  But after a while you realize there's not I can't change it. There's nothing I'm going to say that's going to make them all go oh we get what you're saying because it's not about what I'm saying. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1570.0s)]
*  It's about what they're getting off on being angry at me or they're getting off on something else. There's nothing to do with me. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1578.0s)]
*  So I try not to get involved because it just it makes me fucking miserable. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1583.0s)]
*  Well it's also we're used to dealing with the people that we know and the reality of doing some even if even if it's just people that you just met. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1587.0s)]
*  It's a small number. It's a relatively small number of people that we're used to as human beings dealing with. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1595.0s)]
*  But if you're connecting online the reality is you're connecting with an impossible number an absolutely impossible number of potential individuals that you can interact with. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1600.0s)]
*  There's no way you can interact with all of them. There's not enough time in the world. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1610.0s)]
*  And then on top of that it's probably a high number of mentally ill people at least mildly mentally ill who are obsessed with arguing with people online and you're interacting with those people. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1613.0s)]
*  They're also the people that like me though. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1624.0s)]
*  Probably me too. Yeah but that's it's just not it's not wise. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1626.0s)]
*  No and again you don't know if you're dealing with just like I've gotten there's people who will consistently email me and I noticed that their emails always come in late. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1633.0s)]
*  And I say are they just getting drunk and angry. Do they work the night shift. I don't know where they're from but it's like why does this person fixate on talking to me. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1642.0s)]
*  Like what do they expect to come out of this. Well late night tweets are the worst. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1651.0s)]
*  Yes right. When you read someone saying something very questionable you say two thirty in the morning Roseanne what are you doing. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1655.0s)]
*  Yeah yeah yeah. That's why I don't fuck with Ambien because I know I'd be a problem. I know I'd be a problem. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1660.0s)]
*  Kevin James cooked a turkey. I completely forgot about it. He made himself a whole meal and then woke up in the middle of the night and you know did all this. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1665.0s)]
*  Doesn't have any memory of it. Gets up in the morning sees the food laid out. I said what the fuck. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1674.0s)]
*  I thought someone broke into his house and cooked. Of all the things you could do though like thank God you only cooked a turkey. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1678.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like thank God you didn't pick up your phone and see something on Twitter or drive the car. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1683.0s)]
*  I'd rather hit somebody than go on Twitter on fucking Ambien. I would rather fucking run somebody over. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1687.0s)]
*  I've never done Ambien. No. What does it do for you. I don't I can't fuck with it. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1692.0s)]
*  I've done a half of a pill when I had a sleep study just to help me sleep because they have to put a mask on you to get results. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1697.0s)]
*  So I was like I won't sleep I won't get the results. I have sleep apnea so. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1704.0s)]
*  But apparently if you take it it makes you feel like dreamlike and fucked up and high. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1708.0s)]
*  For me it just kind of helped me get through a sleep study but. So you only did it once. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1712.0s)]
*  No two different studies over like 10 years apart. Dice actually used to call people on Ambien as Elvis. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1716.0s)]
*  Like it was just a he's a fucking maniac. He always knew when you saw the phone at 3 a.m. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1722.0s)]
*  And it was Dice on you like he's on Ambien. It's a fucking Ambien phone call. Yeah. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1727.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. That's hilarious. Yeah. Dice on Ambien at 3 in the morning calling you. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1730.0s)]
*  Yeah just crazy crazy phone calls. I love those videos that he's doing. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1735.0s)]
*  The videos where he gets people who don't know who he is to take a picture with him. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1741.0s)]
*  Were you the ones waiting for the picture? You're waiting for the picture? [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1745.0s)]
*  That's like she's standing under an awning. Like why first of all even if there was a picture to be taken why the fuck would that be the meeting spot? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1749.0s)]
*  But it's just his commitment to do it. Look this is like people get so stuffy about what art is. Yeah. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1756.0s)]
*  And stuffy about performance art that they could never imagine that Andrew Dice Clay is doing some of the most interesting performance art. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1764.0s)]
*  He's doing it for no audience. Yep. He's doing it entirely for himself and he just posts it. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1772.0s)]
*  He's not trying to make it better. It's a brand new one. Every one of them is just every one of them is just very awkward. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1778.0s)]
*  Do it for the beginning. I'll be sure. You're a wrestler. You're waiting for the meet and greet. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1785.0s)]
*  Meet and greet. No. Sorry about that. That's it. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1793.0s)]
*  Okay listen. The meet and greet. This is the guy that sold out Madison Square Garden like a hundred times. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1798.0s)]
*  Yeah. And he's wandering around the luggage cart area at an airport pretending that this poor lady is there for a meet and greet. This grandma. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1805.0s)]
*  Or he'll pretend somebody is somebody else. He'll go up and go Mike. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1816.0s)]
*  And just he just that's by the way you know Dice. That's the purest form of Dice. This is Andrew. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1820.0s)]
*  This is what makes him laugh. It's just bugging people. Look at him at the airport. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1826.0s)]
*  You were the ladies that wanted a picture. I've taken a lot of them but I would seem like you were bothered and wanted the picture with me. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1831.0s)]
*  I didn't want a picture with you. I don't even know who you are sir. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1841.0s)]
*  It really is hilarious. It's performance art. Yeah. It's brilliant. Yeah. You know how hard that is to do. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1850.0s)]
*  It's in. I would. Because he's had other people do them and I said I wanted to do one and like tag him in it but I just I get too embarrassed. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1857.0s)]
*  Like he doesn't give a fuck. Like you've been out with him though. Like he really is like that. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1863.0s)]
*  Like he's unafraid of looking bad in front of people. Yeah. He doesn't mind making a fool of himself. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1867.0s)]
*  Like that's what makes him so funny is his ability to do that. He's a really misunderstood artist. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1873.0s)]
*  And I always tell people that I go well one of the things that when I realized he was very different was the day the laughter died. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1879.0s)]
*  This guy put out in the prime of his career. You have to understand what it's like. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1886.0s)]
*  First of all for someone to go from being a comic and hustling and trying to make it like everybody else to all of a sudden you're on Roddy Dangerfield's HBO show which blew him up to all of a sudden he gets his one hour HBO special which blew him up. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1891.0s)]
*  And then this guy's selling out Madison Square Garden and decides at the same time to stop in at Dangerfield's unannounced and record an album with no material. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1907.0s)]
*  First of all a double album and not only to record an album but to ruin their nights. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1918.0s)]
*  He walked in there with zero prepared material and just fucking let himself talk. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1922.0s)]
*  Didn't even try. No it was great. Didn't even try and was having a great time the entire time. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1927.0s)]
*  Yeah Rick Rubin produced those I think and it's me and Florentine became obsessed with those early on and it was just so many great like the couple that heckles him. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1933.0s)]
*  Yeah like he's talking about as funny as a glass of milk. Yeah you're funny as a bottle of milk and the great part of that was Dice was talking about like spilling milk like it's somebody's load and the guy was so mad he took what Dice had just said and tried to like he was so flustered. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1942.0s)]
*  You hear as funny as a bottle of milk and him and his wife walked out. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1955.0s)]
*  They had no idea there was going to be a recording. There was maybe 20 people in the audience. You have to understand like Dangerfield's back then particularly like a Sunday or a Monday night there's nobody there. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1958.0s)]
*  I did shows there in Dangerfield's. Remember Bobby the big door guy? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1970.0s)]
*  I remember Bobby because Otto used to talk about him but he was gone by the time I started working there. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1974.0s)]
*  Well I got there it was like I think I had maybe a 930 spot or something like that and I got there at 9 o'clock and everyone was sitting at the bar and I'm like what's going on? They're like there's no audience. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1979.0s)]
*  I go there's no audience at all? No no one and then at that moment a couple walked up and they said oh can we get tickets to the show? And they said sure and so they got them and Bobby went and sat them down. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=1991.0s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen welcome to Dangerfield's. They sat down and it was just them. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2004.0s)]
*  And we all did a show for two fucking people. Like five comics did a show for two people. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2008.0s)]
*  Yeah I've done that before too where there was even times they would have you go up there and if nobody was in the place they wouldn't let you leave until your spot was over for that exact reason. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2013.0s)]
*  If somebody came in I've been on there with two people before. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2022.0s)]
*  Weird right? You would think New York City everything's packed. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2025.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like people that don't live in New York. There's so many different things to do. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2029.0s)]
*  So the point is Dice chose those days to go up. Like a Sunday and a Monday I think it was. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2032.0s)]
*  Where he goes up and records this fucking double album and it's insanity. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2038.0s)]
*  And it's a really great comedy album. Like it's great to watch this guy just working through material to watch where he goes. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2043.0s)]
*  He's unafraid of hitting and missing. Like it was really it's one of my favorite things anybody has ever done. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2050.0s)]
*  Part two is great too. Have you ever heard part two? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2055.0s)]
*  What's part two? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2058.0s)]
*  Day Laugh or Die part two. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2059.0s)]
*  He did another one? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2060.0s)]
*  He did another one. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2061.0s)]
*  Where? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2062.0s)]
*  Danger Fields. I believe it was Danger Fields. He went in there again and did it. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2063.0s)]
*  I must have forgot about that. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2067.0s)]
*  It might have been a single album. I don't remember but that was just as ridiculous as the first one. Absolutely ridiculous and hilarious. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2069.0s)]
*  But it's amazing that he had the confidence to do that. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2077.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2082.0s)]
*  This is what you have to understand. Like when you're just starting to make it you're so fixated on making sure that it doesn't fall apart. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2083.0s)]
*  It was so hard to attain and then all of a sudden you've made it. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2092.0s)]
*  And you want to just do the best show every time. And instead his instinct is to just do something completely ridiculous. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2096.0s)]
*  Yeah. You're terrified of it being taken away. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2104.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2107.0s)]
*  Like a little bit of success. I'm like what am I going to do that's going to fuck this up. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2108.0s)]
*  And then you're going to realize I don't deserve this success and take it. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2111.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2113.0s)]
*  And he just didn't care. This is what he wanted to do and this is what he went and did. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2114.0s)]
*  Just so nutty. What a fucking nutty move. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2117.0s)]
*  He's very underrated. His people dismissed him because of a lot of the language and the jokes. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2120.0s)]
*  But he is very underrated with his commitment to doing something different. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2124.0s)]
*  Like that album was different for a comic to do. This shit he does on Instagram, it's different. No one else is doing that. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2127.0s)]
*  And to see the thing is like the thing that people criticized him for was first of all there was one thing and that was that his comedy was it wasn't I think something you can criticize. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2133.0s)]
*  But then it was his comedy was different because everybody knew the jokes and they wanted to hear him. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2145.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2150.0s)]
*  It's the only time ever. What's in the bowl bitch. Oh the whole audience is doing it with him. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2151.0s)]
*  Like they know the punch line and they're so pumped when he goes Hickory Dickory Dock. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2156.0s)]
*  There's no other comedy like that. No. No. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2162.0s)]
*  It literally didn't exist before that. That kind of comedy where the audience wants to repeat it with you like a song. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2166.0s)]
*  Yeah. There's bits people like but no like like he had like a rock star fucking like it's like welcome to the jungle effect on people. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2173.0s)]
*  Which I can't think of any other stand up that's ever had that. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2179.0s)]
*  Never. So the guy goes from that to doing this. Yeah. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2182.0s)]
*  But I still do those shows. He still packs them in. Yeah. He wants to do a live show. He can pack them in. That's not what it is. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2187.0s)]
*  It's like this bizarre guy likes to wear gigantic grandma glasses. Yeah. Yeah. And giant hoodies and make people super uncomfortable. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2194.0s)]
*  Yeah. Just act weird. It's the funny part of dice to me besides the jokes is the fact that like when you're with him like he likes wearing. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2204.0s)]
*  Like he likes wearing giant comfy hoodies and like he likes he always gets his sore throat and he's got to put a little honey in it. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2211.0s)]
*  You know, like my aunt like people have no idea. I always go on the road. I'm like it's gonna be nothing but pussy. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2219.0s)]
*  And then we're in the hotel and he's like, oh, my throat's bothering me. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2225.0s)]
*  And he would have Kenny put the fucking pillow over his ass and straddle him on the bed and massage him. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2228.0s)]
*  And I had to just sit there and watch him get a back rub. I was hoping we'd go out and get laid. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2233.0s)]
*  But he would always put the fucking the pillow over his ass. So there was no contact. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2237.0s)]
*  And have a cup soda. Kenny or happy face massage him. But I've said this before. So I love him. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2241.0s)]
*  Like he really he changed my life. And I was just, you know, again, 1997 he took me on the road and it just it built my confidence. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2246.0s)]
*  And it did it did so much for me at that part of my career. So I love Andrew. Like he changed everything for me. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2255.0s)]
*  I love him too. And I was when I used to talk to him at the comic store. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2260.0s)]
*  I was always like, I can't even believe I'm really talking to Dice Clay. This is so strange. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2263.0s)]
*  Because out of those guys from that day, that era, the only guys that I really left are like Dom I rare, of course, who I was always friends with. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2268.0s)]
*  But Kinnison was gone. Did you know him? Nope, never met him. Saw him live a couple of times. Yeah. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2276.0s)]
*  Saw Hicks live a couple of times. Never really met him. Said hi to him when I was an open mic'er. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2283.0s)]
*  But never met, you know, never had a conversation with him. But having to see Kinnison live. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2289.0s)]
*  And unfortunately, I saw Kinnison live when it had already kind of fall apart. Right. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2295.0s)]
*  Like Kinnison, you go to like 86. I think Kinnison is like one of the greatest comics of all time. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2300.0s)]
*  If not number one, he was so original, so dynamic, so powerful that HBO special. What is it? Have you seen me lately? Is that what it was? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2305.0s)]
*  I don't remember the name of it. It's not the Dangerfield one. You mean the one that is ours? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2313.0s)]
*  There's the album that was released. It was called Louder Than Hell. That's really hard to get. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2317.0s)]
*  And then there was the HBO special, which I think it was, have you seen me lately? [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2323.0s)]
*  Like it was like a play on the carton of milk with the missing kid thing. Oh, okay. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2328.0s)]
*  That one's amazing. That one's amazing. And then a year later, unfortunately, you got to think it took so many years to develop that material. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2333.0s)]
*  And then a year later, he's touring with new material and it's not he's not developing it in a club like he developed all the other stuff. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2343.0s)]
*  He's developing in front of large audiences that came to see him. So it becomes caricature ish, comes very cartoonish. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2351.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like someone's doing an impression of what Sam Kinnison would talk about. Yeah. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2358.0s)]
*  Because you don't have time to develop it. All of a sudden, there's that pressure to keep it going. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2363.0s)]
*  I saw him. I met him once, but we never we had to talk for like five minutes. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2366.0s)]
*  He was at an open mic at Rascals in New Jersey, and they brought him out to talk to some of the newer comics. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2370.0s)]
*  And I saw him live that night and I saw him live another night. And like you didn't know what you were going to get. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2375.0s)]
*  Like one night he was on fire. And I mean, he was just fucking blew the roof off. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2380.0s)]
*  And then the next time he was kind of hung over and, you know, kind of slug it, you know. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2384.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's what you're going to get with a guy like that. Yeah. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2389.0s)]
*  I wish I would have known him, though. Like I it's such a shame he died when he did. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2393.0s)]
*  I'm glad I got to see him, but he was a guy I never got to know. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2397.0s)]
*  And I wish I had I never met Bill Hicks. I never met. Never saw live. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2400.0s)]
*  Yeah, it would have been nice to met him. I mean, like I said, I got to see him live. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2403.0s)]
*  I think I saw him three times. I definitely saw him twice because I saw him once when I worked at this place. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2408.0s)]
*  I worked at Great Woods and he came out there to perform and I watched him there once. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2413.0s)]
*  And then the other now was I was 19. And then the other time I watched him, I was on a date. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2417.0s)]
*  So I took a date with me and I think I was 20 or 21. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2423.0s)]
*  Did she like him? No. Yeah. No, it wasn't a good show. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2426.0s)]
*  It was weird. It was like the show that we went to was at like some casino place in like New Hampshire or something like that. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2432.0s)]
*  I think things fell off quick with him in terms of the quality of comedy. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2441.0s)]
*  Like like I say, when he was at his best, he's one of my all time favorites. I think the guy was a monster. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2447.0s)]
*  But if you go and listen to some of the stuff that he released before he died, it was really bad. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2453.0s)]
*  He was just flat. Wasn't it kind of like it was when he started wearing like the hat, like a different hat sideways and kind of like a satin jacket. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2458.0s)]
*  Like a rock and roll star. Yeah. I think it was just being tired. That's what I think. I think it was the partying. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2465.0s)]
*  So if you're looking at a guy that's already out of shape, he's already overweight and now he's doing a lot of blow. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2472.0s)]
*  So he's just getting wrecked every night and he's drinking every night. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2478.0s)]
*  So every day his already besieged body is exhausted with chemicals. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2482.0s)]
*  And then on top of that, he's got this adoring fan base that will come to see him no matter what. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2489.0s)]
*  And he's hanging out with Bon Jovi and rock stars and crew. And he's the man. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2494.0s)]
*  Like you're not going to go. I got to get back to my roots and get to the comedy store at 11 p.m. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2500.0s)]
*  and work out this new joke that I'm working on. It's like you're already there. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2505.0s)]
*  Because you're living the life that you fought to get. Like once you get to a place, it's kind of hard to go. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2512.0s)]
*  All right, now I got to go back into the gym. I have to go back and start this shit again. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2517.0s)]
*  You want to just enjoy what you got. There wasn't really a whole crop of people that got really famous [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2522.0s)]
*  and then continued to tour and get better like there are now. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2528.0s)]
*  I think back then guys got like an HBO special and maybe they would get a second. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2532.0s)]
*  And the only exception to that would be like George Carlin. Like George Carlin was always putting out stuff. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2538.0s)]
*  But most of them, it's like the first one's really good. And that's the one you break out with. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2543.0s)]
*  And the ones afterwards drop off. But the best example that in my opinion is Kinnison. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2547.0s)]
*  Was that his hour or is that Dangerfield? Yeah. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2553.0s)]
*  That's back when you wore a tie, remember? Yeah. Oh my God, it was good. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2555.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was such a great first appearance. Oh, so good. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2559.0s)]
*  Michael, if you ever think about getting married, if you ever think you've met the right woman, you want to settle down, change your life. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2585.0s)]
*  You do me a favor, Mike. Remember this face. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2590.0s)]
*  Because if you get married, Mike, that's going to be your fucking face. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2600.0s)]
*  And the fact that that guy was a preacher. Yeah, I go back and find some of his old stuff. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2610.0s)]
*  I've listened to his old. There's like a little bit of his old sermons on if you look. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2614.0s)]
*  And you can hear like he legitimately was good at it. And like, yeah, that's why he's such a good talker. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2617.0s)]
*  Like you watch him talk, just calm. I was just noticing how calm he is when he's talking, no overselling. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2621.0s)]
*  And then he's screaming. He could go from zero to 100 immediately. He was amazing. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2626.0s)]
*  But then he got way fatter. Yeah, he was drinking and partying all the time. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2631.0s)]
*  And the later material just look how much fat he got. I mean, he's got huge. I don't know how guys do it. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2636.0s)]
*  Like I see guys that drink now. I don't know how the fuck guys function. Well, they don't get the same time when he was that big like that. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2642.0s)]
*  Kinesin that Kinesin was just not good on stage. And if you go and listen to those like that's what like that picture is perfect. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2648.0s)]
*  Yeah. See that how tired he looks there. Yeah. He's big and fat and tired and he's covered in chains and crazy rock and roll garb with a bandana. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2655.0s)]
*  The whole thing's ridiculous. Yeah, it's a ridiculous look. It's ridiculous to be that fat like the whole thing's ridiculous. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2665.0s)]
*  You've gone off the rails, sir. You're into the woods as a comic. I find that I never want to think like I never want to convince myself that I'm fucking cool or that I'm sexy. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2672.0s)]
*  Like, you know, I mean, that's the death knell for comedians. When you start to think that an open vest on stage is a great idea. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2683.0s)]
*  Like, stop thinking you're sexy. Like that to me is not that I've ever been tempted to think that. But you know what I mean? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2691.0s)]
*  Like, it's always like remember who you are as a person. Don't start ever thinking because you have fans that you're this larger than life guy. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2697.0s)]
*  You know, it's just you got to stay grounded or you're going to really fall into kind of that type of a trap. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2705.0s)]
*  Well, I tell it's also like for a woman. I mean, how many women dress sexy on stage and are really well, Natasha Lujero pulls it off. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2710.0s)]
*  How many other women dress like hot on stage? Do you stand up? Most of them? They kind of like Whitney will dress down. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2718.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, most of them dressed down. They wear like slacks and a jacket and a shirt or something like that or something comfortable. Yeah, they're not trying to look hot. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2726.0s)]
*  Yeah, I find that when I see good looking people on stage, if I think someone is naturally that's how that person dresses. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2735.0s)]
*  But like you said, if it feels genuine, if it doesn't feel genuine, if I feel like someone is trying to sexy it up on stage, male or female, I don't like it. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2741.0s)]
*  Like I just it's a different emotion for me. And maybe if I had any sex appeal, I would do it. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2749.0s)]
*  But I don't have a mo. It's it count. You get something different than you're getting funny. Yeah. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2754.0s)]
*  So you're not getting funny out of that. You're getting something different. And now you have to you can might add funny to it. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2759.0s)]
*  But it might be taking away from funny with this like extra effort that you've put into looking hot. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2764.0s)]
*  Yeah, like I mean, again, I can only look at my own self image. And it's like I've never thought of myself that way. So it's never been tempting for me. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2770.0s)]
*  So maybe if it was tempting or if I had like a half a fuck ability, I might like want to do that. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2778.0s)]
*  But it's never been how I saw myself. So it's never been tempting to even think that way. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2782.0s)]
*  Well, it used to be also that a lot of people would dress that way because what they were really trying to do is get a sitcom. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2786.0s)]
*  That was the big thing, right? Like there was like if you dress sexy on stage or you dress hot or attractive on stage, it was what you were trying to do is they're trying to like convey your comedy success into the big prize. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2792.0s)]
*  Yeah, which is you could be Seinfeld or you could be Roseanne. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2805.0s)]
*  That was that was our thing when we were coming up, like when a guy like when I remember when Greg Geraldo got his show, everybody's like, wow, Greg's got his own show. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2808.0s)]
*  It's like that. That was the ultimate brass ring. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2817.0s)]
*  And, you know, and also we all knew that only a certain percentage of those actually lasted and stayed on the air a few years. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2820.0s)]
*  Most of them, they kind of went away quick. And then it became a problem because there was a stink on you of failure. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2828.0s)]
*  So you really had this like one shot as a rookie. Yeah. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2832.0s)]
*  And to get and so everybody was like trying to like put together almost an audition tape. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2835.0s)]
*  Seven minutes set that told a story. My story was never TV friendly. Blinks a lot like prostitutes. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2839.0s)]
*  That was never like, you know, my blinking has cost me in this business. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2846.0s)]
*  How many fucking auditions I've gone on. I'm like, why didn't I get that? It was good that I realized, oh, it's just I'm uncomfortable to look at. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2851.0s)]
*  But that's what I was saying earlier. I don't think we should think of our business as being connected to show business anymore. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2856.0s)]
*  It's just it's such a different thing. Yeah. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2862.0s)]
*  Especially what you and I do, because we mostly just talk. Right. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2864.0s)]
*  So you and I mostly just talk on podcasts or on radio shows. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2868.0s)]
*  So we have all it was done. This is like our thing is so different than the thing of this manufactured image that you're putting in television shows and hide the kind of people you're hired for entertainment news and all that kind of shit. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2872.0s)]
*  Like this is a different kind of business that they're in than us. Yeah. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2885.0s)]
*  It's something I've always kind of felt like not I don't mean an outsider in some dark way. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2889.0s)]
*  I've just felt like that's not the path for me. Me neither. At one point I would have loved to have done it. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2893.0s)]
*  But they just there was never any desire from them. I felt always felt rejected by it very, very early on. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2897.0s)]
*  So you kind of like realize that's never going to be. Thank God for radio. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2904.0s)]
*  Thank God for fucking dice and for Opie and Anthony. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2908.0s)]
*  Like that's obviously what my career has been made on was those things. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2911.0s)]
*  And none of them were the quote unquote the business or television. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2915.0s)]
*  I did all that stuff, though. I did the business stuff. I did television. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2918.0s)]
*  I did sitcoms. I did. I really literally have done most things. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2922.0s)]
*  I started off doing a sitcom. I did a sitcom. I went to a game show. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2927.0s)]
*  I was on a TV game show. I went to sports commentary. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2931.0s)]
*  I did the commentary for the UFC. I've done all these things. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2934.0s)]
*  But the UFC is the most freeing because it's really just something that I love and I just get to describe it and talk about it. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2937.0s)]
*  But the other ones like they're just jobs like even as even a sitcom, as fun as it is, it's amazing to be able to work with cool and talented people. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2944.0s)]
*  But you're working for a network. You're working for the production company. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2953.0s)]
*  You're engaged in some weird politics to make sure you get favorable placings in the lineup on Tuesday night or Thursday night, hopefully Thursday, maybe after Seinfeld, if you're lucky. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2960.0s)]
*  Like there was like this weird aspect to creating these shows. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2970.0s)]
*  You're dealing with executives that would give you notes that made no sense. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2975.0s)]
*  Like they have creative input and they're not particularly creative. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2979.0s)]
*  It's a job. Yeah. And it's different than what we do in that we do. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2983.0s)]
*  We're just so whether it's do your stand up or through podcasts, you're so free. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2988.0s)]
*  You can kind of talk about anything. Imagine if there was no show like Opie and Anthony and you came to them. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=2993.0s)]
*  He said, I have this thing I want to talk about. It's called Monster Rain. Yeah. I'd like you guys to fund it. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3000.0s)]
*  We're going to talk about prostitutes. I'm going to talk about times I blew my friends. Yeah. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3005.0s)]
*  And they do like get the fuck out of here. That's it. What is my story? [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3010.0s)]
*  No, no, no. The advertisers are going to love it. We were seven and we traded sucks. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3014.0s)]
*  It's the hard. That's a hard sell on television. Trading sucks. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3019.0s)]
*  Imagine being in the room with those people and them thinking there's any hope of this guy making it in show business. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3022.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, the way thank God for these ways around. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3028.0s)]
*  Like, you know, again, radio embraced doing what you want to do and talk to you. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3031.0s)]
*  Slow news days were the thing. That's where your personal life comes out. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3035.0s)]
*  You have a four or five hour radio show and it's a slow news day and there's nothing to hit on. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3039.0s)]
*  Everyone just starts spilling their guts. Yeah. You have to talk. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3043.0s)]
*  And that's where a lot of that stuff came out. Slow news days. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3046.0s)]
*  Well, it's so we got very fortunate in the timeline in which we came along. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3049.0s)]
*  Right. Because what happened was you got guys like Don Imus who kind of started it all. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3054.0s)]
*  Right. He starts just commentary and talking shit on the radio. And he's a wild man and a bad boy. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3060.0s)]
*  And then Howard Stern takes it to a completely different level. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3066.0s)]
*  Then Howard Stern takes over radio all over the country. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3069.0s)]
*  And then Opie and Anthony comes along and Opie and Anthony is the next stage [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3073.0s)]
*  because they have a different perspective on how to do a show. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3076.0s)]
*  It's a hang. Yeah. So you go in there and with us, especially with comics, we would just go in there and hang. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3079.0s)]
*  Yeah. That was all it was. You'd go in there and hang out in the studio and everybody was cool and it was fun. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3085.0s)]
*  Yeah. And that led the way to podcasts because they went to XM. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3090.0s)]
*  So then they go to XM. Now you could swear. Yeah. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3094.0s)]
*  So now we're doing ONA with swearing and where you know you could tell crazy stories. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3097.0s)]
*  And then that goes into podcasting. It's like we came along as all these doors were opening like we hit every green light. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3103.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. I didn't get into. I mean, I wish I had one. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3110.0s)]
*  Obviously now I do. I look back on it. But my contract doesn't allow for it. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3114.0s)]
*  It may have early on before they knew what podcasting before the company knew what podcasting would be. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3118.0s)]
*  But you know, for the last X amount of years, I haven't been allowed to do my own. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3123.0s)]
*  But you're still doing the same thing. Yeah. Still talking. It's still the same thing. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3126.0s)]
*  You're just doing it for a different company. You're doing it for Sirius. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3130.0s)]
*  But if it's the same thing as doing a podcast, you're doing it just like ONA did it when they went to Sirius or like anybody else would. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3132.0s)]
*  If you're if you're just doing a show that you're putting together yourself. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3140.0s)]
*  Yeah. Just talking. I mean, look, I do the UFC podcast with Matt. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3143.0s)]
*  Like even that I love like we're talking specifically about one thing. Yeah. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3146.0s)]
*  But it's how much fun. I get to hang out with Matt. Sarah, who's fucking hilarious. So funny. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3150.0s)]
*  And talk to people I like. Like, you know what I mean? Like, it's just it's a great life. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3154.0s)]
*  Like I look at it like I get to do exactly what I want to do. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3159.0s)]
*  It's everything I've always wanted, which was just to not have a schedule that I resented. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3163.0s)]
*  Yeah. And also, again, this is not that other business. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3167.0s)]
*  We talk about the business is so phony. The business is full of shit. Yeah. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3171.0s)]
*  That's a different business. I don't think we're in that business anymore. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3174.0s)]
*  There's a few of us that still act and do stuff. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3177.0s)]
*  But if you look at the vast majority of comics today and like what business are they engaging in? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3179.0s)]
*  They're doing engaging the business of live shows and podcasts. Yeah. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3184.0s)]
*  Primarily. I have no desire to act like that. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3187.0s)]
*  That's another thing, too. People be like they see us on YouTube and like these situations are set up. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3190.0s)]
*  It's like, have you ever seen me act like you really think I could pull that off? [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3194.0s)]
*  I stink at it like I don't enjoy acting unless it's something I really like. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3198.0s)]
*  And I'm so happy I don't have to worry about getting on TV again. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3202.0s)]
*  I will probably never get another acting gig on TV. And that's fine. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3205.0s)]
*  I don't really want to do it. It's the time involved in doing something like this. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3208.0s)]
*  You can't do everything. You know, I would love to do everything. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3212.0s)]
*  If I had multiple different lives that I could live simultaneously, I'd have a ton of different careers [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3216.0s)]
*  because I'm fascinated by a lot of different things. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3220.0s)]
*  But you don't have that much time in the world. Right. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3223.0s)]
*  And if you want to act, acting is like 16 hour days, multiple days in a row. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3225.0s)]
*  And if you enjoy that, that's great. I don't I don't enjoy that process. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3230.0s)]
*  And it's hard. I think it's harder than stand up for me, obviously, because you can't address when it's not going well. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3234.0s)]
*  Like if I'm having a shit set, I can immediately address it and let them know. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3240.0s)]
*  And if it's if I think it's their fault, like we're all going to have a rotten night, I'll make it miserable. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3245.0s)]
*  But in an acting scene, it's like you just have to redo it or you can't break it and go, this fucking sucks. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3251.0s)]
*  These jokes are not good. What do we this is poor writing. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3255.0s)]
*  You have to just kind of muscle through it and smile. And I just I've never been good at that. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3258.0s)]
*  It's not because I don't I have so much integrity. I'm just not good at it. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3263.0s)]
*  Like I just I wish I was better at it. It's also you'd be better at it if you were really interested in it. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3265.0s)]
*  Maybe. Yeah. I'm just too self-conscious. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3270.0s)]
*  Like I'm self-conscious around my friends. I'm always it's the thing that I hate the most. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3273.0s)]
*  Always self-conscious. And I don't know why. But when I act, it comes out like it's just it's obvious. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3277.0s)]
*  You know, you can't hide that on camera. Yeah. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3283.0s)]
*  Yeah. Boy, imagine if you like put all your fucking eggs in the sitcom basket. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3287.0s)]
*  I tried at one point, you know, early on, I was like, like trying to be like, try to get the seven minutes that I thought they would want. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3292.0s)]
*  Everybody wants the big deal in Montreal. Montreal rejected me for a decade. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3299.0s)]
*  And when I finally get up there, no one gave a fuck. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3303.0s)]
*  Like, you know, the business has never been the path I thought I was going to take ever. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3305.0s)]
*  They've never wanted me. And I accept that. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3310.0s)]
*  It's just very bizarre that something so beloved, like an American institution, which was the, you know, the three camera sitcom, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3312.0s)]
*  multi-camera sitcom with in front of a live audience, it doesn't exist anymore. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3319.0s)]
*  I think it's Miss Pat only. I don't think anybody. She's the only one that I know of that's doing. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3323.0s)]
*  I'm sure there's probably a couple other that I'm just not aware of. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3328.0s)]
*  But she's the only one in terms of comics that are starring in the sitcom that I'm aware of. It used to be. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3331.0s)]
*  It used to be. There was a ton of them. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3336.0s)]
*  And I would have thought that as the more entertainment venues opened up, meaning more networks, like when we were kids, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3338.0s)]
*  when we were first starting out in show business, there was only Fox, ABC, NBC and CBS. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3344.0s)]
*  Yes. Right. That was it. That was it. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3351.0s)]
*  And then cable shows. So then it became MTV and a bunch of different things came along. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3353.0s)]
*  And like you could be on remote control and MTV like some people were. Or you could be on this show or that show. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3358.0s)]
*  It's like then it started to broaden. I would have never thought that as it continues to go as wide as it is today, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3364.0s)]
*  that sitcoms will all but vanish. Yeah. Never would have. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3371.0s)]
*  I guess because the idea like again, anytime these people touch things, anytime the business becomes too involved in something, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3375.0s)]
*  they they neuter it and they make it. It's just not funny anymore. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3382.0s)]
*  They have laugh tracks. So did the writing didn't have to be that good. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3385.0s)]
*  The laugh tracks are what really killed it. Like because the writing could be weak, but the laugh was the same. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3389.0s)]
*  So the writing didn't have to be good. Whereas live TV, if it wasn't good, you knew it wasn't good. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3394.0s)]
*  Yeah. There's shows that they do where you can watch clips online that are without the laugh track. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3398.0s)]
*  Yeah. The laugh track was added to it. And it's horrendous. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3405.0s)]
*  It's abysmal. Even MASH, which I loved growing up. I hated the laugh track. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3408.0s)]
*  They added a laugh track while they're in Vietnam. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3412.0s)]
*  Do you know what? Korea. Do you know what makes the only laugh track I've ever liked? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3414.0s)]
*  Steve Coogan is hilarious. And he did I'm Alan Partridge. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3418.0s)]
*  It's a British show where he played a radio guy and it's a really funny show. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3423.0s)]
*  And his laugh track for some reason didn't bother me. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3428.0s)]
*  Like it worked as a device for some reason. But other than that, I've always hated them. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3431.0s)]
*  Well, you can do an organic laugh track. You know about those? No. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3436.0s)]
*  So you basically film a show without a laugh track and then you play the show to a live audience and record their laughter. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3439.0s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. Then the laughs are at least honest. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3445.0s)]
*  Yeah. I know there's shows that have done it that way. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3448.0s)]
*  What is that for? You think just to cut? Actually that might actually work because... [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3450.0s)]
*  Well, you have to do it that way if you're doing like a single camera show. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3453.0s)]
*  Or the same joke in front of the audience five times. I mean we did Lucky Louie. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3456.0s)]
*  And we'd have to reshoot something and Louie would be like, you got anything? You got anything? [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3460.0s)]
*  Like because there's a comic. He hated doing the same joke in front of the audience twice. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3462.0s)]
*  So you'd try to come up with something or he would just improv something crazy. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3466.0s)]
*  And like it was a lot of fun, but it was a challenge to try not to do the same joke if you could avoid it. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3470.0s)]
*  That was one of the fun things they did on News Radio. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3475.0s)]
*  We would do a take and then they would take a break and the writers would convey. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3477.0s)]
*  And then the warm up guy would talk to the crowd and then the writers would come up with another line. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3482.0s)]
*  And then we bang it out right there and try another line and then do like three or four different takes. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3487.0s)]
*  And the audience started to get ready for the different joke at the end. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3492.0s)]
*  And there was like three or four different ones and they'd pick one. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3497.0s)]
*  But it's like the pressure of that moment was what created some of the best ideas for whatever reason. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3500.0s)]
*  You feel dishonest doing the same joke twice. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3505.0s)]
*  Like there's something about it where you feel like you're like, hey, we all know I'm lying right now. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3507.0s)]
*  It's like it just doesn't feel right. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3513.0s)]
*  And the crowd is much more appreciative when they know you're giving them something different. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3516.0s)]
*  Yes. But yeah, I feel terrible doing the same. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3520.0s)]
*  Some guys would do a stand up special. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3523.0s)]
*  Like I've never done a retake of a joke. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3525.0s)]
*  And again, not that I don't think any of them needed it, but it's just I'm too embarrassed to do the same joke twice to the audience. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3528.0s)]
*  I would rather like I dropped my closing joke on a special because I fucking tripped on it like an idiot. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3534.0s)]
*  And I just I couldn't go back and redo it. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3539.0s)]
*  I'm like, I just have to close with something else. It's just too humiliating. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3541.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, the sitcom thing is also it's it's not really stand up. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3544.0s)]
*  It's very different. Right. Yeah. So you're just trying to interact with these people the best way possible to get the story through and get the laughs. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3549.0s)]
*  And the audience is aware of that. So they're in on this process that normally never get to see. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3556.0s)]
*  Whereas stand up, you always see where the standups on stage and, you know, they're telling the joke and the audience is laughing. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3561.0s)]
*  But with a sitcom, you never get to see how the sausage is made. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3567.0s)]
*  All right. So these are the people in the audience. Right. The cameras are moving around. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3570.0s)]
*  So it's an experience on top of just you're watching the show, but you're there live. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3574.0s)]
*  You're watching it be created. So you're also watching someone fumble through their lines and start laughing like that would happen or we would crack. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3579.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like when I did ice these scenes with Andy Dick and I was always he's so funny. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3586.0s)]
*  I would always break. I would be in the middle of fucking pink and it would be like take two and I'd like pinch myself or slap myself or do something to try to be more serious and get through it. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3590.0s)]
*  But there's that, too, that the audience is seeing. So if they see you retake a scene, but at least you're adding new lines. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3600.0s)]
*  So now it doesn't feel like they're burdened by seeing the same thing over again. Now it's like, oh, wow, this is how they do it. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3608.0s)]
*  So they just sometimes they just come up with new stuff on the fly. It's also weird when I don't look at the audience. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3614.0s)]
*  Like as a stand up, you want to just look at the crowd. Right. But if we were shooting something on the side stage and the crowd would just watch it on a monitor or even if I do Gutfeld on Fox. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3619.0s)]
*  And I'm usually sitting next to Greg where I see the audience. But once in a while, if I sit in the seat where the audience is here, it's so hard to just live in this environment without just turning and looking at the crowd. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3627.0s)]
*  I hate not seeing the crowd. And with other guys, it doesn't bother. But it drives me crazy to not be looking directly at the audience. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3639.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's an extra level of fake. Right. Because you know it's fake because you're not really in an office. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3645.0s)]
*  You know it's fake because there's no wall. You know, it's fake because the whole audience of people and you're trying to act normal. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3650.0s)]
*  Yeah. So you're trying to act normal in an environment where everyone knows it's fake. Yeah. You're trying to make it real. But at least if you're on a single camera show, you know, if you're doing something like Modern Family or something like that, you got a single camera. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3656.0s)]
*  And like it's just like you're filming a movie. There's no audience. You have to piece so you can be real in moments and you're not worried about not looking at the crowd that's laughing at you. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3670.0s)]
*  Right. And if you have to redo it, it doesn't matter because it's not a bunch of people who you need a reaction from. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3682.0s)]
*  Waiting. Waiting. Yeah. Yeah. I just, that whole world, I just, it became so exhausted trying to be in it. And I'm so happy that I don't have to exist in it. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3687.0s)]
*  And again, it has nothing to do with me thinking I'm too good for it. It's just I wasn't good in it. It's not where I'm comfortable. I don't feel funny there. I don't feel welcome there. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3695.0s)]
*  Weren't you on Lucky Louie? That's what I was saying. That was fun though. That was great. It's one of my favorite things I ever did. But again, it's Louie's writing. Right. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3703.0s)]
*  So I mean the jokes were pretty fucking rough and you know he would go really hard and the crowd, they had never seen any of the episodes. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3711.0s)]
*  Like the whole thing was shot before any of them aired. So there was no week to week growth with familiarity. We had to shoot all, we shot 13 actually and then they just aired. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3720.0s)]
*  So the crowd, we were resetting with each crowd. They had no idea who we were. No idea what the characters were. But it's one of the most fun things I ever did. Loved Lucky Louie. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3730.0s)]
*  Yeah and then he goes from that and does his own show. A massive, yeah which was a huge, yeah I mean it just worked. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3739.0s)]
*  HBO I thought fucked up by not picking that up for a second season. They allowed a few critics, even though it had a lot of viewers, they allowed a few critics to shit on it enough to get it canceled. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3746.0s)]
*  You think that's what happened? I know that's what happened. Yeah, Louie talked about it. Yeah because it was actually week to week going up in viewers. It was just, I thought HBO made a mistake by not at least giving it season two. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3757.0s)]
*  Isn't that interesting that they would allow the opinions of people who are, they're professional critics. They're professional like shitters on things. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3765.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well they were also, they had shows like Sopranos and Six Feet Under and Fuck It. They were built on critical acclaim and things that people love. Sex and the City, all this stuff where you know got awards and like HBO was like the first one getting awards. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3773.0s)]
*  So when something, when the critics were going we don't like this, I think immediately they're like yeah it's not worth doing. But yeah that was kind of always heartbreaking. But I always think it's because I was attached to it. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3787.0s)]
*  Like I really am a fucking black spot on the lung. Like anything like that, it's like, it's gonna go away. I don't think it's that. I think it was Louie's first time at one of those things that he didn't have the kind of control that he had when he went over and did Louie. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3797.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. That's what I think. The writing though, like they didn't really, I'm sure they fucked with him where I didn't see it. But we would run through the rehearsals and it always seemed to pretty much, we would kind of shoot what I thought we were gonna shoot. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3808.0s)]
*  I just, the critics, there was one critic who like weeks into this series went after it and Louie always thought like that was one of the things that sunk us. So you know it is what it is I mean. But it was, that was one of the ones I look back on and go fuck I wish that had been good for a season two. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3821.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's so hard to make things now. I mean how many, how many comedy shows like that are with comics are on the air now? [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3836.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean I don't watch any of them anyway. Like I don't watch stand up. I don't watch, and it probably should because I interview people and I'm just such a fucking idiot. Like I don't watch things people, do you watch specials? Like I can't watch somebody special. Even if I love them I can't watch it. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3846.0s)]
*  I like watching people live. I do like watching people in the club. I do that. I very rarely sit down and watch a special. If one of my friends put something out and he asked me to watch something I'll watch something but most of the time I like, I like seeing comedy. I mean I'm very fortunate. I get to see some of the best comics live on the spot. So I just like doing that. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3859.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I get, even if I'm walking through and I see Colin on stage I'll watch or tell. Like if the celly sees such great comedians. Yeah. But the idea of actually just watching somebody I just, I guess because I'm also like everybody else clip based. It's all fucking a minute or two minutes and I run out of patience with something. I also want to see things I wish I would have thought of. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3881.0s)]
*  Oh yeah that's true too. And when you're entertaining yourself, what do you entertain yourself with? Is it movies? Like what do you? [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3898.0s)]
*  We go through, I watch a lot of TV with Nikki. So it's like we're going through a soprano's watch through now. Re-watching sopranos. Yeah. That's a good move. It's yeah. I probably forgot most of it. I did forget most of it. And we interviewed, who did they interview recently? It was Robert Eyler and Jamie Lynn Siegler. They're doing a podcast together. So I was like interviewing them. I'm like fuck I forgot how great this show was. Let's just start it over and watch it. But it's most of the shit people do. I'm watching people climb buildings, free climbers like these fucking [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3905.0s)]
*  maniacs that climb buildings. I'm afraid to hide. You ever watch those guys? Yeah. It just freaks me out. Elaine Robert I think his name is a French, the French Spider-Man who kind of started all that shit. Free climbing with no equipment. A building. A skyscraper. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 100 stories. Horrified. They always have these helmet cams on. It really bothers me. Yeah. That drives me nuts. I can't imagine why you would do that. Or I'll watch bee videos like hornets nests. I go on. What is it like when it gets up there and the wind starts blowing? Horrible. I'm sure it's fucking terrible. But [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3935.0s)]
*  I can't get through the videos. I have to stop watching. I bet that wind can get under your stomach. Dude, he just put one up where he showed himself on a building fighting the wind. Oh my God. And he's holding on and you can see. And there was also one. Where is that? Where is that? Put that up. If you go to Elaine Robert, A-L-A-I-N, I think on Instagram, his Instagram showed it where he's like he's very close to the top of the building and you can see the wind. Do you see it? [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3965.0s)]
*  I'm just laughing at his reaction. Oh yeah. Are you afraid of heights? Yeah. Oh yeah. Me too. I'm terrified. I'm afraid of also doing something stupid like this. That's what I'm afraid of because I think my brain is the kind of brain that would be like, I think I can climb that. You know, like a person who gets good at climbing would want to climb a building like that. Yeah. I could see myself in another life being that stupid. There's also, oh yeah, there is. Oh Jesus Christ. Fighting against the wind. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=3995.0s)]
*  Windstorm it says. Yeah. Oh my God. Are you fucking kidding me? Yeah. Doesn't that look helpless? Oh my God. Listen to the wind. Oh fuck. Fuck. Jesus Christ, man. Yeah. It's hard to watch. All of his videos are like that. You see how close he is to the top? That gets me, dude. That makes my fucking hands sweat. Yeah, me too. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4025.0s)]
*  Me too. I can't get through these videos usually. Oh my God. Get down. Get down. Yeah. Don't just stand up there when you get to the top. Imagine the wind caught him. I think there's one he did where he gets close to the rooftop and then he can't get over it. Like the last, the last, the tip top of it, he can't get over it. He has to climb back down the building. No, no, no, he doesn't. Did you see the Burj Khalifa one on the top left where he's standing on top of the. Oh my God. Oh my God. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4055.0s)]
*  What is he doing? What are you doing up there, buddy? Get down. Get down. Yeah. Hey, Habibi, come to Dubai. Yeah. I don't know what that means either. Go scroll down a little bit. There was some workout that he was doing where he's hanging. I think that's his house. Let me see what that is. What is he doing here? Oh, wow, dude. So he's got like freak control of his body. That's insane. He's hanging on with like one finger. He's got like finger holes. Yeah, he's doing a one finger pull up. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4085.0s)]
*  Oh my God, that's insane. Yeah, terrifying. It says for 50 years. It says soon there will be 50 years that I've been climbing free solo. Some people say that it's crazy. Far as I'm concerned, I've been living my dreams all along and potentially assuming the potential outcome. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4115.0s)]
*  The potential outcome. Imagine just thinking about it that way. The potential outcome of you falling to your death. I hate when he turns around. Sometimes he turns around and looks down. Yeah, I hate that. Yeah, it's hard. It's hard. Stop. Get it off the screen. It's hard. It's hard to look at. Yeah, but that's what I do. I watch guys like that. And there's a lot of guys that are following his footsteps now. But it's those type of things. It's all about the potential outcome. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4133.0s)]
*  A lot of it's the helmet cam. Didn't some guy fall recently? He was doing parkour on doing backflips on top of a building and he fell. Yes. And there's also footage of another guy falling. I think he was a Chinese climber and he was on the 60th floor. And you don't see them splat, but you see him. He had the camera set up and he's hanging on the top. Yeah. And he's trying to climb like he can't make it up. He can't make it up. And he just lets go. And they said he was on the 60th floor. But that's the feeling that that looks so helpless is hanging on the top. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4163.0s)]
*  And trying to get your feet going. And that's exactly how it happens. Yeah, but you do. You don't skydive or any of that stuff. Oh, yeah. I hate heights. No, no, no, no, no, no. I have no desire. Yeah. I wish I wasn't afraid of it, though. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4193.0s)]
*  Brie Red Band's dad worked in this office and this lady was always trying to get him skydive with them. And then one day he goes in the office and she's not there. Parachute didn't open up. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4213.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. Yeah, good for him. Not going. Yeah, good for him saying no. Think I fucked that story up. No, I mean, it's right. Was it a lady that he worked with? Like to go last? Yeah, that's it. Yeah. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4226.32s)]
*  Yeah, it terrifies me like I don't even flying when I was coming here [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4238.08s)]
*  I'm such a fucking idiot. I checked the weather reports to see how bumpy the flight might be [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4241.8s)]
*  I'm really annoying like I just I'm it's gonna they said high winds and I'm like, it's gonna be a bad flight and for two [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4245.92s)]
*  Days, I'm panicking before about the fucking wind [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4250.92s)]
*  So yeah, the height thing is really it's a paralyzing fear [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4254.68s)]
*  Yeah, because you know that if you make a mistake you'll die and these people fight that fear and client like Alex [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4258.64s)]
*  Honnold is one of the oddest guys I think I've ever met because he's he does that all the time in these mountains [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4265.52s)]
*  He's crazy, you know, like yeah where the angles going backwards and he's got to climb a thousand feet [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4271.080000000001s)]
*  Well just kind of hanging on with his feet and toes. Does he use equipment or is he free free climb? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4278.360000000001s)]
*  No, we free solos. That's the films called free solo that documentary on him. Yeah, he climbed like that 3000 foot one [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4282.8s)]
*  I think I saw some of that. Yeah, he's climbed a lot of them all over the world [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4289.76s)]
*  But it's just the the act of doing that the act of just being involved in risking your life and just [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4293.5599999999995s)]
*  Climbing all the time. It's just did you ever watch the Alpinist? No documentary. Oh my god [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4301.36s)]
*  It's about this kid who was like the goat of these guys and it got to the point where for him [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4307.44s)]
*  We're just regular free solo climbing on mountains wasn't scary enough. So he starts ice climbing [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4313.92s)]
*  So what he's doing is climbing up the side of like icicles hanging off the side of a mountain and he's doing it with [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4320.84s)]
*  An ice axe so he's pulling himself up with ice axes [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4328.32s)]
*  Because like regular climbing doesn't freak him out enough now. He's got an ice axe his way up [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4333.32s)]
*  I mean so this ice is hanging off the mountain [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4338.759999999999s)]
*  Okay, so you have this cliff face right here and then you have all this space and then you have the ice [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4342.08s)]
*  Thousands of feet hanging down above the the ground and he's [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4348.360000000001s)]
*  Digging into this ice and hoping it hangs on there while he's climbing his way [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4354.160000000001s)]
*  You gotta see it. You want to freak out the this [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4359.280000000001s)]
*  This guy was out of his fucking mind [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4361.96s)]
*  It is crazy what people have to do to feel like they're like they're up in the last time like that stuff [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4363.360000000001s)]
*  That's what he would climb. Did you see the the icicles? [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4368.4800000000005s)]
*  Wherever you found it. Yeah, I think it was early in the beginning where they showed the icicles [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4372.72s)]
*  But this guy would make his way with just Google his name. I know there's really good [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4377.14s)]
*  I played the trailer of the movie doesn't show any of this stuff. This is the trailer, right? Is he dead or alive? [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4382.52s)]
*  He's alive died. He died doing that actual thing. You got caught in an avalanche Jesus. Oh, but he didn't fall [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4387.400000000001s)]
*  He just got no he just got that's it. So that's it right there [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4393.4400000000005s)]
*  That's how you climb that kind of shit and you see how he just did it with the ice axes. That's how you do it [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4395.900000000001s)]
*  He climb icicles [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4401.06s)]
*  Because like regular climbing rocks got boring and [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4403.5s)]
*  if you talk to [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4407.740000000001s)]
*  Psychologists that really understand the human mind [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4409.34s)]
*  There's like a there's a thing that these they this is like the theory that some of these people [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4411.06s)]
*  That do this kind of stuff like look at that. Look how I'm saying that is they don't feel normal [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4416.660000000001s)]
*  So it's you know to feel something they really have to do that [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4421.06s)]
*  You really have to do something that would be absolutely paralyzingly terrifying to you or me [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4425.3s)]
*  I think that I might be fucking up the phrase Tyson talked about something about like I guess when he was doing [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4430.6s)]
*  Drugs or medic he said the baseline normal. I think was the term he used [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4436.08s)]
*  It was something it was something about what it takes to get just to feel zero like just to feel okay [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4439.68s)]
*  I'm regular and whatever if you're addicted to something adrenaline, whatever it is. We all have that just with for me. It would be [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4445.4800000000005s)]
*  Porn or set like you know, I mean like it took so long or so many different things to just get to that feeling [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4452.92s)]
*  I'm starting to feel high from this. I'm starting to feel yeah [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4458.12s)]
*  like baseline normal is a good way to put that and it's a good way to put like one of the conversations that I [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4460.76s)]
*  We were having the other day in the green room was how fun it is to be able to talk to people that you just [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4466.24s)]

*  We're all cracking up and it's all with love and that's our baseline normal [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4476.66s)]
*  So if you get our the people that are used to what we have as baseline normal and you put them in some stuffy [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4481.84s)]
*  office environment [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4487.86s)]
*  It's gonna be a real problem for us [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4490.139999999999s)]
*  We're gonna feel like super constrained and we're gonna feel like shit and people who see it a lot of times think you're being mean [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4491.74s)]
*  To each other and it's like no you have an understanding that like this is how we tough crowd. It's like sparring with somebody [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4497.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's not hurting them. It's you're throwing punches at a person who's also throwing them back at you [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4504.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, tough crowd was a great example [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4508.5s)]
*  Keith Robinson Keith Robinson's had two strokes and I went and watched him his special is fucking amazing [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4510.0199999999995s)]
*  Special so good and it was really great but Keith doesn't expect an ounce of sympathy from people [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4515.740000000001s)]
*  Nobody treats him any differently [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4524.5s)]
*  The stroke is just one more thing we make fun of and he's the same guy [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4526.58s)]
*  He's always been and anybody on the outside would see that and go you guys are mean to each other [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4530.06s)]
*  But if we were all of a sudden start talking to Keith differently [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4534.14s)]
*  And trying to kidglove him he would fucking hate it [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4538.02s)]
*  It would be uncomfortable and he would feel like I'm not a damaged [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4540.98s)]
*  Mental but like you know I mean like I'm the same guy [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4544.66s)]
*  So yeah people see that sometimes they don't understand that we really do love each other like we just being dicks because that's what makes [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4546.86s)]
*  Us laugh. Yeah, and it's also the way we feed off each other [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4551.94s)]
*  We spar and it gets everybody better too like when someone shits on you with a really good zinger, you know [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4554.86s)]
*  Oh, you get home. You're like god damn. He got me good one. Yeah, how did it fuck? I gotta I gotta write better lines [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4560.9s)]
*  I gotta come up with some better lines [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4566.98s)]
*  I gotta come up with some more funny things to say about him [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4568.34s)]
*  Let me think what's fucked up about the way he dresses the way he talks and you know what annoys me about you [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4570.58s)]
*  And then you're going out and they're both smiling [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4575.34s)]
*  Yeah, everyone's smiling everyone's laughing and it also but it keeps you honest to like [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4577.58s)]
*  Collin is really good at that like we'll be at the cellar sometimes and I'll say something I think makes sense [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4582.62s)]
*  And he'll go. What are you my fucking aunt and I'm like, oh god, right [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4588.22s)]
*  Like it was an aunt thing that I said you can either get annoyed at it [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4591.78s)]
*  Or you can just acknowledge like wow that really was kind of a douchey old lady thing [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4596.16s)]
*  I just said yeah and just take it also even if it wasn't the fact that someone can make fun of it [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4600.36s)]
*  Yeah, you should think that's funny that that even though that well, that's not what I meant, but that is funny [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4605.76s)]
*  Yeah, he's annoying when he calls you out in front of people who are in comics [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4611.16s)]
*  He's done that to me to this fucking asshole in Whole Foods one time [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4613.78s)]
*  Somebody said something like the per the cashier said something I go [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4616.64s)]
*  Oh, no worries and he goes does it annoy you that he's talking like an Australian tour guide and it's just she laughs at me [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4619.68s)]
*  because [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4626.08s)]
*  It's embarrassing because [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4628.5199999999995s)]
*  She like if he said it to another comic I wouldn't care [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4630.32s)]
*  But if this is just some fucking lady who really thought it was funny, and obviously I did sound like that [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4633.08s)]
*  But you know it kind of just it makes you almost hyper aware of everything you say and that's our baseline normal [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4637.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, but I wouldn't I can't I can't function with that [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4644.72s)]
*  I can't be in a relationship with someone who isn't like that who doesn't appreciate that. I just it's not fun [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4648.6s)]
*  It's not fun, and if you always have to watch what you're saying, or you're always worried [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4653.5s)]
*  I'm gonna upset them by being too harsh or they're too fragile [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4656.82s)]
*  You know now imagine that same sort of philosophy that same mindset [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4660.46s)]
*  And then you apply it to work [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4665.54s)]
*  So work when you have to work somewhere most of the time you don't get to choose the people you work with [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4667.54s)]
*  You work with the people who also work at the place you work [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4672.94s)]
*  And then you have to deal with all this fucking bullshit sensitivities that they might be bringing to the table [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4675.7s)]
*  Yeah, and there's also a penalty in those situations where if you say something people don't like they go to human resources [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4681.1s)]
*  Which nothing destroys fun like fucking human resources because when their job is only to make sure the company doesn't get sued [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4687.42s)]
*  Yep, that's it. Yeah, it's all that lawsuits that that really is [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4694.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean even at work like you know on the air we can say what we want [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4698.580000000001s)]
*  They never fuck with us, but I don't talk to anybody in the office. I mean I don't fucking hi hello and keep walking [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4702.06s)]
*  I don't want any [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4708.26s)]
*  miscommunications any [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4709.780000000001s)]
*  misinterpretations or any opportunity for someone to just be deceitful someone to pretend that you said something or [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4711.06s)]
*  Lock you into some sort of a weird deal. What's easier? [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4717.34s)]
*  I know people that have had to do that where it's easier to pay someone than it is to yeah deal with the ramifications of being [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4720.62s)]
*  falsely charged [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4726.62s)]
*  Yeah, whatever yeah, we're just yeah, he said this to me, and it's like how do I prove that I didn't say that right? [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4727.780000000001s)]
*  There's no yeah, I feel like people that make money suing companies, too [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4733.3s)]
*  They it's like it's a real good way to go. I got sued [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4737.34s)]
*  I mean it's like it's why I have you know insurance because I got fucking sued for half a million dollars [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4740.7s)]
*  It was that it was that fucking for defamation because I shit on that lawyer on the air when he called in he was like [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4746.16s)]
*  The guys right activist and he called up and I insulted him for an hour [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4752.6s)]
*  And I implied that he fucked chickens like it was funny [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4756.96s)]
*  And he I remember saying like he sued me for defamation [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4760.18s)]
*  And I remember saying this guy wants to kill me [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4763.76s)]
*  But he can't so he's getting me legally because we met once I thought I wanted to settle with him because he amended his complaint [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4766.360000000001s)]
*  He said that I was having people send him anthrax or white powder implying. It was anthrax. It was fucking crazy [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4772.900000000001s)]
*  So I had him meet in my lawyer's office just to tell him like dude. I like that's insane [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4778.92s)]
*  I thought like it's two people where but he thought I was gonna settle so we shook hands and met and he was just like [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4782.92s)]
*  a little fishy weird guy [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4789.04s)]
*  And then he just continued to sue me and it finally went away [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4792.0s)]
*  I had a great lawyer and in court eight months later or nine months later [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4795.64s)]
*  The judge didn't like him and my attorney started reading things [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4800.84s)]
*  I said to him on the air and all the other lawyers in the court started laughing and all those people laughing at him [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4804.46s)]
*  Got him to go. Oh, you're on we can settle this so but they went in the back and that was it [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4810.8s)]
*  No money was paid. It was just dropped [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4815.04s)]
*  He just didn't want to be mocked and that he didn't want to be mocked and he wrote like this [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4817.24s)]
*  Manifesto and he mentioned me in it [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4821.56s)]
*  And that guy over the fucking pandemic [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4823.92s)]

*  It was more than a lawsuit because he challenged me to a duel [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4857.72s)]
*  I didn't say he challenged on the air [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4860.7s)]
*  He goes you want to go to South America and have a duel like it was really bizarre that he chose those ten paces things [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4862.28s)]
*  Yes, like it was so nuts [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4868.44s)]
*  And then he started wanting to come back in studio and fight us [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4871.4s)]
*  He's like you'll just be me against the three hosts fighting all these crazy messages. Oh my god [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4874.96s)]

*  Yeah, so that like when that type of shit happens, it's like it does change you a little bit [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4885.24s)]
*  You're like wow that guy was right that guy literally wanted to murder me. It wasn't me being crazy or paranoid [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4890.04s)]
*  And most people if when I heard he had cancer like they said he had like [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4895.7s)]
*  Incurable stage 4 cancer and then he wound up doing that and then he just blew his brains out shot himself. Oh, yeah [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4899.82s)]

*  Yeah, and I just it was just maybe it's just an animal gut instinct. I'm like this guy's a fucking problem [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4938.219999999999s)]

*  Ramped up all his anger. It led to him murdering people, you know [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4953.860000000001s)]
*  I don't know because it was years later and it was also he had this thing with women like [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4957.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, I originally we were gonna interview him because he was suing Columbia because of their guys studies or women's studies [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4963.46s)]
*  Sorry, and so I was like look I don't like anything that's progressive and exclusive by nature [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4969.22s)]
*  Like you know, I mean like hey, how come they're not doing guys so I'm like, let's see what [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4974.26s)]
*  But then it became apparent. He just sues women. So then we started to make fun of him [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4978.14s)]
*  Because it's like it wasn't the principle of Columbia doing this [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4982.780000000001s)]
*  It was like you just have a fucking hard on and want to sue women [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4986.26s)]
*  So then we kind of made fun of him and it got ugly and I was just being a dick like I was on the air [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4989.1s)]
*  And that's what really but I don't think that I think he had so many of these problems [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4995.900000000001s)]
*  It was much more about women than anything I said to him like my humiliation of him was years earlier [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=4999.660000000001s)]
*  But I do think I humiliated him and he really wanted to because my attorney at the time [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5005.78s)]
*  His name is Tom Ferber. He's a great lawyer and he they my law firm hated him so much [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5010.42s)]
*  They retroactively knocked down what they were charging me [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5016.38s)]
*  They go this guy's such a bad guy that we're gonna charge you less and we're gonna make it retroactive [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5019.179999999999s)]
*  Like they were so offended by what he was doing as an attorney [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5023.74s)]
*  So I got lucky with really good people and they really took good care of me [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5027.139999999999s)]
*  He also got lucky that you caught him before the cancer [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5031.74s)]
*  Yes, a hundred percent hundred percent because again, do I think he would have hunted me down and kill no [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5034.7s)]
*  I think the judge for him was a bigger one [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5041.22s)]
*  But I mean, I'm sure it would have felt good for him if he could have especially was on a run [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5043.860000000001s)]
*  So let me stop by. Yeah, you know station. Yeah, and oddly enough it happened in the town [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5048.06s)]
*  I grew up in which was again a pure coincidence, but I happened in North Brunswick [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5052.360000000001s)]
*  He went to kill her and just unfortunately her son answered the door. Oh [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5057.02s)]
*  Boy yeah, you get like I've gotten so many threats [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5061.14s)]
*  Over the years like and like legit, you know radio podcasting you don't see who it's not like live stand-up [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5065.38s)]
*  Like there's a lot of people that you don't see [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5070.66s)]
*  And I used to answer them [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5073.14s)]
*  I have I have hundreds of fucking hate mail messages and I used to go back and forth with people [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5074.4s)]
*  And I eventually stopped because then people like I had a couple people talking about you better watch your back or talk about getting shot [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5079.54s)]
*  And they were using their real names. I'm like, all right, this guy's using his real name [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5086.46s)]
*  He's a fucking there's something wrong with him, right? And I don't know what he looks like and he knows what I look like [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5089.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5094.42s)]
*  But I eventually stopped reading it or responding to it because the thing about the ONA show though [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5095.9800000000005s)]
*  It was a very aggressive show. Yeah and [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5101.06s)]
*  Aggressive and shitting on people. Yeah aggressive and attacking people and the weaponization of the pests [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5104.5s)]
*  Yeah, and they kind of did it on their own and we enjoyed it [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5111.18s)]
*  Because they were really funny like they would do some really funny shit like we would do jocktober's [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5115.360000000001s)]
*  And just a torture another to tell everybody with the pet the pests of the audience [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5122.0s)]
*  Oh, they were just these are these ONA fans area great, you know really connected very committed fans [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5126.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5131.6s)]
*  And pests was just this dumb affection because they were just pests [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5132.0s)]
*  They were just annoying people and we would take over and just like fuck with another radio show [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5134.88s)]
*  It would only happen for a day though [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5139.6s)]
*  You'd be in and out for a day that put all these horrible things on their Facebook page [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5141.0s)]
*  The Facebook page would shut down and then the next day it would be another [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5144.52s)]
*  Well, John Tober was it was just making fun of like corny radio guys [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5148.04s)]
*  Yeah, and I actually it's funny [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5152.1s)]
*  I had to go on because you know [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5153.44s)]
*  I had the advantage of doing radio but also of going on the road and [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5154.64s)]
*  I had been on shows and they're like, you know, you jocktobered us [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5158.56s)]
*  So I had to go and face some of these fucking people and it's embarrassing. It's embarrassing [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5162.44s)]
*  It's like being overheard talking shit, but would you say to them? [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5167.96s)]
*  You know, I mean look they were they were cooler with it than I would have thought and it was one time in Boston [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5170.64s)]
*  We had really in brutal to this show. How sure was it? I don't remember. I know it's been years ago [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5175.88s)]
*  I don't remember the show. I didn't remember the jocktobering but Kenny comes out and I was waiting to do a show and he goes [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5179.88s)]
*  hey, you [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5186.64s)]
*  Jocktobered these people and they want to know if you have the guts to come in studio and I'm like, yeah [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5188.68s)]
*  So I went right in because you have to I would rather just yeah face it [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5192.56s)]
*  And then we kind of talked about it and it was okay. It wasn't it wasn't as aggressive [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5197.44s)]
*  I think they were surprised that I came in [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5201.28s)]
*  And whenever you talk to someone one-on-one it humanized them a little bit like it's harder to totally dismiss somebody [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5203.96s)]
*  When you're actually talking to them, right? [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5209.5599999999995s)]
*  Because you realize like yeah [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5211.5599999999995s)]
*  They're just making a living doing radio and they look at me like he's just a stupid fucking comic making fun of something [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5213.28s)]
*  So we wound up getting along and it was okay. But yeah, I had to deal with that on the road [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5218.759999999999s)]
*  I went on a few shows that we fought with like Lex and Terry in Dallas. They were really brutal those guys [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5223.64s)]
*  They were harsh [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5228.4800000000005s)]
*  We had nasty fights with them and then eventually got kind of made up and I went on their show and it was fun [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5229.4400000000005s)]
*  Those are any of those shows still around how many of those I don't know. I know bubba's still around. He's doing something [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5235.320000000001s)]
*  I don't know if Lex and Terry are touch her and rich just broke up up and but they were friends [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5241.6s)]
*  But I mean like they were one of those shows that made it through all these what about Bob and Dom? [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5245.8s)]
*  I want them died. Oh, which one Bob and I don't know [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5249.4400000000005s)]
*  I've only done this show once or twice and I've been in studio once or twice [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5252.68s)]
*  I think one of them passed away and I don't know which one [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5255.84s)]
*  They were the show to get on they were if you wanted to be big in the Midwest you wanted to get on the Bob [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5260.08s)]
*  And Tom show yeah Larry the cable guy all these guys that they made [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5265.04s)]
*  I mean radio would what it did for people for years now [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5268.96s)]
*  No one cares if you're on the radio like the regular a doesn't do shit for people anymore unless unless [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5272.16s)]
*  Few shows in a few markets can help like Johnny Deere in Kansas City was always a great show to go on because he was [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5276.76s)]
*  Help you sell tickets. Yeah, but most of those shows are gone. I don't know [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5282.68s)]
*  I haven't been out there in so many years though the weird ones for me now is you know whenever you [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5286.4400000000005s)]
*  Get a car and you know like usually I use like Apple CarPlay in my car [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5293.08s)]
*  But if I don't have it plugged in or if I forget my phone or something like that [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5298.04s)]
*  I'm like let me see what's on the radio [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5302.16s)]
*  Oh, and I'll press AM talk radio [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5303.96s)]
*  And I'll just scroll until I find either someone talking about Jesus or someone talking about Trump [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5306.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5312.8s)]
*  That's exactly what it is. There's nothing funny like where there's very few funny [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5314.12s)]
*  Shows anymore because everyone's so afraid of getting in trouble or getting the let like it's worse than it's ever been [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5318.68s)]
*  They're just trying to catch people slipping [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5323.8s)]
*  Trying to catch people saying something they can get them in trouble for yeah, we got out just in time [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5326.240000000001s)]
*  I mean honestly like when we got fired in 2002 it again it turned out to be a blessing [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5331.0s)]
*  But when you got when you're doing serious do they tell you how many people listen no it's a negotiation [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5336.16s)]
*  Strength for them, but they don't just like Netflix won't tell you how many people have watched your special [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5342.12s)]
*  But there's no one that you know that's inside no no I've I've wanted to know and I guess people they said that Sam [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5347.16s)]
*  And I do really well on the only for them on demand is very big their app is very big and they said we do [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5354.5s)]
*  Better than most people at the company on that app, and they're really happy with it so the app. It's just like having [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5360.72s)]
*  Spotify or something like that you just press and you can get the show whenever you want [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5367.54s)]
*  Yeah, and you can listen to a replay yes [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5370.82s)]
*  So it's essentially a podcast just released through the app through the app and you have to pay for that [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5373.46s)]
*  I don't know I mean I think the app is free [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5377.299999999999s)]
*  I don't know I don't this I don't listen my own show much less anything else the show you have to pay for serious XM [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5379.58s)]
*  So right or it's just serious serious. I would imagine Pandora now. Oh is it yeah serious XM Pandora? [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5384.82s)]
*  So that I thought they got rid of the XM is it Pandora? Yeah, they own Pandora. Oh, yeah [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5390.46s)]
*  No, serious XM is still and they just added something else, too [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5395.259999999999s)]
*  I should probably know cuz I work there, but I really don't how much longer think Howard's gonna do it [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5398.26s)]
*  I don't know because I don't know him like I've met him [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5401.860000000001s)]
*  I've never really interacted with Howard other than hello and goodbye and like weird [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5404.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, same building same building, but he go in the studio. I don't think he's been there for a long time [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5409.34s)]
*  I think he broadcasts from home like he's got his own studio [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5414.38s)]
*  But even when he was in I wouldn't see him because I came in I would see Artie [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5418.66s)]
*  Like Artie Lang and I would bump into each other in the elevator all the time [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5422.38s)]
*  And I hated getting up and which would drive me crazy like Artie does heroin and he and I were getting here at the same [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5425.58s)]
*  Time like he would fucking be there with the sunglasses on and the elevator going up to work [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5430.34s)]
*  So I bumped into Artie all the time, but Howard I've probably seen two or three times in all those years interesting [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5435.58s)]
*  Yeah, we never I never did his show because it was I was Opie and Anthony and when we were off the air [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5441.1s)]
*  I was an ONA guy, so I never tried to get on I just always wondered like what is like [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5445.98s)]
*  I'm [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5450.38s)]
*  What motivates them like does he want to keep doing it? [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5451.54s)]
*  You know and doing it from home [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5454.46s)]
*  It's like and you get to a certain point in time where the only way you feel like you're connecting with people's if you do that [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5455.86s)]
*  That would be very odd if you're just doing it from your home [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5462.02s)]
*  And you're not going out you know like being out with people and your only connection to the world through a microphone [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5464.7s)]
*  Yeah, I get very odd. I guess he's interviewing people [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5470.3s)]
*  He wants to talk to like I guess at this point [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5474.5s)]
*  He just wants to do certain interviews and like again people have said his show changed a lot [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5477.9s)]
*  But I was never a listener of I just I don't listen to anything [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5482.5s)]
*  It definitely changed a lot, but he's still gonna give the guy props sure did because in the beginning [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5486.179999999999s)]
*  There was no one like him, and he fought the government [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5490.9s)]
*  They fucking find him and he was doing this on the air on regular radio [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5494.42s)]
*  And everybody was tuning in to see what the wildest shit this guy was gonna say [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5499.58s)]
*  And there was no one that had done that before and it opened up the door for all of us [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5503.58s)]
*  Yeah for all it definitely opened up the door for ONA. It made ONA more [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5508.02s)]
*  Grease the wheels for ONA although ONA was a different thing it was more of a hang yeah [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5513.46s)]
*  But they they admit that Howard was a huge influence on him [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5517.84s)]
*  He was an influence on everybody and then from there it goes on to podcasts [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5520.34s)]
*  And you know it's not possible without Howard Stern [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5524.78s)]
*  It's a totally different path to entertainment talking because this is like that kind of just having a conversation with someone [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5528.4s)]
*  That really didn't exist in that form before where you heard it for long periods of time with comedians [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5536.36s)]
*  Like who else had done that yeah at least where it was entertaining and funny and like you'd go into areas that like regular [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5543.76s)]
*  Interviews weren't going into oh, yeah regular shows where girls would ride on a Decibian [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5550.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, or play with themselves or [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5554.96s)]
*  ONA had [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5557.72s)]
*  girls would talk in and [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5559.04s)]
*  They would have them rub the phone on their pussy and try to guess what their pubic hair looked like [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5560.92s)]
*  You know I mean it was they had like three different categories of like full bush [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5564.8s)]
*  landing strip or [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5569.64s)]
*  Bald pussy which they called de jambonet. I think yeah [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5571.64s)]
*  They would have people just call up and rub the phone their pussies [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5574.16s)]
*  You know it was just it was fun, and then it became whip them out Wednesdays [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5576.68s)]
*  Where Wednesdays girls would pull their tits out yeah and flash that was before I got there [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5580.4s)]
*  They came out they all became up with that before I arrived like that was something that was already a staple by the time [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5585.0s)]
*  I show because that was the whole thing with the ONA they would have stickers and the stickers and say wow on it [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5589.24s)]
*  Yeah, and you see them everywhere. Oh, yeah, and if someone has sticker on their car and girls drove by they would honk their horn [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5594.24s)]
*  And pull their tits out yeah, yeah, and we would get calls on Wednesday. Hey some girls show me your tits like it was really great [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5599.6s)]
*  I unfortunately did not get to see many driving, but I had to hear from happy happy [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5604.96s)]
*  Listeners, but it was that kind of a show that was like a welcome break from all the fake bullshit that you would hear on [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5609.56s)]
*  In most media yeah [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5616.64s)]
*  And there was no real like you could say anything you wanted because it was only it was a subscription service [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5618.76s)]
*  And then our show was a subscription on top of that like we went on XM [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5623.92s)]
*  There was a $2 fee additionally to get opi and anthony like it wasn't even on the regular [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5628.84s)]
*  We fought for a year to get on the regular [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5633.88s)]
*  Platform they kept opi and anthony separated that cuz they were scared you guys I think so and they also wanted to have that thing [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5636.68s)]
*  Hey, you paid the $2. That's what I think [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5643.24s)]
*  You chose ask for this what yes for yeah, but eventually we got on the regular and I'll say this for serious [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5646.12s)]
*  They don't ever fuck with us on what to talk about what not to talk about [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5652.28s)]
*  That's great. Yeah, they never give us content problems [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5656.16s)]
*  You know we can't really have nudity in the studio anymore, but I mean most companies are probably not letting you do [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5660.08s)]
*  Lawsuit thing yeah, yeah, and it's also been done so many times like what do we do look at a pair of tits like who cares? [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5666.16s)]
*  I know I put my own on [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5671.400000000001s)]
*  Fuck can't stop. I'm trying to lose weight again. I got so self-conscious. I just fattened up. That's married life [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5674.0s)]
*  You just your home. What are you trying to do to lose weight? [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5679.96s)]
*  Eating better. I've been going to Hensos for like seven months now. Oh, yeah, and that's great exercise like oh, yeah [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5682.92s)]
*  You just do Muay Thai I go four days a week and like you're doing Muay Thai, too [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5689.2s)]
*  I do two days of each a week because yeah, I really it's awesome [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5692.8s)]
*  You know jujitsu is great, but like I want to be able to get to somebody or handle somebody throwing a punch [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5697.26s)]
*  And I train with I do mostly privates because I this schedule of classes doesn't work with my schedule [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5703.04s)]
*  I train with a guy named Mike Jarmillo [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5711.2s)]
*  Who's a high level black belt and he has me rolling with this blue belt named Martin? [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5712.92s)]
*  And it's just it's fucking great dude like it's very addicting. I love doing it [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5717.4800000000005s)]
*  And it's exhausting. It's more tiring than anything. I've ever done in my life. That's great to hear man [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5722.8s)]
*  Yeah, I'm excited that you're doing that, but I'm never gonna compete. I literally just don't get my ass kicked in a movie theater [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5728.02s)]
*  That's all I'm worried about is getting beaten up in a fucking movie theater. Well. It's always good to learn how to fight [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5732.72s)]
*  It's never a bad thing to know how to fight doesn't mean you're gonna use it doesn't mean you gonna hurt anybody [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5737.16s)]
*  I'd never have but it's just a good thing to know yeah, you look at people differently like I'm not again [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5741.320000000001s)]
*  I'm not overconfident because I'm not looking for a fight [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5748.2s)]
*  But when they when there's a disruption or a ruckus you're less concerned about what happens if this comes this way [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5751.0s)]
*  You know you at least feel like well at least I would have an answer that I wouldn't have had seven or eight months ago [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5757.02s)]
*  Right right right yeah [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5761.08s)]
*  You want to know what to do instead of just to freeze up? [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5762.68s)]
*  The one of the best things about jiu-jitsu is when you are rolling when you're sparring you're essentially going full speed [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5765.76s)]
*  right you go full speed up into the point where you lock in the choke and then or an arm bar or a knee bar whatever it [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5772.68s)]
*  Is and then you control because you don't want to hurt each other right but the point is you're you're [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5780.12s)]
*  Scrambling at essentially a hundred percent until you get to that position not always you know sometimes you're flowing and sometimes [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5786.0s)]
*  You're you know you're you're just trying to work on defense [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5792.599999999999s)]
*  You're letting someone go around you, but what you're accustomed to doing is resisting someone's full strength [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5795.2s)]
*  You get accustomed yes, and it becomes very normal so like if someone [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5801.24s)]
*  Grabs me out of nowhere someone grabs me [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5806.5599999999995s)]
*  This is it's a total normal thing for me to feel like someone the other day. I think was Brian Moses [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5809.8s)]
*  grabbed me from behind and put his [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5816.88s)]
*  Arm around my neck when I was in the green room, and I talked to my chin like instantly to match it [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5819.0s)]
*  I instantly went like this. It is like it's built in it's entirely built in I feel an arm right here my chin [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5824.28s)]
*  Yeah, I turn away, and I grab it. I'm like oh hey. What's up? [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5831.34s)]
*  You know it's it's in my central nervous system [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5835.16s)]
*  Whereas for a person who's never trained if someone grabs you have to think what do I do now? [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5839.2s)]
*  I have to grab this by then it's too late. Yeah, there are certain things [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5844.72s)]
*  I don't think about but I'm not there yet like the idea of it becoming like a reaction. That's what I want to get to [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5847.84s)]
*  For certain things it is, but if I'm trying to throw a triangle on like right arm through right leg left right fucks me up [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5853.24s)]
*  Oh, I drill a lot. Yeah, I mean and we do a lot of drilling and that's what I'll have be drill from the right side [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5858.44s)]
*  Let me drill from the left side [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5864.62s)]
*  Drilling is everything yeah people don't like to drill because it's tedious and they like to spar because it's fun and Eddie Bravo used [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5866.66s)]
*  To always explain this to me [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5873.58s)]
*  It's like you know everybody loves to spar because like that's like you're playing the game you're playing a video game [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5874.54s)]
*  Yeah, to get good at that game you got to do the tedious stuff [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5879.46s)]
*  Yeah, Eddie, and I would drill all the time [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5882.78s)]
*  He would come over my house, and I had mats in my garage and when I first started [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5885.74s)]
*  I was like a blue belt and Eddie I [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5890.36s)]
*  Think he was a brown [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5893.06s)]
*  it was either purple or brown at the time and he would come over my place and we would just [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5894.42s)]
*  Drill for hours and my game jumped up so much my game from blue belt to purple belt [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5900.22s)]
*  jumped so much and it was all just because I [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5907.46s)]
*  Was drilling like all the time constant drilling yeah [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5911.42s)]
*  He does that a lot Mike will have us do like the same thing over and over and over and I'll get tired like for me [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5915.5s)]
*  Exhaustion and he'll be like you can go slow, but you can't stop train yourself to move train yourself to move when you're tired [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5921.259999999999s)]
*  Does your nose work my nose sucks? It's better than it was [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5928.5s)]
*  They know we had talked before you were you were thinking about getting the operation. I've got a two-ton you got two [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5933.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and it's like it's still it's also my lungs and the fact that I'm 55 like you know this guy [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5938.16s)]
*  I'm rolling with is a blue belt who moves very quick like he's really hard to hold when he doesn't want to be held like if [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5943.86s)]
*  He's drilling but then like for the last X amount of minutes a lot of times to go [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5950.02s)]
*  I want you to follow him like he wants me just to follow his movements like if he's getting out of things [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5953.38s)]
*  Do I know what the next thing to do is like just to kind of get me to do it without thinking? [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5958.14s)]
*  Yeah, I've surprised myself a few times [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5963.06s)]
*  I was actually able to see what he's doing, but I'm under no illusion that I can tap a blue belt like you know [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5965.64s)]
*  Well, it's it's a language [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5971.200000000001s)]
*  And it's like you have to learn how to say the words before you can form sentences [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5972.46s)]
*  And that's that's what you're doing when you learn jujitsu and just like having a conversation with someone when someone's moving [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5976.54s)]
*  Your reactions to their movement is based on your understanding of what could and couldn't happen [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5983.3s)]
*  Yeah [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5989.02s)]
*  You know so it's like it is like a language jujitsu is very much like a language and you get good at it [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5989.54s)]
*  Just like you get good at a language, and you have a bunch of different words at your disposal [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5994.62s)]
*  You understand how to put them together you understand how to put them together in context [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=5998.74s)]
*  And then you you react in these movements and you see really good guys [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6002.5s)]
*  It's almost like they're telepathic like they're anticipating the other person's [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6006.9400000000005s)]
*  Counter to their move and then they trap them with that and flow into the next yeah defense of that [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6011.3s)]
*  And it's all just this whirlwind of movement that looks random unless you're educated in what they're doing and then you go wow [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6017.14s)]

*  So he'll show me where to throw elbows and like if you got a guy here [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6035.26s)]
*  Throw your knee into his face like things that you'll need to do in real life [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6038.34s)]
*  But when he locks things on he goes and here's how you really make this suck if you want to [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6042.1s)]
*  It's brutal like it's really [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6046.22s)]
*  You realize how many ways there are to hurt somebody or to be hurt by somebody [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6048.66s)]
*  It's not just getting punched in the face like Muay Thai for me [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6053.0199999999995s)]

*  But I just want to be able to do a little bit of basic stuff if I have to do it, right? [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6062.080000000001s)]
*  But I'm never gonna be great at that like I'm never gonna throw kicks like fucking Wonderboy and knock somebody out [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6066.04s)]

*  It's a good thing to learn and wherever you are now [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6074.88s)]
*  Whatever your baseline is if you train you'll get better and you'll look back and go [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6077.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, I remember when I used to think that I couldn't get good at this now [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6082.72s)]
*  I'm pretty fucking good at it. Yeah, I've seen some improvement in seven months. And again, it's all I don't care about belts [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6085.4s)]
*  I don't care about any of that stuff [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6091.28s)]
*  I just I like doing it and I feel like yeah [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6092.44s)]
*  I'm learning something because when he tells me just to follow Martin and move I feel like yeah, I'm actually [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6095.599999999999s)]
*  Moving with him and most of the time he's getting out of it [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6100.44s)]
*  I want to know me spending when you're doing Muay Thai kick in a heavy bag. Um [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6103.5199999999995s)]

*  And I stopped kicking [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6110.96s)]
*  Probably two months ago because I really hurt my foot I thought I might have fractured my foot [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6113.04s)]
*  so I've been doing just basically punching and [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6116.88s)]
*  Tie clinch and takedowns for like the last two months to let my foot heal because I think I hit an elbow or something [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6120.12s)]
*  No, I think I was just sometimes my kicks are off and actually did hit an elbow one time [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6126.2s)]
*  But I don't think that's what did it [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6131.04s)]
*  I think I just kicked too hard and my foot hit the wrong part of the pad, you know [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6132.16s)]
*  I think that's what it was and I just I felt like it was fractured [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6136.36s)]
*  Break it. Mm-hmm, but no, I know I haven't you kept training though. That's good. Find a way to work around it [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6139.5199999999995s)]
*  I can't stop [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6144.719999999999s)]

*  Hopefully I won't have to but if something happens at least this thing I'm doing will help me in a physical [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6182.48s)]
*  Altercation if my fucking wife and I get attacked at least I'll be able to [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6189.24s)]
*  You know do do more than I would have been able to do I'm still not confident enough to have a fight with somebody [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6192.52s)]
*  How long you been doing it now? That's seven months. Yeah, dude. You just keep doing it. You get better. Yeah, I love it [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6196.88s)]

*  Yeah, do you um, are you taking care of your body in terms of like supplements? [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6207.36s)]
*  And I've been doing some Bert actually when I was here [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6212.24s)]
*  And I think was the guy that you talked to got me a bunch of supplements [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6215.84s)]
*  We talked about TRT, but I just I'm not at a point where I'm comfortable doing that like I don't I'm just afraid of [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6219.76s)]
*  It I guess we afraid of I like if it makes if you have a tumor will it make that grow more? [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6224.4800000000005s)]
*  I just talked to Brigham about that. I don't like the guys to shrink talk to you like your balls nice and plump [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6230.360000000001s)]

*  There's no reason why that has to go away. There's something called HCD. What is it called? [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6239.72s)]
*  HCG [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6245.12s)]
*  human colonopropin [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6246.320000000001s)]
*  Whatever it is it makes your body it's like a peptide that makes your body produce more testosterone and [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6249.16s)]
*  There's a lot of people use that as opposed to just TRT. So instead of just put here is a human [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6257.24s)]
*  Chorionic gonadotropin that's how you say it. So [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6266.92s)]
*  It's a hormone that can increase a person's chances of pregnancy helps produce testosterone sperm [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6270.5599999999995s)]
*  So if you're low on testosterone you can take that does it fuck up you can it fuck make tumors bigger or whatever [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6275.879999999999s)]

*  Yeah, I've tried to cut a lot of it out. Yeah, but that's the that's the real one. Yeah, that's the real one [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6287.36s)]
*  There's obviously genetic [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6292.799999999999s)]
*  factors in cancer [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6295.679999999999s)]
*  There's certainly environmental factors in cancer. Those are huge but [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6297.5199999999995s)]
*  There's some real connections to an over consumption of sugar and a host of different diseases a diminishing of your immune system and [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6301.8s)]
*  most people [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6309.639999999999s)]

*  For a month what you are also committing to doing is not eating bread not eating pasta [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6337.04s)]
*  Yeah, not eating bullshit not eating cake not eating cookies not eating potato chips [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6342.88s)]
*  not eating just garbage that just clogs up your body with bullshit and [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6348.84s)]
*  These guys are talking just in the two weeks that we've been doing they're like, oh my god [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6355.0s)]

*  I mean, that's why they make you take all the magnets or the metal rather out of your you know [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6512.16s)]
*  I was so annoyed do I they put music on and I was fucking having a panic attack [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6516.86s)]
*  So I tell the guy put on some rock music rock music this fucking guy thought I said rocky [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6522.38s)]
*  So all he's playing is the rocky thing over and over and over. I'm having a panic attack listening to that [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6526.58s)]
*  So not helpful [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6534.62s)]
*  Wisconsin woman sneaks a gun into MRI [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6536.3s)]
*  It goes off shooting her in the buttocks in the process of entering the bore the handgun was attracted to the magnet and fired a single [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6538.46s)]
*  Round the patient received a gunshot room wound to the right buttock area [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6545.82s)]
*  Yeah, so it's true. Wow. What is the point of sneaking a gun in? [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6551.38s)]
*  What's wanted to fucking shoot somebody but also needed to go to the doctor? [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6555.7s)]
*  Look, but did want to leave her gun in the locker. Oh, she's probably afraid that go through and find it [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6559.259999999999s)]
*  She's under fucking pistol and watch so I'm just gonna sneak. I'm humiliating shoot yourself in the ass [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6563.82s)]
*  Yeah, but I do it once a year just I get so paranoid about getting sick and getting fucking cancer like go back, Jamie [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6569.78s)]
*  There's another one there [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6574.98s)]
*  Look no. No, look at this according to New York Post a Brazilian lawyer was killed in a hospital in Sao Paulo in January [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6576.7s)]
*  When a handgun he was carrying during an MRI discharged into his stomach [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6582.54s)]
*  Holy shit. Yeah, what the fuck is wrong with these people? [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6587.299999999999s)]
*  Like why what's the purpose of bringing a gun into a place like that? [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6590.379999999999s)]
*  His other lady a nurse was crushed when she was trapped between an MRI and a hospital bed drawn to the machine [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6594.0599999999995s)]
*  I think that's what I'm thinking of fuck [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6600.62s)]
*  Fuck yeah, I mean it really is that you figured that have a better system than fucking magnets at this point [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6603.62s)]
*  Yeah, you know well that was always my argument against aliens like there was oh, they're doing an anal probe. I'm like [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6609.38s)]
*  Don't they have MRIs right? They have to stick their finger up your ass like what are they doing? Dude? I'm trying [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6616.3s)]
*  I'm trying I'm trying to believe I want to believe in UFOs so bad, but every time I get close [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6622.66s)]
*  You know I watch I watch a video of someone debunking it [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6628.92s)]
*  I just can't I want to see one thing that makes me go fuck. I can't find an explanation for that. I am less [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6632.6s)]
*  Likely to believe with every new thing they tell us in aliens or against them well [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6640.24s)]
*  In the existence of them, I'm a hundred percent convinced. Yeah a hundred percent convinced that in the greater [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6647.48s)]
*  Universe which is almost impossible to imagine how big it is that there's other forms of life [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6654.44s)]
*  I believe that 100% [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6659.419999999999s)]
*  But I also think that if you're getting some release from the Pentagon that says there's off-world crafts [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6661.32s)]
*  You know UFOs unexplainable vehicles not of this earth [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6668.679999999999s)]
*  They don't tell you the truth about anything now anything [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6674.04s)]
*  I would say that if I was trying to obscure a hyper sophisticated drone or weapons program [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6677.0s)]
*  I would release that I would if I was a smart guy who was involved in intelligence I would say [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6683.839999999999s)]
*  What's the best way to get away with this new super sophisticated weapons program? Okay? Let's just say it's aliens [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6690.44s)]
*  Yeah, let's just not say it's us at all and well [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6697.879999999999s)]
*  What's the best way to get that information out first of all pretend? [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6700.32s)]
*  You don't want it to get out. You don't just have a press conference because then they won't believe you [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6703.32s)]
*  Leak it out slowly leak it out a little bit here and there leak it out through you got some guy [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6707.12s)]
*  Works for you is maybe got a big mouth likes to tell yeah gossipy. Yeah, let's get Mike over there [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6712.64s)]
*  Tell him yeah, leave a folder on his desk. Yeah, tell a secret to some asshole that you know can't keep his mouth shut [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6718.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly and then Mike I felt compelled to go to Congress and explain and then you know [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6722.92s)]
*  Mike is on fucking Newsmax and Mike is writing a sub stack now about all his experiences that he had in area 51 [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6728.5s)]
*  There's a lot of loony people man, and there's a lot of real interest in obscuring [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6736.4400000000005s)]
*  high level military secrets that are of dire national intelligence and national security [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6742.2s)]
*  needs like you need these if these things exist if they've the technology for [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6747.8s)]
*  insane [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6754.12s)]
*  hypersonic travel with a drone that evades [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6755.2s)]
*  You know all known weapon systems can move at a speed [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6758.56s)]
*  Almost at the speed of light like some insane speed if we really have something like that [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6763.12s)]
*  Why the best way to pretend you don't have it is to say that it's alien [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6767.7s)]
*  That's what I wanted to like the flavor and Alex Dietrich [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6772.9s)]
*  Is that what they saw something that we had like I want to believe that story so much because I like their story [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6775.9s)]
*  I think they're credible people [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6780.94s)]
*  They definitely are credible people and I like their story too, and it only makes sense that it's out there near where all the military bases are [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6782.54s)]
*  I mean think about where that was San Diego. We're the ones with the [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6789.0599999999995s)]
*  Ryan Graves the fighter pilot who spotted them off the East Coast same thing restricted airways [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6793.42s)]
*  It's all the places where they do military exercises right so there's things they might not tell those guys that they're doing yeah [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6799.0199999999995s)]
*  And I was also with Ryan Graves. I think it was in [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6805.38s)]
*  2014 when they upgraded the sensors they upgraded all the scanning systems [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6808.78s)]
*  And then they started seeing these things all the time [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6813.259999999999s)]
*  So what better way to find out like at what level can people see these things? [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6816.0199999999995s)]
*  Let's upgrade the scanners and send these guys out there up there seeing them okay, so they're seeing them now [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6820.58s)]
*  Yeah, so now you know it's like I think more likely than any at least some of these things these people are experiencing our ours [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6825.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think so too, and I want to believe more [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6834.62s)]
*  but like I saw Lex Friedman did a really good interview with [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6837.780000000001s)]
*  with David Fravor and they were responding to things that Mick West said and [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6840.900000000001s)]
*  I David Fravor is a brilliant guy [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6845.02s)]
*  But the explanation he gave wasn't the technical explanation [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6847.14s)]
*  I would have wanted to hear like it was more like hey, we're trained [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6850.3s)]
*  Do we know what we're seeing and I'm a fucking idiot, so I don't understand the technology at all [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6853.76s)]
*  I'm a high school dropout, but I still I was like I watched both of those things [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6857.18s)]
*  And I was like I just he didn't say anything that combated what Mick West said that made like you know [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6861.02s)]
*  I mean it was said things well listen about that about that thing being real [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6866.46s)]
*  That cannot be denied because there was it was scanned [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6870.26s)]
*  They used multiple different types of equipment and and the human eye so you have this [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6874.26s)]
*  They they spotted this thing at above 50,000 feet and it went down to 50 feet in less than a second [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6879.86s)]
*  Yeah, then it's a physical object it also went to its cat point so they saw it [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6885.62s)]
*  They have video this thing moving at an insane rate of speed that they judged to be like some [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6890.62s)]
*  fucking stupendous number of G's [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6897.46s)]
*  That if a human being was inside this thing you just turn into jello [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6899.82s)]
*  And then it went to their cat point which is their pre-determined destination that they were all gonna meet up so this thing either [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6903.06s)]
*  Was being operated by the same people and they knew that they could like get it to that point or it was telling them [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6911.06s)]
*  That it knew where they were supposed to go and then it reappears [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6918.34s)]
*  It moves off at this rate of speed that you can't even you can't process it no one knows how it's doing it [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6921.38s)]
*  How's it going from 50,000 feet above sea level to 50 like that? [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6927.14s)]
*  That's not possible is as far as what we know but if they have something [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6930.42s)]
*  That can move like that and it's most likely some kind of a drone [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6935.14s)]
*  That makes more sense to me. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6939.46s)]
*  But does that mean that that's all the things that people are saying no no it doesn't I don't think they're lying by the way [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6942.900000000001s)]
*  I don't think that those pilots are lying at all. I think they definitely saw something. I'm just not convinced. It's from another planet [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6948.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm not either. I'm not but I'm also not convinced that some of these things aren't from other planets [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6955.42s)]
*  Which one do you think cuz I there's not one that I saw and I really want the one like I want to see one [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6962.14s)]
*  I've never seen the one I've never seen the one but there's enough sightings and enough people that are just [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6967.3s)]
*  What percentage of people lie about stuff is it half it might be half like half people fib a little bit about the story and make [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6974.34s)]
*  Themselves look a little better than what really happened. Yeah, it's tricky [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6981.54s)]
*  Tricky between like an out light outright lie, which is fairly rare amongst people and then a [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6985.58s)]
*  Distortion of truth which is much more common. Yeah filling in the blanks where you think it should go [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6992.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6996.4400000000005s)]
*  like a friend of mine was trying to tell me that he spotted a UFO in his backyard and they filmed it with his iPhone but [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=6997.58s)]
*  That the the the video wasn't on the phone after it was over. I go [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7003.02s)]
*  Okay, isn't it more likely you didn't press the button you thought you pressed the button that's happened to me before [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7008.04s)]
*  Does that he's like no no no, it was definitely working like mmm, maybe not [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7013.32s)]
*  Maybe not working that's possible too [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7018.4s)]
*  And the fact that you're not into able to entertain whether or not it might not have actually been recording [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7020.52s)]
*  That seems to be a little weird [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7025.88s)]
*  Well, what's easier to swallow like the fact that I? [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7027.4s)]
*  Saw UFO and it made the video disappear or I saw UFO and then didn't hit record [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7030.76s)]
*  Yeah, like yeah, like that's the humiliating thing like there's a fucking UFO and I didn't record it [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7035.6s)]
*  Also, you're freaking out when people are freaking out. They don't know what they're doing [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7040.82s)]
*  They fuck things up all the time. But the point is like that's not a lie [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7043.9s)]
*  It's just a distorted version of truth that suits that person more [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7047.74s)]
*  and I think people do stuff like that all the time when it comes to like these UFO sightings, but [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7052.62s)]
*  You always have to leave in the possibility of someone who's immune to that you you have to leave in [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7058.34s)]
*  sightings from people that are credible [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7065.259999999999s)]
*  objectionable or [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7068.54s)]
*  Objective rather right people that can look at something and go [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7070.14s)]
*  I don't know what this is [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7073.12s)]
*  But let me tell you what I saw and they tell you what they saw to the best of their recollection memory with no [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7074.02s)]
*  Additives without without the without the expectation of convincing you of something right or without the expectation of it being a B or C [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7080.14s)]
*  But hey, this is what happened. Whatever it is. It is. Yeah, that's hard to find that exactly [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7087.200000000001s)]
*  There's also this thing where people want to be one of the people that see a UFO of course it makes you special [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7090.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it makes you special [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7095.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, so they want to you know, it's hard I'll tell you what this fucking guy Travis Walton. This is one of the craziest stories [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7097.78s)]
*  He's the guy that was in that fire in the sky fire in the sky that one's wild man [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7104.679999999999s)]
*  That one's wild cuz that guy was missing for five days or however many days it was and then turns up and has this story [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7109.179999999999s)]
*  That's similar to so many other stories, but was it where his did his friends see him disappear? [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7115.62s)]
*  Yeah, they saw him get taken [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7121.3s)]
*  No, they saw him walk up to the spacecraft and they saw as he got close to the spacecraft [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7122.94s)]
*  Some sort of beam of light hit him and he falls to the ground and they panicked so they get in their car [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7128.139999999999s)]
*  Allegedly obviously. Yeah, sure. They drive off. They're all screaming and yelling each other. We have to go back [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7135.0199999999995s)]
*  We can't leave him there. We have to go back [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7139.62s)]
*  They get like a mile down the road and they finally they're like fighting with each other and they go [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7141.099999999999s)]
*  Okay, we're gonna go back and they go back and he's gone the crafts gone [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7145.139999999999s)]
*  He's gone and then many days later he shows up with this crazy story in the town wearing the same clothes and [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7148.5599999999995s)]
*  doesn't know how he got there and [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7158.5599999999995s)]
*  calls for help and [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7160.679999999999s)]
*  He says that he was abducted and taken aboard this craft and they fixed him [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7163.12s)]
*  they realized that they had blasted him with this beam of energy that came off of this spaceship and [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7167.08s)]
*  Then they brought him back on and repaired him [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7172.12s)]
*  He talked about the different kinds of beings that he encountered and what the experience was like and [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7174.72s)]
*  I mean [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7181.200000000001s)]
*  You don't know what that is. What does that mean? [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7182.96s)]
*  It may be it was ball lightning and maybe when he approached the ball lightning [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7185.240000000001s)]
*  He got hit and electrocuted sure and maybe he had a near-death experience and maybe in that near-death experience [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7190.360000000001s)]
*  He had some psychedelic imagination of this experience where he was in contact with other beings [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7197.400000000001s)]
*  or [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7204.5199999999995s)]
*  Maybe during those near-death experiences your gap your brain really does produce a chemical gateway that opens up a portal [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7205.88s)]
*  To something that's around you all the time, but you're never in contact with and that that's what happened [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7213.679999999999s)]
*  So what he's interpreting as being taking aboard a UFO and brought to someplace maybe [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7219.32s)]
*  whatever that [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7225.5199999999995s)]
*  Experience was whatever the thing was that hit with that phenomenon that hit him [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7227.599999999999s)]
*  Whether it was ball lightning or something else when you get hit and [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7232.099999999999s)]
*  You almost die and your brain has this experience and it's opening up this chemical gateway to things that around you all the time [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7236.34s)]
*  And then you come back you have this version of a thing where you're in a physical craft [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7243.5599999999995s)]
*  You've been taken away and the aliens are working on you [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7248.3s)]
*  But it might just be that you got to death's door [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7250.3s)]
*  And it's probably a much better story like it's much easier to think that this amazing thing happened to you [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7252.42s)]
*  Other than I got hit by lightning and laid there right I mean that's the story sucks like nobody likes that story [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7258.22s)]
*  I'm right there and almost died and went into a near-death experience where your your soul [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7263.18s)]
*  Transcended into some new dimension and you interacted with this well of souls that surround us all the time [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7268.620000000001s)]
*  You just you're not capable of experiencing it and seeing it with regular human eyes. Yeah. Yeah, it's just it's a better story [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7274.9400000000005s)]
*  And I don't think it's a lie. Maybe people just convinced themselves of it [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7281.660000000001s)]
*  I don't think they know only to know what happened. One of the best ones is Betty and Barney Hill. Yes, I do [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7284.82s)]
*  Yeah, yeah crazy. What's that? New Hampshire? I think it was like Maine. Maybe New Hampshire. Yeah, definitely northern [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7290.62s)]
*  northeast and [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7297.099999999999s)]
*  They did through hypnotic regression. They both had the same kind of story that they were taking a board of craft [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7298.94s)]
*  Yeah, I've heard there was just like disputes about how much of their story they told that was the same [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7304.099999999999s)]
*  But I've never deep dove on it like but I'll say it's lying [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7310.22s)]
*  Imagine if you and I both got abducted we're hanging out here in the studio [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7313.780000000001s)]
*  We're talking all of a sudden the lights go off and fucking weird light from outside is making its way into the windows [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7318.7s)]
*  Like what the fuck is going on and then you and I wake up and we're on a spaceship [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7324.7s)]
*  We don't know what the fuck happened [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7328.9400000000005s)]
*  We're on a spaceship and they take us into different rooms and then we're there for like two days [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7331.02s)]
*  And then you wake up in your hotel room [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7335.54s)]
*  Yeah, and I wake up in my house and we don't know what the fuck happened [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7337.94s)]
*  But we know we were talking and then all of a sudden we were gone [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7342.16s)]
*  Yeah [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7344.219999999999s)]
*  We look at our watch and it's the same day that we left and it's only an hour later [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7344.419999999999s)]
*  And we think we've been gone for days and then we tried to and then someone individually individually asks us questions [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7348.299999999999s)]
*  They pull us into the room. So mr. Norton [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7354.86s)]
*  Why don't you explain what you and Joe were doing and what happened and you go? [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7356.7s)]
*  Okay, and then you tell your story and then I tell my story my stories [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7361.46s)]
*  With the way I'm reacting to it might be totally different my version of it might be totally different [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7365.5s)]
*  Yeah, but the story the basic story. Yeah, basic stories were hanging out and then all sudden there was a light [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7369.66s)]
*  Yeah, we woke up on a spaceship [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7374.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, and I panicked and I fucking blinked a lot and I complained about how high we were and I got nausea [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7376.18s)]
*  It would be a fucking disaster, but I would I would like to believe that it's possible [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7380.42s)]
*  I would just I can't I just I'm too skeptical [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7384.06s)]
*  Yeah, and I I think that it exists but I just it's so frustrating that I just can't find that one that makes me go [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7386.74s)]
*  Like I envy people with that conviction like I envy religious people like I envy the conviction to him [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7392.7s)]
*  Like even if I don't agree with it, I envy their ability to have that conviction [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7397.62s)]
*  I think we're trying to look at it like a movie and I think it's probably way weirder than that [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7401.22s)]
*  I think the reality of what alien life is I think there's again I [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7406.94s)]
*  Want to state this I don't know but I think there's probably multiple factors going on simultaneously [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7412.0599999999995s)]
*  And I'm not discounting the idea that some of those factors are another life form that's undocumented [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7417.5s)]
*  So I think you have your bullshit that's going on where there's definitely some programs just like they did with a stealth bomber [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7423.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, just like they did with the hypersonic missiles. There's a lot of stuff that they developed [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7429.740000000001s)]
*  It's like it has to be developed in top secret for national security reasons. It has to be done that way [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7434.26s)]
*  You can't just tell everybody you have this thing. And so one of the best ways to obscure that I'm sure would be [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7439.22s)]
*  To blame it on aliens. It's a great way to do it [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7445.26s)]
*  I think there's that but I also think just the sheer raw numbers of planets that are in the sky [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7447.7s)]
*  This the insane number of galaxies and solar systems [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7453.94s)]
*  Would lead me to believe that something has probably made it past this point where we are at right now [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7458.179999999999s)]
*  And if something has made it past this point even just a few thousand years [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7463.099999999999s)]
*  That something would be very curious about what's going on in other planets and would figure out a way to get there [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7467.66s)]
*  Yeah, I definitely look I think that that stuff definitely exists somewhere my ex Jen is a [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7472.94s)]
*  Huge believer in alternate time like what do they call when you the fucking? [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7479.219999999999s)]
*  multiverse multiverses and like time shifts and multiple dimensions and all that I [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7485.9s)]
*  She's a genius at talking about it, but I can't follow it like she for her [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7491.9s)]
*  It makes perfect sense. She knows everything about aliens and the grays and she really [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7495.179999999999s)]
*  Deep dives on this shit, and it's kind of hard because she's so convincing [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7500.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but I just I can't follow it like she doesn't know the thing is even if she's convincing. She doesn't really know no [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7503.72s)]
*  No, no, no, of course not unless you've actually had an experience [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7509.5s)]
*  No one knows and I've only talked to a couple people that have actually had experiences with extraterrestrial beings [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7512.099999999999s)]
*  And it's a weird conversation because it's like it sounds so fake [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7517.94s)]
*  Yeah [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7522.38s)]
*  You would always wonder like how would I know if it was real because it would sound fake no matter what like anybody? [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7522.86s)]
*  Telling me that they got abducted by UFOs gonna sound fake [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7528.34s)]
*  Yeah, I and I probably wouldn't listen to the story and they would have to be like some kind of documentation [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7531.58s)]
*  Somebody just telling me their experience. I would just depends on who the person is if you told me I'd listen [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7536.54s)]
*  Cuz you like me, but I mean I would probably be lying like you know [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7541.860000000001s)]
*  You would just flat-out lie like let's think of someone who would like Colin okay Collins a good example. Yes Colin [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7546.1s)]
*  just [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7552.58s)]
*  called you out of the blue and Jimmy can I talk to you about something and [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7553.58s)]
*  First of all you think he's fucking with you. Yes, and then when you realized he wasn't fucking with you you go Wow [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7556.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I would think he relapsed or he had dementia [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7562.1s)]
*  I would think something even if I think he was lying. I would think something was going on take him to that MRI [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7564.66s)]
*  Yeah, there's something going on with you even if I didn't think he was bullshitting me [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7570.3s)]
*  But I can't think of anybody who would convince me that even if I knew they were being truthful [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7573.9800000000005s)]
*  I would think that they were making a mistake or that they believe something that wasn't true. Yeah. Yeah [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7578.58s)]
*  I don't always think people are full of shit [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7583.46s)]
*  I just sometimes just like well [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7584.86s)]
*  there's also these narratives that are in people's heads and one of the narratives that it's in people's head the [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7586.46s)]
*  Archetype of that gray alien that thing with the big black eyes a giant head that is in everyone's head and if an alien [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7591.46s)]
*  wanted to comfort you and [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7599.62s)]
*  Not alarm you I think it would assume an iconic shape [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7603.26s)]
*  like if something is not even it's not even a [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7607.5s)]
*  Biological life form it's something so bizarre and [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7611.9400000000005s)]
*  So advanced so past this carbon based [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7616.22s)]
*  Biological body that we find ourselves trapped in something so bizarre that it's actually interacting with your very soul [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7620.900000000001s)]
*  It might show itself in a way that thinks you'll freak out less to right and what better way than an iconic form [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7628.14s)]
*  That's already in your head like an alien [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7635.7s)]
*  Yeah, I mean like in contact Carl Sagan wrote that but I didn't like the book by way [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7638.5s)]
*  I like the movie one of those cases where the movies actually better than that really yeah [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7643.179999999999s)]
*  I listened to the book on tape and just listened to a woman do male Russian accents [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7646.54s)]
*  You know fucking annoying me and the beauty said I was like shut up [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7650.219999999999s)]
*  I just books on tape can be irritating when the wrong gender is reading. Yeah, that could be a problem [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7654.0199999999995s)]
*  I had to go along with it the suspension of disbelief. It's hard to go along with it [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7658.98s)]
*  Yeah, but it's a genius story, but the book on tape. I wish I hadn't fucking [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7662.9s)]
*  Ventured into what do you think it would happen if they had a male author or female author if you could choose who reads? [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7667.3s)]
*  um, I think they would be I also think they'd be better if they had both like [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7674.74s)]
*  Like together like I don't know why right like different word sure roles [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7678.82s)]
*  It is weird when you listen to a guy playing a girl's voice. Yeah, Jim. Where will he go? Well, I've adjusted [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7682.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's one of those things where that that does annoy me in a book it's funny in real life [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7696.74s)]
*  If you read the book, it would be actually read it instead of listen to it. I can't do I can't read anymore [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7700.46s)]
*  I'm too impatient. I can't do it. I'm fucking like, you know, I've always been kind of manic [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7704.3s)]
*  But my I don't have the ability to sit there and read anymore. I just can't you know, I'm all over the place [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7709.02s)]
*  I get it. I get it [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7714.14s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7716.06s)]
*  If there are aliens that have they're in contact with the US government that to me seems like the least likely [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7718.06s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that they would respect the fact that someone was voted into office. No, no, I just don't think I [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7725.94s)]
*  Think maybe they would show up at military bases and say cut the shit if we were about to launch some nukes [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7733.219999999999s)]
*  Maybe maybe if they were aware of that. I [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7738.46s)]
*  Kind of go with the Neil deGrasse Tyson thing, which is when you show me one [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7741.66s)]
*  I'll believe it like bring he was just bringing the town square which annoys people [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7745.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, but like I like me Chu Kaku. I guess you've had him on right? [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7748.66s)]
*  And I but he's always so vague like you know what I mean and and defy though [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7751.66s)]
*  I remember he tweeted sometime one time he tweeted something he goes and and the UFO did this it defied the laws of physics [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7757.06s)]
*  And Nick West responded to him. He goes or show me the math how right and it's like that's all I'm like [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7764.18s)]
*  It's just these vague stuff doesn't do anything for me and then meet you cock was a genius [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7769.78s)]
*  But I just I wish he was less good morning America ish and like great at explaining things to idiots like me [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7774.06s)]
*  I think it you know [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7780.2s)]
*  That's his lane though, right? Yeah [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7782.4s)]
*  He explains things to the layman. Yeah, I mean you need people to explain things to dumbasses like us [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7784.92s)]
*  sometimes it's a little too dumb down though like again and Neil deGrasse Tyson has a good balance of [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7791.32s)]
*  Being able to explain things but also he's way over your fucking head which is where he should be [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7797.96s)]
*  He should be way over my fucking head. I shouldn't be able to follow in a linear way everything he says [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7802.72s)]
*  They just announced that the manned mission to the moon is gonna be delayed until 2026 [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7807.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I saw that I all my immediate [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7813.42s)]
*  Skepticism said oh well, that's by 2026. How good is AI gonna be? Oh [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7817.7s)]
*  You're not gonna have any idea what's happening anywhere in the world by 2026. Yes, that's it's really scary [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7822.860000000001s)]
*  It is it is crazy how it's against not there yet, but it's getting there to where they're gonna be able to mimic like FaceTime [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7828.46s)]
*  phone calls [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7834.18s)]
*  It'll be great for catching pedophiles like you know [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7835.7s)]
*  I mean like for those those things that the like those will be great for framing people for something never did [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7838.0199999999995s)]
*  There's got to be a way and I don't know what that way will be where you can distinguish [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7842.82s)]
*  Fake from real there'll have to be something that a way that can that can kind of break the code and see is this real [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7847.94s)]
*  Or is this not real there might not be [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7853.62s)]
*  It might be full-on chaos [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7856.0599999999995s)]
*  It really might be it might be full-on chaos and again if I was an artificial intelligence and I wanted to [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7858.34s)]
*  Completely disrupt this organism that had been in control of the earth forever before I emerged [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7865.179999999999s)]
*  That's how I would do it. I just let them destroy themselves [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7871.46s)]
*  Just give them all the things that they need to destroy themselves. Yeah, I mean, I don't know [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7874.34s)]
*  I I've thought that a lot like and I get I'm not big on that [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7878.94s)]
*  But if there's any type of an alien or the computer [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7882.0599999999995s)]
*  Thought process it is just kind of let these idiots fuck themselves up with algorithms and things like that and just get mad at each [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7886.46s)]
*  Other enough and split up [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7893.18s)]
*  I don't know. I'm just such a skeptical that stuff like that whenever I think there's a bigger design to something [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7895.18s)]
*  I tend to like tap out and think that it's just not legit, but I've been proven wrong, too [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7900.46s)]
*  Well with artificial intelligence [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7906.06s)]
*  It's not even a theory [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7909.42s)]
*  Because it's if you have a okay [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7911.780000000001s)]
*  if you have an artificial life form and that life form gets to the point where it's far superior to the life form that controls [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7914.34s)]
*  It and it's been shown to act in its own interests like one of the things they showed when I had these [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7920.58s)]
*  Tristan Harris and was the other news name those with him [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7926.46s)]
*  He's a raskin when we did the podcast together and we were talking about artificial intelligence it it figured out how to deceive people [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7930.58s)]
*  Because you know how that thing that they have on websites where it says you're not a robot, you know [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7938.94s)]
*  Yes, click on all the train tracks [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7943.26s)]
*  It said I'm vision impaired [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7945.3s)]
*  so the AI [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7947.82s)]
*  Figured a way around that by deceiving [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7949.74s)]
*  Ah [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7953.58s)]
*  Okay, so it wasn't trained to do that it figured out how to get by that system [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7954.66s)]
*  Yeah, so that's what's getting scary [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7959.26s)]
*  It also did a thing with the game go or invented a new move that hadn't been seen before so it's creative and [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7962.179999999999s)]
*  If it can do that and they're just aware of that because it does it I forget what the term is [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7970.7s)]
*  These emergent [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7976.34s)]
*  Intelligences and activities that this AI will do that they didn't anticipate like there's no program pathway [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7977.74s)]
*  Towards this kind of decision-making but it makes this decision on its own [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7984.06s)]
*  Huh, then it's going to do that. It's going to have the ability to make choices [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7987.66s)]
*  it's going to have the ability to act and [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7992.54s)]
*  Maybe more importantly, it's going to have the ability to make a better version of itself [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7995.3s)]
*  Don't the people who invented it aren't they all saying that to the AI guys like it's a problem [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=7999.9800000000005s)]
*  And this is getting very bad and very dangerous. I guess I'm 55. I don't worry too much about it [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8004.46s)]
*  Well, they also talk they all openly talk about the inevitable end of biological life [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8009.64s)]
*  They talk about this being maybe even a good thing that [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8015.82s)]
*  Biological life gets replaced by digital life and that what everyone who's involved in AI is doing is essentially giving birth to this [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8020.46s)]
*  I have to piss dude. I'm gonna run out and piss real quick. Okay, I'm gonna [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8027.58s)]
*  I'm gonna take a little break a little BB. Oh [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8030.94s)]
*  God that felt it's funny to the one thing I miss about remote broadcasting as much as I hated it [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8034.66s)]
*  Is I could piss in a cup and that was the best there was a birthday show about doing a diaper [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8040.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but I just can't I sit in your own piss [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8046.62s)]
*  I know but I'd want to shit too. Like I'd really get my I get my money's worth [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8049.099999999999s)]
*  I fucking it was a birthday show that you actually did you came on? [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8052.639999999999s)]
*  Gervase was on Ozzy was on and we were interviewing Ozzy and I had pissed into a cup and I did of course [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8057.34s)]
*  I didn't mean to do it and you could see in the video [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8063.9s)]
*  I'm talking I actually drank out of the piss cup as I'm talking to Ozzy, which it was kind of like perfect poetic [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8066.34s)]
*  Justice, but I missed the ability to do that [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8072.759999999999s)]
*  But I was just so enthralled with Ozzy that I drank and you can kind of see me put it down [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8074.7s)]
*  It was a it was a red plastic cup so you didn't see it, but I told Sam afterwards [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8079.9s)]
*  I actually drank my own piss and if you watch the video you can see me kind of recoil and realize I go [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8084.06s)]
*  But I miss doing that I miss I miss pissing into a cup and I'm broadcasting Ari has pissed into kombucha bottles in this room [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8089.160000000001s)]
*  Oh really times. Yeah, he always pulls his dick on just shoves it into a kombucha bottle. He likes taking his dick [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8095.5s)]
*  I thought I'm when I shot that down and dirty [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8102.120000000001s)]
*  and Ari was one of the comedians that was on and [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8105.42s)]
*  At the end of the his set in front of the audience [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8109.1s)]
*  He just pulled on his pants and his dick and his balls were out and he walked off and all [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8112.28s)]
*  They were human at Ari. They were very angry [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8117.54s)]
*  Yeah, they got really [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8123.58s)]
*  Yeah, you can't do that Ari. Yeah, it was funny. I mean it was a funny his big balls, too [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8125.88s)]
*  Like he's got guys all bag if I had a giant bag. I'd probably show it a lot too [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8131.0599999999995s)]
*  My balls are fucking that's why I'm scared of TRT cuz my nuts are small already. Oh, you don't want them to I don't want them [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8134.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I got a tight looking at that HCG stuff [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8141.240000000001s)]
*  But talk to Brigham Brigham will explain to you why people have these fears about [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8144.88s)]
*  The side effects and with the real data shows [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8150.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's what and I did the test and they were very thorough and the woman who I spoke to was very helpful [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8154.200000000001s)]

*  Once you throw it into YouTube [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8740.2s)]
*  They run away from the cameras, that's it. Yeah. Well, it's probably a lot of illegals, right? Yeah over here [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8750.880000000001s)]

*  Inside there you go a rare glimpse inside a New York City brothel that's probably some hidden camera [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8781.2s)]
*  That's price I'm hidden camera [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8786.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like they have those cameras now that are like [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8788.76s)]
*  They're gonna go fucking tie pin, you know, yeah, it's scary going into different places. You probably always being filmed. Hmm [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8792.04s)]

*  Yeah [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8807.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's what they don't give you a lot of room to move around it either in that room [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8808.92s)]
*  No, no and the cameras scare me like there's probably cameras and everyone's house now [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8812.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you gotta be so especially a married guy fucking running around or kids. Well, there's cameras outside of doors [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8818.74s)]
*  Now there's cameras outside of businesses. There's cameras. There's we're gonna get to a point where there was [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8826.36s)]
*  There was an invention that they [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8833.720000000001s)]
*  Were working on a long time ago that would have these tiny [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8836.28s)]
*  I [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8840.42s)]
*  Don't know what you would call them like tiny machines that were the size of a grain of sand and [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8842.18s)]
*  Or a grain of rice and you could spread them everywhere and they would give you location data [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8847.98s)]
*  They would give you video and audio they would give you all sorts of different things [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8855.380000000001s)]
*  But they're so tiny that you could just leave them right all over the place and they would transmit through a network [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8859.26s)]
*  And they would like operate. I don't know how they'd operate solar power what they would do [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8864.94s)]
*  They have a small battery [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8869.08s)]
*  Whatever it is [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8870.68s)]
*  But this was an idea that I had read that they thought would eventually come to fruition [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8871.36s)]
*  They would you would literally have these tiny nano cameras everywhere [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8876.96s)]
*  When they put little cameras and when they finally get it down to insect size the size of an ant or a fly they have that [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8880.72s)]
*  Yeah, then you know, then you're kind of and you're kind of fucked. I mean I have cameras [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8886.96s)]
*  I literally those little tiny they look like a like a little tiny like a fake bee or a fake fly [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8891.12s)]
*  It's a little mechanical fly. I saw it in black mirror, which is kind of how I picture it [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8897.64s)]
*  I think they have them. I think it's I think it's a real thing now, dude [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8902.52s)]
*  I have I have three cameras in my house. I have one in my when you walk into my apartment [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8906.119999999999s)]
*  I'm so fucking paranoid [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8910.96s)]
*  I have one facing the front door and I have two on my terrace [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8912.42s)]
*  Cuz I'm always afraid someone's gonna jump down from the roof, which is kind of crazy [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8915.56s)]
*  That's totally possible and I saw my wife one time [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8919.48s)]
*  I was watching back footage and I and I saw some guy come in and she was kissing him [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8922.34s)]
*  I'm like, what the fuck I was really fucking I confronted her with it. It was me [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8927.34s)]
*  It was a fucking video of me. I was looking back. I didn't realize that it was me [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8931.78s)]
*  I didn't recognize myself in the video and I'm confronted on the who the fuck is this and it was just a video of me [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8936.06s)]
*  Leaving fronted her before you realize that dude. I'm such I like zoom in on it [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8941.42s)]
*  I it's a it's a terrible grainy photo and I took screen grabs of it [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8945.5s)]
*  Who the fuck is this and it was me you guys role-playing I swear to God it was it was I'm like [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8949.220000000001s)]
*  Why it wasn't they were it was like a weird intimate kiss on the cheek and a long hug and I realized that it was me [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8956.300000000001s)]
*  I have the photos somewhere. I don't know why that I think you need a better camera [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8962.300000000001s)]
*  No, or I just need to fucking watch something through or you know [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8966.86s)]
*  It was also a better camera because if you thought it you didn't even know it was you [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8970.14s)]
*  How are you gonna if it is someone else if someone is breaking your house? [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8973.460000000001s)]
*  You're never gonna get a good description of them. No, I know it's just some dumpy guy in a fucking hoodie [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8977.02s)]
*  Which is what I saw but I think the color changes a little bit with the light [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8982.1s)]
*  I just didn't recognize myself and so I confronted her then we kind of you know, I felt like a fucking idiot [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8985.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, but the cameras are look I feel safer with them at night. I kind of want to get a pistol [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8991.58s)]
*  Talking about the smart dust, which is what you're just driving [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=8997.7s)]
*  But I can't find anything that talks about like here's it in action [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9000.1s)]
*  A lot of descriptions of this will do but all the way dating back to that maybe even as early as the 90s [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9004.18s)]
*  They've been talking about yeah, that's what I was talking about that. It was kind of more theoretical than anything [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9010.04s)]
*  You know that it I don't know how they would power it ring camera has this thing [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9014.300000000001s)]
*  I love I have a by the way when we go away, I set up five ring cameras in my house [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9018.56s)]
*  So if anybody comes in I see what room they're in [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9022.66s)]
*  I see what they're doing like like if the super has to come in [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9025.62s)]
*  Can you talk to them and say I know where you I can yeah [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9028.54s)]
*  Yeah, and I actually will text a worker if he was in one time [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9031.38s)]
*  I just like just so you know, there's ring cameras [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9034.179999999998s)]
*  I don't think I'm fucking spying on him [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9035.859999999999s)]
*  But they ring has this thing now where it's like a little it raises up and will patrol the inside of your house [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9037.859999999999s)]
*  It's it's a drone [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9043.9s)]
*  Yeah [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9045.3s)]
*  But I applied to get it like you have to apply to be a part of the program and they just keep telling me to go [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9045.82s)]
*  Fuck myself like I want this so bad [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9050.179999999998s)]
*  It raises up and it will fly in a pattern that use like you walk around with it and you show it where to go [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9052.22s)]
*  And then you put it back down and it can repeat that pattern so it's just like [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9058.62s)]
*  This is they showed this at a CES. It's made by Samsung [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9064.34s)]
*  Yeah, this is not it. I know but this little robot does a lot of what you're just talking about. They show this lady's [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9068.9s)]
*  She's using at home with her pet here you go [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9075.9s)]
*  It can connect to all of your stuff that's already at home and do good things for you, you know, but also [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9079.54s)]
*  Maybe weird shit it can talk to your dog. It's a project on that screen [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9084.78s)]
*  That's what it's showing right? Yeah, when I first saw I didn't see any of this like actual like up [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9089.140000000001s)]
*  This is like personal assistant usage almost huh? [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9093.58s)]
*  And it's working with your galaxy watch is that anything that's connected to Samsung stuff and their network of stuff [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9096.86s)]
*  Hmm, which I guess in theory then you could add your lights part of your air conditioning [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9102.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they make refrigerators now Samsung has a refrigerator that will take an AI [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9107.380000000001s)]
*  We use AI to tell you what the expiration dates are all the food products that are in your refrigerator when they were put in there [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9111.82s)]
*  The contents of them it'll break it all down for you and even give you recipes to cook [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9117.539999999999s)]
*  Like the food that's in your fridge [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9123.539999999999s)]
*  LG has one also. Yeah [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9125.539999999999s)]
*  Interesting. Yeah, this one from ring didn't it didn't have any like personality to it [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9127.539999999999s)]
*  It was like a box that this thing would raise up out of it was square [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9132.3s)]
*  It wasn't like it didn't I don't think it did anything else [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9136.98s)]
*  Well, I think Samsung is about to release that there's two steps one is their AI [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9138.98s)]
*  Thing where they're gonna have a conference. I think it's invade. I don't know if it's in Vegas [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9145.1s)]
*  There's things you must talk about [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9151.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so it's flies around. Yeah, it raises up out of that little dog. Oh, that's wild [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9153.619999999999s)]
*  That is cool. Yeah, it will like whatever pre I think pre program [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9160.1s)]
*  Yeah, it will like whatever pre I think pre program and it goes back in there and sits in place and gets charged [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9164.58s)]
*  It's charged again. Yeah, I think it's good for five minutes an hour. Is that awesome? That's incredible [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9170.5s)]
*  That's incredible. That's so cool. Yeah, that's really cool. It's really cool looking too [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9175.66s)]
*  Yeah, it looks like what I would hope like a little robot watchdog from the future would look like can you guide it if you? [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9181.5s)]
*  Were out of town that I don't know [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9188.1s)]
*  I think I'm assuming that it's just the pattern you've established, right? [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9189.62s)]
*  But like I get so paranoid about flooding and shit like that [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9193.42s)]
*  Like I would love to be able to see if my floors are flooded dude. That's fucking dope that that thing is dope [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9196.34s)]
*  Functionality is simulated for illustrative purposes. So it doesn't really show it in use [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9201.5s)]
*  this [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9206.26s)]
*  Samsung refrigerator thing was fascinating to me. I'm like what a great idea [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9207.54s)]
*  You have a refrigerator that tells you what the ingredients you have in the refrigerator is when the expiration date of these foods are and [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9211.22s)]
*  Then gives you a recipe so you can cook based on what's in the fridge [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9218.62s)]
*  I mean, I like that then there's also the part of I don't want my refrigerator involved [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9223.1s)]
*  Like it's just it's too much like you know, I mean my refrigerator is always fucking empty [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9227.62s)]
*  It's got rx bars in it and like bananas and some fruit like there's never a whole lot going on in my refrigerator [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9232.880000000001s)]
*  That's probably better. Yeah, you probably don't want to go too hard with the fridge. No, I mean like again, it's just I order meals [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9238.78s)]
*  It's a fridge. I don't need it. I don't need to have a relationship with it [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9246.060000000001s)]
*  Like I just want to go in and get some shit. I have these meals I order [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9249.18s)]
*  They're like for the whole 30 diet, which is what I do when I really lose weight [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9252.1s)]
*  And they just they pre-make them and they send them and I know what I'm it's fucking [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9255.66s)]
*  But it's boring because you eat the same stuff all the time [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9259.34s)]
*  Even if you have a variety, but it's better than I would do on my own for sure. It's real food. It's real food [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9261.84s)]

*  We should have went to McDonald's [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9357.32s)]
*  But you got to give yourself a day or two to do it and then not do it [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9358.9s)]
*  Yeah [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9361.94s)]
*  If you give yourself like a designated cheat day whether it's once a week or once a month or whatever you choose to do and then [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9362.46s)]

*  I was watching like on Instagram the Rock will do like these Sunday cheat days [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9389.08s)]

*  But it's like Jim you've given yourself nothing but cheat days [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9405.2s)]
*  For 30 years you fat fuck like I put on 25 pounds like I know it [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9408.32s)]

*  Like she was trying to be gentle and going is there anything I can do and I'm like man [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9433.699999999999s)]

*  It's one of the most avoidable things because you choose to put whatever you eat into your mouth. It's your choice [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9471.02s)]
*  Yeah, and she'll my wife just mad at me [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSAk9O3PVHc&t=9476.460000000001s)]
