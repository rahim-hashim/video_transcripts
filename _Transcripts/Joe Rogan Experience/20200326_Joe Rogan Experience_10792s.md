# Joe Rogan Experience #1448 - Joey Diaz
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 26, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb-g4cACOEc)
*  And we're live Joey Diaz
*  My brother, how you feeling like a new fucking man rested you look I know rested right rested very rested
*  I looked at it at this as a reset button
*  As soon as I came back from Vegas, I knew what time it was
*  February 29th was a 50% capacity
*  Yeah, we were there a week later. We were there when Tommy was at the Mirage
*  And the UFC had their their Vegas the Las Vegas card. It was it was ghost town
*  Half not even half full. I mean a week after you you were at 50% capacity. It's probably dropping less than that 30
*  It was at 30, but the UFC was packed. It was packed
*  Yeah, and then I came to the comedy store March 2nd and that's when I could smell it in the fucking air
*  When I went into the green room, bro, when I saw all those people in the green room, I basically had a fucking
*  Panic attack. Yeah, and I went right to the door. There's a street door
*  Yeah in the back of the Eddie Murphy door if he comes back, that's what we'll call it the Eddie Murphy door
*  This house is gonna get it out of that. Yeah, they're gonna have to have guards to get in
*  So I went to the Eddie Murphy door and I stayed there and you could just see people in the audience
*  Like nothing was going on and I just got I just got shit
*  like I was shattered by Saturday and remember I was supposed to be in New York for st. Patty's day and
*  The Monday before I was supposed to be in New York the 16th and 17th with a show at NIAC on the 12th
*  And I saw it happening. I
*  Got went to a doctor for a shot on my knee to get the gel for the arthritis
*  And he said that you might have a weird reaction to it and sure enough Tuesday
*  I went to boxing class and the guy goes dog your leg is bruised
*  So I had a little bruising on my leg and I got home and that night on the news that hit New Rochelle
*  And I go wait a second New Rochelle and NIAC they're like fucking neighbors
*  You know my memory of mine I served me right but in my mind that talk
*  Close. Yeah, pretty on top of everything
*  So I sent the letter to the picture that might need a producers and I said I'm not coming in
*  Because they wanted me to come in Thursday for wardrobe
*  And then I was just gonna sit in my hotel room for two days, you know
*  Go to Jersey and eat shit like that. So even during all this they were still planning on filming
*  This is for the Sopranos movie
*  So we're gonna do a couple shoots reshoots and I'm reshoots and extra scenes
*  That Tuesday when I got home New Rochelle had bust I sent them a picture of my knee and so I'm not getting on a plane
*  Till Friday. I want the swelling to go down, but it doesn't take a fucking I got a GED
*  When I was in New York City in May, I went by the garden to eat lunch
*  I wanted to get out of my hotel room and I went to the garden on the side
*  You could sit there at 12 o'clock and they have everything steak sandwiches, whatever you want pretty fucking good to trucks
*  No, they have a building that has foods inside and have some truck and you could sit outside fucking beautiful
*  But while I was sitting there was a Tuesday
*  I was off from shooting and I remember calling my wife and specifically saying I like it here and everything
*  But if Godzilla comes out of Hudson River
*  Where all these people come and go?
*  Yeah, if you sit in New York City of Manhattan like on the 50s and just sit there at a cafe
*  You could estimate I mean, it's like maybe
*  10,000 for every 10 minutes that you sit there people that walk by you
*  We don't have that foot traffic in LA like there's in New York
*  There's a little bit of foot traffic downtown, but Sunset Strip that ship sailed
*  You don't see people walking around the Sunset Strip Hollywood Boulevard, but not to the dense pop you know
*  No, not the numbers of New York. So it was a no fucking brain. This is a GED here
*  This is me sitting there going this is gonna happen. I just kept
*  Cutting it down and my biggest fear was going to the East Coast and getting stuck
*  It could happen I would have had a biotruck to Cadillac and drove back I was already prepared like I was like
*  I'm gonna buy a truck and drive back. Do you think you do that drive? That's a long-ass fucking I could do that
*  I've done that drive 20 times. What is it five days five days four days
*  There's a lot four days. You got to do like what 16 hours a day. Yeah
*  It's hard to stay awake. I did Colorado, New Jersey like the back of my hand. How far is that early 80s three?
*  What is it from here to Colorado like here to Denver? I think 16 16
*  Here to Utah Salt Lake is 10 10. That's a good one
*  Good escape. That's a good escape. No, I have not but I've done Vegas multiple times, right?
*  Vegas is about four and a half four and a half. Yeah, and then you go another six ish
*  Somewhere in that range you get to Salt Lake depending on traffic
*  So salt lake you go to Salt Lake City at 5 in the afternoon like all fuck rush hour. Hey, where's the cars?
*  Fly by there's no
*  It took me 10 minutes to get here we thought I thought Salt Lake City was like millions
*  I thought it was like millions of people. It's not millions. What did we figure it out? Jamie? Didn't it's like a couple hundred thousand
*  Yeah, cool fucking place. I love it. I love Salt Lake City
*  Cuz the moment the more mistake on it nobody knows dick about dick. They got reefer bong
*  They got a great Mexican food great food. Did you go to that one? Does this one famous Mexican joint?
*  Lizard I was walking around and some guy goes Joey Deas. I got the perfect spot for you. He seemed cool
*  He drove me to a Mexican joint. What is that? There's a one famous Mexican spot in how did you get the number?
*  It says
*  Estimated is 200 K but that's not a metro area is 1.2 million. So I don't know. Yeah
*  That's like that goes all the way out to the mountains 1.2 million. That's nothing. Yeah, that's nothing
*  No, 200,000 in the city when you see those pop when people like that's not I started hearing them that we're gonna cancel Coachella
*  No, I'm like that. I got a cancer called childhood. They're too fucking greedy. They can't go child dog old people
*  That's what some Palm Springs. Well, once they cancel South by Southwest. I was like, whoa
*  whoa, this is crazy and the store was planning on keeping the OR open and
*  They canceled my show in the main room and they asked offered me a spot in the OR
*  I was like, I don't think we should be doing shows like this just doesn't seem like this seems like it's getting real
*  It's like because if you make a mistake and there's a 14 day period
*  Where all these people can get infected who the fuck knows who gets infected during those 14 days
*  It's so because we didn't know what it was yet. It's still we don't know what it's still strange because
*  So many people Idris Elba apparently is asymptomatic. He's not showing any symptoms and he has asthma and
*  I was reading something find out if this is true that
*  Somewhere in the neighborhood of 60% of the people are asymptomatic
*  And I wonder if that means they never show symptoms or I wonder if that means they they they're
*  Asymptomatic for a certain period of time. So 60% of people infected are asymptomatic
*  But a certain percentage of those people ultimately get the cold or get the you get the cough and all the the terrible symptoms
*  the fever
*  Because you really listen, you know a lot of people and I know a lot of people and nobody's called me yet
*  That has it I have Michael. Yo, Michael. Yo was almost dead. Michael. Yo went to New York City did Gotham
*  He came back. He got real sick. No. Yes. Yes. Yes
*  He got pneumonia and the kovat 19 at the same time
*  So he got coronavirus and pneumonia and he said now now six days ago, I talked to him two days ago
*  He said for four days before that he thought he was gonna die. He's there. I couldn't breathe
*  Pneumonia and this corona. I think I think this motherfucker wouldn't it like plays with you
*  If you don't have it if you don't get it you you can kind of like oh, oh, this is no big deal
*  But if you do get it it fucking grabs you like Jamie knows a girl who's 21 who lost her sense of smell
*  and taste and
*  It just it wrecks people we were we were googling a story about this Olympic swimmer from South Africa 31
*  stud athlete
*  Olympic swimmer said this virus fucked him up. He said it was the worst thing he's ever experienced
*  So it's weird. It's like it it almost like plays with our mind
*  Like it makes some people seem like they're immune and some people are fine. Maybe it's you take a chance
*  Go outside take a chance go to a restaurant take a chance go to the beach. Let's go to the beach
*  What's the worst thing that can happen crack those asshole and then go deep fuck it and then boom a bunch of people in your
*  Family get it and then boom your grandma dies. Look at Italy. You know what happened Italy
*  They just went out. They all live together. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. They all live together and they hang together
*  Nothing wrong with that. That's how people are where I came from. There's a basement your grandmother and grandfather live in a basement
*  Your parents live on the second floor and you live on the third floor
*  Boom, we hang out together the foots go family. God bless them from Freehold, New Jersey. I lost four people
*  From a family reunion. They went to like, oh, yeah, I saw that and I saw that one
*  I saw the one that the guy had the 39th birthday 40th birthday party and they all got on planes afterward and
*  Went off to different parts of the country family from New Jersey was not very old either
*  No, the youngest one that died I think was 55. I
*  Think it's somewhere in that range. It's um, I might do it. Do I have the mask on am I jumping up and down at?
*  Routes buying groceries. No, am I going I stopped, you know, I went to one boxing class after that
*  Yeah was announced and I was like, you know what this is too personal. We gotta give it a chance
*  I got a bag at the house. I got kettlebags at the house. Everything could be done out of my house
*  Yeah, if you're a person and you want to work out there's so many YouTube videos or just bodyweight workouts
*  You can get a fucking amazing workout with nothing. You don't need any equipment
*  You just do burpees and push-ups and bodyweight squats and lunges. There's plenty of working out to do folks and it's free
*  It's a beautiful thing about YouTube
*  There's so many really good fitness instructors that just put their stuff out there for free because they want people to follow them
*  And you know, you can get a ton of great bodyweight workouts
*  You don't need nothing and if you need weights folks
*  You can pick shit up around your house and you could do a great workout with I'm sure you got a can of paint somewhere
*  That probably weighs 15 pounds, you know people have things laying around
*  What
*  We do kind of meditate you do so what I do is I hit the bag I
*  Broke my workout because now you can't do that long workout now
*  Because we're gonna do for the other day for the restoration day the recovery day, right?
*  So there's no recovery in my world just so easy workouts every 15 minutes
*  Nice
*  You're punching you look at anything benefits over 40 for boxing benefits over 50 the number one benefit is stress
*  You know for a couple days that dog I was getting scared. Yeah, I wasn't I'm not scared of it, but I respect it
*  There's a big difference. I respect what's going on something's going on. I'm not a fucking scientist
*  Have you ever been here in an earthquake? Yes, it's for me. It's the same feeling but but more magnified
*  It's like okay. This is alright, but what is it like if it gets worse, right?
*  Are you scared of earthquakes? Oh, yeah, where were you in July? I was on fucking stage. We were we were home
*  I didn't feel it. I didn't feel it
*  I was in a state in Huntington Beach and the room shit and I just kept going
*  I just kept going fuck if a beam falls and hits me. This is it but you felt it while you're on stage
*  Yes, I couldn't let them get scared
*  Oh, I could not let them get scared because now you lose the audience right 50 people in there
*  I know so I could not let how far into your act were you 22 minutes? It was brilliant. It was perfect
*  I was just thinking about the other that was one of my best times
*  I had the last year doing stand-up right in the middle. I'm on stage and I had to calm them down
*  So I just went to a rant so they didn't get scared. Yeah
*  Yeah, my last show I did was like a Tuesday or a Wednesday at the improv I forget maybe a Wednesday
*  Did one show 8 p.m. Show great fun time, but I was like, I think this is it
*  This is the last show for a long time. I didn't want somebody to say they went to the improv, right?
*  I didn't want somebody to say that they got sick at the comedy
*  You'll never shake that thing is you'll never know there's no way anybody could dial it into one person where you got it from
*  That's the weird thing is we're constantly interacting with people and touching surfaces and according to this these cruise liners
*  That they're testing where these people were sick even people that are asymptomatic
*  It shows the virus stays on surfaces for as much as 17 days
*  That's a new discovery. They thought it was three days before that now
*  They're realizing even in asymptomatic people people that don't
*  These it's weird, it's a fucking weird virus man. It's real weird real weird
*  My friend dr. Peter a T. I was saying that most people
*  55 and under they seem to just get a cold
*  I mean, it's a date they're fine. They feel like shit for a while, but they get over it
*  He said but then there's this 28 year old fitness instructor that one of his friends is treating
*  Who's a doctor and these guys on a ventilator is a fitness instructor and they're like there could be genetic conditions
*  Predispositions and then they're also it might be vaping they thinking that vaping might have something to do with damaging some people's lungs
*  You know or cigarette smoking
*  Cigarette smoking is a bad one and they think that that might have contributed to a lot of deaths in Italy and in China
*  Yep, China and in Italy they out smoke us and they have less cancer in China
*  Did you see the thing is are we sure they have less cancer like when they say they have deaths like how many deaths they
*  Have out of China
*  Would you believe those numbers? I don't trust a fucking word of it. They're trying to say that this is an American disease
*  That's what the Chinese people are there's some propaganda network from China
*  That's I don't know what's connected to the government or water. Maybe it's people just fucking around
*  maybe it's people trying to be funny, but they're putting out that this is a
*  Man-made disease that was spread in China by the United States government
*  So who the fuck are you trusting I'm not trusting I trust Italy when it comes to the numbers because I think they're being
*  Pretty honest about what a disaster it is, but China's trying to make it seem like everything's bouncing back now. I
*  Don't buy it. They opened up the movie theaters in China. Yeah
*  That's good. The fucking movies like one watch it on a nightmare movie. Oh my god watch a horror movie
*  We're in this fucking theater. Just wondering if everything you touch is eventually gonna kill you
*  fuck
*  apparently
*  They were saying also that it has something to do with blood type
*  And they don't know why but a lot of the fatalities were blood type a seem to be vulnerable or maybe it's just a coincidence
*  They say they don't have enough data yet, you know, especially here like reliable data that we can trust here in America
*  They don't have enough yet
*  So when I when I think about it what gets me is that same feeling like an earthquake like once an earthquake hits like oh
*  All right. Well, we're okay right now
*  But now we know that this can happen like the first one I ever experienced. I was the first year here
*  I had an apartment in North Hollywood and wasn't it was a thin place like you could hear the next-door neighbor
*  She would get phone calls
*  I would hear her answer machine go off because this is the 90s and I would hear the person
*  Talking on her answering machine. I could hear every conversation
*  She heard she had like it was through a towel like that's how thin it was
*  It was a shitty apartment
*  But when the earthquake hit the apartment just went like this and I remember thinking this is like when you're a kid and you're playing
*  In a refrigerator box. Remember those refrigerator boxes we would get them on the street and we all climb in them and fuck around
*  But they were they were flimsy. I'm like this house felt like a refrigerator box
*  Just started moving like this and it wasn't even a big earthquake
*  It was like a five something like a five five or something like that. It wasn't a huge one
*  They say was an aftershock from Northridge
*  He just started doing this
*  It's moving back and forth and I was like, whoa. I didn't think it was gonna be like that
*  I thought the ground would shake. I thought it'd be like you like you feel feet moving
*  It's not everything just goes left and right everything just shifts
*  Like the ground is made out of like it's sand or something like instantly it just becomes
*  Plyable it's weird. I saw the cat drinking water and all of a sudden I saw the cat in the air
*  That's how much of a dip
*  I heard it looked like you know, you're on the computer and something and you yeah
*  And I looked and I saw the cat drinking water and all of a sudden I saw the cat in the air
*  We landed he took off and they're supposed to feel something before the earthquake I think dogs do better than cats
*  Yeah, I think those indoor cats those indoor cats are done
*  Once you bring them into a mouse runs by them
*  They're like I'm done that that but I don't think so my cats are alive and kicking at midnight
*  They'll know they say they're like Judith. How many do you have now three you only have three that's crazy
*  You were up to 11 at one point nine
*  Yet nine or I think you had 11 you probably forgot
*  I had so many of them outside I was feeding I had so many of them
*  Oh, that's right
*  You had a bunch of feral ones that lived in the yard to you know, Mark Marin has that kind of set up too
*  Yeah, or at least he used to it as old place. It is fucking good. I'm down to three. I'm down to three girls
*  All the boys punched a ticket
*  My favorite one died three months ago the little boy now
*  I'm down to girls. I don't know what I'm gonna do with my next move is I'm waiting to see what the smoke clear is
*  Maybe get a German chef
*  We should all get out of here. No shit legit shit. We should get out of here
*  Oh shit, this should be our wake-up call. We should all just pack up and go to Denver
*  This is a big wake-up call for a lot of people. This is gonna be a big wake-up call
*  You know, there's a lot of places like love land our outside of Denver
*  You know, I mean evergreen 30 minutes outside of Denver what happened to Montana what happened Montana
*  No, but here's the thing Denver's got comedy Utah's got comedy. You know what? Why don't we just open up a club in Montana and buildings?
*  We could do it. That's
*  Opening up a club in st. Louis everybody's opening up a club here. We did
*  war with everybody else
*  Comedy school and fucking we're doing this Montana if we just decided to do that. What was the last time you were in Montana? Oh
*  Six months ago, so what did you think? I love it there. What what I love Bozeman. What are we waiting for?
*  The winter is a motherfucker though son that winter is real
*  Look who we're living through now. What is it? I realize that we could do anything
*  It's better realize look at after every earthquake a certain amount of there's a certain percentage of Californians
*  I wake up and say I'm not going through that again, right? They get up and leave there's certain Californians didn't go like me
*  Like oh shit, you gotta get a generator for my fat sleep apnea machine and
*  Every time you go to supermarket by two or something
*  Yeah, two cans of cream corn by two cans of this you go my fucking garage. I'm good
*  Yeah, you gotta have dried. I'm good. I'm good
*  You know why cuz I'm a child I'm a child of the 60s when I was growing up every building you moved into had a
*  Fallout shelter you dumb fucks. Oh, yeah
*  The fucking fallout shelter and they had Tang and fucking TV dinners down there and every once in a while your building would run
*  A fucking thing the Russians are coming the Russians
*  And you have to run to the basement and close the door and they had like a vent and in grammar schools
*  You had to go down to the basement and they give you like the fucking Tang juice and all that shit
*  God about fallout shelters were East Coast thing. Fuck. Yeah, nobody remembers the fallout
*  So I've always lived like it's the fallout shelter I always had a back situation
*  I got weed till fucking tongue doomsday
*  Family came over here when 66 but they had been over here already dabbling
*  Over here since the 50s fucking around numbers
*  Whatever the fucking my mom was doing whatever the fuck my dad was doing so they were already hip they made it official in
*  66
*  So when I was being raised here my first couple years in this country were we were living under fear Vietnam was going on
*  They had just killed Kennedy and now they just killed because I was alive and kicking when they went see how I'm see how
*  Kid killed Robert Kennedy. So it was a different time then we were living in a little fear
*  Cubans had pointed missiles at us
*  Awesome, the Russians weren't that fucking cool. So that's why the fallout shelter was big just in case they threw a bomb at us
*  We go downstairs to a basement live and stuff like that. So I think
*  What fucked with me was the your own marrow fight denied the your own marrow fight
*  I was invited to a friend's house to watch the fight and I pretty much had a nervous breakdown from the fear of leaving the house
*  really because of
*  Cuz the virus yeah real nervous breakdown. He didn't want to go to your friend's house best guy in the world
*  You were like stay home for people, you know, you never know I asked him what they were cool he goes
*  Yeah, I go nobody's been to China
*  Nobody's been no cuz that's the problem
*  So I knew was gonna affect look at the the skier that went skiing and new Rochelle
*  The Jewish guy that went to the synagogue with the two dudes he went skiing with iron and seno and critical condition
*  Oh, they were he went in a group
*  Then he went to the synagogue and new Rochelle and spread it all around
*  He should be the most popular guy in the neighborhood today, you know I'm saying that guy like nobody wants to talk to him
*  So he brought it there from Italy. He went skiing in Italy
*  He couldn't go to fucking Riverton, Wyoming or fucking Utah or fucking Aspen. He had to go to Italy like a big shot
*  Well, he probably planned a trip to Italy long before I don't give a fuck go to Aspen. You're fuck go to Riverton, Wyoming
*  That's the best grab it. He wanted to eat pasta
*  I don't give a fuck they got pasta in fucking Utah before but before that shit drives me fucking crazy
*  That shit that shit where you just can't you boy you can't go to Ajax
*  You can't go to Ajax. Nobody wants to ski a judge. You can't go to Ajax
*  You gotta go all the way to fucking Italy to go skiing cocksucker
*  Well, maybe he wanted to go skiing as well as go to Italy. Leave me alone
*  You know that shit bothers me as it is. He took people down
*  He's been he can't have a passport. You can't leave. Let me tell you something going to Italy is awesome
*  I didn't say that but he had to go ski. He went to a ski trip in Italy, right?
*  But also in Italy so you could eat pasta
*  Sights you could eat pasta in Aspen
*  And you can see the sights in Aspen. Okay, do you see them saying if everybody goes to ask but we're fucked
*  No Aspen you break it up. There's apparently a guy from Aspen that had it too. You like it in Utah
*  You like skiing you I don't like skiing. Oh, no, you don't like no
*  Yeah, but they enjoy Utah
*  They like all those places. We've been Aspen Aspen is beautiful. I love it
*  Did you come back with the fucking did you come back with the head? No, there was a guy
*  Australia who had it apparently knew he had it and he refused to self quarantine
*  He went to restaurants who rolled the bus he went skiing throw him under the fucking jail
*  No, throw him on see that's the other thing about the store that that shocked me that night
*  Tuesdays through Thursdays packed packed with people visiting. Yep from other seat from over
*  Yeah, so that started giving me the willies that night
*  When they cancelled the store, I was happy. I'm just worried about the wait staff
*  You know what like we've been rocking on the last ten. They've been rocking. Yeah
*  Well, they're putting together some sort of fun to hope they do it quickly and we're all gonna be able to donate and there
*  I think they want to have some stream shows too, but sure. I don't think that's the way to do it
*  I mean if if they do do it and they have a bunch of people almost like podcast style
*  Maybe that maybe that would work and have like a telethon raise money. Well, I say what I thought about the stream thing
*  Yeah, I like doing the stream thing but a podcast not stand-up. I thought but then I saw this week with John
*  Whatever on HPL the little John Oliver John Oliver and last week he didn't have an audience
*  Not good. No, well when no one's laughing at you. Yeah, you need that energy
*  Yeah, they were doing live shows from the Laugh Factory yesterday was yesterday and it was no audience and
*  I was watching Jay more on stage for a couple minutes for how to panic attack and I shut it off
*  No, it's just no good. It's just no good. It's strange. It really doesn't work. It doesn't work
*  I wanted to work and I thought that I could do it for people just to break the monotony
*  You know what? It's like watching someone with no voice singing in the shower. Yeah
*  How bored are we how bored do you want to go like a ten o'clock are you like I'm fucking at night
*  Yeah, no, I'm not I'm not bored. My wife goes to bed. The baby goes to bed. We got her on a home school schedule
*  They have an 11 o'clock
*  Ten o'clock video conference and 11 o'clock
*  Then we do math we take a breather and she hits the mitts to everybody got to hit the mitts at the house
*  We're gonna get that stress out. You know, I'm saying good move good move and
*  Everybody's on a schedule. But at night like this is the first I have not been out of the house in
*  21 nights
*  25th today's 25th 23 nights. So at 11 o'clock I get a little bored. Thank God
*  I'm the edibles started not working
*  Because you won't been too exposed to him. Yeah, I just been up a tolerance. I've been popping two threes, you know, yeah
*  I've been eating them so much like the first like the first week of the week before st. Patty's I
*  Was I was under so much personal stress like I was so fearful of that plane ride
*  To New York that I was getting fucking gazilled. I
*  Wasn't even match if you took that flight. You would have probably caught it
*  I mean that that the whole New York area is a real good chance
*  I had a jet blue by myself cabin. I had all planned out but the more I thought about it
*  I'm like, I don't know guys. I don't want to be in a hotel
*  I know how 40s I know how the food service industry works
*  I was that very weekend that yo got it the very weekend that you went though
*  You were supposed to go was a heat of it
*  Yeah, that was the fucking heat of it and it's still it's still just climbing
*  Well, they said it's two two weeks is gonna reach its apex
*  But they they have you know an astounding number of cases. They do however test more than California
*  So they're more accurate in terms of their numbers. There's more testing being done in New York City
*  I think by threefold than California
*  It's crazy, man. This is a a whole new time and I really hope it's a wake-up call for us
*  It is a wake-up call. This is dog listen as
*  Jokey as this may sound or whatever. I've always had a faith
*  My faith got me to where I am a faith in what on a higher power. Let's call it a higher power
*  I always had a faith in the higher power and I if anybody knows about
*  About karma is me. I'm the fucking poster boy for karma. I know all about it for me. This is like
*  Why a power letting this know like
*  It's a reset button. Take a look around you guys have gotten caught up in selfies

*  The greed's been too much. You know, I got to feel bad for Disney losing six million suck my dick
*  You were charging 140 a day cocksucker
*  140 a day, I think that's the least of our problem
*  No, I think the big problem is people think then this is all this life the way we're living is gonna be permanent
*  No, no, no, it's changing for a reason. Yeah, it's changing for we were getting fucking greedy
*  Well, there's definitely that and we were getting a little overzealous, but we're soft. We're soft
*  That's the big one and especially we're soft right here because we don't have to deal with weather
*  Right here. We don't have to deal with nothing you go outside every day. You can sleep outside
*  It's a great place to be homeless
*  All you need is a sleeping bag get under an overpass if it does rain only rains ten days a year
*  You'll be fine. You know, this is this is a great place because of that
*  But because of that also we're not humbled enough
*  You know the places where people get humbled are the places where people have to deal with direct nature snowy places real cold places
*  Like if you go to any place that's near an ocean, that's a little slap in the face
*  Wake up bitch. Take a look at that. You ain't shit mountains are another one same thing. Like you could die up there stupid
*  There's bears up there. There's mountain lines up there. They're fucking killing deer with their face
*  You don't think they'll fuck you up to go go hike go hike and get lost hippie
*  You know, like it's a wake-up call those places and I think this is a wake-up call for the whole country the whole world
*  There's a wake-up call. We're vulnerable and it's also a wake-up call. I mean I can't say this to enough people take care of your health
*  Please it is a one defense for this that seems to be agreed upon by almost everyone is that?
*  If you have a strong immune system, you have a better chance to get through any sickness
*  And you can do something to strengthen your immune system. Your immune system is something you can work on
*  You know, you can work on it by cleaning up your diet. You can work on it with regular exercise

*  Vitamins supplement with vitamins eat a healthy diet
*  Get some exercise and if you can get in a fucking sauna every day
*  Tremendous for your body producing heat shock proteins or your body reducing inflammation alleviating stress
*  It's great for your cardiovascular system. It's just great for you
*  There's a bunch of different things you can do you can you can use this as like, okay, I'm alive now
*  This is a wake-up call. I'm so glad this didn't happen to me. I didn't get wrecked by this
*  I'm gonna get my life in order and it can be done
*  It's something that everyone can do and this is the time to do it
*  This is a good time to do it if you're surviving and you're getting through this
*  This is a good time to get your health in line
*  What you don't know a lot of people will know about me as I was a sickly kid
*  Really?
*  Never I never believed from the age of four
*  To six because of my dad dying and my mind going somewhere
*  My immune system fell apart. It was respiratory
*  Always got colds always shots
*  You know vaccines I knew the people by first name at the hospital at Roosevelt Hospital in New York
*  I mean it was real with me when I was six something and I also have asthma
*  We really which went untreated like I just said you have asthma still like my mother said it's for faggots
*  Don't worry about it. You don't need you have asthma right now. I
*  Grew it my daughter has it though. Really? She has it and now I see it in her and I go does she have an inhaler?
*  Yeah, and you don't use an inhaler at all. No, did you ever?
*  Like a week then my mother goes
*  You live in New York City, you know, I get smack. Wow, your mother's heart
*  So I grew up with this fucking thing and then when I was 16
*  I got put in the hospital for 13 days for a lung infection
*  From barricade
*  So ever since then like I'm not supposed to smoke. Mm-hmm. I'm never supposed to smoke when I started smoking
*  I would get sick for days afterward
*  Like I had a jumper hurdle to smoke pot, but when you were smoking cigarettes, what about that?
*  That was a comp that let's not even talk about that. What let's talk about the hurdles. I had smoking reefer early on
*  I would smoke reefer and it would be an event. I would have to take three or four days off
*  It would crush me for that long really then once I built the tolerance to that then I started having to build the tolerance of
*  Who I smoked dope with?
*  Like if I smoked up with me you and Jamie and somebody else the next day. I'd have a temperature
*  You get sick from someone. Yeah 13 14. So by the age of 15, I already knew I had to keep my shit
*  Like if I smoked with you and Jamie every day, that's who I smoke with
*  Once somebody else comes into that circle I would get sick. Mm-hmm
*  So I had to knock that out so I had to be very aware at a young age of who I smoked with I
*  Got sick a lot when I was competing. I wasn't taking care of myself back then. I didn't take vitamins. I didn't take shit
*  I got sick a lot because it was always stressed out too because I was always nervous because fighting all the time
*  So, you know you get ready and the weeks up to a tournament, you know
*  That's the most stressful and then the week of the tournament I would always come down with something
*  You know and you want to fighting sick fought sick in Anaheim I flew out to California to fight in the nationals
*  I fought sick had three fights sick. Did we figure out what the
*  percentage
*  Well, I think as time goes on they're getting a better picture of it
*  Take care your immune system kids. I've been drinking a shitload of water, too
*  Yep CBD oil for sure. It took some pet CBD oil accidentally
*  I was wasn't paying attention. I went to the cabinet to get them some CBD. Oh, I'm like man. This is tasty
*  What is this? It's like peanut butter or CBD oil and I have three droppers full and then I looked on it said pet
*  I'm like damn hope I'm gonna be okay. I
*  Don't know what the difference is between CBD MD's pet formula and the regular formula
*  But I had three full droppers of their peanut butter pet formula
*  It was quite delicious. It was pretty good. You take a lot. I take enough supplements vitamins
*  Ktpf I take a lot of things
*  You know, like I said, I've cut down the reef for a little bit throughout this I was going like through a
*  Half ounce maybe a week. Mm-hmm joints and bong hits
*  Eight a week I've got fucking a couple ounces at the house
*  Go off edibles. I'm enjoying the time just the relaxing time of no pressure of things to do
*  You know no shows to go to stay home every night hang out with the girls. I'm enjoying I don't watch the news
*  Yeah, I was fucking with me the first week. I'm glad that little nervous breakdown on the seventh
*  That was really fucking with me and then I said that's it I went back to my roots I went back to Boulder
*  I took it back to the Roper Institute bitch and I took it back to the meditation
*  so what I would do is I hit the bag 15 and
*  Then to come down I'd stretch and just do yoga poses and breathe. Hmm, and then end
*  With like a long fucking meditation
*  Get some vitamin D. I do everything outside
*  In the back of the house a little back yard hidden. I think that hit in the bag is a kind of meditation
*  Yes, I really do. Yes. I think if you really can just concentrate on your breath
*  And I do three minutes 30 seconds off I do try to do five sets of that
*  Yeah, but then after that the stretch has really helped me. Oh, yeah now I have no cryotherapy
*  I got no acupuncture nose. It's cryo closed cryos closed
*  Mmm. Yeah, I stayed away for the last two weeks. I did a little not the novator
*  Which is the red lights until about 10 days ago?
*  Yeah, and then this started getting a little serious like you know what?
*  Let's start just cutting down this whole thing. Mm-hmm
*  And then last weekend I see what was going on at the parks and shit. There's a park close to my house
*  I said, let me go over there make a few calls
*  I'm like this is crazy down here look at these people packed. They're on top of each other
*  Yeah, and if I'm running behind you that makes no sense. They're all running the same way
*  Are you running right into someone's running right into it? I mean, I'm gonna GD Joe
*  This is what kills me. I got a GD and I'm sitting there watching these fucking morons
*  Run behind each other, you know, like yeah, all of a sudden you're fucking rocky
*  But you're sucking that guy's breath it and the chick behind you sucking her breath in
*  Oh my god, and the chick behind you and they'd all run in the same direction
*  Ten feet away from each other. So I knew it's a race
*  Other cops tell them to the cops are pulling in the park going listen, what are we doing here?
*  But you can be by yourself, right? I saw some people hitting the pads at the park
*  Where someone was holding pads for somebody?
*  You do that you got some space away from you can get a little workout and there's always gonna be that good
*  It's gonna come up to you. Yeah, there's always that man. Aren't you worried about the coronavirus?
*  I have to take the race horse out early
*  My daughter's a race watch
*  So they 45 I give my wife a break and I just take her for a little stroke
*  Just wear out just to wear out a little bit. We play badminton
*  Whatever the fuck that is. Yeah the tennis with the fly. Yeah, I throw a whiff of balls
*  I was telling the lead the other day in the heat of all this. I'm there at 915 for a reason
*  they got the playground on sealed off and
*  Then they got a huge fucking park and for some reason everybody got a walk out of walking between me and my daughter
*  Talked about a second person. I had to say something really
*  Really? You can't walk around you got to walk in between
*  People can't have enough
*  They test your fucking wits
*  Well, they don't they don't change their behavior
*  the best was the guy that watched me playing with my daughter and I could see him out of the corner of my eye and
*  I could see him. I could see him whispering to the wife some stupid shit. And what does he do?
*  He starts walking towards me
*  And I'm not even paying attention to him, but I am I'm watching them through this fucking vision. Mm-hmm
*  I'm watching him. I'm playing with my daughter throwing the wiffle ball
*  And he's walking towards me finally had to stop and he goes hi. I just wanted to shake I go stop
*  He just looked at me and I felt terrible for him, but this is what's actually going on they still want to shake your hand
*  Yeah, people try to shake your hands though. They still want to shake your hand. I'm like, it's not gonna happen
*  Stop right there. Yeah, I go hit me on Twitter and I'll hit your back
*  But that's it. I don't want to hug. I don't want to know nobody nothing. You got to tell me I want to hear
*  Unless you're showing in here with a fucking envelope, which I don't see you have don't come close to me at all people did
*  They're not changing their behavior. No, that's some people behavior. There's a number of people right?
*  So some people paying attention to everything some people are over cautious
*  I went to the fucking supermarket this lady had goggles on and she had I mean not goggles but big Jackie Onassis dark sunglasses a
*  fucking face mask with these giant gloves on and she's walking away from everybody like everyone's a bomb and
*  She's doing her grocery shopping like okay. Well you're you've gone too far
*  This is a little ridiculous and then I'm looking at other people that are acting like there's nothing wrong and they try to shake your hand
*  And then there's people that are paying attention too much
*  So they've become paranoid and they're not even living their life and then there's other people that aren't paying attention at all
*  They're barely paying I'm in the middle barely look at I'm in the middle. I know I have to live my life
*  That means I don't have to go to 7-eleven for nothing
*  Yeah, so 11 is filthy. I don't have to go in there for nothing. Okay
*  Nothing. I got rolling papers and everything in my house lighters. I got lighters till the next millennium
*  I can light myself up ten times with the lighters I got
*  I'm not you know, I'm not putting myself in a bad position
*  Yeah, you know you've been quarantined Jamie's been quarantined Jamie. I didn't go to fuck, you know, there's somebody it's that tonight
*  There'll be a concert. They'll go where no if I tell you that tonight
*  There's a concert they'll go if it was it was there still Liberty University is letting students back in today
*  Jesus is gonna look out for him
*  Yeah, there was a article on CNN. They were shown Liberty University opening up its doors again students
*  Like this just started you fucks you can't just you know, where do you think we are right now beginning?
*  You really the beginning. Yes. Yes. You don't think we're good till mid-may. No, listen, it keeps accelerating every day
*  If it's accelerating every day that means it's at the beginning every day. There's more cases every day
*  There's more people getting sick. Now. Didn't he say yesterday? I don't quote me on this
*  Yeah, because it's a very special day to him
*  See he said it's a special day
*  This virus doesn't give a fuck what day you think Jesus came out of the ground
*  This virus doesn't give a fuck and if you don't respect it people are gonna die and there's people like the lieutenant governor
*  I think is who he is of Texas who is like
*  We should take a risk with older people just to get the economy back in line
*  People like whoa
*  What are you saying?
*  You think the economy you should we should get the economy back in line and by doing the economy
*  Some old people are gonna have to die. You're ready to sacrifice people for money
*  Yeah older people would rather die than let COVID-19 harm US economy
*  Texas officials said older people would rather die. This is what he says lieutenant governor Dan Patrick. Okay
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, and you know he's saying that he's in that high-risk category himself because he's 70
*  You know as these politicians are terrified
*  that
*  This is gonna lead to an economic disaster and their names gonna be stuck on it
*  You know, I think they were terrified at first that they had they had to act that a closed things down
*  But they didn't have a plan and now they realize like oh my god
*  This might have to stay locked down for a long time. What happens the economy? Yeah, you didn't have a plan
*  No one had a plan. So they locked everything down and now they're like listen this could last a long time
*  We got a fig we got to start the rumblings now of getting this ball rolling again
*  Because if this goes six seven months and no one's working no one can go outside their house for six seven months
*  Like this is crazy
*  What we won't have any money and China's gonna take over Tucker Carlson had this whole piece
*  He did that I saw that was actually pretty accurate, you know where he's talking about
*  What what could be possible do like he was talking about how the NBA
*  Did you see that whole segment where the NBA they had said something about China and then then you see all these people
*  That were praising China and saying positive things about China. What was this? What was the reason behind that Jamie? You're an NBA guy
*  The
*  GM for the Houston Rockets tweeted like support for Hong Kong. That's right. That's right
*  It was support for Hong Kong and then China got pissed at that. And so then they started
*  tweeting nice things about China and they started well at the time that that happened that the
*  there was like NBA teams in China doing games and just come back and then
*  They started asking all of them what they thought about this and then like the bronze
*  Started supporting China. I think and then everyone jumped on them and like like money over people I think
*  Well, you mean that they face consequences for supporting Hong Kong. Yeah
*  Well what Tucker Carlson was saying in this piece?
*  Was that imagine if that's the the whole country like understand that like if China's the ruler of the world of?
*  China becomes the ruler of the world not the United States because of something like this
*  Like this is all really possible
*  Like the idea that the United States is the ruler of the world so it has to stay the ruler of the world forever
*  No natural disasters
*  disease
*  fucking
*  Asteroid impact there's a bunch of different things that could shift the balance of power in the world Rome used to run everything right?
*  the you know, there's
*  Europe England the UK you see England used to run half the fucking planet
*  There's a lot of different countries that were on top of the world that are no longer on top of the world
*  And we would be in a real sticky situation if we had to live under the same
*  Military dictatorship that China does and the idea that we would never have to live under that we we can't we're America
*  Well, that's ridiculous because we're human beings and other human beings are stuck in a circumstance where they're living under a military dictatorship
*  So there's no difference between them and us other than culture and the place where they live that that shifts things change
*  With natural disaster with disease with failure of the economy with war with all these different factors
*  Things change and our perception much like our perception of our society itself
*  It's always gonna be like this and all of a sudden this disease comes along as it shuts everything down. You're like, whoa
*  That's a fucking wake-up call need to recognize that this is kind of fragile. Well, the whole system is fragile
*  If those things happen natural disaster disease war anything catastrophic happens
*  The balance of power completely shifts and who knows whose control the survivors are under who knows who knows how this works out
*  This is all
*  Real touch and go right now. This is real touch and go
*  This is uncharted territory where we have slipped into a place where no one's working and everyone's scared and the president wants to go
*  Back to work on Easter because it's a special day to him and Joe Biden can't talk
*  The guy was running for fucking president for the Democrats can't talk
*  Did you see the deleted the latest shit Tim Dillon sent me two videos?
*  He's like what the fuck is going on like he's in a cognitive decline
*  Governor in New York Cuomo put him in put him in coach put him in you want it
*  You want a guy to run for president that makes sense?
*  You want a guy who's an intelligent guy who's a strong leader who's got a lot of experience
*  He's impressed the fuck out of me the last two press the fuck out of me. He's like
*  Up human lives more than money. He's impressed me. I'll tell you what's impressed me
*  I don't know. See you can't say nothing because you're always gonna be wrong. There's always a knock. Well, he
*  Joey you're wrong because he's declined the woman's abortion act. There's always something that's true
*  That's part that's that's the argument they had about I don't even know what it is
*  I don't even know and I tell you it's always a something. I don't even know what they see
*  The issue is late term abortions. He apparently voted for I know there's always something so and I was just making a joke
*  But I know you're actually right. Yeah, the guy's doing a good that up
*  The other guy is doing a good job that I see that he's communicating this governor Newsom. Yes. He's doing a great job
*  I don't know what his politics are. I don't know if he's a Democrat or Republican
*  I just know he's stepping up and he's fighting for these people and he's making some smart choices and
*  You know what? I don't know. Are you a fucking scientist Joe Rogan? Let me check. Are you a scientist? No, me neither
*  Go fuck ourselves until that time. I don't know
*  I do know one scientist and she's telling me to stay the fuck home in my business
*  I knew no I do know three four people work in emergency rooms
*  That have told me it's not a fucking pretty place. No, my brother's a cop in a
*  Hospital and he says that it's a fucking nightmare that you have to sort them out a and B and B is if you have
*  kidneyitis and A is if you have
*  Corona they say it's a fucking nightmare, right?
*  Because you got to think the same amount of people are still getting injured. Yes and sick
*  Yeah, some other stuff so mercy's coming in. Hope is coming in. They're not Corona ships
*  Yeah, they don't want no Corona people down there. They just want fucking you know, they're bringing in a ship with a thousand beds
*  This fucking these goddamn cruise ships you want to talk about a Petri dish
*  Stuck on a metal craft in the middle of the ocean breathing recirculated air with a bunch of people were partying
*  And around you is the ocean and if you fall in you're dead because they don't scoop anybody out
*  When do they ever turn the ship around scoop somebody out when they fall overboard?
*  No
*  No chance for comics that was always a death sentence. I made a mistake
*  No, when I was 21 with a chick
*  One of the cruise ship the one that used to go around Manhattan
*  So you leave at six o'clock and you're back at six in the morning and they take you out far enough so you can gamble
*  Yeah, like blackjack. I did that one one time
*  Nice, but I know I wasn't gonna do it again
*  I
*  Got out of my system. I don't want to go in a fucking cruise ship. Yeah, and as yeah as a comic
*  I hate you hate to say this as a comedian
*  Amongst us
*  It's a death. It's a death sentence for me. They have additional work
*  I do got to say though the fucking impractical jokers those guys did a tour on a bus
*  I mean on a boat. Apparently everybody loved it
*  So it's like if you get your fans in there right a rare thing, right?
*  Yeah, just there's people that could pull that off. Yeah. Yeah. Well Alonzo goes on jazz tours
*  He does does jazz cruises, you know, Lando Bowden is Alonzo Bowden is a serious jazz fan loves jazz music
*  Loves him yesterday. I love him to death. He's always been the best
*  Clippers fan before anybody even talked about the clippers and ride a motorcycle everywhere
*  Yeah, that motherfucker badass bike. Yeah, he's got a bunch of bikes or he's had a bunch of one BMWs
*  Mm-hmm
*  But he was a clippers fan when they were over 92 those he was down there by himself with Cristela Alonzo
*  Now he's living like a doctor. He's fucking yelling soon as they got Kwame. I was happy just for Alonzo
*  That's how much I love Alonzo that I was happy just for Alonzo
*  Loves Alonzo everybody
*  Nobody has a beef with Alonzo. Nobody know why would you first of all break your hands?
*  He's giant his fucking hands are ginormous
*  He's the sweetheart. He's a sweetheart. He doesn't even know he could break in but he could break never
*  You'd never know that he's six foot four 250 pounds solid muscle, whatever the fuck he is
*  He's a tank of a man, but he's just he's hilarious, too
*  He's he got he's a dude has got great points
*  Like here's one of his lines. He said he goes not every Trump supporter is racist, but every racist is a Trump supporter
*  There's not a whole lot of racist voting for Biden I mean maybe a few
*  They can't let that guy run for president. They have to put a stop to that
*  You have to see these recent videos
*  Have you seen it Jamie and then you fucking killed Bernie Sanders. You basically killed Bernie
*  They can't even read
*  That Porter you put the kiss of death on him cocksucker
*  Oh my god, Julia the Puerto Rican chick won't shut up. Oh, Casio. Oh
*  Alexander
*  She's a Puerto Rican chick that that she was 28 years old. She won't shut the farts to riches congresswoman
*  She's like fucking I won't talk to him because of Joe Rogan but back them. Well
*  It's not that I've got
*  That they used a video of me to support their their campaign to say that I endorsed them and
*  Then they took a bunch of my bits and they took a bunch of things
*  We said on the podcast high as fuck out of context and made it look like I was some right-wing monster
*  Make them like I'm some sort of homophobe
*  It's and then they use the transphobe thing from that the lady that used to be a man
*  If you don't know the story used to be a man for 30 years became a woman for two and then started beating the fuck
*  Out of women without telling them that her whole life. She had been a man up until recently
*  She just thought it was a medical condition that she didn't have to reveal and I got mad. It's domestic violence
*  Yeah, it's crazy. It's it should be criminal to not tell somebody
*  They mean the idea that you're the same thing as a biological woman is just not fact
*  It's not scientific fact and yeah, I said a bunch of horrible shit about her
*  That she's not even horrible shit. I just said mean things that she's a man like you're a man
*  You can't you can't just go fighting said the truth. Yes. That's why I did I said the truth and I said
*  I think I'll have a lot of friends. But here's the thing. I'm a guy that I support bull riding
*  Okay, I support if you're a woman you want to fight a man. I support it
*  But you got to let that person know that you're a man
*  You if you used to be a man
*  You got to let him know if you want to if a woman wants to fight a biological man right now a guy with his
*  Balls and she wants to do it and they and he wants to do it and they sign off on it. You could skydive
*  Why can't you do that? They're both the same weight
*  Go ahead. I don't think you should if you're my friend if you were a woman and you're my friend
*  I'd be like there's too many physical advantages. It's too dangerous. All they have to do is hit you once
*  They said they don't have to be as skillful as you if they clip you you're fucked and that's the truth. That's what happens
*  I mean, it's a giant advantage doesn't mean the woman can't win
*  Because Jermaine Duran to me actually had a kickboxing fight with a man and knocked him the fuck out
*  That would that lady's a beast the iron lady from Holland
*  She's a beast but she's a former USC featherweight fucking champion of the world
*  I mean, she's an animal that lady and had a real close fight with Amanda Nunes recently for the battle weight title
*  She's a one of the best fighters on on earth and she beat a man and knocked him out, but you shouldn't
*  Fight a man if you don't know it's a man
*  That's rude and if you didn't know that someone used to be a man, that's rude, too
*  So they tried to pretend that I'm not this
*  Transphobic crusader. I love all people. I literally love all people
*  I don't care what you are whether you're gay or straight or Asian or black or white or I don't care
*  I don't care. I just if you're nice, I'm nice to you. That's I'm a hundred percent open to everybody
*  But I'm not gonna bullshit you can't fight women if you used to be a man and not tell them
*  It's so ridiculous that that's that's even a debatable subject
*  Like I had a bit about it where I said never do what I think as a society we could get to a point where
*  Someone would say hey, man
*  I don't think it's cool if you get your dick removed and then beat the fuck out of chicks and people be like you're out of
*  line
*  But that's that's where it got that's where it got we got so overly progressive
*  In the the fight to do the right thing
*  We got to write that script about a guy who falls in love with a girl and it turns out that she's a man
*  Yeah, like yeah the wedding she tells me, you know, my name was Hugo
*  You know, what would you do if she's really hot you're still into her. Do you really care?
*  It's a good question. Yeah. No, that's what some people don't care. Some people like I don't give a fuck
*  I'm ride or die with you Hugo
*  When you're alone with them her in public
*  Yeah, man, it's um in the fight to do the right thing and that's what what's going on with progressives when they get overly progressive
*  They think they're fighting to do the right thing
*  But you have to be able to call out shit that's wrong on your side
*  And this is one of the problems that the Democratic Party's having right now with this Joe Biden guy
*  You guys got to be able to call it out
*  You can't let this slide because everybody else sees it and Trump is going to eat up
*  Trump is going to eat him alive
*  He's gonna eat that guy alive. The guy can barely remember what he's talking about while he's talking
*  Do you know which one it was because there's a few videos a few of them. Yeah, play any of them
*  They're all right. They're all crazy
*  Every video of him recently talking he's stumbling through shit. He forgets what he's talking about
*  We should be making those masks. We should be moving on those ventilators. We can do that
*  Why doesn't he just act like a president?
*  I said stupid way to say, you know Donald Trump was asking
*  Sorry
*  Yeah, go ahead. He's done. No, no, I probably best I don't he's like juniors in prima before he shot
*  It's not that's that's not even the worst example. That's just an example the one down there when he's talking to uh,
*  That lady I think that one was a struggle too. That was a struggle fest
*  Period for keeping businesses shut and people at home. Are you at all concerned as trump said?
*  Yeah, this is it cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself
*  We have to take care of the cure that will make the problem worse. No matter what?
*  No matter what?
*  We know what has to be done. We know you have to reassess the recommended period
*  Yeah, see he doesn't know what he's talking about when he's talking and this is not like this
*  I'm looking at this like a medical condition. Okay, i'm looking at this like okay when i'm calling a fight and I see a guy limping
*  And i'm like, I think he hurt his knee like tiago santos against john jones. I think he hurt his knee there
*  I think there's something going on with his knee like that's what i'm looking at this
*  I'm looking at this like this is a medical issue
*  That's not a normal way to communicate unless he's high as fuck
*  Because if I was high i'd be like, I don't know what I just said to this lady
*  You could be in the middle of one of those interviews blasted on edibles going what are we even talking about?
*  I don't think that's what it is. I think he's tired. He's old. He's very old and I think he can't
*  It's he doesn't look good either and they got makeup on him. Yeah, he doesn't look his skin is all pulled tight like a lizard
*  He's like he got the formaldehyde in him already. It's it's
*  He looks like he's got the formaldehyde in him already. They're not gonna just press a button governor cuomo governor cuomo right
*  That's the answer. I love this behavior. I love this attitude so far and he's been honest
*  And i'm telling you if unless you're a fucking idiot just go to any street corner in new york
*  You know look at fucking footage from july like
*  It's too many people. It's too many people. It's too many people stacked on top of each other
*  I couldn't even think about getting on a ferry and going to eat at rudy's
*  Like I was staying somewhere on park avenue
*  And i'm like so I gotta get into an uber which are fucking filthy in new york
*  Okay, when you walk into an uber
*  People are sitting in cars with the windows shut breathing whatever he's breathing
*  Yep, I open up the car and let the guys like you're gonna get in. Yeah, give it a minute
*  And then I would take my handy wipe out and lower the window and close the fucking door before I got in
*  When I get on the ferry, I stand outside. I don't sit in there. I breed that hudson river red. That's good for you
*  That's as good as it's gonna get disinfected all those bodies and shit floating in there
*  That fucking maluchia dust in there and pollution whatever the fuck is in there, but I knew
*  Look at within weeks t-neck right t-neck was the one that got contaminated today
*  Fort lee got it, you know that that's all my fucking neighbor. I don't think nobody
*  Oh hoboken was really bad
*  Hoboken not a bad the cops had to go in there and fucking like hoboken was like a party
*  Like hoboken didn't give a fuck
*  Like they were fucking just having orgies and hoboken gino told me you gotta stay in
*  Really? So they finally had to go down and they closed hoboken like you weren't allowed to go into hoboken only people who lived in hoboken
*  Could party in hoboken then they just had to fucking shut it down
*  Somebody had a meme on their page
*  It might have been donnell
*  I forget who it was. No, it might have been snoop. I don't remember who it was
*  But anyway, they had a meme on their page that said
*  You're telling people you're gonna put them in jail if they go out after 8 p.m
*  But you're letting people out of jail early because they got the coronavirus and there's someone going. Hmm
*  Like what?
*  Like what the fuck? What are you saying?
*  Are you gonna lock people up but you're letting people out first off if you look at this whole thing
*  There's been some weird people who've got tests
*  They got tests like they got tested like there's been some weird
*  Even is been obvious whatever his fucking name is the black
*  Is this obvious whatever his fucking name is interest elba?
*  Yeah, the black dude that got shot
*  Well, he lives in england and he got tested because he was in contact with other people that had it
*  You know, why the fuck did harvey get a test because he's in reichers and reichers has a massive outbreak
*  No, yes
*  Yeah, he's in reichers. He's in maximum security. He's in buffalo now. Oh, do they move into that because of the corona
*  He's in the hospital in buffalo. He's fine. He's fucked. He probably has no will to live
*  You know, I mean he probably doesn't have a will to get through this
*  I mean, I don't know what kind of medical treatment they're gonna give him but this could do him in easily
*  It's running rampant, but he's so sick already you look at the guy. He can barely walk his health is deteriorating
*  Oh that the stress and this trial killed him crushed him took 20 years off his life instantly
*  This shit kills you. This is just a death sentence
*  What I was just saying we were talking about this yesterday
*  Imagine if you came up to him four years ago and said I want to show you your future
*  Dying in a bed in prison for things you've already done right now you're walking around toast to the town getting in limos
*  Climbing out people are waving to you and cheering you're getting interviewed on the carpet
*  Everyone shouts you out
*  I just want to thank harvey weinstein for his amazing amazing company and the boobies you put together that allowed me to shine
*  Yeah, how many people have you seen all the people that that praised him?
*  And then four years later imagine that he thinks the things he's already done
*  He'd already done them at that point and they knew while they were praising. I wonder what they knew they knew they knew
*  He was a scumbag. They knew something they know. Yeah, they know they all know dog. You got to assume they all know
*  So what the fuck? Yeah, they went back. They knocked on doors. Wait a second. So I rape you you're gonna go to that party
*  What do you mean so I raped you at a party now the next year there's gonna be another can festival
*  And you're gonna show up again a lot of them did because they wanted to work
*  See the thing about harvey is apparently this is whitney cummings take on it
*  She said he would actually give them the things he would tell them he would give them
*  So he'd say hey you suck my dick i'm gonna make you a star
*  And he would actually do it. He would actually put them in these movies. He would give them
*  What so they were happy so they would get all this treatment and they had to spend some alone time with them every now and then
*  So they would send him emails lovey-dovey emails
*  But really they hated him
*  And that's when all this came out. He didn't even see it coming because he thought that they loved him
*  He thought that they would send him these emails. So he sent the emails to the press like look look at all these emails
*  These girls love me
*  even though
*  He had done scumbag shit to them
*  It's just he had it set up
*  Where this was how you got by this is how you made movies. This is how you want to be famous
*  This is how you get famous. I can help you get famous. You gotta help me get rid of some cum
*  Who do you think of suck this day everyone I think everyone did all the guys too really every guy come on
*  I
*  Think Brad Pitt threatened him because he
*  Felt real uncomfortable apparently. Oh, I don't know man
*  One of the people said the producer did not have symptoms and was under close observation was not clear why he had been tested
*  There's a lot of shit that don't sound right to me. They don't give me listen invicts are the last people they care about
*  All right, and the only problem you have with those things is that you could really sue the state like I got locked up
*  When hiv was starting to get popular 87
*  88
*  So as soon as I got to my destination
*  They had already built an hiv unit that was fucking state of the art facility
*  Everybody else lived like a fucking mo mo
*  The hiv guys lived like kings microwave ovens
*  TVs colored yeah, they let them get microwaves. Oh, they had everything in there. How come their own refrigerator?
*  Because they didn't want their food. They didn't really know
*  Oh the extent of the hiv so they had their own thing
*  They had an own cook that came in and cooked for the six guys in that unit
*  So you never I don't understand that must have contributed so much to homophobia, but okay
*  So when you not in jail, I mean in the world, you know during the aids crisis
*  What do you mean?
*  Homophobia in the world during the aids crisis when aids was was out when it was a big deal
*  I mean I was almost too young to remember it because I was like 21 when it was happening
*  I was still a kid
*  but I mean the people that were
*  Already inclined towards hating gay people and then there's a disease that everyone's terrified of that you get through sex that could kill you
*  And it affects gay people disproportionately
*  83 82
*  Those are tough years, you know
*  They even made a phenomenal movie about it called and the band played on
*  With richard gear and a bunch of great actors
*  they richard gear played the guy that uh,
*  the the fucking uh,
*  The guy that's a choreographer that did a bunch of plays. I can't remember his name
*  Oh, yeah, but he played him in a in like a weird manner and they everybody in that movie was a movie star
*  It was a phenomenal movie about age hiv
*  hiv really started with a stewardess a male stewardess that would take flights from
*  France or italy or england one of those don't quote me, but let's just go with france
*  To new york
*  And when he would come to new york, he would fuck somebody from the plane
*  Then go to studio 54 and get his dick sucked and then go right back then go
*  And he kept doing that it was all sex with the same stories really if you watch watch that and the band played on
*  People forget about that. I was gonna put that out in this week. I never saw one of my weekly movies
*  Excuse me, jamie if you can see if there's a trailer for it or something and the band played on richard
*  We can't play the trailer. No, no, no, but they'll tell you who's in it
*  And you're gonna go damn how the fuck did he even see that?
*  Everybody's in it like it was such a it was such a
*  Well, just um go to the the movie and don't don't go for a youtube don't go to a trailer
*  Just go to the movie on imdb. You'll be able to see how good looking he was then he was beautiful
*  Still flinging dick. He's a beautiful man, and these guys are all gay

*  whoever played he's a drill sergeant that movie he played anthony because

*  And then there's somebody else who's in it. I'll get him hanging out with sam kineson
*  I um, I met vinny right when uh, well before but right when all that shit was going down
*  I uh went to his apartment and he was uh, showing me the script and telling me what was happening margie warburg
*  That's what he was gonna hire
*  That's who's gonna play funding fell apart like last minute the funding fell apart and the movie deteriorated, but it was a good movie
*  He had based on his life of his life and it's a fucked up story, you know
*  And he was he was willing to to say who he is and you know how he became who he is
*  He was a tough motherfucker though. That guy was a tough fighter very tough guy. I read his other script
*  And it's better than that
*  His script was good. It was a very good script. Oh the other one he wrote about when he had to go hide out in canada
*  So he couldn't go to any training gyms
*  Really everybody knew where he was looking that they were all looking in boxing gyms
*  Wow, so instead of hitting the bag, he decided to run up a hill in canada
*  It was very hard to run up this hill. So every day he would run up the hill
*  And finally there was a kid in the block and he had some type of muscular dystrophy
*  And the kid always said I'd like to walk up that hill
*  So he said listen before you die
*  We're gonna walk up the hill one time
*  One time
*  And he walked up the hill on the way back the kid died
*  I mean just he and he wrote it into a fucking screenplay. Wow, Vinny's got some stories
*  He's got some stories Vinny's got and he forgets him
*  He forgets. I mean how many fights do you have? You know the other night?
*  I gotta tell you what's another academy award one that I forgot about that. I'm gonna be honest with everybody right here
*  I refused to watch it
*  When it came out for years I refused to watch it and after I did i'm happy I did
*  Harlem nights
*  Is so fucking good
*  Harlem nights eddie murphy is such a fucking black experience that it is a masterpiece
*  I mean i've been watching a lot of shit lately and I haven't seen that in forever. What year was that?
*  I remember seeing it when it came out that movie is so
*  So
*  Richard Pryor, oh my god. Oh my god and and fucking
*  The other fucking guy too red fox
*  Oh my god. This is such a good movie. Look at that picture. I refused to go see this movie
*  I'm like, this is just black exploitation
*  It is so fucking brilliant this movie. Have you seen dolomite? Yes. I haven't seen it the new dolomite
*  I heard it's amazing. I think it's amazing. I heard it's amazing. I think it's I think he did a great job and just
*  He says one line that movie I'll tell you that I love I fell in love I had tears coming out of my eyes
*  He's an open micer, man
*  And he's fucking dying to make it and you know how we are and one of us comes up to you like joe
*  I got an idea
*  You know like he's right. I got an idea man. I think i'm gonna do this and the other comedian is like man
*  He is a bum and he you know like when you're at that when you're an open mic and you really can't
*  And he was walking away and he said to him just to somebody he goes
*  It's gonna be all right. And Eddie Murphy goes nah, they man
*  There's nothing worse than having something to sell and nobody to sell it to
*  And it made me feel like an open mic because that's what you feel like when you're an open mic
*  Yeah, you got something to sell but nobody to sell it to it
*  Do you remember that feeling when you'd watch someone on stage and the crowd was packed?
*  And you just wished you could get up there like god. I wish I could get up there right now
*  And that's what i'm trying to do right now. I'm trying to reform
*  During the break
*  Yeah, I even wrote the story out of how I like I was lost and my ex-wife fucking forced my hand and drove me
*  To the comedy works in dendro
*  And now I got on stage and I was like this is it and i'm like, but the only obstacle I have is a wife and a kid
*  How am I gonna do comedy with a wife and a kid?
*  And we just we just bought a condo how old were you?
*  28
*  It stole my soul like it just like I didn't want to go to work no more nothing else mattered
*  The only thing I loved as much as doing comedy was cocaine
*  Like I didn't like nothing else. I just like cocaine and stand-up comedy
*  And I couldn't figure out how to do and make a living and pay for a family
*  Then she came home after three months and she didn't want to be married no more
*  And part of me was 80 relieved and the other 20 I wanted to be a father and the whole thing
*  but it's the truth I fell in love with it it fucking just
*  Stole my soul like I did I threw everything I had I watched every tape
*  I studied carlin. I studied the shit out of prior. I studied the fuck out of dice
*  I studied the fuck out of bill hicks
*  You know, I loved bill hicks
*  You know I watched today before I came up here
*  I was in a rabbit hole because I took my daughter for a walk and I sat down for a minute to get them to drink
*  They sent some emails
*  And rodney dangerfield was on the tonight show the week before easy money
*  and he said that uh
*  He he said a joke on the tonight show and I was laughing I thought it was funny
*  He says he drinks so much that he pissed on olives
*  And the other night that was on the other night caddyshack
*  From the beginning was on I watched that for a little while. That's a great movie. So like this vacation
*  Whatever the fuck is going on. It hasn't been rough on me at all
*  The first week was rough on me before st. Patty's day
*  When I thought I had a flight to new york was rough on me. I already had a plan already in mind
*  I'm coming back from new york and i'm just
*  Staying at home. I'm hiding like a motherfucker. That was my plan for how long I do not know joe
*  If he says the 18th i'm not still going out 420. I have a 420 show
*  Yeah, I have a 420 show in vancouver, but it's on the 18th or 420 420 monday night in vancouver on a monday
*  Yeah, that's not happening. I don't see how it can happen unless they come up with some sort of cure
*  in
*  10 days
*  I mean, it's the 25th unless
*  Somewhere around the first week of april. They have a cure. That's not gonna happen
*  Yeah, I mean there's there's there's some hope to some treatments that they're coming up with
*  There's no cure right now. There's no vaccine. It's not even close. How would you feel here way plus how big is this place that you're doing?
*  i'm doing an arena
*  And what how do you feel?
*  Doing it like do you feel I don't want to put anybody at risk. Okay, if if if people
*  Can go to the show and have a good time and not be at risk
*  I would love to do it's so weird man if the flu was going around. I know this is worse than the flu
*  But if the flu was going around we wouldn't think twice of doing a show
*  That's what's so weird about this. It's like it is absolutely more deadly than the flu. Don't misread what i'm saying
*  But it's just so crazy how different our approach is
*  To this as approach to anything else that winds up killing people
*  You know, we've all known people that have died from a disease
*  Diseases there they kill people all the time, but we've never been in a situation where everybody's scared of one disease
*  It's so strange, man
*  It's so strange and I don't think I could be able to get past that and just do a show right now
*  I'm 90 sure they're going to cancel it
*  I mean the the stuff that they're coming up with for treatment one of them is a malarial disease an old malaria disease
*  Um, there's some other different treatments that hold hope and but there's so many people man that could get infected if you've got a show of
*  12 000 13 000 people whatever it is
*  How the fuck are you going to make sure those people are okay? Is that your responsibility?
*  Do you say come at your own risk?
*  You know, I mean, what if you get it when you're there like what are we doing? What are we doing? You know, I mean
*  The whole thing's crazy
*  It's I think it's going to be a long time before we feel comfortable doing shows again
*  It's going to be strange at first, you know, but I also think uh when the dust settles it will settle
*  Hopefully unless this is the first thing that falls and then all those other things fall in the place that we talked about like natural disasters
*  We're going to appreciate
*  Peace we're going to appreciate freedom. You're going to appreciate being to roam around do whatever you want
*  Go out at three o'clock at night. You're going to you're going to appreciate it
*  You can appreciate being able to go to a diner and have breakfast with your friend at two o'clock in the morning and laugh
*  You're going to appreciate it cars on the street everybody acting normal. It's going to mean more to you now
*  It's like the sun after a rainy day. It means more feels better
*  Has more of an impact
*  And I think we've gone through a long stretch in this country where everything was static. Everything was doing fairly well
*  We were on an upward trend
*  No real tragedy
*  National nationally that changed the way we live our life other than september 11
*  so we got like september 11th and then all these years of
*  War, of course crime, of course all these things, but we're basically business as usual for most folks
*  Not anymore. This is a wake-up call
*  There's a wake-up call that you have a finite amount of time in this life
*  And this life the way you're experiencing it right now. It's this is just how it is right now
*  There's a million different factors that are in play constantly and you've been real lucky that you've had this stretch of peace and harmony
*  But that shit could change at any moment
*  It really could and we got to use this time to be nicer to each other
*  We're going to use this time to to realize that we got we got a little confused
*  We got crazy
*  You know everybody's just trying to acquire things and everybody's trying to you know, move their way up the corporate ladder like hey
*  There's there's a fucking end to this ride
*  Okay, this ride comes to a stop someday and it doesn't matter how much shit you've acquired
*  It doesn't matter, you know how far you got up this ladder
*  You know what what position of prominence you have in the community and how you're respected by the business world
*  Nobody gives a fuck when you're dead. It's not you're gonna die
*  We're together right now experiencing this thing in this like really distracted way
*  The thing comes into focus when you're forced into a situation like like we are now where you literally are
*  Nervous about your survival then the thing comes into focus
*  And your what to me my gratitude has come into focus my gratitude towards my friends
*  My gratitude towards my family my gratitude towards you know, look we're very fortunate that we're not living check to check
*  You know many of us and many of us have been in the comedy community
*  Many as many of us are now there's a lot of guys listening to this right now that we're hoping for these weekends coming
*  Up so they could pay their rent
*  This is uncharted territory for those folks and all of us that are experiencing this but the people that go in check to check
*  They're the ones that are really getting hit
*  That you cannot
*  Stress over this enough that your stress makes you get sick. Yeah weakens your immune system
*  We are working, you know, and I know
*  50 percent of people are being honest
*  You know, my friend said that they ganked them the other day for the cable bill in the middle of all this
*  You know if they didn't give a cable doesn't give a fuck so they shut this cable off
*  They were they called them and told them they were shutting this cable because I had the money
*  I didn't have no problem with it. My wife just we got to pay it
*  So they're just jumping on people right away. Yeah, they're jumping on you right away. So yeah, they didn't want to stack
*  I don't know how landlord's gonna be I had another friend
*  Who said this is really funny?
*  Who got divorced 10 years ago?
*  Close to 11 years ago. There was a dispute with one of the credit cards during the divorce
*  They yanked it two weeks ago out of his account
*  Out of his savings account. They got a judgment
*  4200 bucks from an old credit card
*  Like they're coming out of the fucking woodwork
*  Yeah chasing down cold cases cold cases and shit like that
*  Yeah, they realize a big careful whatever money you have if you didn't pay your student loan
*  They might yank it now
*  Just yank it from you. Yeah, and say we had to do this
*  So be very fucking careful. You're right
*  You know right and you think about it that way like who knows what the fuck they're gonna do
*  You know, they're telling you on tv. Yeah, this landlord isn't gonna care
*  First off listen if you can't do business, I can't take your rent money, but who am I gonna put in there anyway?
*  Who who called you this morning and said that we're going to look for a location for a business
*  If you have two brains in your head, you're not doing anything right now
*  No, you're not buying a house unless this is your business like unless you drop and buy houses for a living
*  You know i'm saying you're not going house hunting right now. Well, even then is that even if you do you'd be like let's hold on here
*  Yeah, let's hold on. Nobody knows nothing
*  For the next six or seven weeks, you don't know dick. I never even thought about the china thing
*  I didn't read that article, but that was even enlightening, but you don't know dick
*  Mind your business. You don't gotta I don't have to fly nowhere
*  Do you understand me? Yeah, I don't have to go anywhere. I got brayer the first week of june
*  And I got indianapolis and cleveland somewhere in there in june. That's it
*  I got nothing in july july 31st. I got las vegas who knows what's gonna happen there
*  And august 1st i'm in san diego
*  And then I got who gots who knows if any of those who knows of any of those dates and i'm and
*  I'm being smart about this listen
*  So what you mean to tell me is that motley crew who was supposed to start a huge tour in august?
*  Guns and roses who were supposed to start a massive tour
*  in june
*  They're all pushing their stuff back to october and november december
*  I mean when live nation thinks about giving that motley crew money back to have a heart attack
*  They have a heart attack. They're like no, yeah, we're holding on to this, you know, because it's august
*  I talked to salami. He talks to what's his name ricky. I think it's august that they go on tour
*  So what are you telling me that right after people are allowed to go out people gonna start
*  Going out and spending money right away. I don't think so guy
*  I don't think so. They're evaluating every day. We're not at work every week that we lose the week
*  That 12-one-dollar check that 12-one-dollar that 12-one-dollar check is basically gonna get people groceries
*  I think that right now like we're we're real touch and go but so is the rest of the world, right?
*  China's touch and go
*  Everywhere is touch and go
*  Everywhere Italy certainly touch and go they still got their streets locked down
*  You know, who knows what they're singing at night. They don't give a fuck some of them
*  Italians are singing like motherfuckers then new york's gotta act like gay people. They gotta fucking sing yellow submarine
*  Sing war pigs, bitch. This is new york. This is the boogie down bronx
*  What are you singing yellow submarine for and shit?
*  Fuck yellow submarine
*  Yeah
*  You know what's killing me the most about this is one thing about
*  Not wanting to go out and do comedy. There's another thing that you can't go out and do comedy, right?
*  Okay, i'm the captain kirk of the enterprise
*  You know what man? I gotta get out of house every three nights or if not somebody's gonna get stabbed
*  You know that
*  Even a belly room show. I don't give a fuck. There's always something for us to do
*  You know, how long do you think it's gonna be if you had a guess?
*  Honest honest honest honest by what i'm seeing today by what I watched in the news last night
*  I think for me to go back on stage. It'll be may 1st
*  And I don't know when i'll be another plane again don't don't
*  Yeah
*  It's all guesswork right now
*  we've really
*  Really have no idea. We don't know nothing. We don't know nothing. How has your focus been on writing?
*  Have you been focused enough to really write the best stuff you've been writing right now? No, yeah. No, okay
*  I haven't written at all
*  Okay, I haven't written at all while this is going on. I'm waiting. I've tried
*  I've tried to write i've written jokes that like, you know, the funny thing was like last week
*  They had that poor little white kid that had the rosy cheeks
*  And he's like you could tell that dude never got a d in his life. Did you see that video?
*  You know, this is all turn. Yeah. Yeah, this is all turn in florida, you know
*  Yeah, like I had to write about shit like that. Like everybody's mad at that kid joe. That's me
*  Right. That was me in 1981. That's every 18 year old. Yeah, can you imagine coming up to me in 81 and going?
*  There's a coronavirus. I would have snorted
*  We're here to party. I would have taken give me a line of that coronavirus watch nothing happens to you. Give me two lines
*  I guarantee
*  You know
*  So it's all different that could have been us that kid was as dumb as a fucking stump
*  Did you see that poor his parents must be like Jesus we fucked up with that dummy
*  This one girl was like is my birthday turn up
*  Oh my god, there was like 20 little chicks doing that fucking
*  Echibreky heart dance. Oh my god, did you see them all 20 of those girls just spinning into each other one's breath?
*  Oh, I was fucking dying. That's hilarious
*  The achy breaky heart dance, yeah, whatever I don't know what the answer is don't quote me
*  Some I haven't done since like the fifth grade type shit
*  goddamn
*  So, I don't know what the fuck's going on. So that's you're always gonna have that with kids though
*  Kids are gonna fuck
*  They're 18 years old. They're gonna fuck
*  They're going out. They have a couple drinks in them. They got plastic cups. They're gonna fuck what about the dude who took his mistress to Italy?
*  And he got the fucking hurt when he was over there. He they both came back and so now they're both busted
*  Disgrusted and you'll never be trusted
*  He took his mistress to fucking Italy
*  To do something and they both got the corona. Oh, yeah, and they got detained over there
*  Somewhere something happened. So the cat's out of the bag mama file for fucking divorce
*  She's got nowhere to spend the money fucking
*  manhattan shut down
*  There's nowhere to go in the world like the ufc is talking about putting on a fight on april 18th
*  You know
*  I don't know how they're gonna do that
*  I don't know if they're gonna be able to do that in the united states
*  They're talking about doing it in a place with less than 10 people
*  And then you know, just an open arena
*  I guess someone's gonna commentate it
*  It's not gonna be me
*  And they're gonna be duking it out
*  Like in an empty place
*  And they're gonna try to do that on the 18th
*  They did it for the last card in brazil because it was ordered by the government
*  The government ordered all large gatherings to break up when they started seeing the cases of corona rising in brazil
*  So they had to do the brazil card
*  Indoors no people weird
*  So but they're gonna plan kabib and tony this way they're gonna plan it so it doesn't even have to be a big place
*  They could do it like a film studio
*  Like legitimately they could sit they could set this up in a film studio somewhere
*  I mean they could
*  Tyler perry's got a place in florida. They could get on a flora rent one of tyler perry's
*  gigantic film studios
*  Set up. Uh, I mean we did it in when we did fight for the troops when they did
*  Yeah, yes, yes
*  Yeah, san diego and several other places in austin as well
*  Whenever we did it there's a few but though north carolina. There's a few different ones that we did
*  Um, they just would use an airplane hanger
*  And uh the troops would be there they would be the whole audience was the troops in their uniforms and they would set up
*  This uh octagon in an airplane hangar
*  And uh, it was pretty powerful. It's different
*  different real different different kind of show
*  Um, but they could do that they could do that in a studio or just a large warehouse
*  The ufc could do it set up some lights have some crazy high-speed hook up to the internet
*  Let's party
*  Like three notes getting uploaded and we're watching it from here
*  I mean that they could definitely do that. The ufc has the capability of doing that. The thing is um,
*  How they're gonna make sure that nobody has it, you know, you're gonna have to test everybody
*  And if someone has it do you let them fight like what if they have it in their like idris elba?
*  They have no symptoms, but they got the corona
*  Like what if kabib has the corona or what if tony has the corona just kabibi even fight him?
*  This fight is so fucking cursed this fight is so I gotta be honest with you. I gotta be honest with you
*  I already that's one of the first things I thought of
*  When they started talking and then they started talking about the mba getting cancelled. I go. Oh, no the fights could be again
*  Well, this is how dana feels
*  This is why dana's trying so hard to make it happen
*  Even if there's only 10 people in a room at first for a couple days that was mad at dana
*  I'm like fucking dana. I go, you know what this fight has to happen
*  This fight has to happen this I don't care if this happens by itself
*  In a fucking airport in a van of cuba. I don't give a fuck but this fight has to get over with we've waited so long
*  How many cancellations three?
*  Quite a few three four. This is the fourth time three or four. I think this is the fourth hospital visits broken knee
*  Yeah, anxiety attacks might be the fifth
*  This might be the fifth. No, I think so. Yeah, this fight is fucking cursed google it. Um
*  How many times has tony versus could be been cancelled? I'm gonna say I think this is the fifth time
*  It's many times though
*  And it's the best fight. This is the fight ever. That's the first thing
*  Then they kept giving you note first the mba then the nets tested positive
*  Yeah, then the fucking city of new york went under and i'm like, oh no, everything's pointing in the wrong direction
*  I go, but they'll have vegas then vegas said they're not fucking meeting till after march 25th is the fifth
*  It's the fifth time fucking time
*  Come on guys, and it is this has to happen. It is the fight. I don't care about any other fight on the card
*  Just pay them dana
*  Just pay them just one fight just pay them one fight. I'll pay the paper. No warm-ups
*  I'll pay the 69 50 pay-per-view just to see kabib and get it over with could you imagine?
*  That's it. Nobody nobody else has to fight 69
*  $1,000 for one fight one two three trainers in each corner
*  That's fucking eight. Yeah one guy and uh,
*  Where you gonna put the fucking judges?
*  They watch from home
*  Listen that terrible one. They're there. They tell me when they're there terrible when they're there so they can't watch from home
*  Yeah, so it's not gonna help them be in there. Oh, you oftentimes you honestly you get a better view
*  Of what's going on when you're watching at home?
*  Okay, so let's especially if you have headphones on so like when I watch with headphones because i'm watching like when I look down
*  At the screen sometimes when i'm watching fights, I have to sometimes I get a better view
*  I can't see what the fuck is going on
*  There's pillars in front of me guys are grappling and I don't know if someone's trying to get a submission or what's happening
*  Sometimes guys tap and I didn't even see it. I was like, what did he what do you do?
*  I have to like break it down then I have to look at it on the screen when you're watching at home
*  Oftentimes you have you really have a better view of it, but this just doesn't it's not as crazy
*  All right, so we don't need them. We don't need them there within social distancing
*  We do right here. We could put them in a fucking the judges can all come right here
*  Well, i'm gonna look over their shoulder come right here
*  And then so all we need is the three guys in the corner
*  Yeah, the two fighters the ref bruce buffer test bruce buffer bruce buffer. He could do a long distance too
*  No, no, no, no, he's gonna do with a gas mask on bruce buffer's gonna be in there red face with a fucking scuba helmet on
*  It's time
*  This is big old fucking scuba helmet. Does it have to be pay-per-view? Do you think because there's no competition for it?
*  Of course, it's literally no. What are you a communist? No, this is socialist trying to get fucking free shows
*  The same time you're talking about passing out stimulus checks. How are you gonna the ufc wants money?
*  I know sir. How are you gonna get people to pay for you're gonna get plenty of people like I said, you know what same?
*  I jamie wants everything to be for free. You gotta be a dude. You gotta be a douche
*  Somebody fucking loses here. So you gotta be a douchebag
*  Somebody loses out because how am I gonna put all this? There's three or four prelims
*  Five prelims and then four fights before that so i'm talking 10 fights. I'm talking 20 people
*  Three per whatever the trainers
*  That's a lot of people joe in one fucking place of winner so it can't
*  We gotta eliminate the early prelims
*  And just do the main card they could do that
*  But they also would have to test everybody everybody cannot share a space either. I cannot be in this room
*  With your old mirror over there throwing sidekicks because he's about to fight but if everybody's tested
*  And everyone's negative then who gives a shit?
*  That should be the only thing like if you're tested and you're negative, but you should be able to wander around
*  I think this motherfucker is a creepy motherfucker
*  The virus yeah, I think you're right. I think we're gonna find out more
*  I think they could be a 21 day something
*  I'm waiting to hear about what about the people who got stuck at texas airport last week
*  Four hours for luggage when they came back internationally. Yeah, none of them were not one of them has tested positive
*  How come they're not suing dullards? That's uh, what about chicago? That was ohara too. Ohara last week
*  Nobody's testing positive from waiting on a line for eight hours
*  And if you go on twitter everybody who's dying is from functions of the coronavirus, right and you
*  The coronavirus you had to go on that line. So I gotta see how long
*  This could really stay two weeks ago. They were saying the stat the air droplets
*  Stay in the air for fucking three hours. Now. They're saying something fucking different
*  I don't think they have a lot of reliable information yet. They have some they know what it is
*  I
*  Fuck you gotta be ready. I'll spray the nutsack. Have you seen the coronavirus song the rap song? No, I got it on my instagram page
*  You haven't seen it
*  That's fucking great
*  These guys it's really catchy
*  I start I start singing it throughout the day. Sometimes i'm driving around what you're singing for me a couple of times
*  No, i'll play it for you. I have to play it can't even play it now and one
*  Get a copyright strike. We'll play it afterwards
*  This is the world we're living in I think people are less
*  Less worried about bullshit right now more worried about real things
*  I think in that sense some of my favorite people that i've ever met are people from israel
*  Something about them. They're like carefree my friend shuki. He was a kickboxing trainer
*  In tarzana at majiro gym and tarzana I used to go down and train with him there and um, he was from israel
*  And I went to eat dinner at his house once he invited me over his house with his family and they're playing bongo drums
*  Dancing and shit. They were having so much fun. They were so happy and I said tell me this I go why
*  Why are israelis so like carefree? He goes because every day over there you can die
*  Every day over there you can die
*  He goes any day something can happen and he goes everybody just while you're alive. You want to party party party?
*  Have fun. Have fun. Have a good time
*  And I was like, wow
*  That's it. They they have a heightened sense of appreciation of life
*  Like my friends all my jewish friends that would go over there for whatever religious thing they would go
*  We're talking about how hot the israeli chicks were like the chicks in israel
*  They're wild
*  Wild and they all have to go to the army
*  It's a party over there. You know that right? Yeah, it's part of you ever see the episode when board dame was there
*  Um launching missiles and shit in tel aviv or something. Oh, yes. He was stuck. Yeah, that was the old show
*  Yeah, they got stuck there while fucking missiles were
*  Flying through what the fuck is that? That's right. That's right. Yeah
*  Yeah, it's uh
*  We got we were looking for trouble
*  Instead of trouble being here. Our life was so soft. We were looking for trouble where it didn't exist
*  We were trying to create problems where they weren't they weren't real. We were getting outraged about things that really didn't matter
*  And now we see what matters
*  So now that focus has to be on real real survival things and health and and community and taking care of each other and looking
*  Out for the people that don't have any money right now
*  Because they're not lazy. They just got fucked
*  You know, we got to look out for each other, right?
*  All those things are coming into focus now instead of the nonsense that people have been folk. What are you eating there?
*  What is that?
*  Okay, I thought it was that aspirin or ibuprofen. I was gonna say don't take that shit
*  Why not shouldn't take that shit right now
*  Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and it can do damage to your gut bacteria
*  Apparently you can fuck with your immune system. What's ibuprofen?
*  Advil stuff like that. It's good if you're you know, you need it if you're injured, right?
*  But it has an effect on your um, your your gut biome and it causes inflammation on some people
*  Cam Haynes was on that shit every day
*  He was taking 800 milligrams every day and he was in all this pain
*  And I sent him this ronda patrick thing where she was talking about the dangers of ibuprofen
*  And and taking large doses of it particularly like all the time and so he gets off of it
*  He's like fuck like there's a danger of stroke
*  See if you can find the dangers of taking too much ibuprofen because there's a lot of people that really get into that
*  Ibuprofen shit. I take a baby aspirin at night. That's fine. That's it night. I take it
*  Yeah before I go to bed because so i'll be protected between 5 30 and 12
*  Which is the highest rate of having?
*  Heart heart issues. The ibuprofen is very different than but then ask leave and all that stuff. I'm not big on that unless I absolutely
*  positively
*  Have to take something. I don't get that many headaches like that
*  So, you know cam runs like fucking 20 miles a day fda strengthens warnings that non-steroidal anti-inflammatories increase heart attack and stroke risk
*  Yeah, so which one are they that's that's like advil. It's non-steroidal anti-inflammatories
*  There's a there's a bunch of different ones motrin advil
*  Proxen aleve ibuprofen. Yeah, that's ibuprofen and
*  Naproxen so two different types of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories ibuprofen and naproxen. They're both available over the counter and
*  He said it's important to be aware of the ibuprofen warnings and naproxen warnings and take steps to limit the risk
*  So cam was on 800 milligrams this shit a day
*  Right, he's in pain all the time because he runs so much gets off of it and the pain goes away
*  So he's taking something for pain and it's causing him to be in pain all the time because it's causing all this inflammation
*  Because his gut is reacting to this fucking chemical keeps dumping in there and it's a vicious cycle
*  Because you've got all this inflammation and that's what's causing you to take the shit and the shit has given you the inflammation
*  And he's thinking the inflammation is coming from his running
*  So he gets off of it no more pain
*  God damn we're so ignorant so much. I mean this is a guy who's an elite athlete
*  I mean, he's a guy who runs ultra marathons
*  He's run as much as 240 miles in one race, right and he didn't know
*  Like how many regular folks know that this stuff is bad for you?
*  How many regular folks take unnecessary medication that could be beneficial to you if you have a real issue
*  But he take it all the time he take it too much and actually causes problems
*  This is a wake-up call for people when it comes to your health a wake-up call for taking care of your meat vehicle
*  Take care of your body
*  You got to take care of your body. This is one that if you're fortunate and you have a strong immune system
*  You you can mitigate some of the effects of it and that's the case with the common cold
*  It's the case with the flu. It's a case with a lot of different things if you're healthier
*  You have a better chance of coming out of it on the other end
*  Never never
*  So I just found out recently that I could take it through my nose you could spray it
*  It doesn't work as good on older people though. It doesn't know we asked dr. Osterholm
*  I'm gonna be as honest. I can't with you. I've never taken a flu. I think gonna has needles involved
*  You could tell I love to do heroin once in a while
*  But to get really high involves a needle that's where you throw me the fuck out that's what the party ends
*  I mean once you say needle that's where it ends for me. So
*  done, you know
*  You got a great joke about that I don't say it right now what's that you about not needing a flu shot
*  But it really is the truth that it is I've just I think the immune system we've we've flown so
*  much
*  We have flown so much
*  Yeah, that that builds a different type of immune system
*  How about all those shows we did like at the Chicago theater and giant places where we took pictures with people after the show
*  Hundreds of people, you know, I just did the treasure island sold it out and took pictures of everybody
*  That's a lot of people went back up to my room and took a tremendous hot hot boiling shower
*  You know the last time I was at the store I always take a shower before I go to the store
*  Mm-hmm that last time I won April 2nd. Yeah, it was probably the first time in years. I took a shower that night
*  That's how
*  Disturbed I was like I was fucking really disturbed from that last time. I was at the store
*  Yeah, because I thought everybody else was gonna be social distancing
*  More people grabbed me that night than ever before and every time they grabbed me or somebody came up to me and talked to me
*  My skin would crawl and I'm like, I'm not coming down here for a while. Yeah, there's no social distance at the store
*  No, so that's why he rules over there. I was like man
*  And this is my fucking spot, but now we're not live without which is crazy
*  You learn how to live without and that helps sometimes like I said
*  Not doing comedy like giving it a breather or not being able to do comedy two different fucking things
*  Yeah, I can't wait to get on stage. I have a ton to say, you know, we all do the last fucking
*  Four weeks we've made ourselves laugh now we lose our fucking minds
*  Yeah, I one of the reasons why I haven't written anything is because I'm just enjoying the relaxing me too. It's been too long
*  We've been doing this too long there and the last run this last nine years has been a run
*  Well, once you started really you started really kicking ass on the road to yeah, you really picked up your pace
*  You got yeah, you gotta gotta make haywire the sunshine and as they say no, but you gotta you gotta write
*  That's a kind of you gotta write. Well, I felt like with this I wanted to think about it because I look I'm one of the you
*  know, I love one thing that Max Holloway always says says it is what it is and
*  It's a simple philosophy. It is what it is, but it's also it's a good way of looking at things
*  It's like what are you gonna do? You're gonna freak out? It's not gonna change it
*  It is what it is and this was this is what it is right now. It is what it is
*  We're inside all day, you know, if we go outside we go outside for a hike. There's no people there, you know
*  Come here stay away from everybody. No hugging. No kissing
*  Everybody just distance and we do our social distancing and wait it out and just this is life right now. We're still lucky
*  We're still not look Justin Ren comes here
*  a couple times a year after he gets back from the Congo, okay, and
*  Justin goes over the Congo. He sleeps in a grass hut and he's come back with so many different fucking diseases
*  He's got malaria three times now. We have so he has some new parasite that they don't they haven't identified. They don't know what it is
*  He he's worried. It's in his brain because he's having some shakes and some chills and some
*  Some issues that lead him to think that it's connected to the whatever the fuck this parasite is so they keep running tests on him
*  They have these top
*  Vial
*  Virologists that are examining him but he's deep deep deep deep deep in the Congo
*  So who knows what the fuck's in there? There might be some new shit in there
*  he might literally have some new shit in his body right now and
*  You know this guy keeps going back. He goes back because he's compelled. He's his
*  His mission in life is to improve the lives of all these people that he met there it's changed his perspective, you know
*  he's an amazing amazing person and
*  He's constantly doing that like that guy is so happy and so friendly
*  And I think one of the reasons why is because his perspective like he knows what it's like
*  Where these people live he visits them, you know, he stays with them for months at a time
*  He knows what it's like and he knows how lucky we are over here. We're lucky as fuck
*  So if right now we can't do stand-up
*  You and I are extremely fortunate. We have podcasts, you know, so you could just do your podcast instead
*  What do you do it two days a week do it three do it three. You probably you'll be fine
*  You know give plenty chances to rant rave only have people over that you trust, you know, no one's sick
*  Don't touch anybody wipe everything down wash your hands take a lot of vitamin C eat healthy take all your vitamins
*  Make sure you get good rest get in a sauna if you can, please get in a sauna
*  They have them. I mean, I don't know if they have my gyms fuck. You can't go to gym
*  I can't do dick. Nobody's got a fucking song get in the get in the hot tub
*  Then nobody knows where the fucking go to a sauna. Everybody has a sauna
*  I wish I have what you're lucky as fuck. I wish I could do a thousand things, but you can't they were also saying
*  One good thing just elevate your body temperature
*  Just elevate your body temperature like by working out and breaking a really good sweat
*  You know that that actually has a good effect on your immune system as well
*  Even if you like exercise in a hot room, you kick up your immune system
*  You have to do anything crazy, but what you're doing is you're you're introducing those
*  Cytokines those heat shock proteins just wear a bunch of layers and get a get a decent workout and really get hot and sweaty
*  It's good for you. All that stuff's good for you if you look at
*  Like the first thing
*  after benefits of working out it's always
*  Lowing your stress
*  Working on your blood pressure. Yeah, this is the opposite. This is the times right now a debilitating that yeah
*  Like if you went to acupuncture, I had the ability to go to acupuncture right now
*  I know he'd tell me like all this shit is low. They make you grab the thing
*  All the shit is low like all your chakras are blocked like shit like that
*  All that shit is probably running low like you need help with your immune system
*  yeah, even though you haven't been doing much because just the
*  subconscious thought that
*  Thoughts that we have now
*  You know, we start to sit this shit goes deep into your subconscious. That's what happened to me
*  That's why I had my little nervous breakdown on the night that you're Romero fought
*  So tell me you this is you were kind of getting into it
*  You were your friend invites you over his house to watch the fights and you look I can't and you had a breakdown
*  I didn't me over like Wednesday
*  And I'm like absolutely if not, I'm just gonna sit here at home and watch him by myself
*  Like I always do or I'll go to Brett's house
*  All right, you know Brett. Yeah John John, right go to Brett's
*  That night he called me like on Wednesday. He was really doing Saturday
*  I'm getting a catered couple people coming over love for you to come over. He broke his leg skin. Oh, no
*  So I haven't break his leg skin
*  Three months of surgery and the whole fuck. Oh, no fucking metal in his leg
*  Main dog so I before I went to young crutches still yeah. Yeah, he just got off maybe a week ago
*  What a time to have just got off of a fucking surgery
*  When this shit is going down, yeah, he beat the surgery curve like by three weeks four weeks. Oh my god
*  Imagine I'm okay all day. I'm with the family
*  Fucking six o'clock comes. I gotta jump in the shower
*  It's basically where he lives jump over Laurel Canyon make a right go a mile past the communist. Oh, that's it
*  For some reason man. I wanted to shower in the shower
*  Just getting a regular heartbeat I
*  Came out
*  Medication got dressed. What are you taking?
*  They give me a point two five whatever I don't take them. What is it like?
*  Stenazol whatever the fuck they call it Xanax whatever take Xanax. It's a football. It's the baby one
*  It's not the sticks the junkies take it
*  The little fucking
*  So you got a little anxiety so you took his annex so I took how often you take those things
*  Most of the time between you and me I wash them my wife washes them
*  Does that put them in my drug pocket?
*  And you forget they're in there and I forget they're in there and I throw them in the hamper
*  And then my so between you and me I wash more than I eat
*  And I only get like he gives me if I ask him he'll give them to me I ask him for like maybe two prescriptions
*  You know to just keep them around just in case what does it do? I've never done it
*  I just in case I get that Morgan Murphy freak out like Morgan Murphy. What's her name? What's her name Morgan Murphy? Yeah
*  Yeah, one night. I had a file over at the store. I don't know what it was
*  Fucking walked up the stairs and my anxiety lit up really I almost passed out
*  I went up there and destroyed the room. I came out of a fog at the 13-minute mark
*  I didn't know what to come out of my mouth. I didn't know what I said anxiety
*  And you were on the Xanax or the anxiety no no just anxiety so what up there, and I just got this weird anxiety
*  And I remember reaching over to Paulie sure I'm going Paulie. Can you go up there for me? I can't do it right now
*  What are you talking about buddy? You have to go up next time like fuck you
*  I got so fucking mad. I went up there leveled it, but I was in a coma. I was a calm. I was you high
*  No, no my body was so I had so much anxiety
*  It was just I was just spewing. I was like Roseanne Barr at night. I was just saying shit
*  I was just talking
*  Remember when I got off the stage Paulie sure told me you should get anxiety a lot more often
*  Because that was fucking phenomenal as a fight. Well. I just worked myself up
*  You know you work, and I worked myself up that much
*  That night I wanted to see your Romero. I definitely want to see Joanna
*  Against Ching whatever whatever Wiley's young Wiley's young I wanted to see her so and all of a sudden on it
*  Joe Rogan it was I was getting a stroke I
*  was gonna take mushrooms and
*  Not eat them, but I was gonna take mushrooms with me in my jacket how long you know me
*  20 years I'm not scared of nothing I would end the car I went in the car
*  Pulled the car the driveway went like six steps stopped the car and then sat there for ten minutes deciding whether I should take
*  The mushrooms I'm gonna get stopped by the cops. I had no edibles in me no nothing
*  There was no reason for this paranoia. It was just my mind playing tricks on me
*  I started walking in and out of the house
*  In and out of the house like I was gonna about to have a stroke. I couldn't control myself
*  Should I take the keys? I know I forgot something you weren't high no
*  Let me go get the fucking Xanax just in case I get a fucking
*  Should I bring an edible now? I won't bring an edible. Yeah. Yeah, let me go back inside and get an edible
*  I was that that was my acting I'm not gonna wear this shirt. I should wear a different shirt anywhere this year
*  Just went through this whole fucking and I finally said stop
*  Jodeas get your shit together cocks. So this is when I turned Joe dears. Yeah, let's go. Let's go motherfucker
*  We're gonna go. Let's go. Come on. What are you fucking pussy? What are you fucking pussy? I got in that car
*  They do like 90 down, Laurel Canyon. I went over there
*  He had some why you beef for me with some lobster mashed potatoes and shit and we just watched the fight
*  We had a great time. There was a dude there who was turning me on to medical shit telling me to fucking inhale silver
*  Oh block the fucking
*  Little block the fucking thing
*  Coronavirus yeah, yeah, it was great. But you know what that night I realized I was just having a fucking
*  This can't happen. No more. Mm-hmm. That's the type of shit. I like to avoid. I don't like that
*  It's like the first time I got high I took an edible and went to jujitsu and somebody mounted me time out
*  Get off, please. Get off
*  Please you gotta get off me
*  Please please get off me, please
*  I had to go outside take my gear off and take my dick out and pee in the street as cars went by
*  That's how bad when I get anxiety
*  Really? I get anxiety. Yeah, I gotta pee right away
*  So like when I go lift on Mondays and Thursdays I go live for the trainer when she puts 400 on the squat machine
*  And I got a fucking squat as soon as I put the back. I gotta go pee. She's like, where you going?
*  I go my body just wanted to shock
*  My body just wanted to shock. That's how you could tell and when I gotta go I gotta go
*  My first three months of jujitsu. I learned the hard way never take an edible
*  No bueno, don't be taking an edible at 10 in the morning go to jujitsu at 6 it comes back
*  Hmm, even if it's gone it revisits you the first time somebody threw a mount on me dog
*  One of those heavy judo ease on I didn't even know the lightweight geez yet
*  Oh my god, Joe Rogan. I had to call a timeout
*  Like it was over had to run outside take my G off my key top off and just take my dick out and piss
*  Cars are going by Burbank Boulevard. I'm just paying I don't give a fuck about the cops. I tell them the truth
*  I get these huge anxiety
*  Serges yeah when I work out heavy like heavy weights
*  I gotta go to the bathroom before and before I get my car. I think a long does that and does the
*  Medication help you
*  When you take in a Xanax not if you don't take it right, but I got shit to do in the daytime dog
*  I got no time for a fucking Xanax. I don't know what kind of what does it do?
*  That's what I'm asking. Well, I'll tell you what happens with Xanax
*  I know for a fucking fact that nobody could tell me when I first got into comedy how I
*  Joey D is the secrets of comedy you ready? Okay, when I got into comedy all these jerk cars
*  You gotta bring five people to a fucking show
*  I
*  Mean asking nobody to come to a show
*  I just wait for Joe Rogan to call me and ask me who wants weed you want weed meet me at the comedy club
*  I gotta meet you the comedy club. Don't worry about it. Just meet me there next thing. I got you paying ten at the door
*  So I got into selling Xanax
*  There was a crazy guy in Boulder which is gotten out of prison for murder and his wife
*  I don't know they were getting Xanax's from a pharmacy
*  So I was getting
*  Valiums the V's
*  The one with the V's you know anything
*  Ten milligrams you could sell those for two bucks a piece. He was giving it to me for like a quarter
*  So when I first was an open mic or I was a Xanax sells me but it always because I got into a contest
*  So for me to win the contest I had to have people there. So they would say when can we buy some Xanax?
*  You gotta meet me at the broker
*  So I would make the all of them will come up to me. Go what the fuck's wrong with you?
*  Ten dollars to get in there you gotta take that off the price of the pills. Don't worry about it
*  I got you covered. I had such a high profit margin. It didn't really matter
*  So I would sell Xanax to people in the hundreds 20s tens coke heads loved those things
*  So what was I was a coke head? I loved I could eat ten of those. What does it do?
*  Knocks you the fuck out like how like you're gonna pass out you could die like that when people D
*  That's what they eat fucking Xanax and they fucking I thought it just relaxes you it relaxes you but if you eat 50 of them
*  You're gonna die. I was eating 50 of you eating 50 in a day dog
*  I eat 30 of them in three days in Beaumont. It took me five days to recover
*  I told you I OD in Beaumont, Texas in 19 and 2005
*  From eating 30 10 milligram volumes. That's a lot the problem with that shit me is you ready?
*  This is what I realized
*  2030 when I was an open mic, I was selling them. I was dating a chick that didn't do didn't get high
*  So for me to be around I
*  Would pop those anti bars and I would be I'd I'd be good enough for me
*  So I was used to pop them like six of them. I had my tolerance up there fucking high
*  And why did you like it?
*  Because I would drink with them. I would drink like one or two drinks. You feel tremendous
*  That's it. Just wanted to like how do you feel like fucked up?
*  Fucked up two drinks and a couple Xani bars you get fucked up
*  This is before the Xani bars. I'm not supposed to drink on right no
*  No
*  But I would get fucked up and then I do comedy and eat two volumes and drink with the
*  The waitress is I was an open mic a guy, right?
*  You know, but the point to my story is that if you eat 10 milligrams of a valium
*  Five of it your body utilizes five of it
*  The other five go into your fat and your body holds on to it to the user. Is this science? Yeah
*  You forget you're dealing with here so what happens is when you eat that shit it sticks into your fat
*  So every time I would get high
*  I fucking not the Xanax would come out of your it would agitate the fat and fucking
*  It would agitate the Xanax out of my fat if you jogged would you get high? Oh fuck?
*  Yeah, does your body start dog? I've been off a coke for 12 years at the seven-year mark
*  I'd be working out from time to time and I'd bump into a coke rock
*  I just went through my system and I get all paranoid and creepy for a minute
*  like I was still digesting shit throughout the years, but I
*  Believe that those bars and all those little
*  Xanny things sticking to your fat and then they get me tired the next day. Yeah, don't get me tired now like if I
*  Six of them I'll get tired. I only want
*  One sometimes I get really high anxiety before I'm about to go up and I'll eat another one once I get down there
*  But then I won't even for four days
*  Mm-hmm if I don't need them until and then sometimes I remember to take it out and put them in back in the thing
*  Sometimes I just throw them in the hamper
*  One of my friends who takes them says that when you get off of them very highly addictive
*  Well, he also said that when you get off of them, it heightens your anxiety a rubber band effect
*  That's what he was saying for him personally. I'm gonna tell you what I just realized what these fucking things
*  These things are the worst things I have the ear things. This is the worst thing. Why because my hearing was better
*  Before I got these really you told me something once that when you're doing when you're doing the jack
*  When you're doing the baban yet to get you stronger that your nutsack disappears. So when you go off the baban
*  If you're doing steroids your body's endocrine system shuts down so it no longer produces testosterone. Is that true? Yes
*  Yes, your ball shrink is that true no the balls don't really shrink, okay, so but they don't work anymore
*  Since then I put any work. I feel with this ever since I got these hearing aids to clarify my hearing
*  Mm-hmm. It's made my hearing weaker
*  It doesn't make my hearing is it true or anymore. I'm walking you aware of the fact that you're hearing bad
*  No, my hearing was not going bad. Joe Rogan. I was hearing things out of place. I
*  Was hearing the wrong things if I went to dinner with Joe Rogan
*  It was fine if you and I had a conversation if you brought your wife
*  I'm gonna have a hard time in a restaurant. You wouldn't hear I wouldn't hear none of you. I would just hear
*  Jamie's table on the other side of the room. I could hear his conversation more than yours
*  Really and I could hear that the silverware hit the table and I can hear the dishwasher washing dishes
*  And every time this fork would hit the fucking thing I hear that shit every time a fork hits at a restaurant
*  I would be every time I was at a restaurant if it was me and you were having a good time
*  But once you throw Ari and Duncan in the mix, I'm just basically yes in you to death really. Yes. That's how bad it was
*  What is that called?
*  Is there a name? There's a couple different names for it
*  You know and then somebody told me they kind of had it I
*  Go why do you wear those now? Like I don't know for years
*  I went to concerts and then it got to the point where I heard too many things. I just needed to narrow it down
*  Hmm, so I finally figured out with these I don't have them on loud. I'm on low
*  Because if not, you hear fucking everything like I was getting high and fucking hearing everything you get it
*  It's great. You hear every you get high you fucking hear everything
*  so they have these new air pods now that have
*  They have sound deadening. So it's a the they sit in your
*  Noise canceling so you put them in and you can either turn noise canceling on or you can turn them into transparency mode and
*  Transparency mode the microphone actually picks up the stuff that's outside
*  Have you tried that yet Jamie? Yeah, so it makes things sound louder than they are
*  Like you can hear things better
*  in the way
*  It seems to me, you know, I don't have any hearing issues people that maybe to have you don't have hearing issues
*  Whatever it might make it sound better. Yeah. Yeah, I don't have any hearing issues
*  But when I put those things on I can hear things louder. I can hear stuff like further away
*  It's like I don't think I can hear them talking if it wasn't for
*  Noise cancellation works. There's microphones on the outside that like flip the frequency and it cancels it out
*  Oh, that's how it works. And so by not flipping it over. It's just adding to it. Hmm
*  Does it what is the number is it like one and a half times louder than it normally would be is there a number when
*  You add 3 DB, which is not a lot that doubles sound
*  that's like
*  It's like it's an intensity of the sound is more it's doubled the it's really hard
*  It's like a math equation with sound it's interesting because that's one area where Apple has just stolen the show when it comes to
*  Apple versus Android like phones are pretty comparable. I haven't tried them, but I've heard that
*  Samsung maybe has a galaxy bugs close to it or the very people like them also they're very good
*  But they don't have the sound canceling. They don't have noise canceling and the the Apple ones
*  Did I think the sound quality has been reviewed as being better too?
*  There they just they have they figured out how to make it like you you just open it up, right?
*  You pull it out of your pocket you open it up
*  But ask if you want to connect you press button boom and connect stick it in your ear and you're perfect
*  And for me, it's so much better than a hands-free system when you're driving in the car
*  I just have it in my ear and I double tap on that instead of it going through the whole car and hearing it in
*  The speakers and everyone I just hear it in my ear like I would a normal
*  Normal conversation I would have with air pods on there's another level you could probably get into that
*  I don't think you have any air monitors, which I know like Burt has yeah Tom and Christina
*  Have those of the UFC when I go into the octagon I'm doing an interview
*  I have an in-ear monitor in you can get really good ones for music
*  They have like eight different speakers in that little tiny thing. Yeah. Well, I have a pair of sure
*  Headphones for they work on my laptop. They don't work on iPhones anymore
*  Obviously, but they have drivers in them and they're like suit. They're like this clear coating over silver cord
*  They're like pretty high-end fuck. They sound good
*  but you know, it's
*  For the little ones you carry in your pocket like air pods, that's a goddamn genius invention
*  Way more easily replaceable for 250 bucks than a 3000. Yeah easily replaceable and they just work so well
*  They work great. Which of these air pods and pods. Yeah, there's little things. There's two kinds
*  There's the kind that are noise canceling and then the other kind most of the time
*  I actually have both but most the time I use the regular one because it sits in my ear better
*  The noise canceling I feel like I got to jam it in there a little bit
*  But it's great. You can talk to people while you're driving. It doesn't have to go through your the system in your car
*  you know if you have a
*  Bluetooth setup you don't have to hear it in the speed. Yeah, you don't hear in the speakers
*  Hey your music or exactly rock your music you could stay music on the radio
*  you know, you said something to me and I realized like that that's something that I do and when I do it I probably
*  Some of my best results is you were saying a couple years ago you stopped listening to music driving to the store. Absolutely
*  Yeah, absolutely
*  My car that I have some of my my some of my favorite sets
*  After I drive there is a car doesn't even have a radio that little Porsche that I have the red one
*  Because it's so it's old and it's like real loud and it's fucking
*  It's real mechanical and I'm just I'm so engaged with it
*  By the time I get to the comic store my brain is firing right I've been doing something with it
*  I'm not just pressing autopilot and just sitting back and relaxing on my way to the store and riding on this fucking cloud
*  Like the Tesla with that little Porsche. It's like you're you hear all the gears you feel it when you're shifting gears
*  It's like you're engaged no music when you get there
*  You let your brain is fired and you can think about stuff
*  While you're driving there instead of like I like listening to sets I listen to a lot of my sets, but I also like
*  The guy like doing that before shows like listening driving to a show and listening to a set
*  But I also like sometimes not listening to shit
*  Just letting my brain get into a good creative place
*  Just go over the bits go over what I like about him what I don't like about just make make myself
*  Concentrate on them with no paper. No nothing. Just drive it and concentrating on the bit. I
*  Wanted I heard years ago
*  That I don't know how true it is you know what fucking act is you hear all this fucking Milwaukee
*  But I heard that Denzel would sit in the room once a day and go through all his emotions
*  Until he drove himself to tears
*  Just to check himself for the day Wow, and I said how can I do that as a stand-up? I?
*  Don't need to fucking cry. I'm not in the business to make people cry
*  So I don't need to cry. I
*  Just need to be the best me do you know that I went to Anthony Robbins right? You know I'm a big Anthony Robbins
*  You know that right? I know that you have talked about Anthony Robbins before I went
*  I do believe in a lot of what he's saying yes
*  I think that a little bit you know I mean dog when I went to see him
*  I was a burglar and up a kidnapper something happened. He got through to me. You know I'm saying he made me fucking he works
*  This shit works. I'm looking to another level so I am mad at Anthony Robbins. You know I'm saying I got caught
*  I fucked up Anthony was on the right pace. I used to listen to his cassette tapes
*  I really do believe stimulus take you there something that you do to take you to that mind
*  Okay, he believes that there's something that we do
*  You can put yourself in the state put yourself in that state. Yes, you know I really believe there's something to that
*  Yeah, for sure okay the reason why sometimes you're calling me and you're like Joey. What are you doing? I'm not being honest with you
*  I'm telling you I'm writing or whatever
*  I'm watching paparazzi
*  I'm watching the most most obscure people who are performers. Why wouldn't you tell me that why you lying to me because not you
*  But my wife will go you know what are you doing in there? I'm writing. I'm not writing
*  I'm watching BB King live writing in a way watching BB King live from Africa
*  And I'm watching BB go into a place that I could only dream into going
*  But I've probably been in my 28 years of doing comedy. I've been in there 200 times I
*  Want to learn how to get there more?
*  So I believe that on the way down to the store
*  Some mornings I do it
*  Just drive without the car on and think of a specific time in my life
*  Bad or good break down the situation and see what happens
*  I'm not breaking open a scab, and I'm not going to see a psychotherapist
*  I just want to see how I feel about that situation today. Mm-hmm. You know I always do I always do that like right now
*  Reflecting right now alone right right now. I'm thinking a lot about
*  Falling in love with comedy the shit. I did Stan Hope
*  Coming over to my house as a feature act first, and I was an MC at the broker on Tuesday nights
*  1991
*  Stan Hope comes as a feature if anybody ever did that run you knew that the triple run started Tuesday in Boulder and
*  Wednesday you had off and then Thursday you had Craig, Colorado
*  I was divorced, but I had a condo out of two bedroom two and a half bedroom condo if the comic was cool on Tuesday night
*  I didn't buy them to sleep over so you wouldn't have to pay for a hotel
*  Mmm, you know I'm saying I'm not even happy. He just he only made 75 bucks right now
*  You got to pay 48 for a hotel crazy, so if the comic was cool on Tuesday nights like right man
*  If you want to spend the night tomorrow give me a call tonight you got the hotel here
*  But if you want to drive to Craig spend the night first time Stan Hope came he was a fucking
*  feature act
*  The second time that motherfucker came he stayed at my house I
*  Walked him to his car and brought him like food down. He had an apartment. He had like a one-bedroom apartment in this car
*  And I'll never forget saying what the fuck is this and he's like I'm homeless
*  But this is what you got to do if you want because he was a real road dog
*  Yeah, he lived in his car a real road dog. Yeah, so I took his fucking advice
*  You know that fucking and June of 95 I said I'm getting a car
*  I'm the stick in the back just like him. I had a frisbee in there a basketball
*  I had everything you could have in there remember those things that you put in your radiator the metal and if you've ready a the blue
*  Fix your radiator. Yeah, oh when you're broke that shit for dollar fix a flat takes a flat
*  Oh my god living out of your car on the road is a character builder
*  It's a what character builder every comic that I know that ever did that some of my favorite people
*  You've gone through some shit
*  You know road gigs man people that did road gigs. That's a different world man
*  I remember when I was doing road gigs sometimes the booking agent particularly if I was a middle act
*  They would bring in a headliner from New York and a lot of times of these guys. They were club guys
*  like
*  God, I forget the guy's name, but he was a an old club act who?
*  Worked around New York City
*  He never really did the road just did New York City and he and I did a gig together in Burlington, Vermont
*  And you can see this is like a rare thing for the guy the guy didn't have a car because he lived in New York
*  And didn't know how he was gonna get around
*  He had have someone drive him up from the city wanted to get a ride with me
*  It's like man. I'm not giving anybody a ride of Vermont that I don't know like that's just too weird
*  You know this this gig doesn't pay that much anyway
*  But that those guys that didn't do the road when they did man they were like a fish out of water
*  They had like New York City jokes nobody gives a fuck about New York City when they're in Burlington, Vermont
*  Oh, they go right to the old reliable. Yeah, what do you do for a living?
*  There was so many comics though in New York that they would work the crowd because the crowds are on top of you
*  The crowds are on top of you in New York
*  You know the stages were so small because real estate was so precious that the club was stuffed
*  People would be stuffed into some of those places like stand-up, New York remember how small that stage was or Boston comedy
*  You're right with the ear. Yeah, nothing fucking with you. No it just gets itchy. Oh, I
*  Remember fucking New York comedy club was on 74th Street. I don't remember yet in the 74th on the west side
*  I
*  Sussman used to live close to them. Mm-hmm
*  But that room was small and I like a little stairway on top of you yeah, I can have like a staircase that was
*  Right on top of you there. That was stand-up, New York the old one
*  Used to be a New York comedy club guy in 91 that's who took me in in 93
*  I forget what his name is he's very decent to me
*  That's how I ended up meeting Mikey Bouchetti
*  Who is now already Lang's? Hey, how's already doing?
*  Is he doing I checked his you know, I was a suffering from anxiety anxiety
*  Yeah, I went when I went to New York. I was scheduled to do his podcast that Wednesday and he canceled
*  So obviously he's still struggling
*  He's not using he's not using no he did a podcast with me
*  at
*  Legion of skanks place it was amazing
*  He was great. It was great to see him sober and so so alert present so there so honest and fucking hilarious
*  He's like as funny as he's ever been fucked up nose
*  Laughing about it doesn't know fuck talking about what he did. He snorted glass
*  Snorted glass his girl broke up these pills with a fucking
*  Salt shaker and cracked it and got glass in and he snorted glass his nose is bleeding
*  And he also got knocked out by a guy who he owed money to
*  Guy who he owed money to hired some kid to collect and the guy punched him in the nose and smashed his nose
*  And so he had a double whammy happened two things at the same time smoking a snorting glass and then that brute dude
*  He was so funny. He was so funny and he was so alert. It was great
*  It was like the already I knew years ago, but even better like I don't think I've ever known already sober
*  You know the circle of
*  There's a circle. It's a spiraling out of control you get involved. Hmm when you
*  When you're going through it, you're not seeing it. Yeah, once you've done it and you have the balls and you look back
*  They're all hilarious. I
*  Went through it. They're all hilarious. You just keep getting in trouble. Isn't it funny though that that's a human pattern
*  It's a fun it's a funny pattern that's so many humans
*  Garage
*  The cops came down. It's things that would never ever happen under regular circumstances
*  But the funk of the drug
*  It just hits you at one time where?
*  member that
*  Everything listen nobody drives to an open mic with a Lamborghini
*  You know, right you never see nobody pull up to an open mic with a Lamborghini
*  Nobody does cocaine or heroin the second time because they had a bad time doing it
*  Right you do have a really good time at first or it seems like you're having a good time
*  Your body left an opening somewhere. Mm-hmm. You know, just how are your immune system could let him Corona bit
*  Then sometimes your soul just has a weakness somewhere and that's when the coke or the heroin comes in
*  Mm-hmm. I know in his mind right now. He's like fucking heroin
*  Really? Right how crazy was I caught up in this shit? So then he went down this fucking
*  Just hold you know, and that's what rehabs do they catch you they slow you up
*  They try to identify the problem
*  With him was this father was it the firing of
*  You know
*  The radio guy no, he had a problems way before that he had problems when he was on mad TV what said him right, you know
*  That's what the rehab does
*  You know, that's what what sets you the fuck off and you got to get yourself away from that
*  I found out what set me off over the years, you know
*  There was a time that I could sit here for hours with you talk. I'm out on bail and
*  I'm fucking out on bail kidnapping. I don't bail for second-degree kidnapping
*  Second degree assault, you know, I got the works drawn at me and I'm fucking going into Sears every day and
*  clipping
*  tense Bruce Springsteen double set CDs born in the USA
*  They're going for $80 whatever they were going for
*  $40 I'm getting 22 a piece. I'm taking two a day. I'm walking with the small 220
*  I got a hundred for coke 50 for weed and 50 for lunch. That was it. I
*  Still remember like doing this for a month
*  Like just like my addiction
*  Had me on this schedule that I wasn't gonna work when I'm out on bail
*  I'm gonna go to see his road bug every day and Rob born by the USA
*  They even had him right by the door. I didn't have to do much work
*  I just had a walk in walk into Sears may believe I was looking for a hammer and then on the way out
*  I just take a four of them put him in my shirt and walk us one day Joe
*  I'm gonna pick up like ten of them because instead of four
*  Why am I gonna take four? It's like the guy says in Narco. You're gonna move a kilo
*  You might as well move to you're gonna move to you might as well move five. You're gonna move five
*  You might as well do ten what's the difference?
*  So instead of taking four boxes, I started taking like tens
*  Like I would walk out of that Joe Rogan like a CD fucking thing and one day I walk out of here
*  We gotta go. Hey you stop right there. And I'm like
*  What are you talking about? He's like come back with those CDs. They're chasing me in Boulder
*  Hmm in the parking lot of Crossroads mall here
*  I am getting chased one security guard in the car and the other guy on foot I could beat him both up by the way
*  Like I could beat them fuck up both of them, but I just can't have no problems
*  So what am I doing? I'm whipping CDs at him as I'm running and the guys like hey stop that
*  What made me think I was gonna get away
*  And then I run up I had him I had him and I run up to the top of the road
*  There's about that 28th Street Boulder police is coming right at me and I had to stop
*  Give him a fake name and fucking you know, here I am out on fucking bail
*  Why am I robbing fucking seat? Why were you addicted to it to the thrill? I
*  Was addicted to snorting coke and getting my dick so do you think there was a little bit of an addiction to the thrill stealing?
*  Oh, I loved all that shit cuz you loved all that doing that shit later on with like lighters and shit
*  Oh, I love all that shit if I'm not in trouble for something
*  Listen, I just smoked three joints with you here. Well look. Hi to you. No, you look fine
*  Don't do nothing no more. Well, it gets you to a good place, but the reefer lets me know
*  I'm still nothing has changed about me. I could be an AA right now and be clean and sober
*  I don't do enough to warrant being fucking unsold
*  This just lets me know I'm okay. It's like a teddy bear. It's like when people suck that though
*  That's all this is for me reefing that doesn't really get me blasted no more. I just told you that
*  Listen, I'll give you one of these capsules
*  You won't see daylight till tomorrow. Okay, the TAC capitals off these things right here
*  The strongest things in the bar what's in there?
*  AB is fucking hash oil a little bit of oxygen
*  Oxygen
*  TAC how many you taking I can pop two in the afternoon 200 milligrams then take another 200 tonight
*  And I'll be okay once no, I got this new thing called quick Z quick Z quick Z
*  What is that? It's a little container if you want to sleep
*  You come see me quick Z quick Z what's in it?
*  melatonin like triple
*  Anything that puts you to sleep naturally mm-hmm. They've put it in there plus a hundred milligrams of either sativa
*  Indica or hybrid marijuana whoa and you drink it dog first night drank it I found myself
*  Usually I fall asleep like you do like this writing read the computer and you like this yeah
*  That's a B is this one
*  I'm away from the computer right I actually back away and just and then slump
*  Have you done that one Joe? I'm sure I've done that one. Yes, you have yeah last week
*  No two weeks ago. I got so fucked up cuz I thought I was gonna go to New York and die from the Corolla
*  But I actually drank that shit. I ate two pills. Oh my god. I ate two of these first nothing happened
*  I come like fuck
*  Nothing's happening, and I drank the fucking liquid
*  Something started to happen, but it wasn't going fast enough. It was like 1015
*  I wanted this down when we go to bed, so I popped two more oh my god
*  They all hit me at once like a Larry Holmes
*  Fucking left hook that night. I woke up on the floor
*  I fell off the chair and the heater woke me up. I have a here in my office my birth my back was on fire
*  I'm like why am I on fire here right?
*  I woke up dog in a trance. I went into the kitchen
*  I opened up the refrigerator and I pulled out a half a pound of deluxe bought that cheese that shit just bought an
*  American cheese and I took a pack of saltine crackers cuz in my mind. I'm not eating bread. I'm okay
*  I'm not eating bread. I'm ahead of this motherfucker
*  Crackers dog I ate the whole half a pound of deluxe ham wow and the whole thing of American cheese
*  Sliced in with crackers, and I just went to bed
*  I woke up the next morning. I took off my mask
*  It was a big chunk of American cheese in the sleep after you've asked didn't have
*  M&Ms in your mask once too. Oh my god. What the fuck did I eat last night?
*  I fucking went out my wife's like Joey
*  What were you thinking? I go? What was I thinking you have no idea what I was going through last night
*  I didn't get into the four in the morning
*  I went to bed at four and the fuck it like I woke up at 330 and was like what the fuck happened
*  Oh my god. I must have went down at a quarter to 11
*  I had been I probably was in this position for an hour, and I just fell off the fucking stool and just lay on the floor
*  Nobody saw me. That's how drilled I got that was I think that was the Wednesday
*  Yeah, that was the 10th. I don't like to smoke and go to sleep. I don't like to eat it and go to sleep
*  I just like to go to sleep when I go to sleep, but when I when I get high
*  Like if I get high before bed, I have to get out of bed
*  I gotta grab the computer because that's when my best ideas come my real yeah
*  My best ideas come like the first hour after getting high like the rush
*  There's like a rush that happens a rush of wild thoughts that happens for like the first like 40 minutes to an hour
*  Right after your high it's like that's when they're pop
*  They're just popping into your head and they're like come on man. Let's dance like you got to get up
*  You can't just try to sleep on that like when those little moments hit I start getting ideas like oh, okay
*  This is a time you got a right
*  Because you know how many times you just go through your day and don't have any interesting ideas
*  And all sudden you get high and they come out of nowhere
*  It's like the most underappreciated engine for ideas ever is getting high
*  It's funny how when I get home at night, I always think of something between the two stages
*  Something always happens between the main room and the original room or vice versa
*  And something always happens how I could do something a little better than what just happened
*  So when I get home, yeah, I do take a piss. I wash my hands. I
*  That's the best time to write my thc t going. Mm-hmm. I got my little three milligrams
*  Tea with the CBN's and shit, they have little breath mints now their
*  Fuck you up
*  Trust me
*  Oh my god, they're called sleep
*  the product is my key Como and
*  it's the tea I drink is called tranquil and it's
*  Every time I got a repicama meal. Mm-hmm and the yorba root. Oh, yeah, you're about my table
*  Yobamata your mat is a stimulant. Well, then it's the cousin
*  Whatever this yob or somebody and then you have three milligrams of THC
*  Ten milligrams of CBN and like all those other things that put you to sleep rosemary
*  They got everything no melatonin
*  But they're fucking pills. It's like a container not like tick like a little tin like a tin of little tiny breath
*  No, you better be careful with
*  Two or three that's it. Yeah, but I also had like 300 milligrams
*  The other things no, no, no, no, they I went to
*  Las Vegas
*  The last road gig I did was Las Vegas. I went with those
*  They were
*  Don't get me wrong. It's not this it's not the THC that kills you it's the CBN
*  Jamie can we find that with CBN is I don't know
*  Right, it's one of the dirty cousins to CBD what is a terpene officially one of the things things in it
*  Think that's like what better it's a great word when you could use the term confidently whenever you can say terpene
*  confidently
*  Terpenes are what you smell
*  large diverse class of organic compounds produced by plants insects
*  strong odor
*  So it's just a component of the plant
*  Here it is
*  It's good for the same stuff CBD is so CBN study benefits include pain relief anti-insomnia promote growth of bone cells
*  antibacterial anti-inflammatory
*  Anticonvulsive and appetite stimulant very interesting. So it sounds real similar to just THC or
*  CBD
*  So just another cannabinoid. Is that what it is? Yeah, there's some new ones
*  they're finding out to like I've gotten THC a which is not psychoactive and
*  There's some other new ones like they're the science is getting
*  To CBD is fucking great for you. It's great for you. It really feels a difference
*  I don't see any downside. I'm not seeing it. I'm looking for it, right?
*  I'm trying to find out is there something this stuff does to you like see just Google
*  What are the negative effects of CBD? I've never heard of any of you. I have a look for him now
*  It's amazing
*  My skin got dry I went somewhere
*  Side effects include nausea fatigue and irritability. No, I doubt it. I think you're just talking to pussies
*  Yeah blame it on that CBD man, it made me have fatigue I was irritable because the CBD
*  You know what you should have
*  A little fatigue at night if you take like
*  More than a thousand milligrams of CBD at night when you get home
*  You work out if you legitimately have an injury
*  Like I know it rests the fuck out of me at night. Like I like all that shit
*  I'd rather take that shit than hit opioids like at this point in my life all that
*  Xanax ambien
*  The ambient makes you do crazy shit
*  Makes you get addicted and makes you say crazy shit, too
*  Yeah, it makes you say do dumb shit at night and make crazy shit, too
*  So, you know what with these every once in a while I go off the deep end
*  I'll make a racist comment or something
*  I can live with that
*  Ambient doesn't write you don't really sleep though. It just kind of puts you away for a little bit
*  Or you don't go through a full sleep cycle, right? Who was telling is that true? You don't go through a full see what?
*  Want to make sure I'm getting this right ambient doesn't allow you to go through a full REM sleep cycle
*  Really? I don't think so. I think it's a different cycle
*  Because when we had Matthew Walker the sleep expert and it was when he was doing very informative podcast the best
*  Yeah, and the one listen, let me tell you something your podcast from Monday
*  The ninth of March or the eighth of March that was the best podcast of the year which one that's the one about that one
*  Broke down the corona virus. Oh, that's this guy one day. I'll stir home. I'll stir home
*  That was the bed. That's the one that put the fear of God into me
*  That's the one that opened my eyes a little bit more
*  Why people were reacting to where they were? Yeah
*  Yeah, that was a there's a wake-up call
*  Wake up call big wake up
*  Hard to find because I would also imagine that any negative effects would be
*  Zapped by the pill industry online to Google it. You know, so it says like I maybe at high dosages
*  It might affect it. But the very first thing I says it says effects of zolpidem
*  Which is ambient had no effects on REM sleep really so I don't but it's like an interesting that's not what Matthew Walker was saying
*  No, I know that
*  You know
*  That you think you're supposed to go there but you don't go as deep as you why don't we Google does ambient
*  Affect do you get real sleep on ambient? How about that?
*  I mean, that's I have to dig through like or and what would you like me to look I guess because the question very first
*  Things that come up are just like blogs about ambient and like yes, I get sleep
*  This is the very first thing they have to go through 12 pages probably a result. Hmm. Yeah, we'd have to figure it out
*  You know what? I need to talk to well, I know that
*  Matthew Walker was talking about the negative effects of it, but I need to talk to someone else and
*  get like the
*  Get the the wrap down or just listen to what he said about it and just get the wrap down because I know there's something
*  To it where it doesn't totally it's not the same as just sleeping eight hours without it
*  You know the same amount of recovery or something
*  it just seems like anytime you could take something it just knocks you out like
*  A chemical just put you out. That can't be good. It can't be good for there's a chemical you take that
*  That crashes you that's not good. You've done some I mean you're gonna recover once you crashed
*  But you've done something very strange. You've taken something that shuts you off just to me that
*  When I'm up, I'm up
*  Am I my up? Oh, okay. Well, I'll get up and then when I'm tired, I'll lay down
*  I'm not taking anything and people like well, I need it for work. Okay, I
*  Get it. You need it
*  It just seems to me that if you want to be healthier taking something that just makes you go to sleep is not
*  I mean, yeah, it's one thing if it's a natural alternative that just
*  Relaxes you in a lap but something that knocks you the fuck out and when you wake up
*  You're in a gunfight with the cops because that's what ambient does you what Kevin James woke up in the middle?
*  I talked about it on one of my specials. He made a fucking turkey went to the grocery store
*  What he made food and people came home and they're like what the fuck who he's like someone broke into the house
*  He thought he went to the supermarket and bought food and made a meal and
*  He thought that someone broke into his house and cooked
*  People are in the middle of a drive on the highway they wake up
*  They have no idea how they got there. They have no idea
*  Some people when they're on ambient, they just ambient walk. They do all kinds of wacky shit. I
*  Think people have committed murders when they're on ambient. I think there was a guy see if that's true
*  So Matthew Walker says that you're not getting the restorative benefits of the environment
*  So Matthew Walker says that you're not getting the restorative benefits of sleep from it. Yeah
*  You're not getting true sleep
*  They switch off the top of your cortex the top of your brain you explained in Dirk magazine and put you in a state of
*  Unconsciousness that's not sleep. That's cryogenics
*  Walker the sleeping pill sleep does not have the same restorative powers
*  There you go immune boosting to emotional resilience
*  So, of course the other stuff that you read was shells
*  By the pill industry trying to fill up the Google search
*  Folks stay up when you're tired go to bed
*  My advice to you
*  You know when they didn't need sleeping pills back in the fucking pioneer days
*  Take a wagon across the country and fight off Indians all day. You could just go to sleep man. You just sleep you're tired
*  Dishes all day. You're tired. You're exhausted. I've always used reefer to sleep early on
*  Pull this thing in here I've always used reefer to sleep a
*  And be I've always used reefer to slow me down a little bit. I know for a fact
*  It always slowed me down. My mind has always been
*  Yeah fucked up like that. So something they should have treated it with something
*  Early on they didn't catch it. They didn't know it existed
*  Now I know how to calm myself down self-medicate
*  You know, I know how to smoke the reefer I'd probably really dig the
*  Meditation the last two weeks and what I saw where it took me from where I was at
*  To where it took me from it helped me it to the main thing was which is accept
*  Acceptance is the main thing in this whole thing that's going on right now
*  Once you accept it, you'll be you'll lose 30 pounds of weight
*  You're gonna live 20 more years
*  Accepting this that you didn't fuck up and nobody around you fuck up you didn't fuck up Joe
*  This is just didn't fuck up because I shot somebody at the store. I acted bad at the store
*  There's nothing to do with us. Right, you know, this is something from life
*  We will all bounce back from this might be a year might take two might take six months
*  You don't know what's gonna happen. I know that it's gonna change people's lives for the better
*  People gonna go you know what? I
*  Didn't want to work in a fucking office. Anyway, yeah, you know what this is gonna make people think from outside the box
*  Which is something they needed. Yeah, so there's both negative and positive from this whole situation
*  How it works for you is up to you
*  How it works for you. It's all gonna be up to you G. Well every time there's a moment of adversity
*  You can you could recover from that if you can recover from that adversity. You have an opportunity to grow
*  It's always there. What was the quote that Rafael Lovato quoted?
*  That inside every seed of adversity is
*  an
*  Inside every adversity is a seed of an equivalent benefit
*  Who is that think and grow rich was that guy's name again?
*  God damn it this weed in your memory
*  Was it being 50? Fuck? No. Yes, Napoleon Hills book very interesting book
*  Rafael Lovato, Jr. He loves that book that book to him is like that's like his his
*  one of his motivational books
*  Joey Diaz, let's wrap this up
*  Three hours in it's always great to see him
*  Great to see you brother, you know, I know Jamie's dying. There's no sports. I've been thinking about him a lot lately
*  What are they doing? Are they gonna just put everything aside for a little bit betting on the weather right now?
*  They're like NASCAR is doing like a virtual league this weekend that they're starting up with some past drivers and whatnot
*  Yeah, I know everything's on a hold. Oh my god
*  You know, I was thinking of doing like some old of the oh my god
*  I watched something really good the other night, but fucking UFC on lease came through for uncle Joey
*  They showed all three Chuck
*  Randy fights right back to another very interesting
*  You know Chuck going in there not training and taking it light get fucking lit
*  Yeah, we're gonna mount them and shit stopped him and then him coming back catch them with that shirt, right?
*  And then him coming back again. That's been great. I wish you could narrate him like the other day
*  I was like, why can't he fucking?
*  I
*  Should call him we should talk to him
*  You know when you and Eddie get together and do that because I even don't know he that's great
*  Right now to get like old fights and put them up and it's not a bad idea
*  No, my god, this is the time to do it
*  We should have a fight companion for old pride fights like get some of the prize. I have no knowledge on them
*  I have dad's we should do like I like I love to go get schooled on
*  over eem yeah beginning
*  The good the Japanese guy which one the one that you Sakuraba Sakuraba. Yeah, I don't know Garrett brothers
*  Yeah, like that's the education ID next. Yeah, that's a great
*  Fight companion with like some of those great old cards. Yes. Yeah, we'll pick out a card pride dynamite or some shit
*  There's so many won't like put together a card of just like top ten fights
*  Oh, yeah, we could totally do that
*  But the best way I think would be if we put it together where they could sync it up like the dark side of the moon
*  And then watch the whole card with us. So we're gonna press play right now. It's starting
*  Here's the first round in three two, you know like that
*  That's like we do with a regular fight so they could they could be synced up so they're watching it with us
*  Yeah, you ever see came through last week. It's a great idea
*  Diaz dad McGregor had everybody on both fights that they ended up with Khabib
*  Diaz didn't ESPN have something like 11 hours of yes. Yeah, they ended up with Khabib
*  Here's the thing about the UFC fights for some strange reason and I'm not sure why they're as
*  Entertaining to watch the second time as anything I've ever
*  I still have Diaz McGregor on my pay-per-view and
*  Khabib McGregor, dude. I've watched John Whaley and and you want to your J check. I watched that five times
*  Yes, I have I watched it on my TV at home. Fuck. I've watched like watching uncut gems
*  It's so good and even better. That was so good. That was so nerve-racking that fight was so crazy
*  I watched that fight a gang of times. I watched the style better. Yo, El Romero fight at least two times. I watched
*  John Jones, Tiago Alves. I watched that. I mean Tiago
*  Tiago
*  Paul no, no, no, no, no Tiago Santos. Jesus Christ. Tiago's chugging Alva's a welterweight
*  Weed I blame the weed but I watched that about I watched the dominant Graves fight a bunch of times
*  I watched that fight at least four or five times watch that fight with a fine-tooth comb and I don't I still can't call it
*  That anybody says that this guy wanted that guy wanted that fight. That's open to interpretation that third round is open to interpretation
*  No question. Dominic Ray is one of the first two no question. John Jones won the last two. It's that third round
*  That third round is like, oh
*  Can we make it even that seemed like?
*  You know, it's hard to say that's a hard-to-say round I
*  Kind of leaned towards maybe Dominic Ray has did enough to win that round because I think he landed more volume in that round
*  But John controlled the center of the octagon John put was starting to put pressure on him. John was starting to catch him
*  Especially towards the end of the round which I always for whatever reason score higher the end of the round to me is like
*  This is when shit's starting to change and then one person might have got a relief from the bell or the other person was gaining
*  Advantage that's what it seemed like at the end of round three. It seemed like John was starting to gain an advantage
*  It's good it's a good fight man Dominic Ray is a bad motherfucker
*  He put on a show you think about what he did and how calm he stayed in front of the goat
*  The guy was beating everybody John Jones is beating
*  Everybody and Dominic Ray has put it to him got it so close that there's a real argument
*  That he might have done enough to win the decision
*  I don't necessarily agree with that argument
*  I think I almost kind of agree with a draw if people saw to draw I could almost see that third round being a draw
*  But I like John winning because John was stronger in the fourth and fifth rounds. I think it means more
*  I think it should mean more. I know it doesn't but it should it's like the fight was going his way
*  He was starting to take over
*  That's what you want to see
*  I mean you want to see the guy who's trying to chase the other guy down and and beat on him at the end of the
*  Fight who's doing that at the end of the fight? Well the end of fight was John Jones, but still
*  impressive
*  But you got to think the Tiago Silva not
*  Tiago Santos fight Jesus Christ
*  Tiago Silva was another bad motherfucker from Brazil, but the Tiago Santos fight was a split decision people forget that
*  I mean, I don't necessarily agree with that. There was a split decision. I thought John won, but
*  It was close enough that one judge disagreed, you know one judge
*  Incompetent or competent you beat a judge gave it to Tiago Santos and
*  You know Tiago Santos put on a hell of a show. It was an amazing fight
*  But I you know John still the greatest of all time if you look at all the guys that he beaten
*  Anthony Smith OSP leota machete or shot Evans just go down the line rampage action. Let's go down the line Vitor Belfort
*  Just go on the line everybody
*  John beats everybody Daniel Cormier twice stopped him the second time John beats everybody John beats everybody
*  So for Dominic Reyes to put on a show like that. See this is why this corona virus is so fucked up for MMA a
*  That people can catch it and get sick and their loved ones can catch and get sick of course
*  But be goddamn there's some good fights that need to be made and how they're gonna make them
*  What are they gonna do Tyson Fury's they're pushing Tyson Fury and Wilder three they're pushing it back
*  They have to they don't know what to do that
*  I think they're gonna try to push it back to July or something right the fall. That's right. It was in July. That's right
*  There's a fight in Vegas in July I'm supposed to be at the Park Theatre
*  In July in Vegas you are the day before the fight
*  Yeah, that the one that's next to the MGM I'm at that place that place where they do the weigh-ins I
*  Don't know who knows if I'll be able to even I don't know I mean
*  Max Holloway said it best it is what it is. Let's get the fuck right it is what it is
*  Hey, we love you people. I love you guys. We do. Thank you for tuning in
