# Joe Rogan Experience #1924 - Andrew Santino
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6.0s)]
*  Hello, interesting team. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10.0s)]
*  Hello, Mr. Joseph Rogan. How are you, sir? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=15.0s)]
*  Good, brother. What's crack-a-lacking? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=17.0s)]
*  Nothing, man. Had so much fun last night. Thank you. Appreciate it. Had a fun show. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=19.0s)]
*  Welcome to God's country. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=23.0s)]
*  It was wonderful. Me, you, Brian Simpson, Tony. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=25.0s)]
*  Fun times. So fun, dude. Cheers, brother. Cheers. Cheers to you. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=28.0s)]
*  Hans Kim. Yeah, Hans Kim. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=31.0s)]
*  That's the first time I've seen him live. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=33.0s)]
*  He's a funny motherfucker. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=35.0s)]
*  Dude, I thought when he walked in there, a little bit of balconies. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=37.0s)]
*  When he walked in the room, he took off his helmet, and he had a jacket on, and I was like, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=40.0s)]
*  this dude bought a bike, huh? I was like, what kind of bike do you have? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=45.0s)]
*  He's like, it's a scooter. I was like, oh. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=48.0s)]
*  He goes, it's very fuel-efficient. That's how he thinks. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=50.0s)]
*  Dude, he's got the get-up, though. He has the helmet, the jacket, matched his shoes. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=54.0s)]
*  I was like, for sure. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=58.0s)]
*  I need to get him a motorcycle. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=59.0s)]
*  He's got to get a bike. Well, there was a bike out back, and I was like, oh, is that Hans' bike? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=60.0s)]
*  That's a nice bike. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=63.0s)]
*  You know what? He should have a Harley. Hans should have a Harley. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=64.0s)]
*  Big handlebars. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=69.0s)]
*  So many guys. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=70.0s)]
*  No, no, those are stupid. You can't steer. Why would you drive around in a bike that's very important [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=71.0s)]
*  to get the fuck out of way of stuff, and your arms are up like this? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=76.0s)]
*  You do not have good leverage. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=79.0s)]
*  Although, if you're lanky, it looks cool. Like lanky dudes, it's kind of like a vibe for them. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=82.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's like a style choice. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=86.0s)]
*  I have a real problem with those handlebars. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=88.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you're not the tallest guy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=90.0s)]
*  That's true, too. But even if I was, I mean, even if you made it to my body. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=93.0s)]
*  Yeah, like here. Yeah. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=97.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's still stupid. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=99.0s)]
*  It still looks dumb. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=100.0s)]
*  Like this. This you could steer right there. Like the race car, the racing bike guys, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=101.0s)]
*  why do they have their handlebars down there? Why? Because that's the best way to steer. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=107.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's efficient. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=110.0s)]
*  Look at that. Come on, son. That's fucking preposterous. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=111.0s)]
*  Yeah, but dude, the style is kind of like there's something about it that makes me go, that's fucking wild. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=116.0s)]
*  There's something about, well, that's not terrible. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=120.0s)]
*  No. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=122.0s)]
*  Like what that guy's got in that fucking, the front of that thing is sick. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=123.0s)]
*  That is sick. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=126.0s)]
*  Hans on that, that'd be sweet. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=127.0s)]
*  Oh, Hans on one with a skull. And look at the back end of it. Look at all that metal and shit. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=128.0s)]
*  Look, I like Hans. He's putting that thing down in three hours. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=133.0s)]
*  No, Hans can handle things. Hans is a black belt in Taekwondo. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=135.0s)]
*  Is he? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=138.0s)]
*  Yeah. What is that skull one? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=139.0s)]
*  Yeah, as a kid I think, well. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=141.0s)]
*  Showing that skull. That is wild. They do some wild shit with bikes. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=142.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=146.0s)]
*  You know, I went for a period of time where I took motorcycle classes and I was ready to ride a bike. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=147.0s)]
*  But then a dude that I worked with on Fear Factor crashed and fucked up his shoulder. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=152.0s)]
*  And then Frank Meir, who worked for the UFC, he got hit by a car and broke his leg and took him out of action for like, he was really never the same again. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=156.0s)]
*  He was like one of the best in the world. He was one of the best in the world for a long time, even after that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=164.0s)]
*  But that was like in the prime of his life. He got his femur shattered to the point where they, I mean, when you get your femur shattered, it's touch and go whether or not you lose your leg. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=169.0s)]
*  And he wasn't the same guy after that, like fighting. It took a long time before he really got his groove back. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=178.0s)]
*  Did you have a bike? Did you ever own a bike? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=185.0s)]
*  No, no. So then that happened. And then a friend of mine saw somebody get hit on a bike all within like two weeks while I was taking classes. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=187.0s)]
*  And I was like, fuck this. And a bunch of the guys that I worked with on Fear Factor, we all went to the classes together. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=196.0s)]
*  And then, you know, a couple of guys that worked in production, one of the guys was a stunt guy. And we all were like, hey, let's get bikes. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=202.0s)]
*  And then one of them kept it. One takes his fucking bike everywhere now. And I always envy him. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=209.0s)]
*  That rebel, that wild motherfucker, he just rides his bike. He said it's the best. He goes, I'm never in traffic. He goes, I ride my bike everywhere. He's a single guy. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=215.0s)]
*  He just gets around. I've thought about it, man, over the years. But I'm sketched out about other people. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=223.0s)]
*  One of my closest childhood friends, him and his wife, both rode professionally like he would do motocross and all that shit and trick shows internationally. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=229.0s)]
*  And then he went to see his wife and his wife overseas and they both gave it up because she, I don't know if she was with them or saw it happen. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=238.0s)]
*  One of her good friends die on a bike and she was like, that's it. Never, never again. And both of them. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=246.0s)]
*  And dude, he was the whole time I knew this kid, when we were teenagers, he was a fucking nut back. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=251.0s)]
*  I mean, he loved bikes, loved anything with two wheels that he could fly. He loved it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=256.0s)]
*  And then as soon as that happened, it was like never again, ever. Fast cars, though. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=261.0s)]
*  A little more protection. Well, a lot more protection. Yeah. You can get in an accident, not get hurt at all. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=267.0s)]
*  I was telling you, somebody rear-ended my Porsche back in L.A. and didn't get hurt. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=272.0s)]
*  That was like fascinating times. I was doing a lot of yoga. I was doing yoga like three times a week. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=277.0s)]
*  And I did it that day. And when the guy hit my car, I was like, well, what are you going to do? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=282.0s)]
*  Like literally didn't. It didn't. It was wild. I was like, this is fascinating. I'm not mad. This dude, the guy didn't have a license. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=287.0s)]
*  It was illegal. And I go, what are you doing, man? And he goes, how to work? I'm like, it's a good answer. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=295.0s)]
*  It's fucking solid answer. The guy has to work. And I'm putting myself in his shoes. I'm like, the fuck would I do if I snuck over here? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=301.0s)]
*  Yeah, fuck it. I'd fucking drive too, man. He just, unfortunately, he was on his phone and there was they had stopped the lanes to move everybody into one lane. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=307.0s)]
*  He didn't see it in time. And he slammed on his brakes and just fucking plowed into me. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=316.0s)]
*  I got hit in my neighborhood. The woman, it was like, this is my first like car accident. I've been like fender bender stuff. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=321.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? But this was like, actually we got hit on our side and I time slowed down a little bit. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=330.0s)]
*  Like it was creepy as shit because I hit the brakes. I had enough time to brake horn turn. I did it almost like simultaneously. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=336.0s)]
*  And I started to slide away from her because I could see she wasn't looking. She came flying out of a driveway. Her head was the other way. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=343.0s)]
*  And as soon as she turned, I swear to God, like out of a fucking movie, like I zoomed in on her eyes. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=349.0s)]
*  Like I saw her fucking eyes and then smoked us right in the side. Everybody was fine. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=355.0s)]
*  But that was like the first time I got into like a real car accident. Legitimate because I've been, you know, nicked, bumped, whatever. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=360.0s)]
*  But nothing like that. That was I had my land cruiser built with rock sliders and metal bumpers just in case it got hit. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=367.0s)]
*  Because when you have a land cruiser and it's elevated, so it's elevated. It's got like a four inch lift and like serious off road. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=376.0s)]
*  It's a apocalypse car. It's got a giant gas tank. I literally got it because I had like I don't trust LA. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=383.0s)]
*  I'm like if shit goes sideways, you got to be able to drive over these hills. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=389.0s)]
*  I need something that can get me the fuck out of here. Like something like if you're on a road and then like the did you hear about those people that died in California? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=392.0s)]
*  This is not I don't think you could have done anything in this circumstance, but they were trapped on a road during a wildfire and the wildfire was moving so fast. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=401.0s)]
*  It killed everybody that was on the road. Burned them alive in their cars. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=411.0s)]
*  That's where you get a land cruiser. Yeah, but even then it wouldn't have helped. It was a bad example. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=415.0s)]
*  You're trapped there too. But the point is like if you have a car, you can't go that way or that way. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=419.0s)]
*  Like you're not going over hills, you know, but if you have like a legitimate four wheel drive off road vehicle, it opens up a lot of terrain to you. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=424.0s)]
*  You can move around better. Yeah. And just a dumb thought. But I was like, OK, and also steel all around it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=432.0s)]
*  So like if someone plows into me from the side, they're going right into those giant steel rock sliders. Everything's metal around you. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=439.0s)]
*  So it's really good for side impacts. How much longer until you get a jet pack? I'm not getting a jet pack. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=447.0s)]
*  Come on, dude. No, I will not be an early adopter. Oh, I do. I don't skydive. If I had the money, I would jet pack the fuck everywhere. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=453.0s)]
*  They only go for I knew this dude back when I used to do the radio in Denver and they had this this fucking guy who was a jet pack guy. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=460.0s)]
*  And this guy had been using these experimental jet packs and he had no knees. His knees were destroyed because you have to land because you have fucking blown his knees out. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=471.0s)]
*  Yeah, but this guy kept doing it. So like before the launch, this guy has to strap his knees in. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=479.0s)]
*  So he has like these crazy braces and strapping his knees down and Velcro in this. I'll go, what are you doing? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=485.0s)]
*  And he goes, did I blow them both by knees out? They're both useless. But he's still flying around in this fucking jet pack. I would do it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=491.0s)]
*  Back then, it could only go up in the air for 30 seconds. Yeah, but now they now they last a long time. I saw the dude doing it over the. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=497.0s)]
*  You have to look it up. How long I saw a guy doing it like over a body of water. Legitimately look like two minutes. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=505.0s)]
*  He was just chilling above the water. You have some with wings now. You see the ones with wings? No. Yeah. See, dude, that this is hot. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=510.0s)]
*  Some dude flying around near the airport with it. There was like reports of them in restricted airspace. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=516.0s)]
*  Yeah, the one place you can't go near where jets go. I want to be near. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=522.0s)]
*  Imagine doing ecstasy and flying around a jet pack. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=529.0s)]
*  LAX jet pack mystery. Pirates report seeing man with jet pack flying near planes above LA. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=532.0s)]
*  That's so wild. That's awesome. Remember, I used to have a joke about it. Where the fuck are the jet packs? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=540.0s)]
*  This was in like 2005. Well, we're here. I thought we'd have jet packs and robot fuck dolls. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=545.0s)]
*  That's what I thought we'd have. Well, you were you were two for two, man. Of course. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=550.0s)]
*  Air car. What is this? Oh my God. It's really it works. And I don't know how we're going to use it. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=554.0s)]
*  But it's a four seater air car. Wait, it's a drone. Does it not have a video of it? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=561.0s)]
*  Of the of a test of like a test run or some shit. Yeah. Fuck. It says preorder. I ain't preorder shit, bro. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=566.0s)]
*  I need to hear some reports. Yeah, test it out, man. Take it for a couple of trial runs. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=572.0s)]
*  It's like an Uber version of it. Why? You could just get it. Oh, that's cool. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=577.0s)]
*  Remember that rental car company? Does that car still company still around? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=582.0s)]
*  Well, you had an app and you just rent a car and they would drive it right to you. Yeah, I think so. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=585.0s)]
*  I think so. They're still around. That's cool how it transforms. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=590.0s)]
*  It's a drone. It's like a drone. Oh my God. And drones today. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=593.0s)]
*  Have you seen those competitions where they have like drone competitions? It's unreal. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=597.0s)]
*  Where they have cones and poles and holes you have to fly through and they [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=602.0s)]
*  get stones and watch the ones where they go through the buildings that that dude. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=606.0s)]
*  It's like you're on a ride. It'll go through building windows sideways, flip upside down, go through different hallways. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=614.0s)]
*  Like this shit is insane. That would be so dope in VR. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=618.0s)]
*  That's what I mean. He'll flip upside down, go through another little tiny holes. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=622.0s)]
*  That's how they're controlling it. They have a headset on like a VR headset and they're watching it in first person. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=626.0s)]
*  Oh my God, the control this guy has is incredible. Yeah, it's unreal. These things are amazingly agile. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=631.0s)]
*  So this is a see if you can find those competitions, Jamie, like because I was watching them on Instagram the other day. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=637.0s)]
*  There were these guys were flying through doorways and little, you know, like they had made a doorway and it's like they have an obstacle course. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=644.0s)]
*  Oh, this one's all lit up with neon. So cool. Oh my God. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=652.0s)]
*  Hard to be to memorize the course to know where the turns are because well, you remember when we used to play Quake dudes would memorize maps. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=656.0s)]
*  Yeah, same thing. Yeah, guys. Well, this looks like he's following that light. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=662.0s)]
*  You see that light in front of him. That's like a trail in front of him. So maybe that's I know they also have the like they have this. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=666.0s)]
*  I also saw someone doing a sim of a fishing sim. We had a real life fishing pole hooked up to a device that was tracking like a tuna. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=672.0s)]
*  I don't know if that's what he was pulling, but they have these also where you can just practice this with a real handset and you're flying it like it would be. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=680.0s)]
*  But it's all fake. It's on a computer. The first question I'd be like, so when I crash this, what does it cost? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=687.0s)]
*  Because I'm crashing that fucking thing immediately. That's so hard to get to this guy's level. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=692.0s)]
*  You have to fuck around with regular drones for a long time. What do they cost? I literally don't know. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=697.0s)]
*  Couple thousand. There's another thing I just saw. It looked like a very goofy video online. I'll try to find it real quick. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=702.0s)]
*  It's like these, but they're attached to a cord like a kite and it's a league where they're racing some. It's a they did do dog fights. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=707.0s)]
*  But you know, it's it's literally like everything else. Like we were just practicing driving golf balls out there earlier. I can't even hit it. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=713.0s)]
*  I'm missing. I'm whacking the ground. I can't. I don't know how to do it. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=722.0s)]
*  We're all you guys are giving me pointers and shit, but I don't. I've never done it. I've done it. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=726.0s)]
*  I went to top golf a couple of times, just whack the ball. I don't know what I'm doing. But when I'm watching you guys, it's fascinating. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=730.0s)]
*  I'm like, how are you doing it? Because you hit it so fucking hard. I fuck. I was trying to show off for Jamie a little bit. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=736.0s)]
*  You can you can drive a fucking golf ball. That shit is impressive as fuck. Your technique is amazing. I want you to come with me. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=742.0s)]
*  So smooth. I would love for you to see it live. I want to see a lot because Jamie talks a lot of shit. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=749.0s)]
*  I want to see you, Jamie and Hinchcliffe going at it. Fuck. Yeah. No, but I'm saying get baked and drive the car. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=754.0s)]
*  Hell yeah. If you see pros live, though, I don't know if you've ever seen pros in person, but it's the way that you're even this gap of you being like, I don't ever golf. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=759.0s)]
*  And then I'm you're like, wow, dude, you're good at that. When I watch those guys, it's it's the same feeling when you go to professional sports and you're like, of course, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=768.0s)]
*  that's un fucking real how good they are. It's like shocking to watch live. And if you are really good yourself and you are really good at golf, then you can really appreciate. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=775.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, dude. Whereas I can kind of appreciate it, but I don't know what's going on. It's sort of like with the UFC. Right. Right. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=783.0s)]
*  When when dudes scramble on the ground and like someone's like an elite jujitsu black belt, the people that are like practicing jujitsu are like, holy shit. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=789.0s)]
*  Look at that guy. Yeah. Like Charles Oliveira. Watch how he cinches this up. Holy shit. Right. You know, when you see like golfing or we have this guy, Fador Gorst came in. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=797.0s)]
*  But how old is Fador? 23? 22? 22? 22, 23 years old. If not the best pool player in the world, top three for sure. We came in here and we played him on that table. It was wild. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=807.0s)]
*  Did you stand a little bit of a chance? I won the first two games. I ran out the first game and I won the second game. Take that, Fador. I got lucky. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=819.0s)]
*  Well, he gave me a shot in the first game. Like, I think he broke and didn't have a shot on the the object ball. He pushed out and I ran out. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=825.0s)]
*  Where's he from? Something like that. He missed. I ran out. I forget. He's from Russia originally. And he's got a green card playing pool in the United States. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=835.0s)]
*  But dude, he is incredible. Like the level between me and him. Right. Who's like, I'm like a B player, you know, probably like you are in golf. I'm like a B player. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=842.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then watching him play like, holy fuck. It's a different world. It's humiliating. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=851.0s)]
*  He's so good. And his cue ball position is so perfect. Like when he's moving the ball around, it's so effortless and smooth. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=857.0s)]
*  And that ball just slides right where it's supposed to go. And then knocks that ball in. The ball slides right where it goes to go. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=867.0s)]
*  And it's all the same speed. It's just a smooth, effortless stroke. Oh, my God. It's amazing. But that's what you do. That's the difference. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=874.0s)]
*  That's what I was like. I'm, you know, mediocre at best at pool, but it's because I don't have my fluidity is off with that. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=883.0s)]
*  I'm not good at it. Where like yours is like that. That's the same thing with golf. It's like it's all fluidity. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=890.0s)]
*  I can play if I played every day for like a year. I could be a shitty pro. At pool. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=895.0s)]
*  Like I go to tournaments and, you know, get knocked out and look like I'd be in like the top 32 of a 50 man tournament. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=903.0s)]
*  But you do good enough to keep up. Yeah. But like I could never keep up with those guys. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=911.0s)]
*  To keep up with guys like Fedor, first of all, you have to be practicing eight hours a day for years. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=915.0s)]
*  It's not just that I could pick up and go eight hours a day and be as good as he is. It's not going to happen. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=921.0s)]
*  The gap is so far. I would have to be like fully dedicated to being a professional pool player because all those guys that are the top of the top, they play eight, 10 hours a day. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=927.0s)]
*  Shane Van Boning, who is one of the best, if not the best in the world, is right there with Fedor. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=937.0s)]
*  I want to have a challenge match with him and Fedor here on that table and just stream it. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=941.0s)]
*  When he would practice his break for five, six hours in a row, just rack the balls like a robot. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=947.0s)]
*  Baa blam rack the balls like a robot. Baa blam rack the balls just over and over and over. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=954.0s)]
*  And he has a hearing aid is he's deaf. He was born deaf. He just shuts his hearing aid off so he can't hear anything. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=961.0s)]
*  All he does is like focus on the task. That's fucking wild. And he's a monster. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=966.0s)]
*  He's the most evil breaker in the world because he'll play 10 ball and he'll break and make six balls in the break. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=971.0s)]
*  So you're playing 10 ball, but he's playing four ball because it's and it's he's not like a big giant guy either. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=977.0s)]
*  It's just a smooth is the way you're driving the golf ball that smooth, perfect technique. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=983.0s)]
*  That's what he has when he drives the cue ball. It's amazing. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=990.0s)]
*  Because you don't need to be. I've noticed some of those guys. I mean, I know almost nothing about pool, but anytime I've seen it like either you shown me is they don't. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=993.0s)]
*  Not all these guys are big boys, but they hit the fucking shit out of it. Even if they're smaller guys, ball do the cue stick rather do the work for them. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1000.0s)]
*  Yeah. When they're doing it, they're not like muscle in it. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1009.0s)]
*  It's like a acceleration of the arm. And there's a thing called a slip stroke where you actually let the cue go and you kind of catch it at the bottom of the cue. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1012.0s)]
*  And a lot of these old time really smooth players, they would play with a slip stroke. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1022.0s)]
*  And when you watch the guy with a slip stroke, you're like, oh my God, like you have to be so advanced to be able to play smooth and effortless with a slip stroke. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1027.0s)]
*  You let go of it for a fraction of a second. You let go of it. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1035.0s)]
*  I've done that on accident. It slips out of your hand. You catch it. But it's because they're cradling that stick. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1039.0s)]
*  They're not gripping it. Like if you watch someone doesn't know how to play, they grab it like a baseball bat. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1044.0s)]
*  But if you watch like Fador or you watch like Efrain Reyes, like the best of the best, they cradle it in their hand. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1048.0s)]
*  They're just great. They're barely holding on to it. And they're letting their arm move and learning to stick to the work. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1055.0s)]
*  I'm choking it out every time. Watch this. Google Shane Van Boney makes six balls in the break. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1061.0s)]
*  You watch this dude break and it's I know it's just breaking in pool, but it's perfection. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1066.0s)]
*  It's like something. It's like you see Jiro dreams of sushi. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1073.0s)]
*  I love it made that dude work on the eggs for like a year. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1077.0s)]
*  That's all he did was try to perfect and the one son did it forever. Did still didn't give him a didn't promote him. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1080.0s)]
*  No, he's like, not good enough. He's like, he's like, it's like, man. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1086.0s)]
*  Well, it's like that. But this guy's got that with the break shot. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1090.0s)]
*  Yeah. So it's like he's there's a Japanese term for that when you practice this one thing over and over and over again in an attempt to achieve enlightenment. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1093.0s)]
*  Watch this motherfucker. So this is ten ball. There's ten balls there. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1102.0s)]
*  Watch this. Watch the perfection of this. Watch the boom. See how smooth that shit is. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1106.0s)]
*  Look at those balls just scattering, son. What the fuck? Exactly. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1111.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. It's like perfection. Like he just knows where to hit it. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1116.0s)]
*  He knows what speed did it. He knows what side of these hitting the not even flat on the one ball. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1122.0s)]
*  He's sending it slightly to the side. Well, that one, he hit it pretty flat. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1128.0s)]
*  This is the cat that was born deaf. Yep. He's deaf. Yeah. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1132.0s)]
*  And when he plays, he shuts his hearing aid off. He doesn't hear shit. You can call him whatever the fuck you want. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1135.0s)]
*  He's out there running out on you, son. So this is the opposite of that in golf where they're going to play in a couple of weeks in Phoenix. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1141.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. The way waste management. They build this giant arena around this hole. It's like 17000 people and they're all cheering. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1148.0s)]
*  It's a fucking party. It's like the opposite of golf. Oh, wow. And this guy hit a hole in one. But this how many holes is it? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1155.0s)]
*  That's just on the par three. It's a normal tournament. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1161.0s)]
*  Oh my God, that's incredible. That's incredible. People start throwing beer from the stands. That's incredible. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1166.0s)]
*  See that? They're all throwing shit on the floor. See that? That's incredible. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1171.0s)]
*  With all that pressure to do that is pretty fucking wild. Amazing. This is what golf should be. That's a great idea. Who came up with this idea? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1176.0s)]
*  These guys did in Phoenix. Waste management. Literally the trash company. This is their, they sponsor this. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1184.0s)]
*  That's the best golf ever. That's real golf. So pool has a thing that's not as grand as that, but it's called the Moscone Cup. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1189.0s)]
*  And the difference between the Moscone Cup and everything else is the crowd cheers and they go nuts. And it's USA versus Europe. So it's teams. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1197.0s)]
*  So like if you and I were on team USA, you would hit a ball like you would hit the four ball and give position for me to play the five ball. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1204.0s)]
*  And then I'd give you the six ball and we go back and forth like that. So you and I, we're playing against two people from Europe and everyone screaming and cheering. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1210.0s)]
*  Europe, Europe, USA, USA. It gets wild. But then they all quiet down when the guy's about to shoot. And then it's loud again. It's loud again. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1217.0s)]
*  See, I love that. See if you can find Moscone Cup highlights. Find Moscone Cup highlights. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1227.0s)]
*  Because now everybody kind of knows about it and it's like the one pool tournament where everyone's going to scream. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1235.0s)]
*  Like there's no quiet in the crowd. There's no quiet. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1241.0s)]
*  Nobody says, everyone's screaming. But they all know the rhythm of it. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1244.0s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1247.0s)]
*  Dude, that's awesome. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1253.0s)]
*  So people are screaming and cheering while these guys are playing. That's pool man. Yeah. That's what it should be. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1255.0s)]
*  Let's fucking go! [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1266.0s)]
*  Losing it. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1267.0s)]
*  That was the most awkward chest bump ever. You know why? Because they didn't want to bang up their Qs. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1268.0s)]
*  Right. Put it to the side. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1274.0s)]
*  Watch how he chest bumps. They're both like, don't touch my Q. Don't fuck my Q up. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1276.0s)]
*  See, the Q. Easy, easy, easy with the Q. Easy with the Q. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1281.0s)]
*  That's Josh Filler. He's one of the best in the world. And he's got a wood shaft. So he's got to like, hey, some guys have carbon fiber shafts. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1287.0s)]
*  They're a little more loosey goosey because you can kind of bang those around. But wood shafts get a little nick in it and then you feel it when you're playing. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1294.0s)]
*  It bothers the shit out of you. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1300.0s)]
*  Just a little tiny. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1301.0s)]
*  The tiniest thing, you can't even find it. You can't even find it by looking at it. You have to almost be playing. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1302.0s)]
*  And then when you feel it, you stop and you go, where's that little motherfucker? And then you got to spit on it. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1308.0s)]
*  You get some water and you put it on the wood and the wood will swell back up to where it is. And then you burnish it. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1313.0s)]
*  You get it all hot and you put a little bit more water on the wood, swells a little bit more. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1320.0s)]
*  I can't help it. Come on, dude. You got to spit on it, make it swell. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1324.0s)]
*  You got to spit on that wood and make it swell. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1328.0s)]
*  Spit on it. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1330.0s)]
*  You know what that reminds me of? They just posted a clip of a dart championship, you know, and when they lose it in the background and it was the it was like, they call it like a nines. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1331.0s)]
*  Two guys have nines or something like only nine darts. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1341.0s)]
*  So two guys both had nines and then the first guy obviously won. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1345.0s)]
*  But it was like, I guess this doesn't happen that often that it's only nines. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1349.0s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? They posted it somewhere. Right here. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1352.0s)]
*  Look, watch this fucking clip, Joe. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1354.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1360.0s)]
*  One hundred eighty. I love these announcers. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1361.0s)]
*  Look at the rhythm. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1367.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1369.0s)]
*  It's so accurate. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1371.0s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1372.0s)]
*  This is insanity. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1376.0s)]
*  That's insanity. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1381.0s)]
*  Look how casual, too. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1385.0s)]
*  It's like, dude, they fucking lose it. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1388.0s)]
*  You know what's funny? I know that dude probably has an English accent, but he totally looks like he'd be from Kentucky. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1390.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1394.0s)]
*  That guy looks, oh, he fucked up. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1397.0s)]
*  First miss. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1399.0s)]
*  That guy looks English, but this dude, this dude looks like he's straight out of Kansas. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1400.0s)]
*  Yeah. Look at him. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1405.0s)]
*  That's a corn fed Englishman. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1406.0s)]
*  Except for some big big boy. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1407.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1408.0s)]
*  That dude could be at a Luke Combs concert. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1410.0s)]
*  Double twelve. So sick. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1416.0s)]
*  Suck it. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1418.0s)]
*  Suck it. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1420.0s)]
*  You got to have a crowd. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1423.0s)]
*  Dude, that's so fun. You got to have a crowd. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1424.0s)]
*  I want to go to one of these so bad one time. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1426.0s)]
*  Pool needs a fucking crowd. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1428.0s)]
*  They have a league starting up in about a year that's going to be indoor golf like this. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1429.0s)]
*  Monday nights, like Monday night football event, they're going to have 15,000 people watching golf. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1433.0s)]
*  Like we just played on a simulator. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1437.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1439.0s)]
*  When it's going to be like Tiger Woods, Roy McIlroy, the best golfers in the world doing it. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1440.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1443.0s)]
*  I wonder, as I was thinking, I was like, can you do a pool that way? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1444.0s)]
*  You could do, you could, but you could, but people, you'd have to have, like the reason why the Moscone Cup is so good is because you have like this USA versus Europe rivalry. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1447.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1456.0s)]
*  And you have this back and forth and I think the Europeans have been winning more lately. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1457.0s)]
*  No. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1461.0s)]
*  Can we recruit? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1462.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1463.0s)]
*  Can we draft? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1464.0s)]
*  Well, the best- [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1465.0s)]
*  Catholic school? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1466.0s)]
*  We have the best people already. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1467.0s)]
*  The waiver. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1468.0s)]
*  It's like, you couldn't get better people. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1469.0s)]
*  Like the people that are already competing, like if you wanted to start your own team, you could recruit. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1472.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1477.0s)]
*  But I mean like Team USA already has the best players in the United States and Team Europe has the best players in Europe. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1478.0s)]
*  Sometimes the Olympics, an American might end up playing in Italy because they have some traced grandfather. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1484.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1490.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can say- [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1491.0s)]
*  Yeah, maybe we get some Filipino cats, you know, come over here. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1492.0s)]
*  We'll sneak in some ties. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1496.0s)]
*  There's Filipino guys that you never even heard of that will fucking beat anybody in the world. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1497.0s)]
*  It's crazy how good they are. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1502.0s)]
*  Yeah, what is it, why the Philippines is there's a lot of dudes out of the Philippines that play? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1504.0s)]
*  It's really popular over there. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1507.0s)]
*  Efren Reyes, who's a legend. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1509.0s)]
*  He's like the Babe Ruth of pool. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1511.0s)]
*  Like when he goes to the Philippines, that guy gets fucking mobbed. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1513.0s)]
*  There's all these matches where him playing, he gambles still. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1517.0s)]
*  He's old as fuck. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1520.0s)]
*  He can't play as good as he used to. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1521.0s)]
*  So guys have to actually give him handicaps. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1523.0s)]
*  They give him spots. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1525.0s)]
*  Like if we're playing ten ball, like say he would have to make like the seven and out and these guys would have to make the ten. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1526.0s)]
*  Or he'd have to make the eight and they'd have to make the ten. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1535.0s)]
*  That's a lot of gives, right? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1537.0s)]
*  It's a lot of gives. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1538.0s)]
*  But that's just so they can gamble. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1539.0s)]
*  I wouldn't say the seven and out, but maybe like the eight ball at a ten. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1540.0s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1543.0s)]
*  But for like a guy like me, if I was going to play a pro, that's how you'd play them. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1544.0s)]
*  They would have to give you some sort of a handicap. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1548.0s)]
*  And that's what they would do. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1550.0s)]
*  Like guys, let's say you get the seven and the breaks. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1551.0s)]
*  That means you could break every game and you could win with the seven or the nine. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1553.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1556.0s)]
*  It's a big, big spot. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1557.0s)]
*  What he's really saying is I'm so much better than you. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1558.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's saying I'm going to lock you up. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1561.0s)]
*  I'm going to run out on you. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1562.0s)]
*  I'm going to put you in a coma. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1563.0s)]
*  I'm going to win all the games. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1564.0s)]
*  Do people keep, like in golf, you keep a handicap. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1565.0s)]
*  Can you keep a handicap in pool? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1567.0s)]
*  No, you there's a thing called the Fargo scoring and Fargo scoring. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1569.0s)]
*  It calculates how often you miss bad position play. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1573.0s)]
*  It calculates scratching on the break, all these different things. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1577.0s)]
*  And you get like a number. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1580.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1581.0s)]
*  That's your Fargo score. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1582.0s)]
*  Bad safeties. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1583.0s)]
*  If you have a bad safety and leave the ball out, that counts against your score. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1584.0s)]
*  What's your Fargo score? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1587.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1588.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1589.0s)]
*  But I was never good. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1590.0s)]
*  I was always B level. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1591.0s)]
*  I never got to other. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1592.0s)]
*  I've won tournaments before like a local tournament, but that's against other B players. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1593.0s)]
*  What would a good Fargo score be? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1597.0s)]
*  I think it's in the 900s. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1599.0s)]
*  Oh, the more is better. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1601.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1602.0s)]
*  It's like a hundred is the perfect score. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1603.0s)]
*  And some of these guys, they'll win matches with like nine thirty seven, which is just insanity. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1605.0s)]
*  Just insanity. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1610.0s)]
*  They're just not missing. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1611.0s)]
*  They're just we watched this match with that kid, Fador, where he ran out seven racks in a row to win this set on this guy in this like high pressure tournament in a row, in a row, just broken ran out perfectly seven, seven games in a row. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1612.0s)]
*  And you're like, what the fuck? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1623.0s)]
*  He did that to me out here. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1624.0s)]
*  He did it multiple times. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1626.0s)]
*  He broke and ran out like four or five racks in a row. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1627.0s)]
*  We just sit in there watching this guy break and run out, break and run out, break and run out, a clinic. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1630.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1635.0s)]
*  That's great. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1636.0s)]
*  It's like I love that with everything that I love when a guy can do that. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1637.0s)]
*  I love when people can do that, especially in something that I don't even do. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1639.0s)]
*  Then because this way, like I don't have to get obsessed and run home and try to practice. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1643.0s)]
*  I could just enjoy it. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1647.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1648.0s)]
*  You know, like when I watch Gary Clark Jr. play guitar, I get obsessed watching someone who's so good do something. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1649.0s)]
*  I have zero. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1656.0s)]
*  I don't understand what's happening. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1657.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1658.0s)]
*  I know you're doing this and the fingers move. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1659.0s)]
*  I don't know what's happening. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1661.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1662.0s)]
*  I just love that, that I could just watch it. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1663.0s)]
*  I like it if I know I don't have that much interest in it because then I don't get jealous and I don't go, I want to pick one up so fucking bad. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1665.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1672.0s)]
*  That's a problem with golf. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1673.0s)]
*  See, I can't get I can't get involved with golf because I know I would love it. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1674.0s)]
*  You will. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1678.0s)]
*  Everybody loves it. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1679.0s)]
*  It's so fun. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1680.0s)]
*  Nobody takes up golf and goes, this sucks. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1681.0s)]
*  Everybody's like, dude, I'm so obsessed. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1683.0s)]
*  Like Tony became a fucking straight up junkie. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1685.0s)]
*  Jamie became a straight up junkie. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1687.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1689.0s)]
*  Just from moving here. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1690.0s)]
*  Feeding in the garage with the track man. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1691.0s)]
*  The guys out there, first of all, he starts out normal, right? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1692.0s)]
*  Start out with just like a little little piece of grass and this little computer setup. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1695.0s)]
*  Now he's got a net around it and a new fucking radar system to tell how fast the ball's going. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1699.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1705.0s)]
*  He's filming is himself to make sure his technique is right. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1706.0s)]
*  Are you checking your technique against something against something or no? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1709.0s)]
*  You just know, just a feel. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1712.0s)]
*  Oh, you run shit through a program. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1714.0s)]
*  Well, that's the next level. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1716.0s)]
*  Yeah, that is the next level. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1717.0s)]
*  I can hook up three high speed cameras to that. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1718.0s)]
*  I can send have my coach if I had one. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1720.0s)]
*  It goes right to his phone. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1722.0s)]
*  Basically, why do you have a coach? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1724.0s)]
*  You need a coach. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1725.0s)]
*  I've talked to a few people. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1726.0s)]
*  He's out of Chris coma. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1727.0s)]
*  You do need a coach. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1728.0s)]
*  Coaching is giant and full fully coached. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1729.0s)]
*  I played pool for a long time before I got coached. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1732.0s)]
*  I got coached a little bit a couple of times or a few lessons when I was starting out in the beginning in the early days. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1734.0s)]
*  But then I met this dude, Max Eberly, who's like a professional instructor and also like a top flight pro. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1739.0s)]
*  And he coached me like he gave me actual lessons. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1744.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1748.0s)]
*  And when he gives you like you learn so much, you learn what you're doing wrong. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1749.0s)]
*  You learn why he's doing it this way. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1753.0s)]
*  You learn like position play. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1755.0s)]
*  What's the right way to move a ball to another ball? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1757.0s)]
*  Is everybody you know, but like in golf, like everyone's stroke can be different. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1760.0s)]
*  So like, is there is there a single like perfect stroke that I was trying to emulate? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1766.0s)]
*  No. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1772.0s)]
*  So it's the same thing. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1773.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's the same thing. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1774.0s)]
*  Everything's all weird. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1775.0s)]
*  Like there was a guy named Keith McCready and he had like the greatest stroke of all time and his arm was like totally sideways. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1776.0s)]
*  It was totally fucked up. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1780.0s)]
*  Like you're supposed to it's supposed to be like 90 degrees from your elbow down. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1782.0s)]
*  If someone was teaching you like if you watch a snooker player, for example, they call it snooker. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1785.0s)]
*  They're playing on a giant ass table with little tiny balls. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1790.0s)]
*  They have to have perfect technique. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1793.0s)]
*  The way they hit the ball is so straight and so smooth and they make really good pool players. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1795.0s)]
*  A lot of those guys come over and start playing pool and dominate because they're so accurate because they're used to these little tiny balls and they're used to having this perfect stroke. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1801.0s)]
*  But pool players, they do all kinds of different shit. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1809.0s)]
*  Like some guys you got like the guys who like have that slip stroke thing going on. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1813.0s)]
*  You got guys who are like Keith McCready, who's the rarest of the rarest, totally sideways with his arm. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1817.0s)]
*  Like his arm would be like this while he's playing. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1822.0s)]
*  He wouldn't be playing like this. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1824.0s)]
*  But it's out here. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1825.0s)]
*  It's out on the side. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1826.0s)]
*  But it works. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1827.0s)]
*  Because he learned how to play when he was a little kid and he couldn't reach the table. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1828.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1831.0s)]
*  He had his arm up there like this. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1832.0s)]
*  Because the table is where his chin is. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1833.0s)]
*  So he's learning how to play with his arm sideways. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1836.0s)]
*  That's like the guy. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1838.0s)]
*  Jamie, what's a Korean guy that swings out of his shoes? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1839.0s)]
*  You know, a little Korean guy who literally flies out of his shoes. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1841.0s)]
*  You should see this guy. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1844.0s)]
*  It's the funniest shit you've ever seen. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1845.0s)]
*  He is a pro golfer who has a swing like a guy who started a month ago. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1846.0s)]
*  And he literally will swing so hard his body will turn. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1852.0s)]
*  He'll drop shit. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1855.0s)]
*  Watch this guy. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1856.0s)]
*  That's an easy one. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1858.0s)]
*  This is this. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1860.0s)]
*  But is he good? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1862.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's good. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1865.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1866.0s)]
*  Look at him fall down after he fucking... [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1867.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1869.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1870.0s)]
*  Look at on the right, Joe. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1871.0s)]
*  Straight down the middle. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1872.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1873.0s)]
*  300 yards. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1874.0s)]
*  Yeah, as long as it's repeatable. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1875.0s)]
*  I mean, that's the thing with pool. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1877.0s)]
*  It's repeatable. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1880.0s)]
*  That's the thing with archery. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1881.0s)]
*  That's the thing with a lot of things. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1882.0s)]
*  A lot of people have goofy archery stances. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1884.0s)]
*  But it works. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1886.0s)]
*  But if it's repeatable. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1887.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1888.0s)]
*  The question is, Ken, is it repeatable under pressure? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1889.0s)]
*  Because pressure is a fascinating thing. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1891.0s)]
*  Because you just want it to be over. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1893.0s)]
*  You have anxiety. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1895.0s)]
*  You rush things. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1896.0s)]
*  You fuck things up. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1897.0s)]
*  And you've got to learn how to stay inside your technique [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1898.0s)]
*  and inside your mindset and inside your pre-shot routine, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1902.0s)]
*  even under pressure. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1906.0s)]
*  So that's got to be the same with everything. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1908.0s)]
*  So that's why it's really important to learn great technique. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1910.0s)]
*  If you have your own flair, you should learn how to do it right first. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1914.0s)]
*  There's thousands and millions of people who have been doing this. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1919.0s)]
*  They've figured out how to do it right. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1922.0s)]
*  You could have variations and deviations of that. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1924.0s)]
*  But there's certain things like with Taekwondo, when I was teaching, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1927.0s)]
*  it was very hard to teach someone who had already taken bad classes. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1930.0s)]
*  So if someone had went to a karate school, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1934.0s)]
*  and they were kicking with their knee down, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1937.0s)]
*  and they had no power, it was all in the legs and not in the hips. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1939.0s)]
*  And you would try to teach these people under pressure, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1943.0s)]
*  they would always revert back to their earlier form. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1946.0s)]
*  Under sparring pressure. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1949.0s)]
*  Under fighting. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1951.0s)]
*  When they were fighting in competitions, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1952.0s)]
*  when shit would get wild, they would always revert. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1954.0s)]
*  And they would lose power, they'd lose speed, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1957.0s)]
*  you'd lose a direct linear line to the attack point. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1960.0s)]
*  You're deviating. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1964.0s)]
*  When you see people throwing looping punches, sometimes they work. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1966.0s)]
*  Sometimes they work. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1970.0s)]
*  But most of the time, you're better off if you have that as an option, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1972.0s)]
*  but you straight punch most of the time. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1977.0s)]
*  Your hooks are clean, your straight punch is clean, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1980.0s)]
*  but every now and then you can do some wild shit and get away with it. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1983.0s)]
*  But you have to learn how to do everything else first. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1986.0s)]
*  Otherwise you leave too many openings. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1989.0s)]
*  That's got to be the same with golf, it's got to be the same with everything. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1991.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, like if somebody had lessons before, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1995.0s)]
*  the trick is, what he knows, is sometimes they have to untangle [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=1998.0s)]
*  like a fucking phone wire what someone else has done to you. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2002.0s)]
*  Because you can keep changing as you get older, your body will change. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2006.0s)]
*  Like Tiger goes through it, his back, so he changes the way he swings. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2009.0s)]
*  That's the same thing, and your techniques have to change with time [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2012.0s)]
*  and your body and with your limits, you know what I mean? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2014.0s)]
*  And guys will pick a style, kind of stick to it, and then tweak it over time. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2017.0s)]
*  Because you've got to find the thing that literally... [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2023.0s)]
*  I equate it to when I started snowboarding, learning how to go to your toe side. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2026.0s)]
*  Everyone can heel side, everyone can stop like this with their back to the mountain. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2031.0s)]
*  But face to the mountain is always so scary at first, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2034.0s)]
*  because you feel like you're going to catch an edge and hit your fucking head, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2036.0s)]
*  which you do when you're starting. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2039.0s)]
*  But once you learn your version of how to shift your weight, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2041.0s)]
*  it's like riding a bike, cliche, but you immediately go, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2045.0s)]
*  I know exactly how my body does that. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2049.0s)]
*  You feel the moment you learn it, you go, oh. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2051.0s)]
*  Do you remember those hover boards we had at the old studio? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2054.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2056.0s)]
*  Little wheelie things? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2057.0s)]
*  The first time I got on the thing, I could not fucking stand still. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2058.0s)]
*  My friend Tate had to hold my arm, I was like, Jesus. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2061.0s)]
*  I was like falling, like you see the video of Mike Tyson falling? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2065.0s)]
*  Mike Tyson, Mike Tyson, who's a fucking better athlete than Mike Tyson? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2067.0s)]
*  Falls on his ass riding one of those things. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2071.0s)]
*  But then once I got the hang of it, dude, I could just cruise around. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2073.0s)]
*  It's like my body knew exactly what it did, and it just goes, oh, we got a program for that. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2076.0s)]
*  Yeah, they plug it in. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2081.0s)]
*  Plug it in, and then all of a sudden I could just... [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2082.0s)]
*  Jamie and I were doing it all the time, but Jamie fell and broke his ass bone. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2085.0s)]
*  Like literally broke his ass bone. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2089.0s)]
*  He's going to say he was fucking around, but he wasn't. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2091.0s)]
*  He was cruising. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2093.0s)]
*  Oh, he was definitely fucking around. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2094.0s)]
*  What were you doing? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2095.0s)]
*  He was always fucking around. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2096.0s)]
*  I was trying to film and do his different stuff. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2097.0s)]
*  I just took my eye off the prize for a second. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2098.0s)]
*  Did you break your tailbone for real? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2099.0s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2100.0s)]
*  I got hurt though for sure. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2101.0s)]
*  Bro, you were hurt for a year. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2102.0s)]
*  I probably still am hurt. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2104.0s)]
*  Alright, you broke your tailbone. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2105.0s)]
*  I tried to cover it up. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2106.0s)]
*  I know people that have broken their tailbone. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2107.0s)]
*  It's real similar in all the... [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2109.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm not a doctor, but I think it's real similar. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2111.0s)]
*  I fell on my side on my tailbone technically, so it would have been something with my hip. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2114.0s)]
*  No, you could break your hip bone, your tailbone by falling on your hip. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2118.0s)]
*  Look, anytime you're putting that kind of pressure on your hip, where you're falling [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2123.0s)]
*  and all your weight is going down to concrete, which is what it was, we have polished concrete [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2127.0s)]
*  floors, it's immovable and you're hitting bone and all kinds of stuff goes crack. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2132.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to fucking hurt. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2139.0s)]
*  Stuff up here goes crack. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2140.0s)]
*  It hurts. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2141.0s)]
*  There goes crack. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2142.0s)]
*  When I fell skiing the last time I skied, I fucking cracked. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2143.0s)]
*  I got what's called an insufficiency fracture, where it fractured at the top where my shin [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2146.0s)]
*  meets my cartilage. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2151.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was like, fuck skiing. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2153.0s)]
*  Fuck that. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2155.0s)]
*  Fuck this. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2156.0s)]
*  Well, that's like the first time you snowboard, you fall on your ass, dude. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2157.0s)]
*  It hurts so bad. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2159.0s)]
*  Because your body's not used to that kind of fall. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2161.0s)]
*  Not since you were a baby learning how to walk was your ass squishy enough to bounce. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2163.0s)]
*  Now you get older, dude. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2168.0s)]
*  You break. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2169.0s)]
*  Yeah, it hurts. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2170.0s)]
*  My boy Shane Dorian, he's a world champion big wave surfer. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2171.0s)]
*  He was snowboarding a year and a half ago, two years ago actually, and just blew his fucking knee out, man. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2175.0s)]
*  Slammed into a tree. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2181.0s)]
*  And this is a guy who's a professional surfer. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2183.0s)]
*  I think he tore his ACL and his MCL. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2185.0s)]
*  He had to get surgery. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2188.0s)]
*  And then we hooked him up with Ways to Well here in Austin. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2189.0s)]
*  They stem celled him and fixed his knee. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2192.0s)]
*  Fixed his shit fast. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2195.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2196.0s)]
*  Well, fixed it after he'd gone through a lot of rehabilitation. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2197.0s)]
*  But that was the big thing that really helped him and pushed him over the edge and got him back to it. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2199.0s)]
*  Yeah, it gets scary. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2204.0s)]
*  You're a fucking pro surfer to be doing that? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2205.0s)]
*  That seems so insane to me. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2208.0s)]
*  Yeah, but snowboarding is so fun. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2209.0s)]
*  It must be so exciting. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2210.0s)]
*  Riding down a fucking mountain is so fun. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2211.0s)]
*  My buddy just broke a couple ribs. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2213.0s)]
*  He was with his kids and we got this weird text chain that was like, hey, did you hear what happened? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2215.0s)]
*  At first, whenever you hear skiing shit, I immediately you're like, what the fuck happened? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2220.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2225.0s)]
*  Luckily, all he did was break a few ribs. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2226.0s)]
*  I mean, he's fucked up, but he's fine. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2228.0s)]
*  Bro, we lost Sonny Bono. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2230.0s)]
*  I know, dude. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2232.0s)]
*  God bless. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2233.0s)]
*  We miss you, man. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2234.0s)]
*  Sonny Bono, we lost Sonny Bono into a fucking tree. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2235.0s)]
*  Got him. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2237.0s)]
*  The tree got him. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2238.0s)]
*  What a disaster. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2239.0s)]
*  Boom. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2240.0s)]
*  Don't fuck with those trees. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2241.0s)]
*  Bro, that must be a horrible way to go. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2242.0s)]
*  I do not go in there. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2244.0s)]
*  You see the tree and you know there ain't a goddamn thing you can do to stop that motherfucker. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2245.0s)]
*  No thanks. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2249.0s)]
*  Boom. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2250.0s)]
*  I'm sticking to where I'm supposed to. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2251.0s)]
*  People are ballsy that go off. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2253.0s)]
*  If you're really good, people do it all the time, but I don't need that shit. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2255.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2299.0s)]

*  I'm not sure. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2305.0s)]
*  This is a little different. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2306.0s)]

*  Period. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2321.0s)]
*  My boy Andy Stumpf had the world record at one point for the longest wingsuit flight. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2322.0s)]
*  How long was it? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2327.0s)]

*  I saw that, right? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2335.0s)]
*  No, that's a different one. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2336.0s)]
*  Maybe it was Red Bull. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2337.0s)]
*  Who did the Andy Stumpf one? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2338.0s)]

*  Yeah, I think that was the one I saw. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2349.0s)]
*  He jumps out of a little cage. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2351.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2352.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2355.0s)]
*  I saw the one from space. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2356.0s)]
*  He hops out this fucking thing, and look how high he is. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2357.0s)]
*  That's so ridiculous. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2362.0s)]
*  He's got oxygen on. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2363.0s)]
*  It's so high up there. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2364.0s)]
*  Andy's such a psycho. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2367.0s)]
*  He loves that shit. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2369.0s)]
*  17.5 miles, jeez. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2371.0s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2374.0s)]
*  He flew 17.5 miles in that squirrel suit. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2375.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2379.0s)]

*  Literally has oxygen on. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2381.0s)]
*  There's no air up there, bitch. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2382.0s)]
*  Yeah, 35,000 feet. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2383.0s)]
*  35,000 feet. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2384.0s)]
*  He's up there with a plane. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2385.0s)]
*  That is so crazy. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2388.0s)]
*  Oh my God, he's going 141 miles an hour. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2389.0s)]
*  That's as fast as you drive a golf ball. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2394.0s)]
*  Yeah, dude, that's insane. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2396.0s)]
*  No, you were driving ... What was your top one today? [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2397.0s)]

*  What is the fastest you've ever done? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2403.0s)]
*  I think the fastest on the track, man, was about 170, right around there. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2405.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2409.0s)]

*  Yeah, he's a long drive dude, and show him in a long drive competition. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2431.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2435.0s)]
*  See, no, go to a competition, Jamie, where he's outside, where you can see him hit it [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2436.0s)]
*  outside, because it's ... Like this, Joe. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2440.0s)]
*  Watch this ball flight. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2443.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2444.0s)]
*  I started putting those videos up on my channel. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2445.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2448.0s)]
*  390 yards, Joe. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2449.0s)]
*  That's so ridiculous. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2450.0s)]
*  That's so far. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2451.0s)]
*  But this guy's swing speed is ... Look, you see it right there, 217. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2454.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2457.0s)]
*  Ball speed. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2458.0s)]
*  Club is 150. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2459.0s)]
*  They send them to Mesquite, Nevada, and they go down this range. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2460.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2464.0s)]
*  And this Justin James cat, he got 390? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2465.0s)]
*  390. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2467.0s)]
*  Yeah, so he's going to beat it. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2468.0s)]
*  He's got eight chances to beat it. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2469.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2471.0s)]
*  But you only get eight balls. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2472.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2473.0s)]
*  He has to beat it within this, otherwise he's out. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2474.0s)]
*  That's why he'll take his time for a second and set up. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2476.0s)]
*  He's on a clock, but you know ... Bro, you got to love the hair. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2478.0s)]
*  Oh, he just cut it though, sadly. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2481.0s)]
*  No. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2483.0s)]
*  Yeah, he cut it. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2484.0s)]
*  Why would he do that? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2485.0s)]
*  I don't fucking know. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2486.0s)]
*  Look at that mane. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2487.0s)]
*  460 yard drives here. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2488.0s)]
*  What? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2489.0s)]
*  460. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2490.0s)]

*  Watch how he ... [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2493.0s)]
*  And it's got to be, Joe, inside these lines too. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2494.0s)]
*  So you can't just hit it anywhere. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2496.0s)]
*  It's got to be within this field. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2497.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2499.0s)]
*  That was just a cold 415. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2500.0s)]
*  Oh my God, that's amazing. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2503.0s)]
*  And that's warming up. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2506.0s)]
*  He's just getting fucking started. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2507.0s)]
*  Now I understand why Tiger would blow his back out doing this. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2508.0s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2511.0s)]
*  That's exactly why. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2512.0s)]
*  Now I get it. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2513.0s)]
*  So much torsion. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2514.0s)]
*  The best golfers in the world, you'll see, guys like Ricky Fowler, size-wise I mean. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2515.0s)]
*  They're skinny guys. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2519.0s)]
*  They're tiny guys, some of these guys. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2520.0s)]
*  But they can pipe it because it's all torque down ... It's all below. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2521.0s)]
*  A lot of guys think it's all upstairs. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2524.0s)]
*  Everybody wants it to be like you want to fucking hit ... You have a hammer, dude. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2526.0s)]
*  Everybody wants to go this way. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2529.0s)]
*  But the problem is it has so much to do with your lower body snapping you into the ball. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2530.0s)]
*  This guy's probably the best. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2534.0s)]
*  Tiger says he's got the best swing. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2535.0s)]
*  Roy has the best swing. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2536.0s)]
*  And see how much torsion is in his lower body? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2538.0s)]
*  See that? [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2541.0s)]
*  How it snaps his lower body through. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2542.0s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2544.0s)]
*  Look at his technique too. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2545.0s)]
*  Look at the finish of it. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2546.0s)]
*  It's funny that that other guy's so wacky. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2548.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2550.0s)]
*  See? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2551.0s)]
*  But ... When you see that, when you see that perfect technique. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2552.0s)]
*  Roy's top in the world. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2555.0s)]
*  That other guy is good, but he's nowhere near this. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2556.0s)]
*  That guy's good, but he's not ... This is different. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2559.0s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2561.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2562.0s)]
*  That guy's going to make money and do well for the rest of his life, but top, top shit. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2563.0s)]
*  Roy's got to be ... It's almost like a difference to those dart guys. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2567.0s)]
*  It's just if you throw a fastball baseball pitcher up there to just throw against them, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2570.0s)]
*  but they're throwing those little darts at the thing, and the other guy's just throwing [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2574.0s)]
*  fast as fuck. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2577.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2578.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2579.0s)]
*  It is amazing watching people learn to do something that's really hard to do and getting [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2580.0s)]
*  really good at it. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2585.0s)]
*  When you watch someone do acrobatics, or you watch Cirque du Soleil, you're like, what [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2586.0s)]
*  the fuck? [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2589.0s)]
*  Absurd. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2590.0s)]
*  How? [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2591.0s)]
*  Have you seen the one where they jump in the water? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2592.0s)]
*  Which one? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2593.0s)]
*  The Cirque du Soleil Le Reve. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2594.0s)]
*  Did you ever hear of this? [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2598.0s)]
*  No. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2599.0s)]
*  Bro. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2600.0s)]
*  I don't even know if it's around anymore, but when I went to Vegas one time, I got fucking [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2601.0s)]
*  baked out of my mind and went to see them. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2602.0s)]
*  Dude, audibly, like an old lady, I'd be like, ah! [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2605.0s)]
*  Because I got nervous. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2608.0s)]
*  They would jump in these little tiny, tiny holes from like 70 feet up, just into a little [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2609.0s)]
*  tiny ... But if they missed, they're dead. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2614.0s)]
*  The floor moves underwater. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2617.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2618.0s)]
*  So you'll watch it raise up underwater, shift heights. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2619.0s)]
*  They'll climb up from one of the ... And acrobatically climb to the other one, and then it'll drop [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2622.0s)]
*  into the water out of nowhere, and then it'll raise up a little tiny window they have to [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2626.0s)]
*  dive into. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2629.0s)]
*  Dude, have you seen ... Le Reve, I think is what it was called. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2630.0s)]
*  It will ... I don't know if it's around, but if it's still around, go see it, because that [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2633.0s)]
*  was the wildest shit I've ever seen. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2637.0s)]
*  Oh, dude, every show to me has to be such a high level of precision. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2639.0s)]
*  There is no like ... You know when a band is like, dude, you missed that fucking ... [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2644.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2647.0s)]
*  You can't miss shit. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2648.0s)]
*  You're not missing a chord. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2649.0s)]
*  It's your neck in the water. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2650.0s)]
*  I saw it years ago. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2652.0s)]
*  I saw the Beatles one at the Mirage. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2653.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, I think I saw that. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2655.0s)]
*  It's called Love. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2656.0s)]
*  It's fucking great. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2657.0s)]
*  It's like the dudes on rollerblades doing flips and shit too. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2658.0s)]
*  But it's the music. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2660.0s)]
*  It also, you sort of rediscover the music of the Beatles. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2661.0s)]
*  Like you forget how good their music was sometimes. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2666.0s)]
*  And when you hear it in that amazing arena where they have the Cirque du Soleil and the [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2669.0s)]
*  sound is incredible and the visuals are incredible, you're like, these guys. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2674.0s)]
*  Unreal. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2678.0s)]
*  God damn. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2679.0s)]
*  You watched the documentary, I'm sure, and it was like ... What shocked me the most ... [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2680.0s)]
*  Cart Day's night? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2684.0s)]
*  What shocked me the most was how short of a time they were doing it. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2685.0s)]
*  This wasn't like a 30 year span where you're like, dude, the band made hits forever. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2688.0s)]
*  No, this was a little baby window they destroyed and then poof, like that it's gone. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2692.5s)]
*  Yoko Ono. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2699.0s)]
*  Yoko Ono. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2700.0s)]
*  Came in and fucked it all up. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2701.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2702.0s)]
*  That's my Bobby Lee, dude. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2703.0s)]
*  Came in and fucked it all up. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2704.0s)]
*  Did you ever read the ... Did you ever read Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2705.0s)]
*  No, but I've heard you talk about it. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2710.0s)]
*  It's a great book. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2711.72s)]
*  One of the chapters in the book is about the Beatles and it's about how the Beatles went [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2712.72s)]
*  to Hamburg and they were playing in a strip club and they were playing like eight hours [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2717.6s)]
*  a day. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2721.3599999999997s)]
*  They were playing so much and they were so tightly tuned. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2722.3599999999997s)]
*  They went back to Liverpool a couple of years later and everyone was like, what the fuck [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2726.3399999999997s)]
*  happened? [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2729.9599999999996s)]
*  They were just so tight and so smooth. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2731.7599999999998s)]
*  Did they go to Hamburg just to do a run? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2734.12s)]
*  To work. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2737.08s)]
*  They went to work. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2738.08s)]
*  They're doing these shows and they're performing together eight hours a day. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2739.56s)]
*  They're writing all these new songs and they're performing and I think they had to do covers [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2745.2799999999997s)]
*  too. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2749.7999999999997s)]
*  They're just fucking tightly ... Putting in their work, man. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2750.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, just like tightly coordinated like Cirque du Soleil with music. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2753.92s)]
*  Watching Paul make like improv, so to speak, get back, watching that was ... I don't think [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2760.16s)]
*  I've ever seen any footage of something so magical happening that they were able to capture [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2769.64s)]
*  when he's like ... When you hear him just humming out what he thinks the words might [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2774.48s)]
*  be, dude, I was like ... We're witnessing like little magic go off in his brain. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2780.56s)]
*  They're watching his synapses fire into being like, get back. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2787.58s)]
*  What is that? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2791.2599999999998s)]
*  Get back. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2792.2599999999998s)]
*  Get back. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2793.2599999999998s)]
*  You see once he finds it, everything else kind of like ... It's almost like when you're [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2794.2599999999998s)]
*  tripping and you see one thing and then it exposes all this other stuff and you're like, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2799.06s)]
*  I see all of it now. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2803.02s)]
*  That's exactly what that looked like to me, that he found get back and it was like, get [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2804.42s)]
*  back to where you once belonged. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2807.34s)]
*  I was like, holy shit. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2809.5s)]
*  A lot of those guys do that. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2810.5s)]
*  Rick Rubin talked about that on the podcast. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2812.74s)]
*  They sort of make up words and shit. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2815.18s)]
*  Then they start putting words where the sound is. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2821.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that's wild. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2823.94s)]
*  Yeah, they just sort of like feel it. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2824.94s)]
*  They feel it. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2826.5s)]
*  Whatever the beat is, they start just talking over it and shit. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2827.5s)]
*  But then in my stony brain, I think, did their brain already know the words and they were [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2831.02s)]
*  just trying to find it? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2835.94s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2836.94s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2837.94s)]
*  The pop brain is like, they're there. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2838.94s)]
*  I always wondered that about Jay-Z. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2839.94s)]
*  Jay-Z is so impressive. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2840.94s)]
*  The way he can add lib lyrics. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2842.9s)]
*  Rick Rubin was talking about how they'll play a beat and he'll go in, listen to the beat [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2846.2200000000003s)]
*  and just flow with the beat. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2850.34s)]
*  It's stuff that he wrote for weeks and weeks. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2853.2200000000003s)]
*  But he never wrote anything down. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2855.58s)]
*  That always blew my mind. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2857.5s)]
*  Wild. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2858.9s)]
*  Wild. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2859.9s)]
*  I sadly want him to have written one thing down. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2860.9s)]
*  That ability is incredible. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2863.78s)]
*  But then this guy's like Nas, who I think is the best lyricist ever. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2865.6600000000003s)]
*  Nas writes things down and you can tell he writes things down. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2869.54s)]
*  He'll do a rap backwards. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2873.82s)]
*  Remember that song, Reverse? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2875.86s)]
*  I love that song. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2877.5s)]
*  That song's incredible. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2878.5s)]
*  That is one of the most lyrically complicated and beautiful songs ever in the history of [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2879.5s)]
*  hip hop. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2884.98s)]
*  It also has the ability to just toss in there, he's getting a blowjob and throws up. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2885.98s)]
*  That's also my favorite. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2889.1400000000003s)]
*  He's a poet. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2890.1400000000003s)]
*  She's like, he spits the nut back into my dick. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2891.1400000000003s)]
*  The drink goes back into my cup. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2896.1800000000003s)]
*  Throw up. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2898.06s)]
*  It's so cool how he was able to tell that story backwards but also still keep it in [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2899.54s)]
*  his vibe. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2905.82s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2906.82s)]
*  He didn't break character. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2907.82s)]
*  It was still Nas telling a story like Nas would. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2908.82s)]
*  It didn't get corny at any point or change shape. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2911.2599999999998s)]
*  His new shit is great too. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2913.58s)]
*  He stays fantastic. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2916.18s)]
*  He stays relevant. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2918.38s)]
*  If you're a Nas fan, you will not be disappointed. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2919.38s)]
*  His new shit is just like his old shit. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2923.46s)]
*  It's great. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2925.66s)]
*  He's so good. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2926.66s)]
*  That was the hip hop that I liked. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2927.66s)]
*  I talk sometimes about hip hop. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2928.66s)]
*  Some new shit I like a lot. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2931.58s)]

*  It's classics. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2958.2200000000003s)]
*  I had Pharoah Monch. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2959.2200000000003s)]
*  On tour, I would come out to Pharoah Monch, Simon Says. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2960.9s)]

*  I come out to this song because I loved it so much. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2977.3s)]
*  But the crowd would lose their fucking mind. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2984.1s)]
*  This is from 13 years ago. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2987.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2989.3799999999997s)]
*  Trippy ass music video. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2990.3799999999997s)]
*  I miss music videos. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2992.66s)]
*  Dude, this is MTV. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=2993.66s)]

*  I said it. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3029.66s)]
*  Rub on your titties. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3030.66s)]
*  So I was coming out to this. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3031.66s)]
*  Then for the special, I wanted to use it. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3033.66s)]
*  DJ Premier, who is a fan of comedy and knows Sigoura. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3036.66s)]
*  I reached out to him. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3042.66s)]
*  Out of the blue, I was like, hey man, I hope I'm not crossing. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3043.66s)]
*  I hope I'm not crossing lines here. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3045.66s)]
*  Would it be cool if you reached out to Pharaoh about me licensing that song for the special? [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3047.66s)]
*  And it's widely known in the hip hop world. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3052.66s)]
*  Most like old hip hop heads, they love that song. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3054.66s)]
*  And I was like, I don't know if I can afford it or whatever, but would you mind? [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3056.66s)]
*  And shout out to him because within seconds, Premier was like, yo, reached out to him. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3060.66s)]
*  Here's the deal. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3067.66s)]
*  That intro is from Godzilla 1. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3068.66s)]
*  The original. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3072.66s)]
*  And he never cleared it. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3076.66s)]
*  13, 15 years ago. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3077.66s)]
*  So the deal was like he's got the mechanics to the song, but can't license it out for stuff like this. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3080.66s)]
*  Let me hear that. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3086.66s)]
*  Have Godzilla walk out. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3087.66s)]
*  I want to see Godzilla anyway. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3088.66s)]

*  Who sampled? [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3090.66s)]
*  You can see all the samples. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3091.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3092.66s)]
*  You can see every single who sampled it in their music. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3093.66s)]
*  I love that they sample in hip hop. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3095.66s)]
*  It's the best. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3097.66s)]
*  I love it. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3098.66s)]
*  It's cool. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3099.66s)]
*  Stuff like that didn't clear so long ago. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3100.66s)]
*  It didn't clear. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3102.66s)]
*  So what? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3103.66s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3104.66s)]
*  Can you show me it, though? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3108.66s)]
*  Can you show me it when it happens? [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3109.66s)]
*  Find the stop. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3111.66s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Jamie. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3113.66s)]
*  Can you show me Godzilla coming out to that sound? [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3116.66s)]
*  And I want to see actual Godzilla because it was so dumb. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3119.66s)]
*  The actual Godzilla, if you go back and try to watch that, like the idea that that's a [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3125.66s)]
*  monster movie, it's so goofy. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3130.66s)]
*  But it was crazy scary for people at the time. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3132.66s)]
*  People were like, oh shit. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3134.66s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3135.66s)]
*  For people in 1960 or whatever, Godzilla came out. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3136.66s)]
*  It was like, what am I seeing? [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3139.66s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3141.66s)]
*  Fire came out and it was like, eh, eh. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3143.66s)]
*  Yeah, it was so cool. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3146.66s)]
*  Yeah, and that sound was so, so like memorable. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3148.66s)]
*  And so he didn't clear it. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3151.66s)]
*  And then, you know, I, and Premier was like, whatever I can do to help, you know, moving [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3152.66s)]
*  forward. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3157.66s)]
*  And there's this other guy, RJ D2, who I loved. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3158.66s)]
*  And ironically enough, I had wanted a song from him and he was like, I didn't clear that [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3161.66s)]
*  song. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3167.66s)]
*  Like, and I was like, do the same shit. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3168.66s)]
*  So then he sent me a folder of unused like beats. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3170.66s)]
*  He was like, there's a, I got to, he's like, I have stuff that I've made that I don't have [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3174.66s)]
*  and no one has, you know, that I still have. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3177.66s)]
*  He's like, do you want to hear someone? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3179.66s)]
*  He sent me one and that's one of the ones I chose. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3180.66s)]
*  And shout out to those guys for helping me out. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3182.66s)]
*  But it was so funny because he said the same thing. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3184.66s)]
*  He goes, dude, I was young when I did that. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3186.66s)]
*  We didn't clear shit. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3188.66s)]
*  Of course. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3189.66s)]
*  We were making dope shit, putting it out to the world. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3190.66s)]
*  And then sometimes, fuck no. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3192.66s)]
*  He's like, those labels, have those labels from back there all gone. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3194.66s)]
*  They dissipated or they got bought or. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3197.66s)]
*  How many great, great songs in hip hop, they sampled old music, like old James Brown tracks. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3199.66s)]
*  I talked about William Bell. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3208.66s)]
*  I love the William Bell. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3210.66s)]
*  If you don't know who he is, he's great. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3211.66s)]
*  And so many people have sampled him, but they sample like even a word like Tim Robinson, his show. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3213.66s)]
*  I think you should leave, which is fine. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3219.66s)]
*  He samples this baby, baby, baby. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3221.66s)]
*  And it's from William Bell's a piece of his song that he looped and put over itself. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3224.66s)]
*  And like, it's just cool to see how many people pick apart these old things. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3228.66s)]
*  I love hearing it and finding it and be like, do you know who that is? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3232.66s)]
*  And when people like, no, it's like, oh, that's Ann Peebles. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3234.66s)]
*  That's, you know, it's just great. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3236.66s)]
*  I love seeing where the samples came from because it's like, man, how do they find that or why that of all the shit they turn into something else? [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3238.66s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's there's an art to that, man. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3246.66s)]
*  Oh, it's beautiful. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3248.66s)]
*  A lot of those like old hip hop dudes used to have just enormous collections of records. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3249.66s)]
*  They would just listen to just try to find samples, digging in the crates constantly to find something like that. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3254.66s)]
*  Try to find you find Godzilla's emergence. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3259.66s)]
*  That's it. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3261.66s)]
*  It's from a 1992 film. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3262.66s)]
*  That sound is? [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3265.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3266.66s)]
*  Oh, it's a 1992 Godzilla. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3267.66s)]
*  That's probably a way better Godzilla. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3268.66s)]
*  It's from the soundtrack. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3269.66s)]
*  So it's not the original Godzilla? [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3271.66s)]
*  That the original. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3273.66s)]
*  So this says it's from whether or not this is right or not. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3274.66s)]
*  I guess we'll have to go into that. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3277.66s)]
*  But Godzilla versus Mothra. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3278.66s)]
*  Yeah, this is from Godzilla versus Mothra, which came out in 1992. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3279.66s)]
*  OK. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3282.66s)]
*  And then I found that movie, but I have no idea where they would have used that 12 second sample because this is the whole movie of Godzilla versus Mothra. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3283.66s)]
*  Just show Godzilla coming out. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3293.66s)]
*  Yeah, let's see him. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3295.66s)]
*  I guess there's a hard. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3296.66s)]
*  Hard to find it? [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3297.66s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know where. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3298.66s)]
*  I've never seen this movie. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3299.66s)]
*  I've never seen it. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3300.66s)]
*  Godzilla versus Mothra from 1992. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3301.66s)]
*  How many people saw this? [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3306.66s)]
*  I don't know if they're going to play the soundtrack when it comes out. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3307.66s)]
*  I highly doubt it. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3309.66s)]
*  Let's find where just so you can see what Godzilla. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3311.66s)]
*  What did Godzilla look like in 92? [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3314.66s)]
*  I didn't see this movie. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3316.66s)]
*  Yeah, it wasn't. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3317.66s)]
*  It came out in Japan. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3318.66s)]
*  That's like right. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3319.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3320.66s)]
*  OK. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3321.66s)]
*  In that while, like he found a sample from fucking Japan from a Japanese movie. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3322.66s)]
*  There it is. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3326.66s)]
*  Oh, here it is. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3327.66s)]
*  Oh, he looks terrible. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3328.66s)]
*  There it is. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3329.66s)]
*  You hear the background? [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3334.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3337.66s)]
*  It's not even hurt. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3338.66s)]
*  It's not even hurt. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3339.66s)]
*  It's going to land. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3341.66s)]
*  We have to stop it. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3344.66s)]
*  That's one of the best parts about Godzilla's dubs. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3346.66s)]
*  The dubs are so terrible. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3349.66s)]
*  We have to do our best to find out where he's going. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3351.66s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3354.66s)]
*  It's not even hurting him. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3356.66s)]
*  Here's Godzilla. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3357.66s)]
*  Oh, Godzilla's in a fight with Mothra. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3359.66s)]
*  Oh, Mothra's jizzing all over him. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3363.66s)]
*  Jizzing all over him, dude. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3365.66s)]
*  It's silk. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3367.66s)]
*  He's covered him with silk. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3368.66s)]
*  Imagine that's all it takes to fuck Godzilla up. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3370.66s)]
*  Just a little bit of silk. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3373.66s)]
*  He's all tapped out. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3375.66s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3376.66s)]
*  Look how corny it looks. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3377.66s)]
*  And that's like the updated Godzilla. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3378.66s)]
*  Now go to the original Godzilla. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3380.66s)]
*  Go to the original Godzilla movie. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3382.66s)]
*  That looks so bad. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3384.66s)]
*  The Matthew Broderick one came out like four years after this, didn't it? [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3385.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3388.66s)]
*  The Matthew Broderick movie was pretty good. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3389.66s)]
*  In terms of special effects, it was a terrible movie. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3390.66s)]
*  But in terms of special effects, it was a pretty good movie. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3393.66s)]
*  Looks like the 64 one. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3395.66s)]
*  He's got the downs. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3398.66s)]
*  100%. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3400.66s)]
*  It's a meme. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3401.66s)]
*  Mothra. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3404.66s)]
*  This is from 1964? [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3405.66s)]
*  Bro, look how bad this is. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3409.66s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3413.66s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3418.66s)]
*  This is so corny. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3419.66s)]
*  You can even hear the helicopter flying overhead that gives them the wind. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3426.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3430.66s)]
*  You hear the helicopter? [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3431.66s)]
*  Look how corny Godzilla is. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3437.66s)]
*  There it is in the background right there. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3441.66s)]
*  It's a different version of it, yeah. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3443.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3445.66s)]
*  Dun, dun, dun, dun. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3446.66s)]
*  When my daughters were really young, when they were like four and six, my wife was out of town. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3455.66s)]
*  And I said, do you guys want to watch a scary movie? [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3460.66s)]
*  And they were like, no, we're scared. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3463.66s)]
*  I go, no, no, no, a bad scary movie, corny. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3464.66s)]
*  I want to show you a scary movie from the 1930s. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3467.66s)]
*  It's called King Kong. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3470.66s)]
*  And they're like, what is it? [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3471.66s)]
*  I go, it's about a giant gorilla. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3472.66s)]
*  But I go, but the special effects are so bad, you're going to laugh. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3473.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3476.66s)]
*  It's so bad. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3477.66s)]
*  And so six-year-olds, right, from whatever, you know, six years ago, watching a movie that was a scary movie at the time. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3478.66s)]
*  In 1933, when people saw King Kong for the first time, go to King Kong from 1930s. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3488.66s)]
*  King Kong from 1933. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3493.66s)]
*  When people saw that, whatever year it was, was it 1933? [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3494.66s)]
*  Am I making that up? [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3497.66s)]
*  I want to say it predates World War II. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3499.66s)]
*  People thought that was like the craziest shit they'd ever seen. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3502.66s)]
*  What is it? [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3506.66s)]
*  1933. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3507.66s)]
*  1933 King Kong. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3508.66s)]
*  So go to 1933 King Kong. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3510.66s)]
*  And this is made with clay. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3512.66s)]
*  Look how bad this is. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3514.66s)]
*  So my kids thought it was hilarious. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3515.66s)]
*  I go, how bad does this look? [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3518.66s)]
*  It looks so bad. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3520.66s)]
*  They weren't scared at all. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3521.66s)]
*  They were laughing and then they were relieved that it wasn't scary. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3522.66s)]
*  So then they started laughing really hard. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3525.66s)]
*  Look how corny this is. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3527.66s)]
*  But in 1933, they're like, I can't believe what we're seeing. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3530.66s)]
*  King Kong is actually fighting a dinosaur. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3534.66s)]
*  And there's a lady watching it. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3537.66s)]
*  But it's like, whenever you revisit that shit, when I was, I remember Babysitter showed me The Exorcist far before I should have seen it. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3539.66s)]
*  And I remember how crazy that, I thought that was in, that movie was so scary. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3548.66s)]
*  It gave me nightmares. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3551.66s)]
*  Look at the new one. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3552.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's insane. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3553.66s)]
*  The new one's incredible. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3554.66s)]
*  That's what the ride is almost at Universal. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3555.66s)]
*  Isn't it hilarious how King Kong always falls in love with a white chick? [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3558.66s)]
*  But look how badass this King Kong is. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3563.66s)]
*  He's fighting two. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3566.66s)]
*  This King Kong is incredible. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3568.66s)]
*  Heed a smoster for sure. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3572.66s)]
*  And what year is this? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3573.66s)]
*  This is three years ago, but I don't know exactly if that's right. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3574.66s)]
*  05. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3578.66s)]
*  05, yeah, I was going to say that looks like it might be a little bit more. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3579.66s)]
*  Now the newest shit's probably. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3580.66s)]
*  Yeah, they remade it again, I think. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3581.66s)]
*  Yeah, they did. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3582.66s)]
*  But then King Kong kept growing, because now King Kong has to fight Godzilla. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3583.66s)]
*  Godzilla's 500 feet tall. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3588.66s)]
*  Yeah, right, I saw that. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3589.66s)]
*  So the idea is that King Kong has some sort of a genetic malformity that makes him just continue to grow forever and ever. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3590.66s)]
*  So now they don't visit Kong Island for a few years, and they come back and. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3597.66s)]
*  He's got a lump on his pituitary gland. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3601.66s)]
*  He just never stopped growing. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3603.66s)]
*  Yeah, so this is the regular size King Kong. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3604.66s)]
*  This is the 50 foot King Kong. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3606.66s)]
*  See, that looks fucking unreal. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3608.66s)]
*  Smash. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3610.66s)]
*  Boom. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3611.66s)]
*  I mean, yeah, the fucking special effects are incredible. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3612.66s)]
*  It's so amazing what they do with CGI, but at the same time, you know that that's not real. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3616.66s)]
*  You feel it's not real. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3621.66s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3623.66s)]
*  It just feels fake. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3624.66s)]
*  That's what's like people that do like Rick Baker and those guys that did special effects for like American Werewolf in London. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3625.66s)]
*  They say that you can't replace like the physical special effects where an actual object is attacking an actual person. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3632.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3640.66s)]
*  I remember that too. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3641.66s)]
*  When I was a kid, I thought that was. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3642.66s)]
*  I had nightmares of like stairs. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3644.66s)]
*  I hated stairs. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3646.66s)]
*  Yeah, it just freaked me out so much when I was a kid. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3648.66s)]
*  Back then, man, this movie freaked people out. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3651.66s)]
*  They were so scared that she was so good. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3654.66s)]
*  They were so scared that she was so good. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3657.66s)]
*  Yes, by a devil. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3660.66s)]
*  She was so I bought it. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3661.66s)]
*  I bought for I was like that bitch is possessed. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3662.66s)]
*  I think that movie fucked her up. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3664.66s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3666.66s)]
*  For the rest of her life. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3667.66s)]
*  I think so. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3668.66s)]
*  Because she did it so young. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3669.66s)]
*  She's a kid in that movie. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3670.66s)]
*  It's like to be in that mindset. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3671.66s)]
*  Twelve hours a day on set shooting yelling your mother sucks cocks in hell. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3672.66s)]
*  Remember that? [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3677.66s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3678.66s)]
*  Your mother sucks cocks in hell. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3679.66s)]
*  Like, whoa, whoa. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3681.66s)]
*  Yeah, but you have to do that. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3684.66s)]
*  Was that 76? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3686.66s)]
*  What year was the Exorcist? [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3687.66s)]
*  That's what happens to actors that get embedded in those things that go deep, deep, deep. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3689.66s)]
*  Sometimes the brain takes a while to get back. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3693.66s)]
*  I would imagine that if you're playing 73, if you're a child and you're playing someone who's possessed by a demon. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3696.66s)]
*  Yeah, come on. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3704.66s)]
*  And you believe in demons when you're a child, too. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3705.66s)]
*  For sure. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3707.66s)]
*  Do you believe in demons? [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3708.66s)]
*  Still do. Yeah, for sure. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3709.66s)]
*  They might be real. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3710.66s)]
*  They gotta be. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3711.66s)]
*  There's got to be external forces around. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3712.66s)]
*  I can't imagine that all this energy in your body goes to nowhere. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3714.66s)]
*  I don't buy it. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3719.66s)]
*  Well, that's not even the question about demons. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3720.66s)]
*  Like, where your energy goes is a really good question. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3723.66s)]
*  But the question about demons is are there external forces that are playing against you? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3727.66s)]
*  There are actual entities. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3731.66s)]
*  But I think negative energy goes into those things. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3732.66s)]
*  That's what I guess I mean. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3735.66s)]
*  I think what builds those things is negative, really toxic, evil shit builds negative things. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3736.66s)]
*  And another dimension. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3743.66s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3744.66s)]
*  I definitely believe that. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3745.66s)]
*  And if you're doing like evil shit, you're probably even more haunted by those things. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3746.66s)]
*  When you die, it doesn't just go away. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3750.66s)]
*  It goes somewhere, into a thing. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3752.66s)]
*  I wholeheartedly believe that. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3754.66s)]
*  And honestly, the first time I really felt, like when I saw the Irish, for some reason, we love wakes. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3756.66s)]
*  We like to see people when they're dead. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3764.66s)]
*  I liked how the Jews do it. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3766.66s)]
*  They're like, I'm not fucking looking at that person when they're dead. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3767.66s)]
*  I had the same experience. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3769.66s)]
*  I know what you're going to say. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3770.66s)]
*  And I couldn't look at my grandmother the whole time. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3771.66s)]
*  And then my mom was like, we're going to leave. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3775.66s)]
*  So you ought to say goodbye. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3777.66s)]
*  And I was like, all right. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3778.66s)]
*  And I walked up there and I felt this sense of relief because I was like, oh, the thing I loved isn't even in there anymore. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3779.66s)]
*  This was a vessel. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3789.66s)]
*  Yes. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3790.66s)]
*  And whatever was in there is somewhere better. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3791.66s)]
*  And I felt immediately like this weird, like someone was telling me like, this is just the shell, man. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3794.66s)]
*  The thing you like, it's in a really great place. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3800.66s)]
*  It's all good. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3802.66s)]
*  That's the weirdest part about seeing someone dead is this feeling that they've left. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3803.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3809.66s)]
*  They're not in there. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3810.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3811.66s)]
*  They're not in there. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3812.66s)]
*  Did you see this? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3813.66s)]
*  The pope? [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3814.66s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3815.66s)]
*  Is this the new pope? [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3816.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3817.66s)]
*  He passed away. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3818.66s)]
*  They did the funeral and they thought the new pope who died brought him out without a coffin and left them on display. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3819.66s)]
*  That's dark for a pope. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3822.66s)]
*  Don't need no coffin. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3823.66s)]
*  That's dark. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3824.66s)]
*  Everyone came up and kissed his hands and stuff. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3825.66s)]
*  Wild. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3827.66s)]
*  That is a crazy gig. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3828.66s)]
*  That guy had the craziest past. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3833.66s)]
*  Pope Benedict, he had the craziest past because he was charged with moving priests around [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3836.66s)]
*  that had committed atrocities. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3842.66s)]
*  And he moved one to a place where they molested 100 deaf kids. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3844.66s)]
*  What? [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3849.66s)]
*  Yes. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3850.66s)]
*  Google that. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3851.66s)]
*  100 deaf kids. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3852.66s)]
*  100 deaf kids got molested by this one priest that he had moved, I believe when he was a [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3853.66s)]
*  cardinal. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3858.66s)]
*  You don't hear him coming. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3859.66s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3860.66s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3861.66s)]
*  You can't even help yourself. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3862.66s)]
*  Cut it out. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3863.66s)]
*  Son of a bitch. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3864.66s)]
*  Cut it out. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3865.66s)]
*  Son of a bitch. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3866.66s)]
*  But the new one's supposed to be chill, right? [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3867.66s)]
*  Well, I think he had to take it down a notch, so the new one got a regular throne. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3869.66s)]
*  He's like, this gold throne's a little outdated. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3874.66s)]
*  And he's like pro gay marriage and all that stuff. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3876.66s)]
*  Yes. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3878.66s)]
*  Well, that's nice. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3879.66s)]

*  200 deaf kids. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3881.66s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3882.66s)]
*  The priest might have molested 200 deaf boys. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3883.66s)]
*  Top Vatican officials, including future Pope Benedict XVI, did not defrock a priest who [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3886.66s)]
*  molested as many as 200 deaf boys. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3893.66s)]
*  That's fucking... [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3895.66s)]
*  Even though several American bishops repeatedly warned them that failure to act on the matter [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3896.66s)]
*  could embarrass the church, according to the files recently unearthed as part of a lawsuit. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3900.66s)]
*  Imagine your concern is embarrassing the church. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3904.66s)]
*  Not that this guy is fucking kids. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3907.66s)]
*  Imagine. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3910.66s)]
*  Yeah, we don't want the church to look bad. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3911.66s)]
*  Imagine your concern. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3912.66s)]

*  Shit is dark. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3921.66s)]
*  I went there on edibles. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3922.66s)]
*  Did you? [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3923.66s)]

*  The whole time I was like, I don't like this at all. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3926.66s)]
*  I just didn't like the fact that they were like, we have our own cops. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3928.66s)]
*  Well, no extradition. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3932.66s)]
*  We can do whatever we want. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3934.66s)]
*  They're basically a country inside of a city. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3935.66s)]
*  They have their own bank. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3937.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3938.66s)]
*  Oh, their own rules, their own laws. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3939.66s)]
*  And then there's a bunch of people in there that people would like to try. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3940.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3942.66s)]
*  They would like to pull them out of there and try them. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3943.66s)]
*  Can't do it. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3945.66s)]

*  Protected. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3947.66s)]

*  The girl who went missing is what I think my instinct is saying, but it's about a resident. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3954.66s)]
*  There's a small amount of residents that live in the Vatican walls in Vatican City. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3960.66s)]
*  Her family was one of them. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3964.66s)]
*  And this has got to be, I don't know, 30 years ago, she went missing. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3966.66s)]
*  And the story is fucking wild. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3969.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's called Vatican Girl. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3971.66s)]
*  I just Googled it. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3973.66s)]
*  Two days ago, it says they reopened the case, so I don't know. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3974.66s)]
*  Dude, you have to watch this. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3976.66s)]

*  What do they think happened? [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3978.66s)]
*  Well, there's a bunch of different conspiracies. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3979.66s)]
*  There's a bunch of different, like, there is kind of a somewhat clear-cut answer in it, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3982.66s)]
*  but there's multiple points where even they go, I don't know. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3987.66s)]
*  This may, this may come from multiple avenues of this being a very well coordinated thing. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3991.66s)]
*  Like a kidnapping, and it's crazy. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=3998.66s)]
*  And they just reopened it up. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4001.66s)]
*  Kidnapping from someone who lives in the Vatican? [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4003.66s)]
*  I don't want to tell you. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4005.66s)]
*  The family that lived there says there might have been a kidnapping, the blackmail, the [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4006.66s)]
*  probe at the time. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4009.66s)]
*  There's a bunch of different theories, and as you watch it, they talk about multiple theories [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4010.66s)]
*  about, like, what it's like. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4013.66s)]
*  But also, the crazy thing is, you'd think if you lived in the Vatican, you're living, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4015.66s)]
*  you know, high on the hog. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4020.66s)]

*  They don't, it's not because they're in there. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4027.66s)]
*  You're not, like, automatically, you know, living like a king. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4028.66s)]

*  They were workers. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4036.66s)]
*  Oh, so the workers lived there. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4037.66s)]
*  But they don't treat them any kind of, it's like they all live pretty, you know. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4038.66s)]

*  Modestly. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4042.66s)]
*  And your family's born into it, so you're kind of born in it. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4043.66s)]
*  And this girl was, she would go to a school outside of the Vatican walls, like a performance [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4045.66s)]
*  art school, if I'm not mistaken, and, you know, a regular route from there to there, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4050.66s)]

*  You know it's like an inch away from being one. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4208.66s)]

*  They listen to you. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4213.66s)]
*  They like what you put out. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4215.66s)]
*  Doesn't mean you have to have some sort of like spiritual ideology. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4217.66s)]
*  Religion could be anything. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4220.66s)]
*  This could slot as a religion. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4222.66s)]
*  For sure. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4224.66s)]
*  It just means a bunch of people listen to a uniform thought process. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4225.66s)]
*  If you put out like a continual thing. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4230.66s)]
*  I don't think you need a book. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4232.66s)]

*  He's the real deal. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4260.66s)]
*  And he has a church that he built that is designed around his art. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4261.66s)]
*  And he got tax exempt status. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4267.66s)]
*  It's called Entheon. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4270.66s)]
*  That's the church. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4271.66s)]
*  Like this is the place. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4272.66s)]
*  Like how amazing is that? [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4273.66s)]
*  Where is that? [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4275.66s)]
*  It's in upstate New York. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4276.66s)]
*  So he bought land and then he set it up for a church and made it tax exempt. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4278.66s)]
*  You've got to see what it looks like on the outside. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4284.66s)]

*  That's the outside of it. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4295.66s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4297.66s)]

*  And you know this guy's been an incredible artist forever. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4309.66s)]
*  But he had, the first time he came on the podcast, he had just the idea for this. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4312.66s)]
*  So all those faces all around it, it's all from his artwork. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4316.66s)]
*  And it all had to be 3D designed. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4319.66s)]
*  That's him and his wife. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4322.66s)]
*  And so this is him and his wife and his paintings. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4323.66s)]
*  So they have like fucking yoga classes there and shit. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4326.66s)]
*  They're like a real church. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4329.66s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4331.66s)]

*  And you're all chanting and shit. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4339.66s)]
*  And he's a real deal. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4341.66s)]
*  He's not like trying to rip people off. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4342.66s)]
*  He's just a genuinely beautiful person who's an amazing artist. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4344.66s)]
*  Who's created like a real church. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4348.66s)]
*  They play music and they get together. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4352.66s)]
*  It's not like he gets to fuck everybody's wife. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4354.66s)]
*  It's a regular church. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4357.66s)]
*  I hope it stays that way. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4359.66s)]
*  Yeah, it will with this guy. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4360.66s)]
*  Because this story sometimes goes the wrong way. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4361.66s)]
*  They almost always go the wrong way. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4364.66s)]
*  It goes to a place where it's like he got the power and he was like, all right, we have to pray naked. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4365.66s)]
*  And then we get guns. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4370.66s)]
*  And someone's got to sit on my face. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4371.66s)]
*  And then we need to protect ourselves from the government. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4372.66s)]
*  We got to kill everybody we know that doesn't like us. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4374.66s)]
*  You don't want it to go down that road. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4377.66s)]
*  But they almost always do. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4379.66s)]
*  Yeah, dude, that's what I'm saying. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4380.66s)]
*  As I'm watching that the whole time, I'm like, I know he's your boy. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4381.66s)]
*  I hope it stays this way. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4384.66s)]
*  I hope it doesn't shift into something I don't want it to be. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4386.66s)]
*  Like that I watched the, you know, Nexium. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4389.66s)]
*  I watched that one. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4393.66s)]
*  I didn't see that one. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4394.66s)]
*  I heard it's wild. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4395.66s)]
*  Bro, it's just you're like also the women's empowerment one. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4396.66s)]
*  That was another one that was nuts. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4399.66s)]
*  What's that one? [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4401.66s)]
*  This woman in San Francisco had started, you know, like a sexual revolution club, a freedom for women to be the powerful versions of. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4402.66s)]
*  She gets to bang everybody's husband. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4412.66s)]
*  Yes, she fucks everybody, dude. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4413.66s)]
*  By the end, she fucked the whole crew. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4415.66s)]
*  It was all see-through. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4417.66s)]
*  She was like, this is for women to take back their empowerment. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4418.66s)]
*  It was in San Francisco, I think. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4421.66s)]
*  And she was she was extremely manipulative and intelligent. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4423.66s)]
*  The way she would break down people's relationships into joining her ideology about sex and love and relationships. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4426.66s)]
*  They would just snap into her thing. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4435.66s)]
*  And it was all about making a woman come. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4437.66s)]
*  The whole thing was about can you make your woman come and make that the priority? [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4438.66s)]
*  But then after a couple of years, she's like, I want to suck a couple of dicks. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4443.66s)]
*  She let a couple of dicks in and then it all led down the same road. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4448.66s)]
*  It all goes down to the same place. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4452.66s)]
*  Power. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4454.66s)]
*  They love the power. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4455.66s)]
*  Well, it's also if you're a person who doesn't you know, you have a hard time knowing who you are. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4456.66s)]
*  Like who maybe you think you're more than you are or you want more than you're getting. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4462.66s)]
*  And then also you're in this position where people revere you. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4466.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4470.66s)]
*  That's intoxicating. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4471.66s)]
*  And then you're literally speaking at a church. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4472.66s)]
*  You're speaking to your flock. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4475.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4478.66s)]
*  I think that's why they made Catholic pre celibate. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4479.66s)]
*  I think they're probably banging everybody back in the day. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4481.66s)]
*  Don't you think? [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4483.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4484.66s)]
*  Of course. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4485.66s)]
*  They're like rock stars. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4486.66s)]
*  Like Giancarlo, you're fucking way too many of the members. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4487.66s)]
*  Do you imagine? [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4491.66s)]
*  What do I do wrong? [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4492.66s)]
*  What am I doing wrong? [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4493.66s)]
*  You're talking about Italians, first of all, savages, savage people. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4494.66s)]
*  And then you're talking about Italians from a thousand years ago. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4497.66s)]
*  Even more savage. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4500.66s)]
*  And then you're talking about the one dudes who could read Latin. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4501.66s)]
*  So they're reading the Bible. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4504.66s)]
*  No one else even knows what the fuck is going on. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4506.66s)]
*  Until Martin Luther came along and translated the Bible into phonetic languages. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4508.66s)]
*  I think he connected. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4512.66s)]
*  What is it? [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4513.66s)]
*  German first? [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4514.66s)]
*  Did Martin Luther convert it to German? [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4515.66s)]
*  He translated it into German, I think. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4517.66s)]
*  I forget what language it was, but he translated the Bible so that regular people who could read could read it because they didn't know Latin. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4519.66s)]
*  And then he basically said you should interpret the Bible any way you see fit. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4527.66s)]
*  The Bible is there for you to interpret it. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4532.66s)]
*  Which was a fucking horrific affront to the Catholic Church. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4534.66s)]
*  The Catholic Church freaked out. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4538.66s)]
*  All the churches back then probably wanted to kill him. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4540.66s)]
*  I don't know, was it the Catholic Church that he did it to? [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4544.66s)]
*  Whatever church it was. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4546.66s)]
*  Protestant? [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4547.66s)]
*  I'm not sure what church it was. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4548.66s)]
*  But he spoke Latin. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4550.66s)]
*  And he translated. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4552.66s)]
*  The priests were the ones, you had to have formal training. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4555.66s)]
*  Like Latin even back then was a dying language. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4558.66s)]
*  Even when there's people that still study it today, which is fucking wild. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4561.66s)]
*  Latin's wild. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4566.66s)]
*  What if they bring it back though? [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4567.66s)]
*  It would be a great thing to learn. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4568.66s)]
*  You could have conversations to people in Latin. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4570.66s)]
*  Behind somebody's back. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4572.66s)]
*  That would be the shit. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4573.66s)]
*  I wonder how well you could communicate with it. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4574.66s)]
*  I'm sure there's enough, well you can't use any, of course there's no slang in it, but you could make up new slang Latin. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4576.66s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4583.66s)]
*  Yeah, the gabagool. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4584.66s)]
*  People... [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4586.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4587.66s)]
*  I was saying that you were the gabagool. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4588.66s)]
*  Gabagool, da-da gabagool. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4590.66s)]
*  Get a little fucking bush-a-dush. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4591.66s)]
*  Stru-y-a-del, stru-y-a-del. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4593.66s)]
*  Yeah, you have to throw a nail through a nail. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4595.66s)]
*  They've got shit for that, for sure. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4597.66s)]
*  Yeah, imagine if they brought Latin back. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4599.66s)]
*  Well, what's stopping someone from inventing a new language and everyone adopting it? [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4603.66s)]
*  There's two guys talking. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4607.66s)]
*  You're talking in Latin? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4608.66s)]
*  Let's talk about this. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4609.66s)]
*  Hello, Luke. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4610.66s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming on today. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4614.66s)]
*  Salve, Xiaomi. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4616.66s)]
*  Yeah, that was good. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4618.66s)]
*  I'll come to a language right after that. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4619.66s)]
*  Sounds Chinese. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4620.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4621.66s)]
*  Let me hear it. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4622.66s)]
*  What was that guy's name, I guess? [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4623.66s)]
*  I've seen your videos online in Latin. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4624.66s)]
*  Certissime, amiche. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4627.66s)]
*  Mi nomin est Lucius Amadeus Ranierius. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4629.66s)]
*  Natusum in Pensylvania. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4632.66s)]
*  E sum quid, sum triginta seks anos natus, atque quid etiam ego, ego sum YouTube-er, ut tu, et apud [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4635.66s)]
*  canalem meum, ego facio contenta, Latine et Greche. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4646.66s)]
*  Wow. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4653.66s)]
*  I know some of that. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4654.66s)]
*  There's a little bit of Italian in there. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4655.66s)]
*  Yeah, I hear a bunch of it. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4657.66s)]
*  It took two years in high school. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4658.66s)]
*  Some of it makes sense, but it's also, Spanish makes more sense, too. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4659.66s)]
*  Et apud canalem meum, ego facio. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4663.66s)]
*  You have to sound like a cartoon version whenever I read it. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4666.66s)]
*  I'm meeting my voice because canalem meum, ego facio contenta, Latine et Greche. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4670.66s)]
*  Did I ever tell you a time I encountered this church that was trying to get me to join when [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4675.66s)]
*  I was in college? [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4680.66s)]
*  What was it? [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4681.66s)]
*  You want to tell this story? [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4682.66s)]
*  No. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4683.66s)]
*  I was taking Italian, and there's people in this Italian class with me, and there was this [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4684.66s)]
*  one hot Puerto Rican girl. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4688.66s)]
*  She wore glasses. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4689.66s)]
*  She was smoking. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4690.66s)]
*  There's always one. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4691.66s)]
*  She was so hot I couldn't talk to her. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4692.66s)]
*  I was like, you know what I mean? [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4693.66s)]
*  I didn't have much confidence back then. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4695.66s)]
*  No. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4697.66s)]
*  And she invited me one day to go with her and her friends to some weekend retreat. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4698.66s)]
*  And I was like, what? [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4706.66s)]
*  What are you guys doing? [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4708.66s)]
*  I didn't know it was like a religious retreat. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4709.66s)]
*  She's trying to convert me. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4711.66s)]
*  And I thought I was just getting invited to this cool kids party. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4713.66s)]
*  I'm like, I can't this weekend, but maybe another time I could do it. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4716.66s)]
*  That weekend I think I had a tournament or something like that. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4721.66s)]
*  It was when I was still competing. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4723.66s)]
*  And then a couple of weeks later, we're in the... [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4725.66s)]
*  Actually, I think I was done doing fighting. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4732.66s)]
*  I think I was doing stand-up at the time. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4735.66s)]
*  So there's something going on. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4737.66s)]
*  I had a gig maybe. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4738.66s)]
*  Whatever it was. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4739.66s)]
*  I'm trying to remember what year it was, because now I'm thinking it's like 89, maybe even 90. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4740.66s)]
*  So there was a plane crash and it was Trump's airplane. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4746.66s)]
*  It was like Trump Airlines. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4750.66s)]
*  And it crashed in Boston and like the front wheels didn't come down. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4752.66s)]
*  So they had to like skid into the runway with sparks and shit. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4757.66s)]
*  So I see them all eating and they invite me over to their table. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4760.66s)]
*  What year is this? [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4766.66s)]
*  89. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4767.66s)]
*  So it's perfect. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4768.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4769.66s)]
*  So it's right after I stopped fighting. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4770.66s)]
*  Maybe I was fighting a little bit. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4771.66s)]
*  And then right when I just started doing stand-up and there was this table full of them and they come sit with us. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4773.66s)]
*  I'm like, OK, cool. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4781.66s)]
*  I go, hey, you guys hear about the plane crash? [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4782.66s)]
*  And they go, no. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4784.66s)]
*  I go, yeah, the fucking the front wheels didn't come down, the plane skid, sparks and everything. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4785.66s)]
*  And they're all staring at me. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4790.66s)]
*  I go, but nobody died. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4791.66s)]
*  And then that hot Puerto Rican girl goes, praise God, praise God. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4793.66s)]
*  And they all started going, praise God, praise God. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4798.66s)]
*  And I was like, oh, no. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4800.66s)]
*  And then immediately I'm like, duh, stupid. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4802.66s)]
*  She doesn't like you. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4805.66s)]
*  She doesn't like you. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4806.66s)]
*  She want to convert you to her fucking wacky Christian cult. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4807.66s)]
*  Yeah, but if the pussy was good enough, you might as well go to the can. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4811.66s)]
*  Just go check it out. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4814.66s)]
*  Check it out. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4815.66s)]
*  Do a trial run. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4816.66s)]
*  I was scared. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4817.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4818.66s)]
*  Too susceptible. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4819.66s)]
*  Well, Jesus lets them in the booty. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4820.66s)]
*  You know that. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4821.66s)]
*  You could always do booty stuff. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4822.66s)]
*  That's Catholic girl. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4823.66s)]
*  That's the Catholic loophole. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4824.66s)]
*  I don't think that's written anywhere. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4825.66s)]
*  I think someone should refute that. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4826.66s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4827.66s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4828.66s)]
*  In Paul. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4829.66s)]
*  I think it's in Corinthians. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4830.66s)]
*  413. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4831.66s)]
*  The first or second letter. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4832.66s)]
*  I think it's, yeah, thou shalt enter booty. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4833.66s)]
*  It's literally Sodomy. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4836.66s)]
*  It's literally Sodom and Gomorrah. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4838.66s)]
*  That's why he killed everybody. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4840.66s)]
*  That's right. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4841.66s)]
*  Everybody's all butt fucking. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4842.66s)]
*  Tight it up. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4843.66s)]
*  That's a wrap. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4844.66s)]
*  Keep it tight, baby. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4845.66s)]
*  Keep it tight back there. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4846.66s)]
*  No, that's the, who does it? [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4847.66s)]
*  That's the loophole. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4849.66s)]
*  No, no, yeah, who does it? [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4850.66s)]
*  The Mormon kids, they do the soaking and then they do the bouncing. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4851.66s)]
*  The soaking's hilarious. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4853.66s)]
*  And you know about the bouncing. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4854.66s)]
*  You know this, right? [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4855.66s)]
*  No, what's the bouncing? [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4856.66s)]
*  Somebody goes underneath. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4857.66s)]
*  I don't know what it's called. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4858.66s)]
*  Look it up. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4859.66s)]
*  Jamie knows. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4860.66s)]
*  Somebody gets onto the bed when someone's soaking and they push the bed so there's movement. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4861.66s)]
*  So it's almost as if they're fucking, but they aren't making the movement. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4865.26s)]
*  Oh my God, that's hilarious. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4867.94s)]
*  This is legit. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4868.94s)]
*  What's it called, Jamie? [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4869.94s)]
*  That's jump-humping. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4870.94s)]
*  Jump-humping. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4871.94s)]
*  Someone else jumps on the bed to get to bed. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4872.94s)]
*  Like you're trying to double bounce someone on a trampoline so they'll start moving. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4876.58s)]
*  Bro, people find loopholes. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4879.66s)]
*  Jump-humping, dude. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4881.5s)]
*  That is hilarious. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4882.5s)]
*  Mormon teens on TikTok, see that? [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4883.5s)]
*  Jump-humping. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4884.5s)]
*  Finding themselves jump-humping, a tactic used to avoid thrusting during penetrative [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4885.5s)]
*  sex. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4888.74s)]
*  Because the thrusting, I think the thrusting is what is prohibited. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4889.74s)]
*  So you can soak. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4892.78s)]
*  That is amazing. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4893.78s)]
*  No in and out movement. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4894.78s)]
*  It's amazing that you can soak. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4895.78s)]
*  You can soak. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4898.26s)]
*  I think they found the loophole, dude. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4899.26s)]
*  You can soak. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4900.26s)]
*  Soaking is amazing. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4901.26s)]
*  Jump-humping is so funny. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4903.26s)]
*  When you were a teenager, you were like soaking, we're good. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4904.26s)]
*  I don't need to move. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4906.38s)]
*  No. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4907.38s)]
*  Well, also, but immediately you put it in. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4908.38s)]
*  Then you're like, I'm gone. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4909.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's so dangerous. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4912.38s)]
*  And that's when kids, like when teenagers are having sex with each other, they're at [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4914.78s)]
*  their most fertile and they're at their least control. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4918.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's why you're pregnant. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4921.26s)]
*  It's like within, they're like, we just had sex once. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4922.26s)]
*  It's like you're pregnant. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4924.54s)]
*  That's why you're pregnant. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4925.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's how it goes sometimes. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4926.54s)]
*  Because your body is just like, okay. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4927.54s)]
*  And so I'm dumb. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4928.54s)]
*  And the moment as a kid, as a dude the first time you fuck, you're just like. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4929.54s)]
*  Well, what's nuts is that that's how the body's designed. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4934.38s)]
*  Like you are your most fertile and you're the most likely to conceive. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4937.86s)]
*  But it's also like that's what nature wants. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4942.52s)]
*  Nature wants you to have sex when you're a fucking kid. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4944.96s)]
*  You're 16. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4949.160000000001s)]
*  It's because we weren't supposed to last more than 20 years. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4950.160000000001s)]
*  I think nature was like, get this done now. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4952.56s)]
*  You're dead in a decade. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4954.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but we haven't adapted to that yet. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4955.200000000001s)]
*  We haven't adjusted. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4957.080000000001s)]
*  Do you think that it will ever catch up? [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4958.080000000001s)]
*  How could it? [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4961.8s)]
*  It would take so long. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4962.8s)]
*  It's not like people are going to stop humping. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4963.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, chemically, I mean, I don't know what would change. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4965.92s)]
*  You would have to almost delay puberty, but then when you would fuck up people's development, [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4969.96s)]
*  what could you do? [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4975.04s)]
*  Because there's a window when your hormones, you're growing and your hormones are kicking [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4976.04s)]
*  in and all this stuff is kind of synced normally by nature. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4980.44s)]
*  If you interfere with that because you think the kids can't handle having sex, like you're [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4984.28s)]
*  going to delay, what are you going to delay, puberty? [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4988.56s)]
*  Like till they're smart enough? [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4990.64s)]
*  Yeah, you have to. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4991.64s)]
*  Well, you're not even smart enough when you're in your 20s. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4992.64s)]
*  No, you're not smart enough. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4994.12s)]
*  No one's smart enough. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4995.12s)]
*  Fucking it never kicks in. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4996.12s)]
*  Well, that's what's wild about humans, right? [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=4997.6s)]
*  There's this clear biological imperative to procreate and it kicks in when you have no [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5000.919999999999s)]
*  business teaching a kid life. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5006.94s)]
*  To raise a child when you're 15 and the husband's 15 and you're 15 and you just gave birth to [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5010.219999999999s)]
*  a baby and you're a baby. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5018.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like that 16 and pregnant show or whatever that always says. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5019.98s)]
*  It's like when it works, you're happy because you're like the kid might turn out to have [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5023.099999999999s)]
*  a nice life. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5026.98s)]
*  But when you see that goes awry, it's sad as shit because a lot of times it's bound [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5028.0199999999995s)]
*  to lose. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5032.9s)]
*  But then sometimes you wait too long and it gets harder to have kids. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5033.9s)]
*  I've dealt with that. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5039.58s)]
*  It's wild how your body sometimes, or the body is like. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5041.66s)]
*  You miss the window. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5044.259999999999s)]
*  Maybe you miss a window. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5045.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5046.82s)]
*  But then they have in vitro fertilization. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5047.82s)]
*  Science. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5049.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, science fixes all that shit. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5050.299999999999s)]
*  Well, they're developing the concept at least of artificial wombs. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5053.02s)]
*  And they think that there will be a time where they'll be able to have babies outside of [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5058.94s)]
*  a human body. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5064.34s)]
*  Just growing next to you in your house? [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5065.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5066.58s)]
*  How far away is that? [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5067.58s)]
*  Because I read something recently on this as a concept. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5068.58s)]
*  But then what is the baby getting from the mother in terms of emotions and feeling and [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5076.1s)]
*  Babies are empathic, right? [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5083.14s)]
*  They're feeling the mother's stress. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5085.1s)]
*  Your cortisol raises when your mother's under stress. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5086.9400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5089.74s)]
*  It's probably lessons. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5090.74s)]
*  You're learning things from the mother just from feelings. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5093.78s)]
*  Like instinctual stuff kicks in. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5097.5s)]
*  I wonder. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5099.06s)]
*  Well, it's got to be based on diet and your lifestyle schedule and the way that you operate [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5100.06s)]
*  has to influence the way that the. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5105.5s)]
*  Can you imagine if they made babies in an artificial womb and the babies just came out [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5106.9800000000005s)]
*  like soulless? [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5110.46s)]
*  What do you do? [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5111.46s)]
*  It's very stiff. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5114.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5115.46s)]
*  And then the scientists say, well, actually we've discovered the soul is real. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5116.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5118.46s)]
*  And it only comes from the mother into the baby. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5119.46s)]
*  And it comes while the baby's inside the mother. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5121.38s)]
*  That's actually a great movie. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5124.5s)]
*  They think that actually that was like an ancient belief that the soul entered the body [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5125.5s)]
*  at a certain time. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5132.02s)]
*  Now I'm thinking about it. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5133.02s)]
*  I think it was like six weeks. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5134.62s)]
*  There was like there was an ancient belief that there was a very specific time where [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5137.14s)]
*  the soul entered the body. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5142.700000000001s)]
*  While you're in the womb. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5144.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5145.5s)]
*  While the baby's in the womb. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5146.5s)]
*  So you're in there for six weeks cooking at six weeks. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5147.5s)]
*  That's when that's when the social. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5149.26s)]
*  Is that what they think it was? [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5150.54s)]
*  What was this ancient myth belief? [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5152.14s)]
*  Whatever you know, if it's real. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5155.02s)]
*  I feel like it'd be right. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5158.22s)]
*  The moment that Aristotle there's fertilization. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5159.34s)]
*  Aristotle believed it. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5163.1s)]
*  In the time of Aristotle is actually what it says. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5164.16s)]
*  Soul entered the embryo at 40 days for a male and 90 days for a female. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5167.44s)]
*  Beach of their girls. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5171.92s)]
*  Wonder why I waited. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5172.92s)]
*  Why they chill. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5174.48s)]
*  They're fucking late. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5175.48s)]
*  They got to do something. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5176.48s)]
*  What's it called? [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5177.48s)]
*  Insolent. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5178.48s)]
*  Insolent. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5179.48s)]
*  Insolent. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5180.48s)]
*  And so that was just their belief. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5181.48s)]
*  Was it based on any thought? [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5183.92s)]
*  Hippocrates was the first to believe this. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5185.32s)]
*  Well, he's always contradicting himself. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5188.5599999999995s)]
*  The embryo was a product male. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5191.04s)]
*  Hippocrates is where. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5192.76s)]
*  Ah, da da da da da da da. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5193.76s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5195.76s)]
*  Why are we, I wonder, why do you speculate we're 40 and they're 90? [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5199.08s)]
*  Why would that be? [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5203.400000000001s)]
*  Well, back then they probably didn't like girls. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5204.400000000001s)]
*  Right, that's why. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5205.400000000001s)]
*  They're like, these bitches are slow. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5206.400000000001s)]
*  They don't even get their souls when we get our souls. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5207.400000000001s)]
*  Give me another taste of the good stuff. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5209.6s)]
*  Yeah, baby. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5211.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5212.200000000001s)]
*  These bitches are slow. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5213.200000000001s)]
*  I mean, they probably, yeah, they probably. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5214.200000000001s)]
*  I bet you scientifically they probably get it before we do, if anything. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5216.200000000001s)]
*  The artificial womb thing I found, 2019 there's an article that said they think they're 10 [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5219.92s)]
*  years away, but I dug through that real quick to find the person that was claiming that. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5224.320000000001s)]
*  And it turns out it's just like an artist. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5228.0s)]
*  Oh. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5230.0s)]
*  So like, it wasn't a group of scientists saying it was like an artist that says like, we might [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5231.0s)]
*  be there. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5235.04s)]
*  Hey man, artist or scientist? [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5236.04s)]
*  That would scare the shit out of me if they started making people in a lab. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5237.04s)]
*  Oof. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5240.4400000000005s)]
*  You don't think they're doing that already? [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5241.4400000000005s)]
*  But yeah, there's visions. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5242.4400000000005s)]
*  I feel like they've got to be manipulating. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5243.4400000000005s)]
*  I bet in another country they're doing it. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5246.280000000001s)]
*  I think we got our hands in there, baby. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5248.92s)]
*  Do you think so? [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5250.68s)]
*  I think for sure. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5251.68s)]
*  You think like in Area 51? [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5252.68s)]
*  For sure. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5253.68s)]
*  What they're making people? [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5254.68s)]
*  Well, don't you think it was so funny that for how many years, when you were a kid, for [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5255.68s)]
*  how many years did you hear about, you know, that alien life forms at Area 51, that's all [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5258.76s)]
*  bullshit. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5264.96s)]
*  That's not what it, and then now they're like, no, no, no, we, there's some alien shit over [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5265.96s)]
*  there. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5269.76s)]
*  They don't say that. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5270.76s)]
*  Yeah, they do. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5271.76s)]
*  No, they don't. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5272.76s)]
*  They say there's something unidentified. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5273.76s)]
*  They found things that they don't know really what it is that they've experimented on. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5274.76s)]
*  I can tell you exactly what they've said. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5279.76s)]
*  What do they say? [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5280.76s)]
*  Because I've talked to a lot of these guys. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5281.76s)]
*  What the government is admitting is that they believe that there are crafts that are operating [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5283.400000000001s)]
*  that are outside of their understanding of physics. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5289.56s)]

*  There have been people that have said, and this is a quote from the Pentagon, that there [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5294.92s)]
*  was off-world vehicles not from this earth. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5300.4400000000005s)]
*  But who said that quote is what I was always confused about. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5304.92s)]
*  It was like one of the top Pentagon officials, it's like one of those things where it's like, [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5308.719999999999s)]
*  wait a minute, who said that? [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5311.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5312.679999999999s)]
*  And what is the exact quote? [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5313.679999999999s)]
*  How did you exactly say it? [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5314.679999999999s)]
*  How much of this is clickbait? [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5315.679999999999s)]
*  But I've talked to multiple pilots that have had encounters. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5317.719999999999s)]
*  I got to know we got something. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5321.92s)]
*  And I don't know if it's ours, if it's a drone that we don't tell them about that moves in [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5323.92s)]
*  a way that defies our understanding of physics because it doesn't operate on a propulsion [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5332.36s)]
*  engine. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5337.56s)]
*  It operates on something that's completely new and unique. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5338.56s)]
*  And there have been thoughts about how a new and unique gravity-based propulsion system [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5341.04s)]
*  would work for decades. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5345.88s)]
*  Astrophysicist Eric W. Davis, who spent years working as a consultant for the Pentagon UFO [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5348.96s)]
*  program and is now a defense contractor, gave a classified briefing to the Defense Department [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5354.080000000001s)]

*  In other words, spaceships. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5364.2s)]
*  The bombshell quote came in the latest UFO report from the New York Times, which has [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5365.92s)]

*  I was like, this will be the thing. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5947.88s)]
*  You can feel it's something about certain rooms. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5950.04s)]
*  Somebody asked me one time on a show, on a podcast about what, a guy who was in a comic [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5953.12s)]
*  was like, what makes like a good room? [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5958.6s)]
*  And I go, honestly, I can name you like physical elements, but sometimes, I don't know, some [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5960.240000000001s)]
*  things are a feeling where you're like, wow, something hits. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5965.1s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5967.84s)]
*  I can tell you why we like low ceilings and why we like, you know, the way it's situated, [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5968.84s)]
*  but there's just rooms around the country. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5973.900000000001s)]
*  You know that when you go in, you're like, wow, I fucking love. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5975.46s)]
*  There's also old buildings. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5978.1s)]
*  Well, yeah, the history does something to make it feel. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5979.42s)]
*  There's something about old buildings, yeah. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5982.06s)]
*  Like when you and I came back here before, when I was running around with you and we [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5983.5s)]
*  played the old Cap City, I remember you being like, oh man, I fucking love the vibration [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5987.54s)]
*  of this room. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5994.42s)]
*  And it was something about, I don't know, I couldn't tell you. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5995.42s)]
*  I've been around for decades. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5998.64s)]
*  Just as if there's something in the guts of it. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=5999.64s)]
*  You know, I tried to buy that place. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6001.0s)]
*  The old Cap City? [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6002.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6003.68s)]
*  You did? [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6004.68s)]
*  Yeah, they wanted too much money for it. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6005.68s)]
*  It was like the whole mall. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6006.84s)]
*  It was like there was a lot of work involved and it was not in town. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6008.36s)]
*  The whole situation was not ideal. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6012.0s)]
*  And so I decided not to go with that. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6014.2s)]
*  And then I went with another one, another place that turned out to be a former cult owned [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6016.76s)]
*  it. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6022.2s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's right. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6023.2s)]
*  Yes. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6024.2s)]
*  And I didn't know like the extent of the cult. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6025.2s)]
*  I had heard it was a cult. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6026.68s)]
*  What kind of cult? [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6028.26s)]
*  What did they do? [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6029.26s)]
*  And then I watched a documentary called Holy Hell. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6030.26s)]
*  It's on Amazon. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6032.0199999999995s)]
*  The guy who ran the cult fucked everybody, including the guys. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6033.3s)]
*  He would charge the guys for therapy, charge them 50 bucks for therapy and then he would [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6037.0199999999995s)]
*  fuck them. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6040.62s)]
*  He fucked everybody. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6041.62s)]
*  It's a part of therapy. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6042.62s)]
*  And this guy was like a low rent actor. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6044.139999999999s)]
*  He was in Rosemary's Baby for like a very small scene, like as an extra. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6047.58s)]
*  Oh, okay, not one of the characters. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6051.98s)]
*  No. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6053.38s)]
*  One scene with Mia Farrow. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6054.88s)]
*  And this guy went on to start this fucking cult in West Hollywood. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6057.8s)]
*  And then I don't know, like if people were chasing him down or whatever, but he upended [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6061.6s)]
*  and took everybody to Austin and had them build this theater for him to dance in. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6064.88s)]
*  Just to dance? [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6071.68s)]
*  Just to dance. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6072.68s)]
*  With other people? [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6073.68s)]
*  Well, he would dance and perform for like all of his flock. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6074.68s)]
*  Wow. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6077.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6078.56s)]
*  And then he up and took off and went to Hawaii. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6079.56s)]
*  This guy lives a pretty fun life though. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6083.06s)]
*  One of the guys confronted him in Hawaii. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6085.62s)]
*  That's him. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6087.780000000001s)]
*  Holy hell. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6088.780000000001s)]

*  That's the guy. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6090.780000000001s)]
*  The guy had a bunch of plastic surgery and shit. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6091.780000000001s)]
*  It was a really weird fucking scene. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6093.66s)]
*  And that was that place. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6097.34s)]
*  I'm like, oh my God. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6098.34s)]
*  So I got out of that place. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6099.34s)]
*  I was like, oh no. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6100.34s)]
*  So we threw that place away. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6102.9800000000005s)]
*  There was another issue that came about with that place before we found the place we're [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6105.02s)]
*  at now. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6108.18s)]
*  But the new joint is great. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6109.18s)]

*  things because I know, you know, an X amount of years it'll be cool to, it'll just be neat [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6117.320000000001s)]

*  I like it. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6163.22s)]
*  I like doing things like that. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6164.22s)]
*  They upend you and they make you sort of recalibrate and you know, you have your bumps, you have [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6165.98s)]
*  your bumps, you have your bumps, you have your bumps. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6170.4400000000005s)]
*  And then you're like, well, maybe this is the wrong move. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6171.4400000000005s)]
*  Maybe this is the right move. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6172.92s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6173.92s)]
*  But then you find your way, you know, but it's, there's something about starting something [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6174.92s)]
*  new and difficult that's like very exciting for people. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6179.16s)]
*  That's what I'm going to New York in May for that reason. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6182.76s)]
*  You're moving to New York? [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6185.28s)]
*  I don't say moving. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6186.28s)]

*  What part? [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6190.28s)]
*  Downtown. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6191.28s)]

*  I have a lot of good friends there. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6195.12s)]
*  And something hit me recently where I was like, I have the, I'm blessed enough, whatever [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6198.780000000001s)]

*  It's just, I do love it. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6224.3s)]
*  I want something different. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6225.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, I've been in West Hollywood was a long period of my life. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6227.68s)]
*  Now I live somewhere else in LA. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6230.04s)]
*  And then I just was like, what if I jump out of LA for a while? [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6231.36s)]
*  Good for you. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6234.12s)]

*  It's good for you. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6238.12s)]
*  So many road gigs are on there too. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6239.12s)]
*  If you're on the East coast, you can go all over Connecticut and do road gigs. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6240.12s)]

*  Everywhere. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6246.04s)]
*  A few hours drive and you're everywhere. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6247.04s)]
*  LA is like San Diego, San Francisco. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6249.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6251.36s)]
*  And the amount of time it takes you to San Diego, you really have to leave at noon because [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6252.36s)]
*  the traffic you hit in Orange County is fucking preposterous. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6256.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's gross. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6258.34s)]
*  It'll take five hours sometimes. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6259.34s)]
*  Easy. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6260.34s)]
*  That's why I need that jet pack, dude. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6261.34s)]
*  That's why I'm soup down there. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6262.34s)]
*  Burr was doing gigs in San Diego and he's taking his helicopter. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6264.7s)]
*  Dude, insane. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6267.58s)]

*  It's amazing. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6270.78s)]
*  He's flying himself to San Diego in a helicopter. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6271.78s)]
*  Yeah, I'll do the gig. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6273.78s)]
*  Yeah, I'll come down. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6274.78s)]
*  You got to have a fucking pad for me to land on. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6275.78s)]
*  Yeah, you got to find a pad. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6276.78s)]
*  I saw a video this morning on the internet of how it was like, it was in the Hamptons [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6278.78s)]
*  or something maybe, and it was like how rich people fuck with other rich people. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6283.400000000001s)]
*  And it was a dude and he's yelling at the helicopter, and the guy's in a helicopter [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6287.28s)]
*  and he's like near his, I mean, dude, he's got to be 20 feet above, no shit above his [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6291.12s)]
*  pool and the wind is blowing all his yard shit, all his pool, like chairs and shit all [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6295.08s)]
*  over the place and the guy's pissed. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6300.6s)]
*  And then you can tell that they're laughing about it and then they fuck off in the helicopter. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6302.08s)]
*  So he's doing it just to fuck with the guy. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6305.68s)]
*  Just to fuck with this guy. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6306.68s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6307.68s)]
*  Yeah, it was badass. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6308.68s)]
*  What a douchebag. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6309.68s)]
*  It was so funny, dude. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6310.68s)]
*  This is how the richest have nothing to do, this is exactly how they fuck with each other. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6311.9800000000005s)]
*  Is that legal? [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6318.62s)]
*  No fucking, no way. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6319.62s)]
*  How close are you allowed to be to a person's house with a helicopter? [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6320.62s)]
*  I can't imagine you're allowed to be anywhere near personal property. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6323.9800000000005s)]
*  You can kind of fly around in those things. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6326.9800000000005s)]
*  It was very bizarre. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6328.860000000001s)]
*  But what's the restricted space? [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6330.860000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6332.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6333.9800000000005s)]
*  But when I went out with Burr, we were flying around. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6334.9800000000005s)]
*  You just go where you want to go. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6337.46s)]
*  We flew over downtown LA, we flew over these buildings. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6339.52s)]
*  You'd be amazed at how many buildings have X's on the top, where they have a landing [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6342.28s)]
*  pad on the top. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6345.64s)]
*  There's air traffic, obviously he's in communication with. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6348.32s)]
*  Can you land on one of those? [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6351.92s)]
*  It's a very good question. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6352.92s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6353.92s)]
*  I think it's private property. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6354.92s)]
*  But I think that I don't know if you have to tell everybody where you're going. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6355.92s)]
*  If you're on a plane, you have a direct flight path. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6360.52s)]
*  Bill's kind of moving around, doing whatever he wants to do. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6364.88s)]
*  And they're like, let's go over here. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6367.56s)]
*  Okay, we're going over here. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6368.660000000001s)]

*  And then the guy who he's with is like his co-pilot, who's his instructor. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6371.580000000001s)]
*  They're talking about where to go, set it down here, and then you're going to lift it [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6377.14s)]
*  up. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6380.42s)]
*  So he sets it down this hill. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6381.42s)]
*  It's such a comedian's machine of flight, though, because it's like, wherever, man, [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6383.820000000001s)]

*  It's just like you're improv-ing the whole time in the air. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6389.22s)]
*  You're like, I guess we'll go over the fucking buildings, we'll go over there. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6390.9400000000005s)]

*  Yeah, when I was in college, man, I was so dumb. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6397.5599999999995s)]
*  My buddy Mark was a pilot. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6399.84s)]

*  We would just go, we flew to San Diego. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6409.68s)]
*  We flew all over Denver. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6412.8s)]
*  He was like, you want to see the stadium? [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6414.28s)]
*  I was like, fuck yeah, dude. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6415.28s)]
*  Stone flying over the stadium. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6418.36s)]
*  He was sober, he was sober, but I was like, it's funny that if you're in training, you [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6419.44s)]
*  can just take one of these fucking things up. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6425.02s)]

*  Yeah, dude, we just took it. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6437.66s)]
*  We would take it to play. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6438.66s)]
*  We landed in Long Beach one time, at Long Beach's little regional airport. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6439.86s)]
*  Yeah, dude, it was very stupid. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6443.18s)]
*  When I used to hang out with Phil Hartman, he had his own plane. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6445.98s)]
*  He had one of those kind of planes. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6448.5s)]
*  A single-engine plane. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6449.5s)]
*  Like a little Cessna? [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6450.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6451.5s)]
*  He took me up in his plane. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6452.5s)]
*  He was so disciplined in his aviation work. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6453.5s)]
*  He had in between takes, he would go over his flight book. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6458.88s)]
*  He was reading, he was reading all this because he had to take his flight examination. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6462.16s)]
*  So he started doing it when we first started News Radio. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6465.6s)]
*  But two years later, he's got a plane, he's flying around. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6467.84s)]
*  And so I'd go up, I went up with him once in this little single-engine plane. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6471.64s)]
*  It's showing me all these areas in the valley and all the different places to live. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6475.48s)]
*  It's sketchy, but it's cool. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6481.64s)]
*  It's sketchy, but it's pretty badass. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6483.44s)]
*  The freedom that you get, you're just alone up there floating around. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6484.98s)]
*  It's pretty amazing. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6488.099999999999s)]
*  Have you seen these guys that go up in paramotors? [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6489.099999999999s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6491.7s)]
*  Oh yeah, the paramotors are so badass. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6492.7s)]
*  That's so insane. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6495.339999999999s)]
*  They're just fucking floating at 6,000 feet. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6496.339999999999s)]
*  That's so insane. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6497.66s)]
*  Look at that guy. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6498.66s)]
*  By the way, this is another thing where you're like, you just go wherever the fuck you want [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6499.66s)]
*  to go. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6502.7s)]
*  Now how do you stop from getting hit by a plane? [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6503.7s)]
*  Well, you're only 5 or 6,000 feet up. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6505.339999999999s)]
*  How many in-air collisions take place? [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6507.98s)]
*  You know? [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6511.58s)]
*  They happen more often, I think, but they definitely still happen. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6512.6s)]
*  They happen at those air shows. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6514.8s)]
*  Did you see the one recently? [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6516.12s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6517.12s)]
*  The air show in Dallas? [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6518.12s)]
*  It shook my core. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6520.24s)]
*  They're flying those old-ass planes, too. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6521.84s)]
*  It just banked so strange. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6523.96s)]
*  The way that other plane just banked, you were like, oh God. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6525.5599999999995s)]
*  You knew almost right away. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6529.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's fucking horrible. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6531.12s)]
*  But it happens. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6533.28s)]
*  I feel like this happens so much that you're like, why are we still doing these air shows? [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6534.28s)]
*  Doesn't this? [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6538.64s)]
*  Every year you're like, you hear what happened at the air show and you're like, yeah, they [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6539.64s)]
*  fucking, 15 kids' heads got cut off because they came too low. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6542.02s)]
*  I feel like every year something wild happens. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6544.7s)]
*  Unless you're a blue angel. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6547.54s)]
*  Why are we still doing local fucking, local air shows? [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6550.54s)]
*  How many air show accidents happen all the time? [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6554.58s)]
*  I feel like every year someone's like, oh yeah, that was fucked up. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6557.78s)]
*  What happened at that one? [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6560.22s)]
*  Even like those Thunderbird guys, they crash sometimes. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6561.54s)]
*  I think they have accidents, but I don't know if they crash crash, but I do think they'll [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6564.78s)]

*  To handle the Gs too on those turns, flipping like that constantly. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6629.0s)]
*  I'm immediately throwing up. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6633.0s)]

*  Gs, you have to go like this. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6659.740000000001s)]
*  Hoot, hoot, hoot, hoot. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6661.3s)]

*  And you're feeling your consciousness closing in like an elevator door with the Gs. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6666.22s)]
*  We got to six and a half Gs before I couldn't take it anymore. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6671.1s)]

*  For sure. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6844.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6845.6s)]

*  Yeah, shut the fuck up. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6847.6s)]

*  You guys like trying too hard and you're drunk? [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6850.3s)]
*  It's like my favorite, I think I've talked about it on this show, but Stan Micheco, I [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6853.82s)]
*  don't know how to pronounce his last name, his most famous painting is called The Jester [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6860.26s)]
*  and it's one of my fucking favorites and Stan, Stan Micheco, I think it is. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6866.139999999999s)]
*  But this to me, if I could buy the original, if I had enough money, I would buy it because [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6871.66s)]
*  it shows how comics feel sometimes when you're done, sometimes when you're done off a stage [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6877.4400000000005s)]
*  and you're fucking burnt, you're like, dude, I've been given so much, I'm tired, I did [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6882.76s)]
*  two shows tonight. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6886.6s)]
*  You just kind of have that moment of just decompression. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6887.6s)]
*  You're not thinking. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6891.56s)]
*  After we would do shows together sometimes, you and I would sit in silence in the green [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6893.04s)]
*  room and just not say anything. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6896.16s)]
*  Just catch your breath. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6898.4800000000005s)]
*  Just catch your breath and chill out. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6899.4800000000005s)]
*  That's that Stan Micheco painting. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6900.6s)]
*  Look up The Jester. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6903.76s)]
*  I think it's called The Jester. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6905.0s)]
*  Do you have any data on how many jesters were murdered? [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6906.54s)]
*  I haven't found anything yet. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6909.099999999999s)]
*  Just no murderers. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6910.099999999999s)]
*  Just weren't murdered. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6911.099999999999s)]
*  Most of them weren't murdered. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6913.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6914.5s)]
*  So it's like one of them, the most famous one, I'm reading the story about how and why he [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6915.5s)]
*  was killed, but how was he killed? [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6918.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6920.5s)]
*  What did they do? [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6921.5s)]
*  He like pushed his luck, it seems like. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6922.5s)]
*  He asked the question to the king about like, what if someone tried to kill me? [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6923.5s)]
*  And he's like, don't worry about that. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6928.46s)]
*  If someone tries to kill you, they'd be killed. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6929.66s)]
*  The noble would be beheaded in more than no more, not more than 50 minutes. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6931.139999999999s)]
*  Why not? [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6934.84s)]
*  15 minutes before. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6935.84s)]
*  His reply made sense, but it was not received well. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6936.84s)]
*  Yeah, bombed. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6940.92s)]
*  At a later date, he pushed his luck once more by physically humiliating the king after telling [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6941.92s)]
*  some joke that Jester slapped Francis I's royal behind amid roars of laughter from all [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6946.160000000001s)]
*  the court's nobles. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6954.200000000001s)]
*  The monarch threatened to have him hang for this unless he could come up with an apology, [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6955.92s)]
*  even more offensive than that act. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6959.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm so sorry, your majesty, but I didn't recognize you. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6961.9800000000005s)]
*  I mistook you for the queen. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6964.14s)]
*  Oh, two times. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6965.38s)]
*  His wit really was the stuff of legends, but as you may recall, the only people fully off [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6966.74s)]
*  limits from a court Jester's mockery were the queen and her ladies-in-waiting. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6971.06s)]
*  The king decided to kill him despite the deal they made, but given that Tribulé was [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6974.78s)]
*  physically disabled and probably had magical powers, Francis I decided that it would be [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6980.82s)]
*  fair to at least let him choose his way of dying. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6987.94s)]
*  He did not want to annoy Tribulé too much while killing him. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6991.78s)]
*  So the jester chose, he told the king, good sire, for Saint Nichus, how do you say that? [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=6995.32s)]
*  Nichus. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7001.679999999999s)]
*  Nichus and Saint Panard say, patrons of insanity, I choose to die from old age. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7002.679999999999s)]
*  The joke completely broke through the king's anger and Tribulé was again allowed to live. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7008.8s)]
*  He ended up only being exiled from the realm. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7013.759999999999s)]
*  They just kicked him out. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7016.0s)]
*  Oh. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7017.0s)]
*  I couldn't find it even, I'm sure they were, but like no number and I didn't get anything [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7018.0s)]
*  yet. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7022.72s)]
*  That also sounds like a lot of anecdotal bullshit. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7023.72s)]
*  I believe almost none of that, but I like all of it. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7025.94s)]
*  I like it too. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7028.26s)]
*  I'd like to believe there was a dude that was that funny, got his way out of getting [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7029.26s)]
*  killed, slapped the king's ass, made fun of the wife and still lived. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7032.1s)]
*  That's Dan Matejko, that's my favorite. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7035.7s)]
*  So why this is also so powerful to me truly is, if you can see on the right there behind [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7038.22s)]
*  In a more clear version of this, the party is still happening. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7044.839999999999s)]
*  And it's just kind of like, this is truly how I feel where you're like, we just did [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7049.48s)]
*  the gig. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7054.24s)]
*  Decompress. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7055.24s)]
*  Yeah, you just need to just be quiet by yourself. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7056.24s)]
*  Does he have notes? [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7059.08s)]
*  Yes, that's all of his performance notes. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7060.639999999999s)]
*  1862. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7063.16s)]
*  I never thought of jesters as having notes. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7064.16s)]
*  Well, they had to prep for shit. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7066.759999999999s)]
*  They must have. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7069.32s)]
*  So that's Stancik, Jan Matejko. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7070.7s)]
*  I don't know how to pronounce it. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7073.86s)]
*  I'm stupid. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7074.86s)]
*  Can you mention, how do you apprentice? [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7075.86s)]
*  For a jester. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7079.58s)]
*  Yeah, and do you work at someone's house for a little while before they move you up to [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7080.58s)]
*  a court? [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7083.38s)]
*  I'm sure he's like, hey man, you got to take my notes for my bits. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7084.38s)]
*  And he'll probably run bits. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7086.66s)]
*  Like those old Catskill comics who just tell old jokes. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7088.86s)]
*  Right. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7091.74s)]
*  Yeah, and they have somebody who's like, mark down, sometimes when I put my eyes out and [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7092.74s)]
*  I grab my dick, they laugh. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7098.56s)]
*  Put that down as a bit of the thing. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7100.16s)]
*  And you know there's a young kid who's like, oh, grab the dick and then the eye cross, [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7101.72s)]
*  cross eye on the right side. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7104.72s)]
*  That had to have been what these guys did because they had to pick people in the, you [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7105.92s)]
*  know these guys are the original crowd work kings. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7108.92s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7110.76s)]
*  They were, this was crowd work at its finest. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7111.76s)]
*  They'd pick people out of the parties. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7114.5199999999995s)]
*  They'd go back. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7116.2s)]
*  They'd write some notes about, you know, something they could lay in because that's what, that [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7117.2s)]
*  was interesting. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7120.8s)]
*  I feel like I've heard that before that they said, you can't say anything about the queen. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7121.8s)]
*  You can say anything about anybody else. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7124.96s)]
*  The queen and any of her crew, you're not allowed to say shit about, but everyone else [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7126.16s)]
*  is like, oh, fuck them all. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7130.9s)]
*  Fuck everybody. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7132.3s)]
*  Like the king would be like, you can, the most powerful man, fuck them. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7133.3s)]
*  So kill the messenger from what I'm reading from jesters being killed in battlefields [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7137.139999999999s)]
*  because they were, the masters made them carry the messages to the other leaders. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7143.099999999999s)]
*  Great. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7147.9s)]
*  Sometimes they were killed. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7148.9s)]
*  Jesters were often required to go to battlefield with their masters to carry messages between [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7149.9s)]
*  the leaders of warring armies demanding that a city surrender to a besieging army or delivering [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7154.54s)]
*  the terms for the release of hostages. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7160.44s)]
*  Unfortunately for jesters, the enemy did sometimes kill the messenger as an act of defiance, [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7163.32s)]
*  especially if they regarded the terms being offered as an insult. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7167.84s)]
*  And some used a catapult or a trebuchet to hurl the unfortunate messenger or his severed [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7172.54s)]
*  head back into his own camp as a graphic illustration of what they thought of the message. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7180.54s)]
*  Can you imagine a trebuchet, fucking a huge human catapult, but just you're chilling with [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7186.259999999999s)]
*  your boys and your old boy's head comes. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7191.0199999999995s)]
*  I told them to go tell them to go fuck themselves. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7194.9s)]
*  He said go fuck themselves. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7196.74s)]
*  I guess they fucked him. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7198.0599999999995s)]
*  I said, give me all you women and all your gold and we're good. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7199.0599999999995s)]
*  Then a fucking head comes flying to the windshield. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7202.9s)]
*  Sometimes that cruel and unusual punishment shit that they would do from years ago, like [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7205.58s)]
*  some of it was like grossly funny. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7208.22s)]
*  It's still gross, but it's like, that's hilarious to be like, cut his head off, throw it back [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7210.580000000001s)]
*  at those guys. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7214.580000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7215.580000000001s)]
*  And they would just load it up in a catapult, fucking hook it at your friends. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7216.580000000001s)]
*  The psychological aspect of a fucking head flying over the wall of the castle. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7219.18s)]
*  It's a deep cut. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7223.660000000001s)]
*  You think anybody laughed? [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7224.660000000001s)]
*  You think of the crew, you think one guy was like. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7225.660000000001s)]
*  They're probably used to it. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7227.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7229.1s)]
*  They're probably used to people getting their heads chopped off. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7230.1s)]
*  I mean, back then people fought with swords. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7231.540000000001s)]
*  People died every day that someone you knew someone was dying. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7234.26s)]
*  And probably in the streets people are getting stabbed left and right. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7237.42s)]
*  Cause like life and death was probably so cheap. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7241.02s)]
*  Just a common place where you're like, yeah, he died. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7244.46s)]
*  Big deal. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7247.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7248.06s)]
*  He got cut up. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7249.06s)]
*  It happens. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7250.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7251.06s)]
*  They sliced his arms off. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7252.06s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7253.06s)]
*  The Mongols would light people on fire and then use their bodies to light buildings on [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7254.06s)]
*  fire with catapults. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7256.54s)]
*  I thought you were going to say for warmth. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7257.54s)]
*  Did they ever light people on, just to warm up? [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7258.82s)]
*  They probably did. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7260.82s)]
*  They probably did whatever they wanted to. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7261.82s)]
*  They're like, man, don't freeze him. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7262.82s)]
*  Burn Nick. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7264.42s)]
*  I can't imagine horrific ways that people died. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7265.42s)]
*  One of the things they did when they, the way they would kill Royals is they wouldn't [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7268.9s)]
*  kill them like they would kill like regular people. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7274.3s)]
*  So they would put them sometimes they would stack them and then put boards over the top [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7276.86s)]
*  of them and then eat dinner on top of them and crush them to death. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7281.32s)]
*  Shut up. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7284.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7285.9400000000005s)]
*  They used you as a table. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7286.9400000000005s)]
*  You were a little side table. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7287.9400000000005s)]
*  You were the thing under the table. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7289.82s)]
*  That's awful. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7292.62s)]
*  Like a whole structure over you. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7293.94s)]
*  And then everybody would like lay the tables out and all the food out and then all the [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7297.46s)]
*  people would walk onto it and then they just crush you. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7301.62s)]
*  The visual is funny. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7304.14s)]
*  I know it's terrible, but it's just funny. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7305.14s)]
*  It's fucking dark. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7307.0599999999995s)]
*  It's fucking dark, dude. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7308.0599999999995s)]
*  That's not that long ago that people did that to people. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7310.18s)]
*  No. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7313.26s)]
*  It's not that long ago. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7314.26s)]
*  No. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7315.26s)]
*  But the reasoning has changed so heavily. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7316.26s)]
*  It's funny. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7317.64s)]
*  You know what technology they say it's like it jumps like, you know, it's the fastest [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7318.64s)]
*  moving thing we have. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7321.84s)]
*  It's technology continually just like overleaping itself. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7323.28s)]
*  Think about giving us a little bit of credit as a society, as people, that we're pretty [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7326.599999999999s)]
*  good to a degree at times changing our ways of like, we can't do that shit anymore. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7331.5199999999995s)]
*  For the most part. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7336.44s)]
*  Yeah, we're trying. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7337.44s)]
*  I think it's kind of... [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7338.44s)]
*  It's definitely a lot better. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7339.44s)]
*  Well, it's only going to get better. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7340.44s)]
*  This is wild that you think that not that long ago that shit would happen, but you're [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7341.44s)]
*  like, it is nice we don't do that anymore. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7344.88s)]
*  But now we kill people with drones. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7347.2s)]
*  If you're in a wedding party in Yemen and you hear... [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7349.76s)]
*  You hear something headed your way. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7352.76s)]

*  Boom! [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7357.76s)]
*  It's a gift from someone. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7358.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7360.76s)]
*  No, yeah, we're more... [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7361.76s)]
*  The drone thing is wild. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7362.76s)]
*  We're getting further away from... we don't want to see it. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7364.84s)]
*  Yeah, we don't want to eat lunch on your compressing body. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7366.8s)]
*  No, but we want to pay someone far away to do it to you. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7370.4s)]
*  But we want to launch a rocket out of our flying robots. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7372.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's nuts. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7376.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7377.68s)]
*  But we're not pulling on your... [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7379.240000000001s)]
*  The fucking... the Chinese torture tactics were wild though. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7382.240000000001s)]
*  You read about those things. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7385.56s)]
*  They were endless. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7386.56s)]
*  What did they do? [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7387.56s)]
*  Water torture might be the one that most people know. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7389.56s)]
*  That might be the... [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7391.8s)]

*  For sure. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7761.8s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7762.8s)]
*  It looks like she's mummified. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7763.8s)]
*  Well maybe they did put her in something. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7765.8s)]
*  Put her in a movie. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7769.56s)]
*  Well then there's the embalming, right? [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7770.56s)]
*  Like what does that do? [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7772.280000000001s)]
*  That stops you from deteriorating the same way, right? [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7774.04s)]
*  Formaldehyde? [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7777.8s)]
*  Did she get embalmed? [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7778.8s)]
*  Is that why she's like that? [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7779.8s)]
*  Or is that like a mummification process? [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7781.12s)]
*  That looks more mummified. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7783.08s)]
*  Because isn't embalming, doesn't that like really, that preserves the shit out of you, [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7784.24s)]
*  right? [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7788.12s)]

*  out there was like arsenic in them and things that the people had done to poison the people [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7793.16s)]

*  Post mortem? [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7814.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7816.36s)]
*  So you could make a deal while you're alive? [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7817.36s)]
*  I don't know if it's specific. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7820.08s)]
*  Or after you're dead. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7821.08s)]
*  It was like after they were dead, like they would sell grandma, and he said the high percentage [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7822.08s)]
*  of these, the high percentages of what was going on in this marketplace was for reassignment [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7824.88s)]
*  surgery. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7831.32s)]
*  So it was like, you know, it was either like skin for new dicks or skin for vaginal reconstructive [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7832.32s)]
*  surgery and shit like that. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7837.36s)]

*  Yeah, kind of wild. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=7944.52s)]

*  And what wasn't was based on other people's shared experiences with patient brokering [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8007.16s)]
*  in Southern California. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8012.12s)]

*  Because you're right, dick skin is not... [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8051.4400000000005s)]

*  Jamie always gets into these like fine men. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8080.8s)]
*  I found a post that says like, what can human skin... [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8081.8s)]

*  heart valves, breast reconstruction. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8094.679999999999s)]
*  I thought I saw a thing. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8096.96s)]
*  There was a manifest on a ship somewhere that said that there was 6,000 pounds of human [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8100.32s)]
*  tissue. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8106.719999999999s)]

*  They were smuggling it in? [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8116.84s)]
*  I'm piecing together stories of body brokering like very loosely. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8117.84s)]

*  remains valued at $67,000. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8146.8s)]
*  They kept it in a five degree Fahrenheit container. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8148.84s)]
*  And it was like... [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8152.6s)]
*  The body parts came from a Portland business called Medicure Inc., a so-called body broker [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8153.6s)]
*  Medicure profits by dissecting the bodies of altruistic donors and sending the parts [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8158.12s)]
*  to medical training and research companies. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8164.0s)]

*  What is that? [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8184.72s)]
*  The move is they take you. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8185.72s)]
*  They take your body, no embalming. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8186.76s)]
*  They cut you up and they bring you to the top of a mountain where they chop you up and [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8188.68s)]
*  feed you to vultures while everybody watches. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8193.52s)]
*  Why? [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8195.880000000001s)]
*  And the vultures know that that's what you're there for because they feed people to these [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8196.880000000001s)]
*  vultures all the time. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8201.32s)]
*  And so the vultures just eat the people. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8204.12s)]
*  Why do you want that? [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8206.44s)]
*  It's a ritualistic tradition. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8207.44s)]
*  Well, at least my body will be useful. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8208.44s)]

*  bringing over bodies. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8224.24s)]
*  Let's look. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8225.24s)]
*  They're fighting over big chunks. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8226.24s)]
*  That's like a chunk of a human. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8227.24s)]
*  They're cutting chunks of hair and meat and all these different pieces. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8228.519999999999s)]

*  And they take them, they take their clothes off, they chop them up and then the vultures [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8258.400000000001s)]

*  like a ton of famous people buried by the Glendale Temple, I think. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8340.74s)]

*  My dad's old house was in a neighborhood in Chicago and across the street, literally [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8351.72s)]
*  from his house was an old cemetery, and a bunch of old famous gangsters were apparently [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8357.56s)]
*  buried there. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8362.599999999999s)]

*  Do you know who that guy is? [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8366.32s)]
*  He's the guy that shot Lee Harvey Oswald. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8368.16s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8369.56s)]
*  He was buried across the street from my dad and I was reading up about him because I was [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8370.56s)]
*  like, I want to know more about, I think his name was like Jack Rubenstein or something [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8374.679999999998s)]
*  like that. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8378.679999999998s)]

*  didn't even think he might not be the one that killed Lee Harvey Oswald. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8384.240000000002s)]
*  Oh, he definitely killed Lee Harvey Oswald. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8387.800000000001s)]
*  Well right, but then they say that he shot him, right? [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8389.560000000001s)]
*  But then there was people said that that's not what killed Lee Harvey Oswald. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8392.880000000001s)]

*  No. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8404.44s)]
*  Right? [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8405.44s)]
*  I don't think so. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8406.44s)]
*  Look up how Jack Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8407.44s)]
*  It looked like a 38. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8408.44s)]
*  What did he use? [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8409.480000000001s)]

*  Ah, it's pretty small. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8415.0s)]
*  It's not really though, dude. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8416.720000000001s)]
*  Is the arm in the way or did he already shoot him by then? [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8417.720000000001s)]
*  I think he... [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8420.12s)]
*  I think he had shot him by then. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8421.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think it's like right in there. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8422.12s)]
*  Yeah, he probably is curling from the shot. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8424.12s)]
*  Just Google what kind of gun Jack Ruby used to kill Lee Harvey Oswald. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8426.16s)]
*  But yeah, that headstone was right across the street from my dad's old house. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8429.560000000001s)]

*  Do you know Jack Ruby was connected to MK Ultra? [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8434.76s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8438.68s)]
*  How? [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8439.68s)]
*  Jolly West, the head guy from the CIA, from MK Ultra, went to visit Lee Harvey Oswald [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8440.68s)]
*  after he shot... [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8446.64s)]

*  They probably gave him a little shut the fuck up shot. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8479.96s)]
*  Shut the fuck up shot. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8483.359999999999s)]
*  Just gave him a little shut the fuck up shot. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8484.359999999999s)]
*  Because they were like, oh no man, he got cancer overnight. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8486.119999999999s)]
*  Like what? [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8488.119999999999s)]
*  It was all over his body. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8489.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8490.119999999999s)]
*  But before he was okay? [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8491.119999999999s)]
*  Totally. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8492.119999999999s)]
*  They probably just force fed him radiation. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8493.119999999999s)]
*  Something. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8494.119999999999s)]
*  They gave him radiation with his acid. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8495.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8497.28s)]
*  But that MK Ultra thing, there's a book on it called Chaos by Tom O'Neill. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8498.28s)]
*  It's an amazing book. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8502.08s)]
*  He was Greg Fitzsimmons' next door neighbor for like 20 years. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8503.480000000001s)]
*  What? [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8506.880000000001s)]
*  And he'd been working on this one book. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8507.880000000001s)]
*  Started off as a magazine article and as he started researching the magazine article, [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8509.480000000001s)]
*  it just got deeper and deeper. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8512.960000000001s)]
*  He found out more inconsistencies and more things that were fucked up. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8514.2s)]
*  And then he eventually realized that Charles Manson had been visited by Jolly West in prison. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8517.28s)]
*  And that they had experimented with Charles Manson with crowd control and mind control [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8523.52s)]
*  and cult control methods. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8528.24s)]
*  And they provided him with LSD most likely. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8530.119999999999s)]
*  And most certainly got him out of jail every time he got arrested afterwards. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8533.0s)]
*  People would have arrested Charles Manson for all sorts of shit while he was on parole. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8537.0s)]
*  They should have put him in jail for the rest of his life. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8539.72s)]
*  They were like, well, he's above our pay grade. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8541.56s)]
*  We're being told to let him go. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8544.6s)]
*  So they would just let him go. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8545.6s)]
*  And then he would go out and run these hippies and have them murder people. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8547.24s)]
*  And this is at the time where they were trying to infiltrate the hippie movement. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8550.1s)]
*  Same way the FBI tries to infiltrate these fucking wacky militias and get them to go [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8554.06s)]
*  kidnap the governor of Michigan. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8557.880000000001s)]
*  Back then they would dose people up with acid and get the hippies to go murder people. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8559.960000000001s)]
*  They're like, this is a great way to crack down on the anti-war movement. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8564.300000000001s)]
*  Great way to crack down on the hippies. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8568.1s)]
*  Get everybody terrified of this young movement of these flower children. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8569.34s)]
*  And they're not so peaceful after all. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8574.82s)]
*  Matter of fact, they're fucking murderers. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8576.7s)]
*  So they literally got a murderer in prison, got a crazy psychopath in prison, Charles [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8578.26s)]
*  Manson, taught him how to run a cult, taught him how to control people with LSD, and then [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8583.86s)]
*  supplied him with LSD and sent him out in the world. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8590.7s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8593.7s)]
*  Yes. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8594.7s)]
*  That's trippy. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8595.7s)]
*  It's an amazing book, man. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8596.7s)]
*  The book's great because it's very detailed, as you can imagine, because Tom worked on [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8597.7s)]
*  it for 20 fucking years. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8601.14s)]
*  And how many has he written outside of that? [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8603.58s)]
*  I don't think any. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8605.18s)]
*  That was the one. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8606.18s)]
*  I think that's his big book. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8607.18s)]
*  He's working on a second book because he had so much data just from that one case that [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8609.1s)]
*  I think he's working on a second book right now. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8612.86s)]
*  What's it called? [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8614.58s)]
*  Chaos. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8615.58s)]
*  Chaos. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8616.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8617.58s)]
*  It's wild. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8618.58s)]
*  It's really interesting stuff, man. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8619.58s)]
*  38. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8622.86s)]
*  38. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8623.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8624.86s)]
*  The most famous gun in the world. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8625.86s)]
*  An original bullet shot from the most famous gun in the world. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8627.460000000001s)]
*  Jack Ruby, Colt Cobra 38 Special. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8631.42s)]
*  Yeah, I see I know my guns. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8634.380000000001s)]
*  But look at it, it says 435 out of 5,000. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8636.18s)]
*  So they shot bullets out of it, I think, to sell. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8638.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8640.460000000001s)]
*  They shot 5,000 bullets out of it to sell. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8641.460000000001s)]
*  How many dummies are like, I want that bullet. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8643.58s)]
*  You shot that son of a bitch Lee Harvey Oswald who definitely acted alone. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8645.62s)]
*  Yeah, he was by himself. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8649.82s)]
*  Give me that bullet. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8650.82s)]
*  I want to shoot a gun, shoot something. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8651.82s)]
*  That is so funny. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8653.78s)]
*  They had a meeting about it. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8654.78s)]
*  They're like, should we just shoot bullets out of that fucking thing and sell them? [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8655.78s)]
*  Someone's like, yeah, some dummy will buy that shit. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8656.78s)]
*  Why they only do 5,000? [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8658.58s)]
*  They should do it every year. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8659.58s)]
*  Keep doing it. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8660.58s)]
*  Keep doing it. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8661.58s)]
*  Do it till the product runs out. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8662.58s)]
*  What are you, crazy? [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8663.58s)]
*  The gun still works. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8664.58s)]
*  I don't know how the card game works. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8665.98s)]
*  That's right. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8666.98s)]
*  That's what's happened in the cards with the Ken Griffey Jr. card. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8667.98s)]
*  What happened? [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8670.38s)]
*  That was like the most famous baseball card you could buy for a while. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8671.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8673.18s)]
*  It turns out like Upper Deck got caught printing sheets and sheets and sheets of them and selling [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8674.18s)]
*  them to the collectors. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8678.26s)]
*  They're not numbered? [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8679.26s)]
*  They weren't numbered? [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8680.26s)]
*  No, they weren't. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8681.26s)]
*  There's a documentary about this actually that's like a scam and it ruined the card [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8682.26s)]
*  industry for quite a while. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8686.98s)]
*  And now only one company is allowed to sell baseball cards. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8688.5s)]
*  Who is it? [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8691.02s)]
*  Tops? [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8692.02s)]
*  Upper Deck? [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8693.02s)]
*  I think Tops got the contract, yeah. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8694.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the same way I feel about golf, I feel about baseball cards. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8696.460000000001s)]
*  Like, what are you wasting your time doing? [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8699.9s)]
*  Now that I understand. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8704.140000000001s)]
*  At least golf is a career. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8705.94s)]
*  There's a sport. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8706.94s)]
*  Yeah, there's something to it. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8707.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's a legit sport. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8708.94s)]
*  Like some people, you know, they make a lot of... [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8709.94s)]
*  What do you think about the fucking, the live golf thing? [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8711.74s)]
*  Love it. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8714.380000000001s)]
*  Absolutely love it. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8715.380000000001s)]
*  Why not? [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8716.380000000001s)]
*  Tell me more. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8717.380000000001s)]
*  Here's the reason. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8718.380000000001s)]
*  And I told you, before this I know a guy that went over there. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8720.179999999998s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8725.06s)]
*  Some people love the preservation and the history of the PGA. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8728.82s)]
*  I get it. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8731.98s)]
*  Tradition. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8732.98s)]
*  A lot of things about the PGA are bullshit and particularly the idea that the PGA had [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8733.98s)]
*  a stronghold on them. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8739.22s)]
*  It was kind of like, it has like the remnants of like contracts from studios in the 50s [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8740.5s)]
*  for actors where you're like, we own your fucking ass. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8745.5s)]
*  Your likeness, your rights, your images. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8748.140000000001s)]
*  When the golfers golf, they can't use that footage. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8750.02s)]
*  They have to license it from the PGA. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8753.62s)]
*  So if I'm out playing and I want to be like, hey man, I want to put a post on Instagram [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8755.380000000001s)]
*  about this dope ass putt I hit or whatever, this great... [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8758.86s)]
*  You have to buy it. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8762.02s)]
*  You have to buy your shit back from them. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8763.26s)]
*  Bullshit. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8766.220000000001s)]
*  Why? [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8767.220000000001s)]
*  If I'm Zion Williamson in the NBA and I fucking yoke on some of them, I put my dick in their [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8768.220000000001s)]
*  fucking face and dunk on them, the NBA can't wait to give you the footage. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8772.78s)]
*  They're like, dude, post that shit because it's going to help their brand. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8776.22s)]
*  PGA is old white guy bullshit and I get it that it's antiquated. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8779.699999999999s)]
*  So some of the younger guys were like, fuck this, I want more freedom and fun. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8784.5s)]
*  I want something different. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8788.38s)]
*  Some of them, their careers are on the other side, so they might not be making so much [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8790.3s)]
*  more to win money. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8795.46s)]
*  So this is a great alternative. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8797.06s)]
*  The problem people had was like Dustin Johnson or guys that are at the top and they're like, [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8798.82s)]
*  why are you pulling your game over there? [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8807.38s)]
*  Do you think you can't win anymore in this? [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8809.58s)]
*  Which is part of the controversy. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8812.22s)]
*  It's like, oh, do you... [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8813.539999999999s)]
*  But what's the big controversy? [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8814.539999999999s)]
*  The big controversy is one of the Saudis. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8815.539999999999s)]
*  But Saudi money is invested in tons of shit. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8819.3s)]
*  Look up Saudi money LPGA. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8822.5s)]
*  Look that up. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8827.6s)]
*  The investment of the Saudis isn't like a new thing in American sports. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8831.56s)]
*  People are just mad because the PGA particularly is mad because they look, they're looking [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8836.06s)]
*  something in the face that's threatening them. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8842.24s)]
*  It's not going to be bigger than the PGA, but it's an alternative that's fun. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8844.52s)]
*  People like it. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8847.460000000001s)]
*  It's not going to be bigger, not going to take it over, but they don't... [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8848.62s)]
*  What people are concerned with is that people are leaving and they're going to work for [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8852.0s)]
*  someone who's been accused of some horrific shit. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8855.560000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8858.52s)]
*  But who made your jeans? [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8859.52s)]
*  These are American jeans. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8861.42s)]
*  But you know what I mean? [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8862.42s)]
*  It's like most people... [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8863.42s)]
*  These are made by origin. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8864.42s)]
*  But most people go, oh, dude, I don't like that. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8865.42s)]
*  It's like, your fucking shirt was made by a Chinese kid. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8867.880000000001s)]
*  There's a lot... [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8870.480000000001s)]
*  Well, your phone. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8871.480000000001s)]
*  If you're complaining about stuff, you're literally complaining on a device that was [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8872.480000000001s)]
*  made by slaves. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8874.76s)]
*  Well, that's my point. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8875.76s)]
*  So I think that when somebody... [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8876.76s)]
*  When you start to get into nitpicky stuff, I'm always like, I understand the idea of [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8877.76s)]
*  people are anti them playing for Saudi money. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8883.86s)]
*  But if you think you're not involved in Saudi money at a high sports level, I'm sorry, but [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8886.06s)]
*  it's there. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8890.94s)]

*  I understand tradition, but if these guys want an alternative league to play in, who [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8943.94s)]

*  And I don't know who literally is funding. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=8978.24s)]

*  So people are really particular. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9052.8s)]
*  So they don't even like that someone's entering the conversation. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9054.46s)]
*  The other perspective obviously is the one that is the bigger deal is people are, people [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9057.039999999999s)]
*  are think it's an immoral move, unethical move. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9060.96s)]
*  If it was instead some enormous hedge fund got together and they put all their money [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9063.679999999998s)]
*  together and decided to fund their own alternative golf agency or golf tour. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9067.679999999998s)]
*  Just as mad. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9073.119999999999s)]
*  I think they would be just as upset. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9074.119999999999s)]
*  People would be, the PGA does not want competition. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9075.56s)]
*  They don't like that guys are even thinking about going. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9077.679999999998s)]
*  And then I think personally, they're shoehorning in the Saudi stuff to go, and that's bad. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9079.7s)]
*  See, they're more mad about business interests. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9085.720000000001s)]
*  They don't give a, they don't fucking care about the Saudi shoe. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9087.68s)]
*  How much of a effect is it having on the top players? [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9089.68s)]
*  Nothing. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9092.36s)]
*  I mean, my buddy, my buddy's doing a documentary that's coming out on Netflix. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9093.36s)]
*  I think coming up soon in the first quarter of the year about the PGA and during it, during [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9097.28s)]
*  the middle of filming, half of the guys left and went to live and he films both perspectives. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9104.240000000002s)]
*  So it's supposed to be really good. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9108.84s)]
*  It's just, it's not changed much. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9111.279999999999s)]
*  What's the highest level player? [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9114.279999999999s)]
*  The highest paycheck? [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9117.16s)]
*  The highest level, like a guy who's like a championship caliber. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9118.16s)]
*  Phil Mickelson is one of the greatest of all time, arguably in a span of many, many golf. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9122.279999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying he's like number one or number, I'm not saying, I'm just saying he is one [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9126.96s)]
*  of the best of all time and he is the, I think he's the biggest money, right? [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9129.72s)]
*  Wasn't he the biggest? [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9134.68s)]
*  Him or- [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9135.68s)]
*  DJ? [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9136.68s)]
*  DJ got the most, but- [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9137.68s)]
*  And what kind of money are we talking about? [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9138.68s)]
*  150 mil supposedly to just come over to play before they won any extra money. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9140.34s)]
*  Before they got paid out. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9145.42s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9146.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9147.42s)]
*  But it's also part of a contract that no one knows the details of these contracts. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9148.42s)]
*  Well they're private, right? [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9150.62s)]
*  They don't have to disclose- [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9151.62s)]
*  Didn't they lose all their sponsors once they went over there though? [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9152.7s)]
*  A lot of them lost some of their sponsors, but I don't know if you need them anymore [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9155.460000000001s)]
*  after 150 mil clears. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9159.66s)]
*  Right. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9161.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think- [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9162.14s)]
*  Like what kind of sponsors are we talking about? [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9163.14s)]
*  You know, like business investment firms. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9166.199999999999s)]
*  Golf is sponsored heavily by like, you know, TD Ameritrade and shit that you're- [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9168.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, right. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9174.519999999999s)]
*  It's a lot of that shit. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9175.519999999999s)]
*  Which makes sense because all those guys are the guys who like golf. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9176.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's who likes golf. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9178.64s)]
*  Yeah, businessmen. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9180.0s)]
*  Old businessmen. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9181.0s)]
*  They love to do business meetings on the golf course, right? [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9182.0s)]
*  Good to see you, Phil. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9184.0s)]
*  I bet if you're like a businessman, you probably have to play golf in some circles. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9185.0s)]
*  It's an advantage. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9190.199999999999s)]
*  The new era, you know, our age is- what's going on now in the youth of business, I don't [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9191.2s)]
*  fucking know what 22-year-olds have to do to like get through in the corporate world, [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9197.300000000001s)]
*  but I imagine it's still a part of it to a degree, you know? [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9200.58s)]
*  It's an inner circle that you're going to get leverage from some way or another. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9205.54s)]
*  It's like going to a good school. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9208.7s)]
*  It's like, dude, I went to Arizona State. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9209.7s)]
*  Did I have any connections? [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9211.42s)]
*  I made zero fucking- friends? [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9212.42s)]
*  I made a lot of fucking friends, but none of them could help me business-wise. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9214.42s)]
*  It's not like going to Yale. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9219.220000000001s)]
*  No, yeah. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9220.24s)]
*  You go to an accredited university, someone's daddy is a somebody, and so that's a big advantage [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9221.24s)]
*  in going to a good school. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9226.359999999999s)]
*  You meet that guy, and you might want him working for his firm. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9227.359999999999s)]
*  He might give you a fucking job. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9229.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9230.72s)]
*  You want a job? [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9231.72s)]
*  Does your kid want a job? [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9232.72s)]
*  It's like that shit, but- [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9233.72s)]
*  Billy's a good kid. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9234.72s)]
*  Really good kid. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9235.72s)]
*  He's top of his class. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9236.72s)]
*  I give him a couple hundred grand a year out of school. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9237.72s)]
*  We'll let him fuck off for two years, then we'll figure it out. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9238.72s)]
*  Show him how to do coke. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9240.359999999999s)]
*  We'll give him a bump. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9241.359999999999s)]
*  I think, at the end of the day, whatever those guys want to do, I just want to watch golf, [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9244.179999999998s)]
*  so I don't give a shit. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9252.06s)]
*  The PGA is still going to be the number one, because it has the Masters. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9253.699999999999s)]
*  It has tournaments where you're- [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9257.3s)]
*  Now, is this the general attitude of most people? [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9258.3s)]
*  Most people are just letting it go? [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9262.679999999998s)]
*  They don't care? [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9263.679999999998s)]
*  Or some people are outraged? [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9264.679999999998s)]
*  Most guys my age. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9265.859999999999s)]
*  I think Jamie might be in a similar boat where you're like, I don't fucking give a shit, [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9266.859999999999s)]
*  My dad's generation is like, fucking ridiculous. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9271.240000000002s)]
*  You don't have to go support in the fucking Saudis. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9274.84s)]
*  You go over there and you're abandoning the ship that you sailed in on. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9276.960000000001s)]
*  The PGA built you and it formed you. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9280.76s)]
*  It would be like if the UFC had a big competitive, had a competitive thing come forward with [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9283.2s)]
*  way more money, which I don't know if that's happened. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9289.68s)]
*  I'm ignorant. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9292.04s)]
*  You could tell me if it has, but- [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9293.300000000001s)]
*  It hasn't. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9294.300000000001s)]
*  But that's kind of the same thing, where people would go- [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9295.300000000001s)]
*  Some guys who get really good deals that they wouldn't get in the UFC. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9297.300000000001s)]
*  So what happens is if there's talent that's available that's top flight talent, Bellator [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9300.86s)]
*  has options. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9306.54s)]
*  That's an option. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9307.54s)]
*  And a lot of guys will go to Bellator because Bellator will pay them more. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9308.54s)]
*  But it's like when you get to the world championship like the Conor McGregor, Khabib Nurmagomedov [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9313.18s)]
*  level, I think they make more money in the UFC. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9318.140000000001s)]
*  Because they have pay-per-view. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9321.18s)]
*  You don't see pay-per-view with Bellator. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9323.86s)]
*  I think they've done a couple pay-per-views. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9325.48s)]
*  I don't think they've been that successful. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9327.72s)]
*  Whereas UFC does a pay-per-view every month. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9330.0s)]
*  Every month is an enormous pay-per-view. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9333.4s)]
*  There's world championship fights where you get the best of the best and everybody knows [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9335.04s)]
*  who they are. [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9338.92s)]
*  It's like Q-Tips, NFL, NBA, that's MMA at the highest level. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9339.92s)]
*  You can get cotton swabs at CVS that aren't made by Q-Tips. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9346.76s)]
*  You're asking for Q-Tips. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9349.960000000001s)]
*  Where's the Q-Tips? [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9351.44s)]
*  Where's Kleenex? [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9352.44s)]
*  Yeah, where's the Kleenex? [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9353.44s)]
*  That's not even the best example. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9355.42s)]
*  The Q-Tips at CVS that aren't Q-Tips, the cotton swabs are probably just as good. [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9357.220000000001s)]
*  It's not that fucking hard to have a little stick and little cotton on the end of it. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9362.54s)]
*  But it's the name. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9365.94s)]
*  To get elite world-class fighters to compete in the biggest organization to hold that UFC [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9366.94s)]

*  When is it? [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9629.54s)]
*  It's in like three weeks. [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9630.54s)]
*  It's a couple weeks in, yeah. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9631.54s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9632.54s)]
*  You want to go to Phoenix and go have fucking fun? [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9633.54s)]
*  I might want to go to that. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9634.54s)]
*  I might want to go to that. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9635.54s)]
*  When I was at ASU, we used to go to this. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9636.54s)]
*  If you're a student, you get cheap tickets, and we would go there and party our fucking [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9637.980000000001s)]
*  face. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9641.800000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's basically like ... Nobody's there to watch golf. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9642.800000000001s)]
*  Everyone's there to have a good time. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9647.480000000001s)]
*  It's like the Kentucky Derby. [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9648.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9649.480000000001s)]
*  It's a party. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9650.480000000001s)]
*  Everybody's partying. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9651.480000000001s)]
*  Do they gamble? [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9652.480000000001s)]
*  Oh, fuck yeah. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9653.480000000001s)]
*  So people gamble on the matches? [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9654.480000000001s)]
*  On that particular hole, what's really fun is people will gamble on closest to the pin, [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9655.480000000001s)]
*  but you're doing it with buddies. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9659.240000000002s)]
*  Oh, right, right, right. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9660.240000000002s)]
*  The next foursome that's up. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9661.240000000002s)]
*  There's Phil. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9662.240000000002s)]
*  He's got a nine iron again. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9663.240000000002s)]
*  That's exactly what he hit at 12, which was awesome. [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9664.240000000002s)]
*  This is before he went over to the Livs. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9666.24s)]
*  Yeah, this is a long time ago. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9667.94s)]
*  That is fucking crazy. [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9674.34s)]
*  And this only happens at the Waste Management Open? [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9676.619999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9683.34s)]
*  I don't understand why they don't do it more. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9684.34s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense to me as a new person who's gotten into this. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9685.94s)]
*  Every single event doesn't have one hole like this. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9690.52s)]
*  That's the move, right? [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9692.46s)]
*  I'll go back to what I said, dude. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9694.58s)]
*  It's like old white guy bullshit. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9696.14s)]
*  Okay, so in Liv, not like this is a selling point, they get to wear shorts. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9697.8s)]
*  Are you working for Liv? [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9701.92s)]
*  Yeah, I work for Liv. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9702.92s)]
*  It's a dumb rule. [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9703.92s)]
*  They wear shorts? [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9704.92s)]
*  Everyone's got to wear pants no matter how hot it is. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9705.92s)]
*  They have to wear pants. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9706.92s)]
*  It's the middle of fucking summer sometimes and they have to wear pants. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9707.92s)]
*  Liv lets them wear shorts, which that's my point. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9710.96s)]
*  Why does the PGA give a fuck? [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9714.92s)]
*  Why do they give a fuck? [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9716.519999999999s)]
*  Because it's tradition. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9717.519999999999s)]
*  That's why you get that stupid jacket when you win. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9718.519999999999s)]
*  That is a very cool jacket. [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9722.72s)]
*  It's green. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9723.72s)]
*  I will take that fucking jacket. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9724.72s)]
*  How much would you want one of those fucking jackets? [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9725.859999999999s)]
*  Would you buy that normally? [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9726.859999999999s)]
*  Would you normally buy a green jacket? [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9728.58s)]
*  You can't buy that. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9729.82s)]
*  No, but I mean, why would you want a green jacket? [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9730.82s)]
*  Because nobody buys green jackets. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9733.22s)]
*  That's it. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9734.539999999999s)]
*  As I wear a green t-shirt. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9735.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, fuck it. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9740.539999999999s)]
*  At the end of the day, those guys, in my opinion, will be ... What do you think? [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9743.06s)]
*  Don't you think they'll come back from Liv? [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9746.74s)]
*  I think it'll be a short-lived, fun fucking money grabbing and it'll be done. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9747.74s)]
*  It would be really cool. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9750.5s)]
*  Every league that we've watched now was probably now a conglomeration of what they were. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9751.76s)]
*  The NFL was, AFC, NFC. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9756.68s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9757.68s)]
*  They had two different conferences. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9758.68s)]
*  They came together to do something. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9759.68s)]
*  Some of them we were just talking about recently. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9760.68s)]
*  Oh, there's a pickleball league starting. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9762.08s)]
*  That was two different leagues that are joining up to make a new pickleball league. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9764.04s)]
*  That's completely different than this, but yes, it seems like it will be a benefit in [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9767.48s)]
*  the long run. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9772.0s)]
*  I don't know how it can hurt. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9773.0s)]
*  I wonder if someone's thinking about doing that with MMA. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9774.0s)]
*  Like a bigger company that has tons more money, capital ... [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9776.92s)]
*  You'd have to have so much more money. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9779.7s)]
*  All Saudis. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9781.7s)]
*  He's got another contract, though. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9782.7s)]
*  Yeah, because the UFC, they purchased the UFC for $4 billion. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9783.7s)]
*  A couple of bucks. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9786.98s)]
*  I think it's worth $10 now. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9787.98s)]
*  Oh, no. [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9788.98s)]
*  I think it's valued at $10 now. [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9789.98s)]
*  They picked it up and right when they picked it up, the pandemic hit and Dana White kept [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9792.1s)]
*  the fights rolling. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9795.1s)]
*  The fights were rolling on while there was nothing else going on in the world of sports [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9796.62s)]
*  and they were playing them at the Apex. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9800.74s)]
*  They fought at the ... The UFC had their own arena. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9802.42s)]
*  They put together a COVID bubble. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9805.52s)]
*  Everybody got tested. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9807.220000000001s)]
*  You got tested before you got on your flight. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9808.24s)]
*  You got tested when you got there. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9809.56s)]
*  You got tested the day of the event. [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9810.56s)]
*  They tested the shit out of everybody. [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9812.32s)]
*  And no audience. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9814.76s)]
*  And they had world championship fights with no audience. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9815.76s)]
*  And then Octagon, it's 40% smaller than the regular Octagon. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9818.359999999999s)]
*  Why? [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9821.88s)]
*  Because it's smaller for the building. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9822.88s)]
*  They decided to make a smaller ... They always had a smaller Octagon. [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9824.359999999999s)]
*  When we used to do fights at the palms, we used to do fight nights or when they used [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9827.88s)]
*  to do the finals of the Ultimate Fighter, they would have them at the palms and they'd [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9833.78s)]
*  have them in a small cage. [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9838.900000000001s)]
*  And then they decided they kind of liked the small cage because the palms was a small place [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9840.380000000001s)]
*  where we would do it at. [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9844.02s)]
*  When we did fights ... See, you can find fights at the palms. [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9845.02s)]
*  I saw kickboxing at the palms. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9847.7s)]
*  I saw glory there. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9849.5s)]
*  I saw a bunch of shit at the palms. [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9850.82s)]
*  The palms was a great spot. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9852.66s)]
*  And they used to have ... Cat Williams performed there. [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9854.5s)]
*  They had comedy there too. [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9858.900000000001s)]
*  It was this amazing little arena. [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9859.900000000001s)]
*  At the palms. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9861.82s)]
*  It was real intimate there. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9863.56s)]
*  We should go to see fights. [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9864.84s)]
*  I want to say there's just a few thousand people there. [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9865.84s)]
*  That's a cool looking room. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9868.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9869.88s)]
*  So that's the pearl at the palms. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9870.88s)]
*  And the way that's set up, that's different than the way the UFC was set up. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9872.8s)]
*  The way the UFC was set up was like that in the center. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9875.92s)]
*  And that's tinier than normal. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9879.44s)]
*  Yes. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9881.68s)]
*  That's a small Octagon. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9883.32s)]
*  That's a 40% smaller Octagon in the apex. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9884.56s)]
*  I think it's the same size as the one they use at the palm. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9887.4s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9890.939999999999s)]
*  But a lot of fighters do not like it. [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9892.82s)]
*  Guys who move around a lot, like Sugar Sean O'Malley, does not want to be at the apex. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9894.74s)]
*  He wants to move around. [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9900.58s)]
*  I love you, Joe Rogan. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9901.58s)]
*  I've seen that. [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9902.58s)]
*  There's somebody with a collab. [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9903.58s)]
*  That collab of him just going, I love you, Joe Rogan. [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9905.26s)]
*  I love him. [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9907.06s)]
*  I love you too, buddy. [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9908.06s)]
*  He's amazing. [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9909.06s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9910.06s)]
*  He's fucking awesome to watch. [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9911.06s)]
*  Yeah, I interviewed him when he had a broken foot when he was on his back. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9912.06s)]
*  He broke his foot. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9914.939999999999s)]
*  What's that foot? [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9916.06s)]
*  There's a really bad foot break. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9917.06s)]
*  And he was out for ... Liz Frank. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9918.06s)]
*  He was out for two years. [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9920.039999999999s)]
*  He snapped the bone in the middle of his foot. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9921.84s)]
*  It's called Liz Frank? [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9924.64s)]
*  It's called the Liz Frank injury. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9925.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's not like a name. [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9926.64s)]
*  It's all L-I-S-F-R-A-N-C. [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9927.64s)]
*  Oh, Liz Frank. [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9930.64s)]
*  On the screen, Joe, this is the arena that they're showing that this new indoor golf [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9932.439999999999s)]
*  thing is going to happen next year. [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9936.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9937.279999999999s)]
*  It's going to be at night, an arena type thing where everyone's yelling. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9938.279999999999s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9941.48s)]
*  Back here, you hit into the sim like me and Andrew were doing back in the other room. [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9942.48s)]
*  So is this the PGA as well? [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9945.8s)]
*  I don't think it's the PGA. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9948.24s)]
*  All I've heard is it's Tiger Woods and Roy McElroy have put this together with someone. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9949.7s)]
*  Well, the PGA's logo is on it. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9952.54s)]
*  The logo is on it. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9954.34s)]
*  It's not called PGA. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9955.34s)]
*  It's called TGL. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9956.34s)]
*  It's also been unannounced fully. [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9958.18s)]
*  They've just hinted at what's going to happen here or how it's going to work. [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9960.220000000001s)]
*  We don't really know. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9963.26s)]
*  It's like eight players are going to show up. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9964.26s)]
*  What are those numbers? [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9965.26s)]
*  466 yards. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9966.26s)]
*  What does that mean? [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9967.26s)]
*  That's how long the hole was. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9969.02s)]
*  That's how far he hit, yeah. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9970.02s)]
*  That's how far he could drive it. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9971.02s)]
*  How far he has left probably. [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9972.02s)]
*  Oh, right. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9973.02s)]
*  He took a hole. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9974.02s)]
*  Yeah, it says number one. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9975.02s)]
*  He's at 466 yards for the hole. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9976.02s)]
*  They'll be in the back and they'll hit their first one or two shots into that giant screen [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9977.36s)]
*  and then come and finish on the green. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9980.36s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9982.960000000001s)]
*  That's probably going to change a little bit. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9983.960000000001s)]
*  Now, is Tiger back with his leg injury? [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9984.960000000001s)]
*  This allows him to compete. [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9987.36s)]
*  Yeah, but he's not going to ... We've seen the best we ever were going to see from him [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9989.560000000001s)]
*  and I think ... [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9994.560000000001s)]
*  How fucked up is his leg? [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9995.560000000001s)]
*  It's bad. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9997.640000000001s)]
*  You can tell when he swings it looks different. [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9998.640000000001s)]
*  I mean, his son is the one to look for. [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=9999.640000000001s)]
*  Have you seen it? [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10001.24s)]
*  Yeah, I have seen his son. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10002.24s)]
*  His son looks incredible. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10003.24s)]
*  It's fucking unreal. [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10004.24s)]
*  Let me see what it looks like when he swings now. [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10005.24s)]
*  Show Tiger Woods drive. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10006.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I bet you there's a video of him before and after. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10008.699999999999s)]
*  He just had to change everything. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10012.26s)]
*  You can tell when he walks he's in fucking pain. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10015.1s)]
*  You can just tell he's just in pain. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10016.98s)]
*  That poor guy, he's had addictions to pain pills in the past. [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10019.42s)]
*  Yeah, fuck yeah. [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10022.74s)]
*  Is this him here? [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10023.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10024.74s)]
*  This is the most recent thing he's done. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10025.74s)]
*  This is the thing they did. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10026.74s)]
*  This is the match. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10027.74s)]
*  That looks pretty fucking good. [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10028.74s)]
*  Yeah, he's good. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10031.74s)]
*  No, he's still got it without a doubt. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10032.74s)]
*  That looks pretty fucking good. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10033.74s)]
*  He's still Tiger Woods. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10035.14s)]
*  That still looks fucking amazing. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10037.039999999999s)]
*  He can't walk. [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10038.039999999999s)]
*  He just can't walk is what I mean. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10039.039999999999s)]
*  Really? [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10040.039999999999s)]
*  So he can do that because he can just deal with the pain. [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10041.039999999999s)]
*  He does, yeah. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10043.599999999999s)]
*  And then when he walks, what is it like when he walks? [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10044.599999999999s)]
*  Well, part of that traditional thing he's saying. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10047.92s)]
*  He gets to ride in a cart for this and part of the thing that he's about to tell you is [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10049.8s)]
*  a big beef with the PGA is you have to have a medical exemption under wild circumstances [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10053.96s)]
*  like this to be able to have a cart during a real event. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10059.92s)]
*  Otherwise, he would have to walk miles. [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10062.039999999999s)]
*  You must walk. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10063.88s)]
*  Right. [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10064.88s)]
*  That's kind of crazy too that you have to walk. [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10066.619999999999s)]
*  But is it fair that he has a medical exemption? [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10068.5s)]
*  Did they let all these other guys do it as well because he does it? [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10070.539999999999s)]
*  Well, this is not a real tournament. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10073.22s)]
*  This is like a for fun. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10075.3s)]
*  Capital One sponsors this. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10076.3s)]
*  It goes to charity. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10078.06s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10079.06s)]
*  Right. [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10080.06s)]
*  They got their Under Armour logos. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10081.06s)]
*  But in play, like in a tournament play of a real PGA match, they can't have carts. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10082.06s)]
*  No. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10086.06s)]
*  Okay. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10087.06s)]
*  So even him. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10088.06s)]
*  He could. [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10089.06s)]
*  All the players are saying, Tiger, please come play with us. [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10090.06s)]
*  Ask for this exemption. [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10092.38s)]
*  They will probably give it to you. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10093.38s)]
*  And he's like, nope. [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10094.38s)]
*  Who was he talking to on the phone? [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10095.88s)]
*  They have Charles Barkley and the people on the. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10096.88s)]
*  Yeah, he's talking to us. [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10099.279999999999s)]
*  He's probably talking shit to him. [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10100.279999999999s)]
*  He finally did it a few weeks ago. [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10103.279999999999s)]
*  And he, I spun one. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10106.119999999999s)]
*  He tomahawked one and got me. [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10108.48s)]
*  Which hasn't beat me yet. [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10110.8s)]
*  This is another thing that golf does. [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10112.359999999999s)]
*  They have mics on so you can hear the golfers talking to their caddies and stuff. [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10115.279999999999s)]
*  And the PGA doesn't really allow that either. [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10118.64s)]
*  That's pretty cool. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10122.8s)]
*  Pretty neat, yeah. [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10123.8s)]
*  To get insight that you don't get. [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10125.22s)]
*  He looks good golfing and he's been pretty competitive when he's gotten to compete. [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10128.859999999999s)]
*  What does it look like when he walks? [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10131.859999999999s)]
*  He's walking. [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10133.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10134.539999999999s)]
*  Well, show him with his match with his son that they just did. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10135.539999999999s)]
*  Do they show him walking around? [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10137.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10139.5s)]
*  And they keep commenting that he's in pain. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10140.5s)]
*  And you can tell, dude. [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10142.3s)]
*  I mean, he's a tough motherfucker. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10143.3s)]
*  This dude is tough as shit. [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10144.3s)]
*  He's just going through. [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10145.619999999999s)]
*  You can tell he's just walking through the pain. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10146.74s)]
*  But you can tell when he'll hobble, he'll kind of like make a face. [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10148.42s)]
*  And that's a couple of years ago, this injury, right? [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10151.179999999998s)]
*  Two years ago, right? [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10153.84s)]
*  When the car crash was? [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10154.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10155.84s)]
*  Here's him walking at the British Open last year. [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10156.84s)]
*  This is a long walk. [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10158.68s)]
*  I mean, we don't see him limping. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10159.68s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10160.68s)]
*  Shit. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10161.68s)]
*  You can see him limping here. [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10162.68s)]
*  This is after a full round. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10163.68s)]
*  Yeah, you see how his right leg kind of bows in? [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10165.68s)]
*  Mmm. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10168.199999999999s)]
*  I mean, look. [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10169.199999999999s)]
*  See right there. [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10170.199999999999s)]
*  Mmm-hmm. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10171.199999999999s)]
*  I mean, he just, you can tell that he's kind of, he's bowing. [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10172.199999999999s)]
*  He's like putting all his weight on one hip. [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10176.44s)]
*  Not bad. [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10180.24s)]
*  We're really pulling hairs here, but I just trust him. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10181.66s)]
*  He's like, I can't do it. [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10184.66s)]
*  He's like, well. [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10185.66s)]
*  Well, see, that's what I'm saying. [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10186.66s)]
*  We say not bad. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10187.66s)]
*  You know the truth. [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10188.66s)]
*  Right. [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10189.66s)]
*  You know pro athletes. [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10190.66s)]
*  Right. [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10191.66s)]
*  They're just tough. [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10192.66s)]
*  They're just tough. [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10193.66s)]
*  He's like, fuck it. [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10194.66s)]
*  I'm just going to do it. [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10195.66s)]
*  I don't care. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10196.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10197.66s)]
*  This is also like a historical thing. [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10198.66s)]
*  It's the 150th British Open. [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10199.66s)]
*  He made a big effort just to get to be able to do this. [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10200.66s)]
*  So he probably worked for months just to be able to do this. [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10201.66s)]
*  People can tolerate pain, man, at incredible levels. [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10202.66s)]
*  You know, when I had David Goggins on, David Goggins explained the operation that he had [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10206.06s)]
*  to get done on his knee because he has no cartilage in his knees. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10210.7s)]
*  It's bone on bone. [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10216.44s)]
*  He runs like a thousand miles. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10217.44s)]
*  His doctor said, I can't believe you can walk in this knee. [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10219.04s)]
*  Never mind run thousands of miles. [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10224.16s)]
*  It's just pure will. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10226.84s)]
*  Just pure will and the overcoming of pain. [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10229.76s)]
*  Because there's just bone on bone, the bone was all distorted and fucking overgrowth and [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10233.740000000002s)]
*  shit to try to deal with all this inflammation. [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10239.7s)]
*  So then they had to cut his bone and slide it down to make an even flat joint. [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10242.64s)]
*  That's nuts. [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10248.720000000001s)]
*  And still even then he's just bone on bone. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10249.720000000001s)]
*  He's still running. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10252.04s)]
*  Still running. [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10253.04s)]
*  Dude's nuts. [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10254.04s)]
*  That's great. [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10255.04s)]
*  I mean, that's fucking. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10256.04s)]
*  Still running. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10257.04s)]
*  Running the Bigfoot 240. [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10258.04s)]
*  What is that? [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10259.04s)]
*  238 miles. [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10260.04s)]
*  No thanks. [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10261.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10262.04s)]
*  No thanks. [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10263.04s)]
*  He ran with the Moab. [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10264.04s)]
*  That's what he ran, the Moab 240. [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10265.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10266.04s)]
*  I think the Bigfoot's 200. [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10267.04s)]
*  Do you run? [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10268.04s)]
*  I've hurt my knee a couple of times and I've been over the last like say seven or eight [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10269.400000000001s)]
*  months I don't even kick the bag anymore. [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10276.12s)]
*  I've been dealing with it. [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10278.160000000002s)]
*  I had an MCL tear and I rehabbed it and I got stem cell shot into it. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10279.160000000002s)]
*  But my dumb ass kept going back to working out like throwing kicks. [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10286.94s)]
*  And every time I would go to Muay Thai and every time I'd hit the pads, I'd never hit [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10292.2s)]
*  them light. [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10296.2s)]
*  And then I'd want to whack. [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10297.36s)]
*  I want to feel that fucking whack. [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10299.36s)]
*  It's just too much fun. [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10302.36s)]
*  Yeah it is. [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10303.36s)]
*  It's too much fun to be able to do that. [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10304.36s)]
*  To be able to really kick hard is so fun. [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10306.560000000001s)]
*  It's so fun. [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10310.12s)]
*  Well it looks fun. [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10311.12s)]
*  It's fun. [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10312.12s)]
*  But see I would look like what you look like swinging a golf club, I look like kicking [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10313.12s)]
*  a fucking bag. [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10316.640000000001s)]
*  But you could learn it. [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10317.640000000001s)]
*  It's you know. [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10319.28s)]
*  Yeah with time. [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10320.28s)]
*  But it's a thing that when you get it to the level where I can do it, it's so unusual. [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10321.28s)]
*  To be able to generate that kind of power. [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10326.44s)]
*  So when I step up to a heavy bag, it's just my automatic instinct is just to fucking dig [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10329.44s)]
*  my toes in. [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10334.24s)]
*  Whack! [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10335.24s)]
*  I just want to fucking torque my body and swing my hips in and tighten up my abs. [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10336.24s)]
*  Whomp! [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10342.96s)]
*  It's exciting. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10343.96s)]
*  No more though. [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10344.96s)]
*  I can still do it. [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10345.96s)]
*  I just have to wait a little while. [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10346.96s)]
*  It's much much much better. [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10348.24s)]
*  My knee doesn't give me any pain anymore. [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10350.24s)]
*  This hunting season in the mountains, no pain at all. [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10352.8s)]
*  I've been doing this knees over toes rehabilitation. [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10355.96s)]
*  You ever heard of that guy? [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10358.24s)]
*  Knees over toes guys on Instagram? [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10359.84s)]
*  No. [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10361.439999999999s)]
*  He's an expert and well he's a fitness trainer and he figured he had a bunch of injuries [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10362.439999999999s)]
*  himself from playing basketball and to the point where they were saying like look you're [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10367.84s)]
*  too fragile, your knees keep fucking up, you're never going to be able to play. [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10371.68s)]
*  And so he figured out ways to strengthen and rehabilitate his knees. [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10375.48s)]
*  And he developed this knees over toes program. [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10380.72s)]
*  It's a scalable program. [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10383.439999999999s)]
*  You start off with just like walking backwards and pulling a light sled backwards and doing [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10385.36s)]
*  certain things till you get to the point where you can have strength in a full range of motion [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10390.76s)]
*  with your knees doing things like that. [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10397.08s)]
*  Oh dude I have seen this guy. [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10399.32s)]
*  I've seen him. [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10400.32s)]
*  Yeah that's fucking insane. [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10401.32s)]
*  And if you can get to that and he, it's not like a trick. [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10402.800000000001s)]
*  He has a, like look walking backward on a treadmill, doing tibia raises and it's all [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10406.92s)]
*  the strength in the muscles around the knee and the stabilizing muscles of the knee which [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10413.12s)]
*  most people are very weak in. [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10415.880000000001s)]
*  You know people have like strong quads but they don't have the exercises in their repertoire [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10418.240000000002s)]
*  that develops all the muscles around the knee and this guy's developed this whole program. [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10424.0s)]
*  It's really amazing. [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10429.28s)]
*  So I do all his stuff. [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10430.400000000001s)]
*  I do a lot of stuff on a slant board. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10431.76s)]
*  I do squats like air squats and then weighted squats on a slant board and I have this thing [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10434.6s)]
*  that I use for my legs from a place called, I think it's called Animal House Fit Fitness [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10441.16s)]
*  and it's called a monkey foot and it clamps onto a barbell. [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10445.92s)]
*  You strap it onto your shoe and it clamps onto a barbell or a dumbbell rather. [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10449.28s)]
*  So you can pick up dumbbells with your foot so you can do knee raises and leg curls and [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10453.76s)]
*  leg extensions and really strengthen all the muscles around your knee and around your hip [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10459.44s)]
*  flexors because like lifting leg, lifting with your legs this way. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10465.76s)]
*  Like a reverse squat is another excellent way to develop speed and power. [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10470.72s)]
*  So this is his company, Animal House Fitness and they sent me these. [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10475.76s)]
*  These are fucking amazing. [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10480.039999999999s)]
*  I bring these on the road with me. [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10481.32s)]
*  I bring one of those things because if I go to a small gym I can still get a really good [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10483.199999999999s)]
*  leg workout and that's one thing that I do that really works well with those hip muscles [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10487.22s)]
*  and stabilizing muscles but there's another thing you do where you take a cable pulling [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10493.88s)]
*  machine and you attach the straps to your insteps and then you pull with your feet forward [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10497.72s)]
*  towards your chest. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10507.92s)]
*  So like a reverse squat. [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10509.599999999999s)]
*  So instead of like lifting weights by pushing up off the ground, you're pulling it towards [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10511.48s)]
*  you. [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10516.359999999999s)]
*  Phenomenal for your abs. [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10517.359999999999s)]
*  It's like one of the best ab workouts. [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10518.359999999999s)]
*  Think about knee raises but think about knee raises times 10. [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10520.64s)]
*  So I'm doing this with 100 pounds for 10 reps and it really builds the strength in [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10524.52s)]
*  your ab muscles and your hip flexors and you tie it into your shoes like this. [[02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10530.36s)]
*  So you pull that thing down, you cinch it up and then you back up and then you're just [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10535.4s)]
*  using the muscles. [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10539.4s)]
*  So it looks like he's doing it at just the regular ones at the gym. [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10540.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I use. [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10544.08s)]
*  I use a regular pulling machine at the gym with those straps. [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10545.6s)]
*  So I do it with the monkey feet but I also do it with that. [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10549.2s)]
*  So you're developing muscles and it's phenomenal for kicking too because the hip flexors and [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10554.14s)]
*  all these muscles at the top of the thighs, they don't get worked out with weights very [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10559.46s)]
*  often. [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10563.939999999999s)]
*  So you really develop those by hitting a bag, which is the best way to develop technique [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10564.939999999999s)]
*  but you can develop additional power by doing that. [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10570.38s)]
*  You ever want to kick anybody anymore? [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10573.26s)]
*  Sure. [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10574.74s)]
*  Of course. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10575.74s)]
*  Why don't you kick somebody? [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10576.74s)]
*  If I could kick like you, I'd love to kick them. [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10577.74s)]
*  Then they kick you back. [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10579.34s)]
*  I don't think you're worried about anybody kicking you back. [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10581.18s)]
*  I'm worried about people kicking me. [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10583.220000000001s)]
*  People like me. [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10584.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but there's not a lot of yous. [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10585.220000000001s)]
*  But if I was going to fight someone, I'd fight someone like me. [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10586.220000000001s)]
*  And then they would kick me the way I'd want to kick them. [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10589.220000000001s)]
*  I'd say, no thanks. [[02:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10590.94s)]
*  No thanks, dude. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10591.94s)]
*  No thanks. [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10592.94s)]
*  That's the rule of life. [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10593.94s)]
*  Fuck that. [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10594.94s)]
*  He's going to kick me like I kick him. [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10595.94s)]
*  Fuck that. [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10598.94s)]
*  Fuck that. [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10599.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10600.94s)]
*  And there's also guys breaking their legs kicking people. [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10601.94s)]
*  Someone checks it and you catch your shin the wrong way and it snaps in half. [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10604.02s)]
*  Let's say there's a guy that's your size. [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10607.9s)]
*  Your size guy. [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10610.220000000001s)]
*  All circumstances are gone as far as who you are in the world of fame and getting in trouble. [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10613.779999999999s)]
*  I don't want to hurt anybody. [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10617.779999999999s)]
*  I know. [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10619.779999999999s)]
*  But let's just say a guy wants to fight you. [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10620.779999999999s)]
*  And you can. [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10623.26s)]
*  Because of the bubble that we're in in my mental mind, there's no trouble that's going [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10624.539999999999s)]
*  to happen. [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10627.22s)]
*  Are you going to punch this guy first or kick him first? [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10628.22s)]
*  What's your first shot? [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10630.26s)]
*  It would completely depend upon the circumstances. [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10631.539999999999s)]
*  Completely depend upon how much room you have to move around in, how much danger you're [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10633.9s)]
*  in, whether or not you could just grab him. [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10638.26s)]
*  He walks in here. [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10639.859999999999s)]
*  If I grab, I'd rather grab somebody. [[02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10640.859999999999s)]
*  If I grab someone, I can contain them. [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10642.939999999999s)]
*  And get them to the ground? [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10645.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10646.82s)]
*  100%. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10647.82s)]
*  All right. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10648.82s)]
*  Well, let's just say it's just punch or kick. [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10649.82s)]
*  What are you doing first? [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10650.82s)]
*  It depends on the circumstances. [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10651.82s)]
*  Depends on how far the person is from you. [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10654.539999999999s)]
*  Jamie's laughing. [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10656.099999999999s)]
*  Depends on everything. [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10657.099999999999s)]
*  I know. [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10658.099999999999s)]
*  I knew you were going to give me a fucking... [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10659.099999999999s)]
*  Depends on everything. [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10660.099999999999s)]
*  Give me an ape answer. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10661.099999999999s)]
*  Give me a monkey brain answer. [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10662.859999999999s)]
*  Well, if you have to get something done very quickly, a punch to the face is a very quick [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10664.06s)]
*  thing. [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10671.06s)]
*  The movement from standing, talking to someone, to punching them in the face is a fraction [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10672.66s)]
*  of a second. [[02:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10676.779999999999s)]
*  Bam! [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10677.779999999999s)]
*  If you have a good, clean, straight punch and you know how to throw it fast, if you [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10678.779999999999s)]
*  know that you have to hit somebody and you want to hit them before they hit you, that's [[02:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10684.539999999999s)]
*  a good way to go. [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10688.1s)]
*  Okay. [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10689.1s)]
*  I just wanted to know what your instinct was. [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10690.1s)]
*  If you had to do it. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10691.58s)]
*  It's a punch always. [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10692.58s)]
*  If you're fast, yeah. [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10693.98s)]
*  It's a speed thing. [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10694.98s)]
*  I guess I just want to see you kick somebody. [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10695.98s)]
*  I do. [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10701.9s)]
*  I did it for a long time. [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10702.9s)]
*  There's a weird, bittersweet thing about knocking someone unconscious. [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10703.9s)]
*  It doesn't feel that good. [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10707.9s)]
*  You think it feels great. [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10709.5s)]
*  It feels very weird. [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10710.779999999999s)]
*  It feels like that could have easily been you. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10713.1s)]
*  I watched a lot of my friends get knocked out, too. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10716.14s)]
*  I saw a lot of friends get knocked out where they kind of weren't the same again. [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10718.5s)]
*  They really never recovered. [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10722.9s)]
*  I saw some people get really badly knocked out and they were always a little fucking [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10724.58s)]
*  weird afterwards. [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10727.98s)]
*  There were always like something was wrong with them. [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10728.98s)]
*  It does. [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10731.26s)]
*  Uh oh. [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10732.26s)]
*  What is this one? [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10733.26s)]
*  This is me and Jamie. [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10734.26s)]
*  This guy on the left tells this guy, you want to lose your kneecap? [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10735.26s)]
*  Oh no. [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10737.26s)]
*  It's not a good idea to say that, I think. [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10738.26s)]
*  Did he kick him in the knees? [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10740.26s)]
*  No. [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10741.26s)]
*  Dude gets knocked out if he's threatening to break man's kneecap. [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10742.26s)]
*  Well, that was that, I guess. [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10745.26s)]
*  That's the end of that. [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10748.26s)]

*  100% he's done that to people before. [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10763.9s)]
*  Probably in competition. [[02:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10766.9s)]
*  That's a, like he opens with a left hook. [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10769.9s)]
*  Who opens with a left hook? [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10771.9s)]

*  He's like, I'm going to fucking hit you. [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10780.9s)]
*  He didn't have to do that. [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10781.9s)]
*  No, he did not have to do it. [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10782.9s)]
*  But he works at NASA. [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10783.9s)]

*  It fucking sucks. [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10866.539999999999s)]
*  I watched a world star hip hop once where this guy got knocked out and then everybody [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10867.539999999999s)]
*  ran by and kicked him in the head while he was unconscious. [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10870.46s)]

*  Yucky. [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10875.9s)]
*  And as this guy kept getting kicked in the head, I was like, that's closer to death. [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10876.9s)]
*  That's closer to death. [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10880.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10881.38s)]
*  Easily could have died. [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10882.38s)]
*  Might be dead. [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10883.38s)]
*  I don't even know if a guy lived. [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10884.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's the only thing about when you would let me come see UFC, you know, because [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10885.38s)]
*  admittedly, I don't know enough about it. [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10889.58s)]
*  I'm not filled in. [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10891.46s)]
*  I love watching it and I love that you bring me. [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10892.46s)]
*  But I was always like, man, when I saw someone to get worked, I was like, oh, my God, I'm [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10894.22s)]
*  watching part of his life leave him. [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10898.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10900.859999999999s)]
*  Watching a couple of years ago. [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10901.859999999999s)]

*  Oh, dude. [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10907.58s)]
*  You're watching with each subsequent elbow, with each punch, you're closer to death. [[03:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10908.58s)]
*  You're not going to answer this. [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10916.14s)]
*  How much longer do you think you'll announce UFC? [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10917.58s)]
*  That's a good question. [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10919.9s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10920.9s)]
*  I thought about it. [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10921.9s)]
*  Because I'll always be a fan. [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10922.9s)]

*  Same kind of intensity that you're bringing to stand up. [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10964.699999999999s)]
*  It's a different vector of the brain. [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10967.46s)]
*  It's certainly different than I never try to be funny. [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10969.66s)]
*  I'm not trying to be funny at all. [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=10972.58s)]

*  Yeah, I don't know if he's still doing it now. [[03:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11246.72s)]
*  Is, find out if he's still doing stand-up. [[03:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11248.64s)]
*  He might be still doing stand-up. [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11250.24s)]
*  He might just be hitting the road. [[03:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11251.48s)]
*  But LeBron's production company put it on. [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11253.16s)]

*  Well, at least in the driving, but I don't think Jamie can compete with you in the rest [[03:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11304.12s)]
*  of the golf game. [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11307.12s)]

*  Just some simple bets. [[03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11313.52s)]
*  Yeah, just some tiny stuff. [[03:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11314.84s)]
*  Couple hundred grand. [[03:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11316.12s)]
*  Yeah, we were talking about before, Jordan bets like a hundred grand a hole. [[03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11317.12s)]
*  What? [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11319.480000000001s)]
*  Charles Barkley just did an interview where he was saying how like him and he doesn't [[03:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11320.480000000001s)]
*  do that. [[03:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11323.08s)]
*  Like him and Jordan bet for a couple hundred bucks, but Jordan, what was it? [[03:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11324.08s)]
*  He just printed out somewhere in an article that he said the most he saw, I think, was [[03:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11327.880000000001s)]
*  a hundred Gs or 200 Gs a hole or something like that. [[03:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11331.48s)]
*  I don't even remember what it was. [[03:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11334.36s)]
*  Yeah, you don't want to fucking play Jordan. [[03:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11335.36s)]
*  Even if you're good. [[03:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11338.32s)]
*  Even if you're good. [[03:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11339.32s)]
*  So it's $180,000 a game, right? [[03:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11340.32s)]
*  If you're doing 18 holes. [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11342.32s)]
*  Well, it depends on if you're doing skins or like if you carry over. [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11343.32s)]
*  Some people don't do carry over, right? [[03:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11346.64s)]
*  Like if you push a hole, some people push the hole, but I imagine he carries over. [[03:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11347.960000000001s)]
*  So yeah, I guess you'd, yeah. [[03:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11352.12s)]
*  Well, the problem with that is he's a billionaire. [[03:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11354.08s)]
*  Too much. [[03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11357.44s)]
*  That's what Charles was saying. [[03:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11358.44s)]
*  He's like, it doesn't matter to him. [[03:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11359.44s)]
*  It doesn't. [[03:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11360.44s)]
*  He doesn't think about it. [[03:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11361.44s)]
*  What's a hundred grand to Michael Jordan? [[03:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11362.44s)]
*  That's exactly what Charles said. [[03:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11363.44s)]
*  Tell on the radio. [[03:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11364.92s)]
*  But I think it's Jeremy Roenick that's telling this story. [[03:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11365.92s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[03:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11368.92s)]
*  The hockey player. [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11369.92s)]
*  This is a crazy story. [[03:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11370.92s)]
*  It's two minutes long. [[03:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11372.480000000001s)]
*  I think it's worth playing. [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11373.480000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[03:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11374.480000000001s)]
*  Back in the 90s when the bulls were on fire, this was like end of the season for us, end [[03:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11375.480000000001s)]
*  of the season for them. [[03:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11382.76s)]
*  I got a call from Michael, meet me at Sunset Ridge early. [[03:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11384.08s)]
*  We can go play play 18 holes. [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11387.68s)]
*  We didn't have a game. [[03:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11389.76s)]
*  We had actually had a day off. [[03:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11390.76s)]
*  So I meet him at Sunset Ridge, big old Greg Kunkel, who is one of the best, best people [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11391.76s)]
*  in golf here in Chicago. [[03:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11396.04s)]
*  I got to mention Greg at Sunset Ridge. [[03:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11397.04s)]
*  So we went, we played around, beat him for a couple thousand and I'm getting ready to [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11399.68s)]
*  leave. [[03:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11404.2s)]
*  Now bulls are playing that night. [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11405.2s)]
*  They played Cleveland that night. [[03:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11406.2s)]
*  So I'm thinking he's leaving. [[03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11408.16s)]
*  It's 10 o'clock. [[03:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11409.16s)]
*  He's like, no, let's go play again. [[03:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11410.16s)]
*  So he goes and we fill up a bag full of ice and pours light and we walk again. [[03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11412.359999999999s)]
*  We roll around another 18. [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11417.76s)]
*  I take him for another couple. [[03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11419.119999999999s)]
*  And yeah. [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11421.279999999999s)]
*  And now we've been drinking all afternoon. [[03:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11422.279999999999s)]
*  Now he's getting going from Sunset Ridge to the stadium to play a game. [[03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11423.8s)]
*  And I'm like, and I'm like, I'm like messing around. [[03:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11428.439999999999s)]
*  I'm like, I'm gonna call my bookie and I'm gonna get all the money that you just lost [[03:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11430.84s)]

*  I'll tell you what he goes. [[03:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11437.32s)]
*  He goes, you, I'll, I'll bet you that we win by 20 points and I have more than 40. [[03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11440.199999999999s)]
*  I'm like, done. [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11445.64s)]
*  Son of a gun goes out, scores 52 and they win by 26 or something after 18 holes of golf. [[03:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11446.64s)]
*  36 holes of golf. [[03:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11455.039999999999s)]
*  And having like maybe 10 Bud lights. [[03:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11457.039999999999s)]
*  The man, Michael Jordan to me is probably the best athlete that I've ever seen, that [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11461.039999999999s)]
*  I've ever been around and watched play and, you know, the way he presented himself and [[03:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11467.12s)]
*  played the game. [[03:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11472.44s)]
*  And I mean, just amazing. [[03:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11473.44s)]
*  What year was that? [[03:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11474.44s)]
*  That would have been 92. [[03:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11475.44s)]
*  92. [[03:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11478.44s)]

*  Superhuman. [[03:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11491.96s)]
*  Not the only time he did that, too. [[03:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11492.96s)]
*  Not the only time. [[03:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11494.0s)]
*  He did it before the finals. [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11495.0s)]
*  I feel like John Stockton, there's stories of him trying to beat down opponents playing [[03:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11496.0s)]
*  golf. [[03:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11499.12s)]
*  Right. [[03:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11500.12s)]
*  There's rumors. [[03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11501.12s)]
*  There's tons of different like rumor stories about he could fucking go out all night, drink, [[03:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11502.12s)]
*  hang out, have fun, wake up, you know, at fucking 5, 6 in the morning, work out, go [[03:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11506.64s)]
*  play a game and score just as many as he would if he wasn't fucking blacked out the night [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11513.36s)]
*  before. [[03:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11517.28s)]
*  Didn't affect him. [[03:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11518.28s)]
*  Wow. [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11519.28s)]
*  Superhuman shit. [[03:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11520.28s)]
*  That guy was a super. [[03:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11521.28s)]
*  He's one of those guys where I'm sure all of the lore is real, where you're like every [[03:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11523.24s)]
*  story where someone's like, really? [[03:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11526.820000000002s)]
*  It's like, I bet, I bet you. [[03:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11528.24s)]
*  Isn't it amazing that even amongst the most hyper competitive elite athletes, there's [[03:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11530.320000000002s)]
*  one that just stands out. [[03:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11536.76s)]
*  Oh, dude, yeah. [[03:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11539.24s)]
*  Just stands out as the freak of all freaks. [[03:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11540.24s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[03:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11543.24s)]
*  Isn't it? [[03:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11544.24s)]
*  I love that there's things like that. [[03:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11545.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11546.24s)]
*  I love that there's people, I love the people that defy all the logic. [[03:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11547.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11550.76s)]
*  Like I love, even though people hate Floyd Mayweather, I love Floyd Mayweather. [[03:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11551.92s)]
*  He's so entertaining. [[03:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11555.4s)]
*  I love the fact this guy is almost 50 years old and he's still taking pictures with all [[03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11556.4s)]
*  his watches. [[03:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11561.32s)]
*  When I go on a trip for 10 days, I bring 10 watches. [[03:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11562.32s)]
*  I love it. [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11565.52s)]
*  If I go on a trip for 20 days, I bring 10 more watches. [[03:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11566.52s)]
*  If it's a 30 day trip, I'll bring out the biggest of the big. [[03:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11569.56s)]
*  And he pulls out this fucking million dollar watch that's covered in diamonds. [[03:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11573.4s)]
*  It's fucking insane. [[03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11577.04s)]
*  But he was on a thing, there was an interview where they were like, how much is that watch [[03:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11578.6s)]
*  worth? [[03:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11583.6s)]
*  And he's like, $500,000? [[03:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11584.6s)]
*  And they were like, well, and he's like, I don't know if that was what it was, but then [[03:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11586.039999999999s)]
*  he's like, I made five million today. [[03:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11588.48s)]
*  And they're like, really? [[03:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11589.48s)]
*  He's like, today, just now. [[03:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11590.48s)]
*  I think I made five million dollars. [[03:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11591.48s)]
*  He's such an entertainer. [[03:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11592.48s)]
*  It doesn't even matter what's true or not. [[03:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11596.119999999999s)]
*  It's fun. [[03:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11597.96s)]
*  Well, it's also what he can do. [[03:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11598.96s)]
*  Look at all that. [[03:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11599.96s)]
*  But it's also what he can do as an athlete. [[03:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11600.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11603.92s)]
*  The fact that the guy is still making millions and millions of dollars fighting people who [[03:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11604.92s)]
*  have no business fighting him, including Logan Paul. [[03:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11610.56s)]
*  He fights a guy that's 200 pounds, a young, big, brutish athlete. [[03:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11614.24s)]
*  He's a big fella. [[03:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11620.44s)]
*  I mean, he's 200 plus. [[03:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11621.44s)]
*  I would say 220. [[03:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11622.44s)]
*  He's a big kid. [[03:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11623.44s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what he had to weigh in at. [[03:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11624.44s)]
*  I don't know what the deal was. [[03:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11627.68s)]
*  But Floyd never fought more than 154 in his life. [[03:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11629.44s)]
*  He's not a big guy. [[03:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11632.88s)]
*  He fought middleweight or light heavyweight. [[03:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11633.92s)]
*  Certainly didn't fight a heavyweight. [[03:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11634.92s)]
*  And Logan was huge. [[03:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11637.32s)]
*  When you see the two of them in the ring together, you're like, oh my God, this is crazy. [[03:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11638.32s)]
*  What do you say? [[03:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11643.32s)]
*  Weighed at 190, basically. [[03:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11644.32s)]
*  189 and a half. [[03:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11645.32s)]
*  Floyd weighed 155 and Logan weighed 190. [[03:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11646.32s)]
*  I'll tell you, I stood next to that kid. [[03:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11651.519999999999s)]
*  I went and did his show. [[03:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11653.72s)]
*  Why does it say 189 and a half? [[03:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11655.16s)]
*  189. [[03:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11658.119999999999s)]
*  It must be 189. [[03:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11659.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think the way that they got the one they just missed four minutes. [[03:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11660.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, 189 and a half. [[03:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11662.119999999999s)]
*  Which is, he probably had to dry himself out to make that weight. [[03:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11663.36s)]
*  He's bigger than that. [[03:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11668.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11669.36s)]
*  When I stood next to him, he's a big kid. [[03:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11670.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11671.36s)]
*  Like, he's big. [[03:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11672.36s)]
*  The fact that Floyd, obviously, he's not nearly as skilled as Floyd Mayweather. [[03:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11673.36s)]
*  Oh, but it's a different world. [[03:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11676.36s)]
*  But the fact that Floyd Mayweather said, fuck it, I'll fight that big dude. [[03:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11677.36s)]
*  You ever see when Shaq fought Oscar De La Hoya? [[03:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11680.36s)]
*  Look at the size difference. [[03:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11683.36s)]
*  Look at that. [[03:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11684.36s)]
*  The size difference is fucking insane. [[03:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11685.36s)]
*  But that's Floyd. [[03:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11687.36s)]
*  I mean, and I don't know how much money he made from that, but I think he still owes [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11688.36s)]
*  Logan Paul money. [[03:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11692.6s)]
*  Wait, really? [[03:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11693.6s)]
*  Yeah, there's some sort of a lawsuit. [[03:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11694.6s)]
*  I don't know if it's a dispute. [[03:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11695.6s)]
*  I don't know who's right. [[03:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11698.0s)]
*  But there is some sort of a lawsuit where he claims that he still owes millions of dollars. [[03:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11699.880000000001s)]
*  I like the word dispute. [[03:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11704.36s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what's going on. [[03:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11705.36s)]
*  With promotions and stuff like that, is it based on pay-per-view points? [[03:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11708.0s)]
*  Were you promised a certain amount? [[03:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11711.6s)]
*  You didn't get it? [[03:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11713.0s)]
*  Did they not sell as many pay-per-views as they thought they were? [[03:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11714.0s)]
*  I don't know how that all works. [[03:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11717.28s)]
*  I want to just tell you this, because you said that, it reminded me of my childhood [[03:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11720.2s)]
*  best friend told me a story one time. [[03:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11723.08s)]
*  He was on the train in Chicago. [[03:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11724.28s)]
*  And this guy sees a guy that he recognizes from across the train. [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11726.44s)]
*  He's like, yo, what the fuck is up? [[03:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11731.480000000001s)]
*  And they're yelling across. [[03:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11733.480000000001s)]
*  He goes, what the fuck is up with you? [[03:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11734.480000000001s)]
*  And he's like, not the man. [[03:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11736.880000000001s)]
*  And they're chatting across the train. [[03:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11737.880000000001s)]
*  My buddy said he was standing in between them and they're yelling over people. [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11739.24s)]
*  And then one guy goes, hey man, how's whatever this name? [[03:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11742.640000000001s)]
*  How's Marco? [[03:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11745.52s)]
*  And the other guy goes, he's dead. [[03:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11746.52s)]
*  And he goes, damn, what happened to him? [[03:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11748.84s)]
*  And the other guy goes, it was a dispute. [[03:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11751.84s)]
*  And he was like, oh word, okay. [[03:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11754.0s)]
*  Like the most generic, like it was a dispute. [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11758.279999999999s)]
*  And he understood it. [[03:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11763.119999999999s)]
*  He was like, uh-huh. [[03:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11764.119999999999s)]
*  That's a good way to handle that. [[03:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11765.119999999999s)]
*  Ask no more questions. [[03:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11766.119999999999s)]
*  It was a dispute. [[03:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11767.119999999999s)]
*  That's a funny way that you would only talk in a crowded room when you're yelling over [[03:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11768.119999999999s)]
*  people. [[03:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11770.72s)]
*  He's not going to give any more information. [[03:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11771.72s)]
*  He was like, it was a dispute. [[03:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHkTIZD7rM0&t=11772.72s)]
