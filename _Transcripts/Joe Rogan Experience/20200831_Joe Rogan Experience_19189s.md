# Joe Rogan Experience #1530 - Duncan Trussell
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [August 31, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xRz8ra9mdI)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience
*  Shrain by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day!
*  Hello Joe. How are you my friend? I'm great man, I'm psyched to be here. Cheers sir. Cheers brother.
*  Hare Krishna. Great to see you. Always.
*  That's good. My friend, these are strange times and we're both departing this land. I know.
*  For greener frosters. I keep thinking back to when we first became friends,
*  and the strange path since from there to here, and all our predictions and all the things that we never would have imagined this.
*  You know, specifically like that there would be this fucking global pandemic that we would suddenly be like,
*  some kind of like refugee is way too dramatic a word for it, but suddenly just part of this diaspora of comedians pouring out of LA.
*  Like, and not just comedians, but just people leaving man.
*  I talked to Joey today from New Jersey. I called him. He's in New Jersey and it was just so strange.
*  I'm like, you're in Jersey? He's like, that's right motherfucker. He's all happy in Jersey.
*  You know, he was the last. Like you leaving was intense, but I was still like, you know, maybe we'll stick around and see what happens.
*  And then like I've been getting all these, you know, the problem with me is like I get weird vibes all the time.
*  And like the last I was on here, I legitimately thought a meteor was going to hit the earth.
*  I really thought that I worked very hard on not listening to that part of me most of the time.
*  But I was getting this real weird vibe from LA and I'm like, come on, man, you're just like superstitious.
*  It's it's probably nothing. And then then my wife would say like, I'm getting a really weird vibe.
*  Like maybe maybe I don't know if we should stay here renting, if we should stay in the place.
*  And I didn't want to tell her, oh, I've been getting a weird vibe, too, because I didn't want to amplify whatever that was.
*  And then I got on the phone with Diaz. He's like, yeah, I'm leaving, getting the fuck out of here.
*  And that was it. Diaz was telling me Burbank was sketchy where he lives in Burbank is my neighborhood during the shit like instantly.
*  Dude, it's like, yeah, it's it's it's not and it's not just any one thing.
*  You know, it's like not just like some of the stuff I get stuff had to get shut down.
*  And because stuff was shut down, it got a little more weathered than usual.
*  And it's like, you know, the homeless in Kamen. I was an Echo Park man.
*  And like, I really feel like, you know, like the red state people, one of the things they love to tweet is like, don't bring your liberal bullshit here.
*  Right. Well, this is that's where I'm eating shit a little bit because, you know, I am I do still believe that we need to decriminalize drugs, that the drug policy is bullshit, the way we're handling it's all wrong.
*  But they there used to be a way that they could get people who are like camping out on the streets.
*  And a lot of the times that was possession of like illegal drugs.
*  And because that that stuff got removed, suddenly you were witnessing like, holy shit, man, there's people who are making like real like a rational decision from the perspective of a heroin addict, which is they love heroin so much.
*  You know that Doug Stanhope joke, some things are better than life.
*  Like they love heroin so much.
*  They're addicted to it. They love it.
*  And the shelters that are apparently available won't let them do drugs in the shelters.
*  They want you to kick it.
*  Yeah. And so that's ridiculous.
*  But now I could be wrong about that.
*  But that is what I've heard is one of the reasons these people are staying out in the street is not because they don't want to be in a shelter.
*  It's because they don't want to be prevented from getting high.
*  And so this has produced this like situation in a lot of the big cities, which is we're seeing like massive tent cities.
*  And by the way, the tent city thing, aesthetically, it's not it's not the best look.
*  But the stuff that I began to experience in Echo Park, man, I took I took my kid to the playground.
*  Right. And there's like a dude that looks like he emerged from a time portal from an apocalypse.
*  You know what I mean? I'm not talking about like, you know, run of the mill, like somebody who's a junkie, who's like I'm talking like covered in like soot, like pure dilated eyes, not wearing like, you know, the disheveled clothes you might expect from someone who's been addicted to heroin for a long time.
*  But like wearing like like he broke into wherever the costumes for Mad Max were like some kind of weird leather vest thing and like like creepy fucking cut off shorts.
*  And he had a machete and he's throwing it into the ground of the playground and pulling it out like he's practicing throwing a machete.
*  I'm with my fucking toddler man. And you know, it's like it's so obviously we didn't go to the playground.
*  But that was, you know, my you know, it was not uncommon in that area to see completely naked people just not that that's bad, but not naked like the way I've covered in dirt wandering aimlessly.
*  Even worse than wandering aimlessly wandering with what seems to be a purpose in their eyes.
*  Some of them seeming like they're late. Where the fuck are you going naked that you're late for?
*  Like are you being summoned? Like that was that was all but that wasn't just it, man. You know, it's a lot of other things too.
*  And it all just started piling on top of it.
*  Dude, I don't think this is sustainable living in giant groups of people. I think it's when it's when it works great. It was wonderful.
*  When L.A. was was working well, it was fantastic. When the comedy store was packed and restaurants were doing well and the economy was doing well and the crime wasn't high.
*  It's great. But when things go bad, there's no sense of community.
*  So then there's a sense of like people capitalizing on other people who either own stores or who aren't home or whatever. People who are desperate.
*  There's too many people. Yeah. If you're in a community, that's a small town and something goes wrong, you can kind of bunch up together and help each other.
*  Yeah, because you feel like you need each other and you feel like you're you're a part of something.
*  You don't feel like they're a part of something here. They're all transient. Everybody's moved here from someone else. Yeah. From somewhere else.
*  Everybody thinks they can go somewhere else and they can and they probably will.
*  I mean, I you know, we all came from you were North Carolina. I came from New York at the time.
*  We all everybody who comes to L.A. in show business. God, what are the percentage of like how many do we know that are just straight L.A.?
*  Like Christina Pizitzky. She's straight L.A. Who else?
*  Sebastian came from Chicago.
*  Theo came from Nashville. Nashville is where he came from.
*  No, Louisiana. That's right. I mean, Joey, obviously Jersey. Yeah.
*  Well, it's a gypsy town, which is something I've always loved about it.
*  I've loved that element of like just this wild vortex of artists and narcissists and people who've just gone insane.
*  And like it's a lot of the sparks fly in that kind of insane cauldron of identity.
*  All that stuff is super cool. It's beautiful.
*  That's one of the things I loved about it is like the place we all know this is the place is the place where you make illusion.
*  That was the idea. You make things that aren't real seem real.
*  And people like to watch that. That's the whole TV movie industry.
*  The whole place is based on it, creating an identity that you like somehow monetize or a studio makes monetizes your identity or something.
*  It was something magical and beautiful in all of that.
*  But it seems like there is a real emperor wears no clothes thing happening right now, not just in L.A.
*  And I feel bad talking shit about L.A. because, man, she's been so good to both of us.
*  Yeah. I mean, this city is like I will always love this place.
*  The problem is not the city. This is the I've been thinking about this a lot lately.
*  And here's an issue. I am progressive on just about every issue across the board.
*  Yeah. Gay rights, civil rights, women's rights, whatever women's right to choose.
*  Fill in the blank. Pro Medicaid, pro universal basic income, pro so many things.
*  But there's a thing that happens in large cities where large cities are always blue.
*  And I'm trying to figure this out because like New York and I used to think it's always because they're educated, you know, and educated people are more likely to be compassionate and compassionate people more likely to be Democrats.
*  But there's a balance that has to be achieved.
*  And when the shit hits the fan, you need law and order.
*  And I think that some people who are Democrats, who are progressive people, they don't understand that aspect of human nature or they want to deny that aspect of human nature.
*  Like when the mayor of Seattle was dealing with that whole six area lockdown, little small little country that they had put up barriers and shit and like literally were had armed guards there that was it called again?
*  Chop Chop or Chas, right?
*  The mayor said maybe this is our summer of love.
*  Like, no, it's not summer of love. Some people took over other people's businesses with force, like just because they think the way you think, or they subscribe to liberal ideas like you like you're a liberal too.
*  So this is like your gang of thugs. You have to support when they take over other people's businesses.
*  No, we have to be able to call out everybody.
*  And just because somebody is on your side, you can't let them take over city blocks and just institute their own government and then say it's the summer of love.
*  This is crazy talk. And this is how this is gets get cities destroyed. And this is what gets the police defunded. And this would would get people saying crazy things like we need to disband the release everyone from prison and no more prisons and no more laws and no more police.
*  I'm like, no, the way things go well is you have to be safe. The only way you're safe is if you have a strong military and a strong police force.
*  And there's something about liberals that don't want to believe that they see the bad cops. They see these videos and we all agree we got to get rid of bad cops. They got to reform the police.
*  They have to. But those are not all the cops. That's crazy. You just only see the bad. No one's no one's filming excellent interactions with friendly cops and compliant people.
*  That's not what you're filming. I'm going to get a lot of YouTube downloads. But that's the majority of these interactions.
*  But we have this distorted perception based on what we're exposed to, which is viral videos of cops being cunts because there are cops that are cunts because there's people that are cunts and there's who knows how many fucking hundreds of thousands of millions of cops.
*  There are the odds that they're not hundreds and thousands of cunts is outrageous. Well, you know what I've been doing with this whole fucking thing, man, because if I get because you know me, the way my mind goes is not going to be like red state consciousness when it comes to that shit.
*  Because when I saw that autonomous zone pop up, I'm like, let's do it, baby. Spread it out. Come on. But what did you think would be good? What could good could have come of that?
*  Well, I mean, the history of America is beautiful, yet somewhat like there's a there's a mania, a utopian mania in the heart of I think the American spirit, which is like Americans identify with this.
*  It's you know, George Carlin did a great job of desiccating it by saying it's called the American dream because you got to be asleep to believe I love that joke.
*  But I love the American dream. And the what's so beautiful about it is it's this idea of like, I think together we can do something new. It's going to be better than anything that happened before.
*  And from that spirit, you get all great innovation that goes across all political ideologies. Right. So to me, you know, and they always call it I've always loved that they call it the American experiment.
*  I fucking love that man, because it's an experiment. It's like, let's see what we could do here together. And for an experiment to work, we need to be able to look at what didn't work in the experiment and improve upon it.
*  Now, that being said, it's like, for me, I've been trying to like, pull myself out of the even though I identify as a progressive, I'm going to vote Democrat.
*  I'm not just what I'm going to do. But that being said, I try to pull myself out of that, because I don't want to be cubby old man. And I have a lot of friends who are like hardcore conservatives.
*  And I know that there is this idea and I think a lot of the idea gets perpetrated by people who are into tribalism, blue, red. And so the blue people, they propagate conceptualization of the red people, which is kind of what you said.
*  Well, they're not compassionate. It's like, shut the fuck up. Get the fuck out of here. These are some of the most compassionate people I've ever met in my fucking life. They would die for people that they've never met.
*  They think a big problem is the figurehead right now. The Republican Party is Trump. Trump is such a polarizing figure. And he doesn't seem to have much empathy, if any.
*  You don't know who he is really because you don't talk to him privately, but his public persona is that of a winner who doesn't give a fuck and you're fired. That's a non empathetic perspective.
*  And we associate people who support him with also lacking empathy. Then you add into it children in cages at the border and you see those videos.
*  You know what bothered me more than anything about the kids in cages? There was one video that really bothered me where Mike Pence went to visit. Like he's on the ground, like next to the cages. See if you can find that.
*  Mike Pence visiting the border cages. Now apparently these cages had been put up through Obama and that's what's interesting about this whole border wall and border discussion and immigration discussion because Obama, particularly when he was running for president, he was very tough on illegal immigration.
*  I mean he said a lot of the same things that Trump said. If you listen to the speeches that Obama said, people believed him and agreed with him because it wasn't a Republican talking point. It was just a safety talking point.
*  And it was also a way that he could get people that were more concerned about the problem with illegal immigration. He could tie that up with just saying, listen, we have to follow the rule of law.
*  And they had these talks and they built these cages. They did that during the Obama administration, right?
*  So here's this. These are the guys that fled from Mexico and who knows where else and came through the Mexican border. And then Pence is standing there in front of these guys.
*  So imagine you're a dude, you live in Ecuador and you make your way up through Mexico because you have a fucking dream. America is the land where people can make it.
*  This is this guy who fights in the UFC. His name is Marlon Vera and he's a bad motherfucker and he just won this weekend. And I believe he's from Ecuador, right?
*  That's Marlon's. Yes. And he talked about it in his victory speech. He was talking about, you know, how, hey, man, you know, you can you can actually do it. He came over here.
*  He was talking about in the Countdown show, too. He came over here. He lived a year without his family just building up money fighting to try to get money to bring his family over.
*  And then he brought his family over. And then as time has gone on, he keeps winning. He's on like a seven fight win streak. And now he's like a top 10 contender in the UFC.
*  And he could have been one of those dudes. That's right. See, this this this is not these are just people that are in a fucking terrible place.
*  They're trying to get out, putting him in cages like it just it's a bad look. And it's an even worse.
*  Imagine you're that guy who comes over from Ecuador and you're in this cage and you see Pence. He could touch him. You could touch him.
*  If that cage was in there, you could reach over and touch him on the shoulder. He's right there. Right.
*  The fucking guy who's second in line to the most powerful army the world has ever known.
*  Trump's the commander in chief. That's number two. Yeah. And he's right there in front of a cage.
*  And he doesn't seem to care. Like, play this. It's weird. I don't know how I want him to to look, but he's not like looking at the people.
*  He's kind of like looking away. He's kind of like ignoring the people. I mean, I don't know what you're supposed to do.
*  Are you supposed to look at them? Would that would it fill you with sorrow and despair?
*  Would you not be able to rationalize and disconnect yourself from the humans that are suffering?
*  When you think about all of us, we're basically the products of a fucking enormous chain of events.
*  Not one thing, but look at they have foil blankets, man. I mean, this is crazy shit.
*  They're stacked in there, stacked on top of each other, wearing foil blanket. Yeah, it's terrible.
*  And it's look at that guy's thinking about his kids. Yes. And he's got a family back home.
*  No, no, no. His kids got separated from him. That too. That's what he's thinking about.
*  And you know, the and again, man, it's like, I keep trying to get out of the like, I keep trying to get out because I this is what I've realized because I love flipping through.
*  I go from I will jump back and forth from like Fox News to CNN, MSNBC. I'll check out some Tucker Carlson blast over to Rachel Maddow.
*  Find these like polar opposites. And what I feel like what's happening just as a result of the entertainment that is news is that we're getting a very non nuanced.
*  We're being told what we are. Basically, do you listen to or watch the Hill? No, you should watch rising the Hill.
*  It's Crystal and Sager and Sager is a Republican and Crystal is a Democrat.
*  And but both of them super smart and really rational. And they're honest. They're honest.
*  And they they're nonpartisan. They break things down based on their honest interpretation of what's going on.
*  And it's so refreshing. These two right here, crystal ball and Sager and Getty.
*  They are fucking fantastic. And I love the fact that they're friends. Yet she's left. He's right. It's not bullshit. They're not frauds.
*  You think your real name is crystal ball? If I my last name is ball, I'd name my daughter Crystal. It's dope.
*  Come on. You would not name her Magic Crystal Ball.
*  I don't know. Why not? Well, because every because you do that and you're going to like I didn't even notice it until now because I'm not name phobic.
*  I'm not name of my name is Duncan. I am. How do you think I am sensitive to names like that?
*  Because if their real name is Crystal Ball, be a third grader named Crystal Ball. Have fun with third grader.
*  Third grader, you might be able to get away with it. But 10th grade, you're going to get tortured by time girls reach 15.
*  Crystal Balls. Yeah. It's like a never ending. You know, anyway, what I'm to me, it's like the propaganda.
*  It's propaganda. And the reality of it is like I'm trying to figure out, well, what do we all have in common?
*  It sounds like a cheesy thing. And what we all have in common is we want to be happy.
*  When I talk to my my my liberal friends, they want to be happy when I talk to my conservative friends.
*  They want to be happy. And then you add to it. Now, this is where it gets weird.
*  A lot of people want to be a hero. And why wouldn't you? A lot of people want to help other people.
*  They have a service mentality. They would they want to die for something good.
*  A lot of people really do want to help. And then that's to me where the problems start is because that's being subverted.
*  And the way it's being subverted is, you know, it sucks, man, when you're around somebody who's telling you how you feel.
*  Yeah. Have you ever had that happen where you're around someone they're like, why are you unhappy today?
*  And you're not unhappy. But if you're not careful, you'll be like, maybe I'm unhappy.
*  Yeah. And then you then you become the unhappy thing and they've like sucked you into a thing you're not.
*  Yeah. And so for me, this is the danger of the news is they kind of tell us how we are, how we feel.
*  First of all, this ridiculous red, blue bullshit. It's like, stop.
*  I mean, every single person I've ever met would I don't think I've ever met anybody who wouldn't try to help someone who is drowning.
*  I think most people I meet are like that. And I think that transcends politics.
*  But somehow they've got us thinking we're all different and separate.
*  And then on top of the thing that really bothers me and annoys me, obviously, man, I'm no fucking Trump fan.
*  That guy's a lunatic and he's driving people crazy. But what bothers me is like, pass that line.
*  You know, you're for sure. He's driving people nuts. And it's just the way you said it.
*  And what bothers me is that the response from like really intelligent people who consider themselves liberals is they're shaming these people.
*  They're shaming them. They're saying, oh, they're idiots. They're rednecks. They're dumb. They're peasants, stupid peasants.
*  How could you like him? It's like how they liked this guy because they thought that he was going to help their families.
*  They were fucking they were not doing great economically.
*  He they bought into a thing and they invested themselves in it.
*  And if they are starting to like it's dawning on them that they succumb to another American tradition, which is the con artist.
*  This is an American tradition. It's American to be a con artist.
*  And it's American to get sucked in by one happens to the best of us.
*  It's happened to me at a Grateful Dead concert. We wanted to buy a hundred hits of fucking acid.
*  This son of a bitch got us a sheet of acid, convinced us to try to sell it to make more money to get more acid.
*  We left there with one mushroom stem on the way back to Hendersonville. I've been conned.
*  I know what it's like. It's a very American thing. But it's like so there was no acid at all.
*  Dude, he's no, he we got we took our money to buy acid and then he's like we could sell this acid and buy more acid.
*  And then, you know, we're like, yeah, let's do it.
*  And then he sold the acid, I guess. And then we were going to buy more.
*  The point is like he started a business. What he my friend almost gave him his fucking car.
*  Like this was a very charismatic hippie. He was like looked exactly the way you'd expect him.
*  A fucking hippie bandana, big hippie beard. Some people are good at that.
*  And it's weird. Yeah, they do weird things like they talk a little too close to you to make you uncomfortable.
*  Yeah, they use what's this neuro-linguistic programming? They like they like they just get you and they know how to talk.
*  You know, when I was to work at Newport Creamery, I'd work the register sometimes.
*  And we had lessons on how to deal with flim flam artists. That's what they called them. Flim flam artists.
*  So they would teach you. So we had to sit there and be taught like how someone will fuck you up, like sell something that costs three bucks.
*  And they'll give you a twenty and they'll say, hey, can you give me a ten and a five and then the rest in quarters?
*  And you're like, what? Yeah. How much is that?
*  And then before you know it, he's saying something else and talking over you and you think you owe him forty dollars.
*  Yeah. Like you're giving him more money. It's like I gave you a fifty. So you give me the twenty, that twenty.
*  And then what is it? It was three bucks. So you owe me forty seven.
*  So before you know it, you're giving money away and you don't understand what's happening. That's right.
*  Especially when you're a kid. I was like, I think I was 16 when I was working there. I was a monkey, basically a monkey.
*  Right. And, you know, these people travel all over the place and they do this to folks. They just trick them.
*  They pickpocket them. Like watching David Blaine do card tricks. OK. From as close as you are to me.
*  I don't get it. I don't know what he's doing. He could get me every time. He's going to trick me every time.
*  He's so good at it. Yeah. And there's guys that are I don't know if they're at that level, but there's guys at a level that you or I can't perceive.
*  And they'll steal your watch. Yeah. There's guys who can get your watch off. Yeah. Like they can get your watch off.
*  I don't know how they do it, but it's a known thing. It's a known thing that guys know how to get your watch off. Fucking guys.
*  I mean, how many videos on YouTube? There's awesome videos of like children doing this to people.
*  You could see like kids like get trained to do this. It's like they it's hacking our operating system.
*  Essentially, he stuffed a card into my friend Jeff's watch band and Jeff didn't even know it was in there.
*  He's like, look, it's there. And he's like, what? He looks at his watch.
*  But he like pull it out. It's the card he was looking for folded up tucked into his watch.
*  Ben, you're like, what? What did you just do? So that guy's a thief. If he was like some like, oh, is this someone stealing something?
*  Yeah. There's a whole genre of YouTube. Oh, boy. Look at that. Wow. Little tiny kids. Yeah.
*  They're trained. Wow. They're trained to steal. Yeah. They practice to do it.
*  I mean, this is just look, we see this on the human realm and we're like, oh, my God, their children.
*  You see a coral reef and a little fish come and take food from another fish. It's like just totally normal.
*  I mean, it's not even this is just part of being in a hive. You know, I just steal that guy's watch.
*  Is that what just happened? Bro, back that up. That was crazy. Look, watch how this guy bumps into this guy.
*  He takes his watch. Watch this. Is that what he did? No, no, the guy still had a watch.
*  What did he steal? You'll never know. I'm too high for this. I'm too high for this.
*  But I've never seen anybody take someone's watch off. But I know it's a real thing.
*  Like guys can actually take your watch off. Yeah. I mean, like one with a strap where they do the buckle.
*  It's annoying for you to do. Yeah, dude, I like to me, this is a natural part of the environment we're in.
*  How many things camouflage themselves as other things take energy out of a system using the camouflage?
*  It's completely fucking normal. It's nature. Nature. Yeah.
*  So you get this Trump and you get people who fell for it.
*  And now those people are deeply invested in that like magic trick, which he did.
*  And by the way, this is another thing. It's like, look, you don't have to like somebody like I don't like Charles Manson.
*  Yeah. But man, I do recognize like how fucking entertaining he is.
*  You know what I mean? Like that's a very entertaining cult leader.
*  Similarly with Trump, not a fan. You know, the moment he said he implied you should shoot looters, although look, we can go on and on with anti-bullying.
*  I'm not I'm not talking about that. I'm saying the problem is that our tactic as Americans is not supposed to be.
*  We listen to the state and get our cues about how to be good people from the state are as Americans.
*  What we do is we have like basic fundamental ideas that are really fucking beautiful.
*  One of them being that we like believe that people have a right to be free and seek their own personal happiness.
*  That's beautiful, man. That's not we shouldn't have the state telling us different versions of what that is.
*  We we have to be intelligent and autonomous enough to do that for ourselves.
*  And then from that, like really be a United States.
*  And like what's happening now is these motherfuckers are not unifying us.
*  This is supposed to be the United States of America. That's what it's supposed to be.
*  So if you're in a government official here and you're doing a thing that's making it all divided and fucked up and you're telling lies and you're shaming people for telling the truth,
*  it doesn't matter if you're a Republican or a Democrat, whatever you are, as far as I'm concerned, anti-American, which is like, man, Americans and fuck anybody gets mad at me for saying this.
*  Americans are beautiful people. We both tour.
*  We get to meet people all over the fucking place and talk to them.
*  And they're always generally wonderful. Yes, some of them will take your fucking watch.
*  You know what I mean? But still still, you know, in general, in general that you encounter when things were going well.
*  See, this is the thing that shifts everything is covid.
*  The reason why everybody's ramped up means it's not no small feat.
*  It's not just about getting sick. It's about everybody being scared that they're going to lose loved ones or they're going to die or they lose lung function.
*  You can't work. So you're worried about your income.
*  There's so many people whose businesses are eroding right before their eyes.
*  I mean, imagine if you own commercial real estate now. Jesus Christ.
*  And you start thinking of the prospect of leasing a building that you invested all your money in out to some folks.
*  They're not going to have offices like that anymore. People are going to do shit from home.
*  There's a lot of people that are actually more productive working from home. I know it's a fucked up time.
*  So everybody's on eight. Everybody's walking around trying to keep it together.
*  That's right. And so a guy like Trump exacerbates it because he doesn't ever come out with a unity speech.
*  Yeah, it's always like a stroke. He's always the strong boss. You're fired on the man.
*  Yeah. So I mean, this is the message and it works with a lot of people.
*  It's a good look. It's it's like comedy or music.
*  Not not everything works on everybody, but there's a lot of people that vibe with his fucking real cartoonish version of being the boss.
*  Right. But it's not a bring everybody together thing.
*  And this is what we need. We need the guy in the movie that stands on top of the hill, the guy that says we have more in similarity than we do that we disagree with.
*  Yeah, man. We're together. We're friends.
*  Most people, most of our issues we could work out amicably. We can talk.
*  Most of our issues, the vast majority.
*  And we need to not just dwell on those, but embrace those like embrace all the things we like.
*  We want safe schools for our kids. We want safe streets.
*  Yeah, we want a fucking bridge maintenance so the bridges don't collapse.
*  We want everybody to be OK. Yeah, man.
*  We want no crime. Yeah, we want we don't want unjust prison.
*  We don't want people being unjustly accused and then sentenced to life in jail and other people to work forever to get them.
*  We don't want any of that. We don't want any prosecutors that hide evidence that shows that a person was innocent.
*  That's real today in 2020. Yeah, they don't even get in trouble for it.
*  Yeah, man. It's right. It's true.
*  And I think that the only maybe this is naive. I think we got to get over our addiction to the person on the hill.
*  We got to get over our addiction to the idea that the way we govern is the only way to govern.
*  That's it. And that's why when I see that, what was it called again? A chas?
*  You know, again, like, yeah, to me, it's not it's to me.
*  What I'm seeing there is at the very least a radical experiment in a potential.
*  Now, it's a temper tantrum by some 20 year old kids who hate capitalism.
*  How old were the founding fathers? It's a good question.
*  But, you know, they didn't have YouTube. And I think they would have formed a much better opinion.
*  Well, the whole and this is the other part of it.
*  So I keep thinking about and again, man, this is where my case is going to start falling apart.
*  But that's OK. I don't mind if my case falls apart.
*  For me, it's I keep thinking like, OK, so what are they telling us now?
*  How do they're saying, well, either you're a socialist or capitalist or a communist.
*  Tell me what kind of is that I am or what is a moment to.
*  And I keep thinking like, man, can't there isn't it possible with all the technology we have that there's a newism that no one's that doesn't have the first part of the world.
*  Good point. So it's like and so at the very least, if you meet someone who's like in passionate in a real way, not a bullshit way, by the way, man, because like there's a big difference between like you know right away when you run into somebody who's trying to tell you how to be.
*  It's horrible. It's a pretty even if it's in a light way, it's such a it's so drone some like, oh, oh, oh, some people want you sick.
*  Some people want you to stabilized and like unbalanced.
*  One one thing's for sure. People don't want you to know you are because if you know you are, they can't tell you who you are.
*  But but, you know, if you run into someone who's legitimately you to a utopian, here we go.
*  Get ready to lose fucking viewers right now.
*  Baby, this is where people press stop on Spotify.
*  Go on to like listen to like my favorite murder or whatever.
*  But I was at Burning Man and stop stop stop stop stop.
*  Hey, man, I am sure Burning Man is like everything else in the world.
*  There's a lot of profound conversations and few of them that want to make you just bury your head in the sand.
*  Definitely. And but one this guy came up to you just getting these great chats and this guy came up to me.
*  We're just yapping.
*  And he said, Do you think world peace is possible?
*  He wasn't being a missionary or anything.
*  Just ask him. Just ask a real question.
*  But it's so cliche that it seems like a joke question that a moron would ask you.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Funny.
*  Yeah. What would you want more than that?
*  World equality, world financial equality, world peace.
*  There's like four or five things you would ever say.
*  Like, look, that might cure up a lot of shit. Yeah, that's right.
*  And but to ask it is so cliche.
*  Like everybody's like Burning Man. What?
*  Well, that's it. That's it. World peace.
*  You know, and that's the other thing.
*  If like, let's say you're at the Venice Boardwalk and some son of a bitch dressed like Uncle Sam comes and asks you that you're going to like go the other direction.
*  Like, fuck you.
*  Like, you're just going to leave.
*  Maybe if you get out of Nicaragua, man.
*  Yeah. Yeah. But but he was actually somebody who's really into Buckminster Fuller.
*  And I think that was something Buckminster Fuller put out there, which is like this.
*  This question is very important.
*  And you saw you should ask yourself this as an individual, because if you think world peace is possible, right,
*  even if you acknowledge that maybe right now it's not possible, but if you can invent in your mind some technology, some or even if you can invent in your mind like an X, like an algebra for a thing you don't have the space for yet, but it could be.
*  Right. If there's any sense in you at all that world peace is possible, then from that point forward, you should be part of whatever it is that's going to make us have that great utopian idea that transcends American borders.
*  And because that's the other problem is the American dream thing.
*  It's confined. It's not the American dream.
*  It's the human dream.
*  The human dream is the intuition we all have that there's a way for us to be on the planet together that doesn't involve blowing each other up.
*  And that's I think it's possible.
*  I think it's possible.
*  I just don't know how it would be how to get there necessarily.
*  But I think it's possible.
*  And one thing's for sure.
*  Whenever you get a Trump or any fucking pundit blowing out divisive shit into people's brains, they are not draw.
*  If there's like a scale, one sides world peace, one sides chaos, they're dropping.
*  They're dropping their their pebbles on the chaos part of the scale.
*  And it's like, you know, why do you think they're doing that?
*  Because, man, let me tell you, there's a lot of money to be made in fucking chaos, man.
*  There's a lot of money.
*  I mean, isn't that what an engine is?
*  Isn't that what an engine is?
*  An engine is kind of like controlled explosions.
*  Do you remember when Trump talked openly once about the military industrial complex?
*  Yeah.
*  And he said they want to go to war.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're like, what?
*  The problem is he says so many other things that are ridiculous.
*  I know.
*  If only he just said that.
*  If only he just said that.
*  The problem with him saying that is you can go, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  But he also called this chickie fuck the horse face.
*  And you go, oh, yeah, that's not nice.
*  Yeah.
*  He he had he had a he had a thing there, like a moment like an Eisenhower moment, not quite as eloquent.
*  But when Eisenhower was on television, he warned people about the military industrial complex as he was leaving office.
*  That's to this day, like one of the most profound speeches I've ever seen.
*  Yeah.
*  It gives me a chill because I think, well, this is black and white from how many fucking years ago?
*  Yeah.
*  If this shit was going on then, it's not like it stopped going on.
*  Didn't stop.
*  See, one of the reasons why we're in such a fucked up space politically is because this is the first time where politics have been really exposed to the general public by the Internet.
*  Like you you have a different access to politics you never had before.
*  You have real time things breaking.
*  You find out.
*  So like if someone like Gavin Newsom said he was going to take a pay cut, he didn't.
*  Fox News princess.
*  It goes, why?
*  And you get all these stories like, oh, would you have known that before cell phones and the Internet?
*  You've never known that he didn't do that.
*  You would have to be a person who's really into politics.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's not that many of them.
*  Most people are busy.
*  So now politics relies on scandals and scandals are what weasels people through.
*  That's it.
*  So the thing about scandals is not everybody's a good person.
*  All right. And if you if you do a lot of fucked up shit, but you own it the way Trump did, people didn't count on the asshole vote.
*  Because there's a lot of assholes out there.
*  And finally they had a king.
*  They're like, this is our king.
*  Fuck you.
*  Maga.
*  They wear the fucking sunglasses and they talk shit to Ted Cruz at rallies.
*  Those guys finally had a king.
*  And that's like we didn't.
*  There was no king on the other side.
*  There was no king, the compassionate, intelligent king who actually made sense.
*  Well, that's the sad part.
*  That's what we don't have.
*  Think how depressing your very astute observation is in the sense that the idea was we weren't going to have a fucking monarchy here.
*  Yeah, that was the whole point.
*  And now we elect a monarchy.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  That's the whole point, man.
*  And it's like and again, it's like, look, if like if you start playing the game, that you're the smart person in the room and that if people disagree with you, they must be dumb.
*  If people have different ideas than you, they must be stupid.
*  And then you start shaming them.
*  What can you what all you're doing is creating this like you're going to create a reaction to that.
*  And the reaction is going to be a celebration of every single thing you're with your great vast elite intelligence deriding.
*  And so I think that's the problem is it's like I just there's nothing worse than when like people who are legitimately smart have read a bunch of fucking books, have got master's degrees,
*  have not developed enough compassion to understand that just about every single person on the planet wants to be happy, wants to have a full stomach, doesn't want to hurt anybody and would run into a building on fire to save somebody.
*  Most everybody, I would say I would say at least 90 percent, a large percentage, a large percentage.
*  And these motherfuckers are shaming them and telling them they're idiots or they're stupid or this and that.
*  It's like, fuck you, man.
*  You don't know what these people came up through.
*  You don't know.
*  These people were born in the houses filled with fucking methamphetamine smoke whose parents were like, you know, absolutely fucking insane.
*  And they still manage to get out and get a job and have a fucking life and pay taxes.
*  And now your fucking ass is going to tell these people who didn't have the fucking trust fund that you had that got you into the fucking Ivy League University that they're fucking idiots.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  Stop. They're not.
*  And then I'm shaming those people.
*  That's the problem.
*  The idea is like, you're not shaming them.
*  I mean, then you're just honestly illuminating their their their current situation.
*  Let's just let's think it's shaming them.
*  It's time to like let go of the whole like snooty thing.
*  It's time to also on the other side, it's time to let go of like every single one of these people must be like burning candles to Malik in their backyard thing, too.
*  Like, let's let go of all those stories for a second.
*  I'm not saying there aren't people burning candles to Malik.
*  I've never definitely are.
*  I've never met one.
*  I've seen the Bohemian Grove video.
*  Is that Malik?
*  Yes, that's the owl God.
*  When Alex Jones is just an hour on since no, it's Molleck.
*  They were talking about it.
*  Is it Molleck?
*  Is it Molleck?
*  Algar, according to Alex, John Ronson and Alex Jones, they snuck into Bohemian Grove.
*  This is when everybody was saying it was all bullshit.
*  And I say this many times and I'll say it some more.
*  Give me that later.
*  You got a friend.
*  Alex Jones.
*  He's he's made some mistakes and some big ones.
*  But he's also actually exposed some real shit and he owns up to the mistakes he's made.
*  They're not good.
*  He doesn't think they're good.
*  There's a thing about finding conspiracies everywhere that's not good for your brain.
*  I really believe this.
*  I think that if you go looking for those things and that's all you look for and you look from all time, you can get real paranoid and real crazy.
*  And then there's also a bunch of people that are trying to stop you from doing that because you do expose some crazy shit.
*  You know, he was talking about Epstein a long time ago.
*  A long time ago, he was saying there is a fucking island and they take all these rich politicians and some celebrities and they bang these kids.
*  And I was like, come on.
*  He was telling me this a long time ago.
*  So he's also the one who told me about Bohemian Grove.
*  Well, I actually watched it.
*  That's like I think this tape was actually made before I met him.
*  So he went and snuck in to this place where like former presidents go.
*  There's a photograph of it's Ronald Reagan with Herbert Walker Bush and a couple of other people all standing around.
*  And it's like these are the people that used to hang out at this place and they would put on robes and they would worship an hour.
*  God, our God.
*  And they would burn an effigy and they're playing and Alex snuck in and made video footage of this shit.
*  And then no one's denying that it's real.
*  This really did happen.
*  So they're in with these bankers and former presidents and they're dressed like druids.
*  Yes.
*  And some guy brings over something that it's an effigy that's supposed to be a body, a wrapped up effigy.
*  It's a bunch of sticks in a blanket, but it's like shaped like a body.
*  And they drop it on the fire and they're all worshiping an owl God.
*  Why is that bad?
*  Imagine if you saw those, if that's what your business is, just finding those things.
*  How crazy you think you get?
*  First of all, wait.
*  Then you add in vodka and head wounds.
*  Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
*  Wait, go to the vodka and head wounds part.
*  What's out Jones?
*  OK, I got you.
*  He had a lot of vodka and he had a bad head injury.
*  God damn it, man.
*  When I was in liberal arts school, man, there's this great teacher who changed my life, Sam Scoville.
*  And one of the things he taught was so beautiful.
*  He still teaches there.
*  One of the things he taught was figure out a way to take in all information and then filter out the shit that's not real and keep the real stuff.
*  And like, you know, Alex Jones is like, let's yeah.
*  Some of the stuff is real.
*  Take what's real and throw out the rest.
*  There's a good chunk of it that's real.
*  Look, I remember he was telling me that there's governments using chemicals that turn frogs gay.
*  I was like, what?
*  What are you talking about?
*  He goes, yes, he goes pesticides are turning frogs gay.
*  And I'm like, that can't be real.
*  No, there really is.
*  Is that true?
*  Yes, there's pesticides that change frogs genders.
*  What?
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  But some pesticide fucks with frogs genders.
*  That sucks.
*  Maybe it doesn't.
*  I mean, depends on the frog.
*  Maybe it's awesome for the frog.
*  Depends on the frog.
*  Frogs don't give a fuck because they've never been taught homophobia.
*  Why would they care?
*  They don't care who they fuck.
*  But there's a real thing that...
*  See if you can find that.
*  It's a pesticide that has some sort of an effect, an unintended effect on frogs genders.
*  Dude, that's another thing that people don't talk about.
*  Pesticides that have been used in like golf courses and like there's people who live around those.
*  That's a chemical dump.
*  Yeah, golf courses are fucked up.
*  Pesticide atrazine can turn male frogs into females.
*  Wow, cool.
*  So this is a fucking pesticide.
*  Berkeley News.
*  That changes the gender, or should I say the sex.
*  Is it the same thing?
*  What?
*  Sex and gender.
*  Hey, I'm not getting sucked into that fucking black hole, Rogan.
*  You can keep that shit to yourself.
*  But hey, I'll get sucked into another black hole.
*  Isn't that crazy though?
*  Yeah.
*  Before we get into that stuff, I want to say this real quick.
*  Okay.
*  Is that camera on me?
*  Friends at the Bohemian Grove.
*  Future friends, I should say.
*  I just want you to know.
*  I don't know much about you.
*  I know Alex Jones, you know, probably on vodka drinks.
*  I don't think he was then.
*  I think he was sober.
*  He started drinking after all.
*  Please don't fuck this up.
*  Sorry, sorry.
*  He had an infiltrator.
*  Look, I went to a summer camp.
*  We had bonfires.
*  We wore robes.
*  I mean, not like maybe what you do.
*  I just want to say, hey, come on, invite me, please.
*  I won't tell anybody anything.
*  I've heard you guys are pretty awesome.
*  Actually, what I've heard is the idea was to get a bunch of hardcore neocons together
*  and then mix some artists in, in the hopes that like having like brushing shoulders with
*  artists would in some way, shape or form loosen some people up a little bit.
*  And I've also heard you have a tram that connects campsites there to other campsites, meaning
*  you just get in the tram and suddenly you're hanging out with Dick Cheney.
*  Listen, I won't tell anybody.
*  I got a podcast.
*  I want you to tell Joe.
*  Let me in.
*  I'll worship Malik.
*  I won't worship Malik if it means hurting people, but I don't understand why people
*  are upset about fucking, by the way, that's exactly why.
*  What's wrong with worshipping?
*  Nothing.
*  This is the thing.
*  So excited.
*  This is the thing that I get confused about here.
*  Okay.
*  It's like in our country, we've got people who are Christian.
*  Yes.
*  And that's beautiful thing.
*  And I do love Jesus.
*  I was reading the book of Mark today regarding the parable of the sower.
*  And that being said, I don't think it's fair necessarily to tell people they can't worship
*  an owl or burn an effigy in front of an owl in some kind of symbolic magical ritual that
*  represents the disintegration of your negative energy or whatever it may be.
*  I really don't know.
*  But to me, that's the other problem that's happening right now is like superstition is
*  running rampant.
*  I'm friends with lots of witches.
*  I know a few Satanists.
*  I know a few people who are under the occult.
*  And I don't know a single one of them that would tolerate child abuse.
*  I don't know a single one that wouldn't kill somebody.
*  Some of them would kill people if they thought they were hurting kids and make it so that
*  nobody found the body.
*  Some of the Satanists I know, they would kill someone probably.
*  I don't know for sure.
*  I'm not trying to throw any Satanists under the bus, but I'm just saying like this idea
*  that we can't have alternate pagan religions in our country without immediately being associated
*  with human sacrifice or child abuse.
*  I think that goes against the American spirit.
*  Because people don't want to subscribe to your particular very popular global religion.
*  Doesn't necessarily implicate them in something that is truly a horror, which is human trafficking.
*  So to me, this is the problem.
*  It's like, man, we got to be a little bit more nuanced in our apprehend or in our conceptualization
*  of these people.
*  Again, I don't know what's going on at the fucking Bohemian Grove, but from what I've
*  heard, it's basically a summer camp for billionaires where they try to get artists in there to
*  loosen them up a little bit.
*  That's what I've heard.
*  I could be wrong.
*  Who told you this?
*  I honestly can't fucking say.
*  Hmm.
*  Hmm.
*  Interesting.
*  Look, man, I don't know.
*  And I know I've seen the video.
*  Bohemian Grove.
*  Have you seen it?
*  The ritual in front of the owl guy.
*  You've seen it?
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, go come with me to Burning Man.
*  And you will see that every 50 feet.
*  Look, I don't think it's that big of a deal.
*  I really don't.
*  If it involves hurting kids, it's a big deal.
*  And if these motherfuckers are doing anything that involves human sacrifice, hurting human
*  beings in any application of that, then it's the worst thing on earth.
*  And I'm so sorry that I said anything about it.
*  I don't think that's what this is.
*  I mean, obviously, what we're seeing is not that.
*  We don't know what else happens.
*  But what you're seeing is them burning sticks in front of this owl god.
*  And it's like this crazy, crazy speech they're given while it's going on.
*  It's really weird.
*  Hey, can we hear some of it?
*  The speech?
*  I don't know where the speech is in the video.
*  I found another video where they stabilized the footage.
*  It's like, but I mean, before before this, nobody really believed that.
*  Listen.
*  And now they're lighting the effigy on fire and everybody's cheering.
*  It looks fun.
*  Stanley Kubrick had this quote once to Nicole Kidman.
*  I think it was.
*  And they're working on Eyes Wide Shut.
*  See if you can find what she said about the elites that he had said.
*  I know I saved it.
*  I can find it if I have a chance to look at my laptop.
*  But it was something about him talking about the powers that run the world and that they
*  all have something on each other and that's how they all can stay together.
*  They'll compromise each other.
*  That's what Skull and Bones was about.
*  That's what all that stuff is about.
*  So he had a much more concise quote on that.
*  But when you see something like that, you go, well, maybe it's like fun that they do
*  it that nobody knows they do it.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Yeah.
*  Like maybe it's like one of those rituals where you get together, you have things, it's
*  hilarious and you both put your hoods on, you go out there and you burn the owl or you
*  burn the sticks in front of the owl.
*  And what's fun is that you're not supposed to be doing it.
*  And it's a secret, but nothing really is happening.
*  That's also on the table.
*  Yeah, it's possible.
*  But it's fucking weird, man.
*  That was weird.
*  Imagine if there was no Catholic Church.
*  Imagine if you are a billionaire.
*  That's what you're doing with your weekend.
*  But imagine if there's no Catholic Church and there was one video of a mass, right?
*  We would be like, what the fuck?
*  That's fucked up.
*  Imagine any religious ceremony if there was only one version of it, because I'm not trying
*  to reduce it to summer camp fun or even like fraternity games.
*  Who knows what it is, right?
*  We could, you can know what it is.
*  Yeah, they'd have to tell us.
*  But we just see something crazy.
*  But it's not evil.
*  I mean, what is it?
*  Well, for me, it's a question mark.
*  I don't really know.
*  I know that my tendency whenever I have a question mark is to assign malevolence to
*  it just out of a basic kind of weakness in my own bias.
*  If I don't know what a thing is, like when you're waiting for the doctor to call regarding
*  some scan they just did on you.
*  If you have the slightest fear of death or any kind of bias in you, then that space in
*  between when you...
*  Maybe we're overlooking this.
*  Maybe it's like their version of Renaissance fare.
*  And people just want to escape reality and pretend that they live with Moloch the owl
*  god and throw a fucking hood over your head and yes, please and peace be with you.
*  Yeah, I mean, it could be some kind of like pagan celebration.
*  It could be, right?
*  And if you look back at the history of paganism or hedonism or Terrence McKenna does such
*  a great job talking about the Elucidian mysteries and all these things that aren't really quite
*  as accessible as the main religions of the world.
*  All the religions of the world, they have this beautiful quality in them depending on
*  the religion.
*  And generally, one of the qualities that's so beautiful is a mechanism of self-forgiveness
*  and a mechanism of purification.
*  A general assessment of the human condition as being somewhat depraved.
*  How many...
*  Like the puking in ayahuasca, you're purging yourself from your darkness.
*  The confession booth in Catholicism.
*  Maybe you could say in Gnosticism, like true gnosis or in Buddhism, like connecting with
*  the actual reality versus your overlays of reality.
*  Or, you know, it goes on and on.
*  This is all within each one is this idea of like there's a way for us to ritualistically
*  create if you want to be a pure scientific materialist, a beautiful placebo effect that
*  gets you to drop some of your neurotic qualities or at the very least reset your intention
*  to make the world a better place.
*  And anything, whatever that...
*  I don't care what the fuck it is.
*  Whatever it may be, if that's what it's all about is a recognition like, man, you beat
*  yourself up every day.
*  You're so hard on yourself.
*  You beat yourself up for all the shit you did in the past.
*  And we live in a world right now where there's not much tolerance.
*  There's not much forgiveness.
*  And anything that allows a kind of like steam valve from which all that shit can get released.
*  So from this day forward, you're born again.
*  You're brand new.
*  I don't care if it's an owl.
*  Man, go if you think that's crazy.
*  Look at like Main Street Disneyland any night.
*  You've got some crazy shit to watch too.
*  In some people's entire lives, I'm not being like changed from like having a great night
*  anywhere.
*  So, you know, to me it's like ritual is not scary to me.
*  What's scary to me though is anything that objectifies humans, enslaves humans, hurts
*  kids.
*  Sacrifice.
*  Yeah, human sacrifice, any of that stuff.
*  And if that's what's really happening there, I truly don't know, then I completely apologize
*  for any defense of it.
*  It just sticks.
*  The question is, was it always just sticks?
*  Did it used to be people?
*  Did they used to sacrifice a person?
*  Did they stop doing it at one point in time?
*  One widely cited Nicole Kidman interview was made up by the fake news site News Punch.
*  You sons of bitches.
*  God damn it.
*  They got me.
*  They got you.
*  But again, does it say what the quote is?
*  Yeah.
*  What is the quote?
*  He said that Hollywood is run by pedophiles or something.
*  I found the Reddit page where it was put up.
*  God damn, they got me.
*  Glad I asked you.
*  Hey, you want to see something real creepy?
*  Jamie, may I ask you to look something up?
*  Look up the, there's a video of a van that was actually used for human trafficking.
*  I saw that.
*  That shit is chilling.
*  Terrifying.
*  And it's like, to me, it's like, man, if we're going to be, it is, there's anybody who is
*  at the helm of the ship that's fighting those motherfuckers right now, deserves medals.
*  And I hope that they never stop what they're doing.
*  I just want them to be very precise in their attacks.
*  That's all.
*  Don't dilute your position by getting caught up in something.
*  And again, I am not, I'm already going to get attacked for this saying like, don't get
*  worked for the blah, blah.
*  I don't.
*  I don't.
*  I'm a Buddhist and I go to Ram Dass retreats and Burning Man.
*  But if they invited me to the Bohemian Grove, I'd go.
*  And if I went there and I saw that-
*  I was going to say, Stanley Kubrick can keep a secret.
*  We can too.
*  Are you saying you would go to the Grove with me?
*  Yes.
*  That'd be awesome.
*  I won't tell anybody.
*  But you know, if you and I were invited there and we saw anything happening that was anything
*  to do with like what people-
*  I would think it would be a trap and they would be setting us up.
*  They would put on like some sort of fake thing just to make us look like fools.
*  So we talk about it on our podcast.
*  Do you know, man, if we ever do a movie together, that's the movie.
*  Like it should be all of your friends going to the Bohemian, get invited to the Bohemian
*  Grove.
*  Exactly.
*  Right?
*  Like I become friends with some guy who's like a banker who really likes comedy.
*  Yeah.
*  Right?
*  And then he gets drunk one night.
*  Like I know the Illuminati.
*  They're real.
*  The Bilderberg group, it's real.
*  Like what?
*  Yeah, man.
*  Jekyll Island.
*  They made the Federal Institute.
*  It's not even from America, man.
*  And you're like, what?
*  What?
*  And then this guy starts unraveling the tale of America.
*  Can I tell you something crazy?
*  With the Federal Reserve.
*  Yeah.
*  People in my family used to own parts of Jekyll Island.
*  Okay, tell the story of Jekyll Island because that's what I'm talking about.
*  If people don't know it.
*  Well, here's the problem.
*  I don't know the story.
*  Like I remember hearing some shit-
*  I have like two paragraphs in my head memorized.
*  I remember hearing people in my family had some claim on land there and that they sold
*  it and since then I was just kind of resentful because it's like they sold it for nothing
*  and like if they'd held onto it, like, you know, I would be at the fucking Bohemian Grove.
*  And so Jekyll Island's supposed to be the place where they invented the Federal Reserve,
*  right?
*  I went-
*  Isn't that it?
*  There's a great hotel-
*  Is that it, Jamie?
*  What does it say?
*  Listen, this all disclaimer-
*  Where all three of us are morons.
*  Yes!
*  Okay, this is not- that's one thing that drives me crazy.
*  There's one of the things about silencing people that are crazy online.
*  I can tell when someone's crazy and part of someone being crazy is you see these crazy
*  people and you go, oh, I think they might be crazy.
*  And then you look into it and you go, yeah, none of what they're saying makes sense.
*  They actually are crazy, but damn, that was pretty close.
*  Yeah, dude.
*  You gotta be- the thing about people saying things that other people disagree with when
*  they want to silence those people is you don't think that other people are smart as you.
*  You're thinking that's going to work on other people.
*  If someone's saying that the earth is flat and there's lizard people that control the
*  sunrise, if that was- you'd go, okay, you know what I'm saying?
*  It wouldn't work.
*  So why not let someone say it?
*  So if someone says it, it doesn't work on you.
*  But what are you worried about?
*  You're worried it's going to work on somebody else.
*  That's what you're worried about.
*  And that's the weird thing about COVID, because it's the one thing where you're not allowed
*  to do that anymore.
*  Because if you do anything that goes against the government bylines, anything that goes
*  against what the World Health Organization thinks you should do or CDC thinks you should
*  do, you get kicked off of YouTube.
*  You get silenced.
*  Everybody gets removed, whether you're right or wrong.
*  It's the one thing where you can't talk crazy.
*  You can talk crazy about the earth being hollow.
*  You can talk about beings that are made out of light that fly in and out of our consciousness.
*  That's responsible for all of our ideas.
*  You can talk about how there's an application that's coming in 2023.
*  It's right now being vetted by the NSA to make sure that we can use it so we can communicate
*  with the aliens.
*  You can have all these wacko videos where you're making shit up and no one cares.
*  But if you say that masks don't help and what we need to do is get healthier, they'll remove
*  you from YouTube.
*  Well, that's the fire in a crowded theater thing.
*  You can't yell fire in a crowded theater.
*  So, the problem with it to me is I have gone through every single stage of grief over YouTube.
*  Mask is a bad analogy.
*  Maybe a better analogy is you can open up businesses as long as you do it carefully.
*  I used to love YouTube, man.
*  I used to love it.
*  I still love it.
*  What I loved about it in the old days, I still love it.
*  I still go on every day.
*  But what I loved about it in the old days is what you're saying.
*  No one's putting a cork in the champagne bottle.
*  It was wild.
*  It was a museum of madness.
*  And what was even better is the algorithm was working in your favor.
*  So it's like punching hollow earth.
*  That's going to take you all the way to some crazy deep shit.
*  Never once in all my explorations on the early days of YouTube was I like, this could be
*  real.
*  It was more like, wow, look at how all the different versions of reality that people
*  are processing.
*  And it was a joy.
*  I think what happened probably is people realized, God, what we've got, you talk about this stuff
*  times bad.
*  The nightmare, and it will happen, when primates figure out how to use friction to make fire.
*  You talk about this.
*  Yes.
*  And that's a nightmare for the planet.
*  You think the fucking shit's bad now.
*  Wait till the chimps figure out guns.
*  Yeah.
*  Just fire.
*  Just fire.
*  Just figure out how to make their own fire.
*  Think of the protohominated shift in the figuring out.
*  That's a really good point.
*  This is trouble.
*  That's a really good point.
*  Imagine how many people died in the beginning of discovering fire.
*  How many experiments were done with fire?
*  How many things were just set on fire?
*  How many people just burned?
*  I can eat it.
*  I bet you can eat it.
*  Let me eat it.
*  I'll get its energy in my body.
*  Holy fuck, he melted his face off.
*  Similarly, with the internet, we have this new fire.
*  People who are in the conduits of the fire are having this really rotten come to Jesus
*  moment where they're like ... Because I think a lot of these, especially if you look in
*  the Silicon Valley, these people are freaks.
*  The people making technology, they're nuts.
*  I've seen you that Steve Jobs thing with him in a commune or whatever.
*  These people are fucking crazy.
*  I think they're recognizing that ... It's like, okay.
*  The internet is the new fire.
*  Yeah.
*  They're starting to understand that because of them, because of their intentional manipulative
*  coding, because of their deep study of BF Skinner and behaviorism, they've produced
*  this hyper-seductive, semi-sentient information dispersal device that is driving people who
*  don't have the immune system to data that you're supposed to naturally get from school
*  crazy.
*  That's what's happening.
*  People are going nuts because it's like ...
*  Add that with the addictive quality of technology.
*  Those two things together.
*  The addictive quality of just looking at your phone and getting information off your phone
*  and then add it to all this stuff that you're saying.
*  Yeah, man.
*  It's a crazy combination.
*  I think Google and YouTube and as much as ... I do think censorship's ... I would hate
*  to be in anybody's position there because on one hand, you're looking at a very liberal,
*  very beautiful idea, which is everyone should be allowed to say whatever they want to say.
*  Then it's meeting like, well, but what about these hyper-charismatic, seductive people
*  who like Hitler?
*  You know what I mean?
*  Why are you running to this terrible place of like ... Also, we know that there's people
*  who don't quite have the ability to discern what's real from what's not.
*  This is my beef.
*  We allow some of that because we allow evangelists.
*  I heard Robert Tilden on one of his shows.
*  He goes, every time you write a check to me, Satan gets a black eye.
*  It's good.
*  Dude, it was in my act for a while.
*  I was like, where's my checkbook?
*  You Satan, you son of a bitch.
*  Imagine you could steal money that way.
*  Look, man, I don't ... But you know what I'm saying?
*  Yeah, I do know exactly what you're saying and it's like this type of con artistry ... Also,
*  cigarettes.
*  It's like this type of con artistry, generally it seems like there's some kind of grandfather
*  clause on specific styles of ... Of fev ... Of thievery and murder.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Cigarettes ... They know they're killing people.
*  Imagine if you had bubble gum that killed a half a million people a year.
*  It's like bubble gum, but people are just dying.
*  Stop selling that shit.
*  Stop, what the fuck are you doing?
*  What are you doing?
*  You're seeing ... Well, people have a right to chew their bubble gum.
*  A lot of people like bubbles.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  Imagine if that's all it was.
*  It's like you chewing bubbles makes you happy and everybody's dying of cancer.
*  This company's making $500 billion a year or something.
*  How much do they make on cigarettes?
*  Let's guess.
*  Let's guess.
*  What do you think the ... By the way, I want to say this before.
*  This is a box of cigars.
*  Mike Binder gave me that and he gave me that one over there.
*  Another box of cigars.
*  I'm not anti-tobacco in any way, shape, or form.
*  I'm a pro-free choice person.
*  You absolutely should be able to smoke cigarettes and I think you absolutely should be able
*  to sell them because I don't want to roll my own.
*  If I want a cigarette as a grown fucking man, I want to be able to have a cigarette.
*  But, cigarettes do kill a half a million people in this country every year.
*  They're going to die anyway.
*  They just kill them early or they die directly because of diseases that you can get from
*  smoking cigarettes.
*  And their kids get sick.
*  Dude, the worst man.
*  Kids that live in ... Greg Fitzsimmons.
*  He has lung problems to this day because his parents chain smoked and they lived in Massachusetts
*  so it's cold.
*  Did your parents smoke?
*  My mom did but she quit when I was really young.
*  She quit when I was like six I think.
*  Did you ever ... Were you in the car with her when she smoked?
*  I must have been.
*  Were the windows up?
*  Well, we lived in New Jersey so it was cold in the winter.
*  I'm sure I was.
*  I don't think she smoked in the car with her kids though.
*  Dude, do you mind if I have a little more of this?
*  I'll fucking have a little drink it all, man.
*  Thank you.
*  It's so good.
*  I remember Fletcher, North Carolina, middle of winter.
*  You'd go down and wait for the bus.
*  My friend Jimmy Fink, I think it was Jimmy Fink, his mom would let us get in her car
*  to wait for the bus.
*  It was wonderful.
*  Very sweet.
*  I'm sorry Jimmy if you're out there.
*  I know we haven't talked in a long time.
*  I still love you though.
*  I'm sorry if it's not you and I'm getting confused here.
*  I just remember she smoked and there was smoke in the car.
*  My dad smoked.
*  I would ride in the car with him on trips and he would smoke and you'd breathe in the
*  smoke.
*  To me, and again, this is always the problem which is clearly there has to be some regulatory
*  principle in the world.
*  If there are people who steal watches, that means there's going to be groups of people
*  who get together and talk about better ways to steal watches.
*  If there's groups of people who get together and talk about better ways to steal watches
*  and then we create a way for them to form a thing called a corporation.
*  You need to regulate that.
*  That's why we need regulation.
*  But then the problem is who does the regulating?
*  What's the incentive for you to regulate?
*  Is there a financial incentive?
*  Do regulators get paid an exorbitant amount of money?
*  Let's say you and I start a vape pen company that is a nicotine vape pen.
*  I like what you're thinking.
*  Start pouring money into people who are against tobacco knowing if we can make tobacco illegal
*  but keep the vape pens legal, we're going to become the new tobacco.
*  Here's the thing about vape pens.
*  This is the real thing about vape pens.
*  Some of them are not good for you at all.
*  They're real bad for you.
*  There's a connection they're saying now between COVID and kids that vape.
*  Kids that vape dying of COVID are getting serious COVID problems.
*  But it makes sense.
*  I have a friend who's got a kid that sucks on one of them things all day long.
*  Just vapes constantly.
*  Kids vape.
*  These kids that vape all the time.
*  The oils that you're taking into your lungs, that's not healthy.
*  The idea that it's not cigarettes so it's healthy.
*  No.
*  There's a lot of evidence that points to some of those companies that make those oils.
*  They don't do it in a way where there's different kinds of oils.
*  And they have different reactions to the heat.
*  And some of them are like apparent.
*  Am I saying this right?
*  Let's check on this.
*  What is the problem with the different types of vapes?
*  Because I think there was one type of oil that they're using.
*  Because they have to somehow another mix.
*  The same with the marijuana ones.
*  You have to mix this stuff with a THC.
*  And some sort of chemical.
*  But it's different.
*  You can do it organically.
*  I know they've done it with coconut oil.
*  I know they've done it with things like that.
*  It's the same way with hash, man.
*  I think it's like the way people make hash varies.
*  And some people there's a healthy way to make it.
*  And obviously the way using the most chemicals is the cheapest.
*  And so there's certain types of hash that you I think are derived.
*  And again, my friends out there, look, I don't know.
*  But it's something like butane.
*  Someone told me this at a marijuana store.
*  I can't remember what.
*  But yeah, man, it's like cheaper.
*  I think the concern is the oil.
*  What kind of oil?
*  I know there's one guy that was selling them that was MCT oil.
*  OK, here it is.
*  Authorities in the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
*  still aren't sure what's causing the dangerous trend.
*  But theories range from issues with vegetable oil in vape juice to the idea that doctors
*  are just now taking note of a problem that's been percolating for a long time.
*  So OK, so that was a speculation that people were using.
*  Like if you try to cook, OK, and you try to like sear a steak and you do it with olive
*  oil, you're going to fuck it up because olive oil, it's not like something that you really
*  sear something with.
*  Like you put olive oil and you don't want to get that hot.
*  Yeah. Olive oil is more something that you'd like to saute with.
*  But other oils like avocado oil or or beef fat like that stuff is amazing.
*  Because you can get it really fucking hot and it has a very, very high temperature where
*  it turns to smoke.
*  So it's like healthier for you.
*  The idea.
*  So if you're misting this stuff into your lungs, you don't want it burnt.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  You want something that's more.
*  So I would imagine if you're using these cheap.
*  This is again, I'm a moron.
*  I'm not a scientist, but we're doing science.
*  If you use vape pen with like some really shitty canola oil and you get in that burnt
*  spray inside your lungs, like that could be terrible for you.
*  You got some fucking GMO corn syrup bullshit in your lungs.
*  Yeah. You know, the haunting thing, man, you go to a pharmacy, right.
*  And you watch as the pharmacist dispenses the drugs, how careful he is.
*  Right. Like they are like so careful in their administration of these pills because they
*  know if like for one second you give someone Xanax when they were supposed to get penicillin,
*  you killed somebody.
*  Right. So you have to be very careful.
*  But like, meanwhile, look at us right now, Joe.
*  Did you do a test on that bottle of booze or these?
*  I didn't even. I honestly, it was embarrassing.
*  I'm like, I don't know how to light this blunt.
*  But then like you don't know how to smoke in something called dad grass.
*  I don't know what's in that. I don't do any studies here.
*  I just for people who love Steely Dan.
*  I do love Steely Dan.
*  I do too.
*  They have some great fucking songs.
*  You know what I mean? I'm saying like the general like in America and anywhere, the
*  general sense is I'm going to eat it if you give it to me, especially if it's in a colorful
*  box. And then you're like, it must be OK.
*  And the problem is, is like sometimes it's not OK.
*  Look at thalamide.
*  Like, you know, look at like the big moments in history when it was shown like actually
*  sometimes the stuff we sell you.
*  Is that thalidomide?
*  Thalidomide. Yeah.
*  Thalidomide.
*  The stuff that gave kids birth defects.
*  Defects. Yeah. Or what was that radioactive shit they painted on watches?
*  Oh my God, dude.
*  We did a whole show where we talked about all the diseases that people got from iridium.
*  Was that what it was, Jamie?
*  What was the radium?
*  Radium or iridium?
*  They were using it for all kinds of things and people's faces were rotting off.
*  Yeah. Literally, they have holes in their face.
*  They were painting it on watches because it would make it would glow.
*  It's cool looking. But so similarly, it's like they were using it for makeup, I think.
*  Yeah. And here we have the Internet.
*  Here we have the fucking Internet.
*  Suddenly we have a hyper a way to like super connect with every single person on the
*  planet, but not just connect with every person on the planet.
*  We have an artificial intelligence based on a neural network.
*  I don't understand how it works.
*  Suggesting who you should connect with.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's like is the Internet the Thalidomide, technological Thalidomide?
*  Are we looking at?
*  I think so.
*  Is that what we were dealing with right now?
*  And like, I think we're on a spaceship and we haven't quite figured out how to slow it
*  down or where the brakes are or how to go left or right.
*  Yeah. But the spaceship is being propelled by thoughts and ideas and social media and
*  world events and drugs and sex and politics and power and control.
*  And it's all just hurling through space.
*  And while while it's all happened, we haven't quite figured out where the brakes are or
*  what's the best way to be harmonious with each other.
*  So we're all in this constant battle for control thinking that once we get in control,
*  we're going to set this fucking ship straight and everybody's going to be cool.
*  We're going to be finally we're going to get along because you're side one.
*  But you're still going to have half the fucking country that hates you, half the country
*  that doesn't agree with you, half the country that has to like be really tolerant in order
*  to engage you in any of your ideas and admit that you're right.
*  Right. And this is what we're doing.
*  And it's not real. It's not real.
*  I don't think it's real. I think a lot of the people that have ideas in one way, if they
*  could just talk to people in in in the realm of the area where they have disagreement,
*  I bet they could work it out.
*  I think the problem is more people not talking than anything.
*  Joe, tell me about the spaceship idea.
*  Because I don't think you're saying something like knowing you like I know you.
*  I wonder if you're saying that metaphorically or like if there's it is metaphorically, but
*  it's also actual.
*  We are on a spaceship, whether we like it or not.
*  We're spinning a thousand miles an hour and we're driving through infinity at a pace
*  that if you if it was small and it passed by you, you would go, holy fuck.
*  Yeah. What was it?
*  If the earth was the size of a baseball and it whipped by you in real time, the way it's
*  moving through the universe, you'd be like, fuck.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what the earth's doing.
*  But the earth is huge.
*  Yeah, it's huge.
*  And yet it's tiny and it's surrounded by things that are enormous.
*  Got a sun that's a million times bigger than us.
*  Just a fireball in the sky that all life on earth depends on a very clear space between
*  earth and the sun, a perfect balance, perfect balance between this unstoppable heat and
*  just keep the water melted.
*  Don't boil it, man.
*  And we're hurling through infinity.
*  And while we're doing that, we're trying to pick who gets to be the leader to steal your
*  tax money. We're trying to tell you, you can't go to a beauty shop because I don't want you
*  getting a cough.
*  That's right.
*  We're trying to tell people, stay home, stay home.
*  Trump's trying to kill America.
*  Yep.
*  It's the wrong approach.
*  Like the approach they're making, the approach they should make, it should be all about
*  positivity.
*  You know, everybody who's voting knows who Trump is.
*  Everybody knows about the riots.
*  Everybody knows about everybody knows all those things.
*  Yeah.
*  Talk about what you want to do.
*  Yeah.
*  Talk about what you want to do.
*  Don't talk about how bad the orange guy is.
*  Tell me what you want to do.
*  Don't use woke lingo.
*  Don't you fucking do it.
*  Don't you do it.
*  Tell me.
*  Tell me.
*  Yeah.
*  For real.
*  Don't bullshit me.
*  Tell me what you can do to fix this.
*  Right.
*  Just that.
*  Tell me you want to bring everybody together.
*  Just that.
*  Everybody.
*  Right wing, left wing.
*  We've got to make concessions.
*  We've got to figure out like where we meet in the middle.
*  There's much more that we agree with than we don't agree.
*  Yeah.
*  Much more.
*  Let's concentrate on that stuff.
*  And let's be nice about this other shit.
*  Yeah.
*  That's right.
*  That's it.
*  Yes.
*  Look, it sounds like, you know, what you're saying, it's beautiful.
*  And that's one of the qualities is beautiful.
*  But it's simple.
*  That's what I saw.
*  I got to see the Dalai Lama speak once.
*  And it's like, wow, you in person?
*  No.
*  And he was at like an event.
*  Right.
*  But you were in the audience.
*  Yeah, I was in the audience.
*  So he was there.
*  He was there with his translator.
*  It was beautiful, man.
*  A real like the vibe in the in the room was so sweet.
*  And like, you know, to go back to what we were talking about earlier,
*  some people will tell you a stupid thing, like a thing on the side of a cereal box.
*  Like, I apologize for that.
*  Be kinder for.
*  I'm so sorry.
*  But, you know, I could tell you, Joe, you know what the world needs.
*  Love.
*  I do like cliches, though.
*  Sometimes.
*  Sometimes they're accurate.
*  Depends on who it's coming from, who the cliches coming from.
*  If they're sincere.
*  So the Dalai Lama is on stage and he says, you can always be kinder.
*  And it was like you could feel this wave rushing out of him.
*  I mean, it was like the essence of Buddhism just rushing out.
*  Everyone simultaneously thinking like, yeah, he's right.
*  And it transcends politics.
*  It transcends geopolitics.
*  And that that is why what you're saying is so beautiful, because it's the same thing,
*  which is like, you know, like this planet, we're so lucky to be on a planet going
*  that fast and like we're so lucky to get a chance of little people in the time.
*  We're not here that long.
*  I think this COVID thing gives us an opportunity to realize how lucky we really are.
*  I do, too.
*  I mean, for the people that are struggling right now financially or struggling
*  with their health, it doesn't register with you.
*  And I'm sorry about that.
*  But I think for the people that aren't
*  fucked by this, there is a moment where we get to realize like, OK, we were taking this for granted.
*  We thought we had all this thing wired in.
*  You didn't have a wire.
*  I mean, they got rid of the Senate.
*  What was the pandemic?
*  There was a pen.
*  The White House decided like a year before Corona decided to get rid of the pandemic.
*  What was the response?
*  What was the actual?
*  No, like he got rid of the whole office based on it.
*  They dissolved it.
*  Just imagine.
*  Imagine if like this is an asteroid.
*  What when's it coming?
*  Forty years.
*  Fire everybody. Fire everyone.
*  We're fucked. Just fire everybody.
*  The more tests, the more sick people we have.
*  Stop the tests.
*  Just fuck.
*  They did that for real.
*  I know. I know.
*  They so so from that, what did they teach us?
*  They taught us that we have to depend on each other right now, not the state.
*  Well, I think they should give people the opportunity to do what they want to do.
*  I really say this too much.
*  I say it in almost every show, but you can't tell people they can't work.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  You should. You're not smart enough for you to say that you that the only thing
*  that matters is whether or not these people expose themselves to the virus.
*  At this point, I think that's ridiculous.
*  But can I tell you something else matters?
*  OK, I'm sorry. I'm sorry to cut you off.
*  But they have to acknowledge that something else matters.
*  They have to acknowledge that the financial problems that people are going
*  through are almost insurmountable.
*  They have to acknowledge that.
*  And that destroys a lot of people.
*  That creates a lot of depression, creates a lot of suicide, creates a lot of drug
*  abuse, creates a lot of turmoil and a lot of mental health issues.
*  That's a fact.
*  So we're we're taking away people's sovereignty.
*  Look, man, if you want to that was another great American tradition.
*  If you want to kill yourself, well, you can do it with so many other ways.
*  You're welcome to kill yourself.
*  BMX flipping no one's going to stop you from doing flips with your motorbike.
*  That was the whole point.
*  I mean, that's like remember when everything got safe?
*  Like the whole point, there was a time when everything was like Algonzo.
*  And the problem is you're spreading it.
*  Right. So it's not just you and your motorbike.
*  It's you crash your motorbike into a crowd of people.
*  That is that's one of the problems.
*  There's a lot of that's a good way of looking at it, honestly.
*  But the bigger to me, the bigger that is a problem.
*  And it's fucked.
*  The bigger problem is, OK, so you own an Applebee's or whatever.
*  Right. And suddenly the government's like, OK, everyone can go back to work,
*  but no one solved the problem.
*  You, the owner of the Applebee's calls the general manager like, hey, dude,
*  get the waiters, wait staff back.
*  We're open it up.
*  You're not going to be there.
*  You're going to have the general manager come in and you're going to have the wait
*  staff come in. Now, the wait staff have been living off of unemployment
*  benefits supplied by the federal government that sometimes are more than
*  like what they were making at the place.
*  That's not a bad thing.
*  But all of a sudden, what happened is prior to a true reduction of this pandemic
*  that can kill you most of the time, it doesn't.
*  But you might be the one who steps on the landmine.
*  All of a sudden, they just decided, well, we got the economy needs to work.
*  So now your unemployment benefits get cut off and you have to go
*  back to work, but they haven't solved the problem yet.
*  So you become the person who has to bear the weight of the failed
*  approach to the disease.
*  And that's why it's fucked up to sit.
*  Yes, you're right.
*  Man, my friend runs a new California barber shop in Echo Park.
*  Brian, he's one of my best.
*  He started off as my barber.
*  He became my best friend.
*  He's one of the coolest people I know.
*  And like I like it, like one of the reasons I want to leave L.A.
*  is because that shop can't open.
*  That's where I used to go to get my beard trimmed in my head.
*  But it wasn't just that was the hangout.
*  It's a real barber shop.
*  And it was you have these great conversations.
*  You be people. He like he's like gotten me out.
*  Like he's gotten me into a sublet that I once when I needed to be in L.A.
*  for a little bit.
*  One of the sad things about being bald,
*  I never really developed a relationship with the barber shop.
*  And by the time I shaved my head, it was too late.
*  Now, that's a good thing to do.
*  You can get like a nice straight razor shave.
*  Yeah, you know, there's you don't go to a bar.
*  There's something about that, right?
*  It's the best for girls with girls.
*  It's acknowledged that a lot of ladies like beauty salons,
*  they like to get their nails done.
*  They like to get their pedicures.
*  They enjoy it. Yeah, I really like.
*  Yeah, that's all been shut down here.
*  Right. Right.
*  And like it sucks because that I loved going there.
*  And it's like, but, you know, the thing is like a lot of people,
*  it's not time to go back to work because if there is a true risk
*  that from making minimum wage, you're going to get a disease
*  that probably won't kill you because you're a waiter Applebee's.
*  You're probably going to be OK.
*  You're taking your vitamins, but you might be living with your aunt
*  who has Alzheimer's disease and you're going to fucking kill her
*  because you picked up a little bit of it.
*  And the reason you're going to kill her is because you had to go back to work
*  because your benefits got cut off.
*  So it's like this is the this is why it's a very complex,
*  fucked up problem that really we it's like, yes, for me, a person, I'm doing great.
*  Do I want everything open?
*  I want to go to guitar.
*  I want to guitar center is open, but I want to stand in line.
*  I want to go into it.
*  I want everything to be the way it was.
*  I'm probably going to be OK.
*  But this is again, it's like this is a complex problem.
*  I don't buy into the idea that the whole thing is a scam.
*  I think we've got exactly what that asshole.
*  Why does the asshole too much booze that is a guy who is actually
*  the opposite of an asshole on your show, I'm like calling a doctor an asshole.
*  Remember the Joe Rogan questions, everything the virologist who told us
*  there's going to be another great pandemic six years ago.
*  We should I've talked about this before, but we should tell people.
*  Duncan and I were in Galveston, Texas,
*  and we went to the Center for Disease Control and went to the very place where
*  they experiment on Ebola and all these hair, crazy diseases that kill you instantly.
*  And Duncan and I were in this building and we were watching like we walked
*  through a window that takes you there's like another window behind that.
*  That's like this plexiglass sealed room.
*  And they have like space suits on and tubes.
*  And I'm like, hold on, hold on.
*  So there's some shit in there that can kill everybody.
*  Like 100 percent.
*  Like it's right there and they were doing tests on it.
*  And so these people are wearing like
*  space suits and they're walking around with these horrific world killing diseases.
*  Yeah, man. And remember we missed the flight.
*  Yeah, we did. We missed the flight.
*  We had to get there.
*  We were just high as fuck at the airport talking.
*  The flight took off.
*  Duncan and I lost total track of time.
*  We were barbecued.
*  Did we take edibles?
*  Dude, I don't remember.
*  We were so high.
*  We might have took edibles.
*  We might have took my custom is to take an edible in the car.
*  My custom.
*  That's because it takes time to get to the airport.
*  And by the time you get to the airport,
*  the absurdity of it all just kicks in full steam because it's like I have no control
*  at the airport. The airport is a place where you just want to give up complete control.
*  You're super duper duper high.
*  That's a fun ride.
*  So you and I were just sitting down talking about life.
*  And that plane went, shoo.
*  And we're like, where's the plane?
*  Like the plane left. Like, what?
*  We didn't just miss the plane by like 10 minutes, like 40 minutes.
*  It was the ultimate dumb stoner moment.
*  Like if we were not our way to film a television show, we would have looked like
*  the biggest losers. We looked like losers anyway.
*  But we had fun and we took one in the morning and we got there with very little sleep.
*  We made it.
*  But being in like the Galveston, Texas Centers for Disease Control with like very
*  little difference. This is the this is done.
*  This is Duncan went to some preppers.
*  This is one that I really love because I didn't get a chance to be with you.
*  So I got to watch it, you know, like from the clips and see what it was like when
*  you went to that. You get to be at that.
*  I was doing something else.
*  We were trying to film two things at the same time, I think that time.
*  You know what, man, I was really like not a norbat, because I love doing the show.
*  But I'm like, of course he doesn't show up to this motherfucker.
*  It's like suddenly I end up deep in a deep in a cave.
*  Totally done it.
*  But I think it was when like there was a
*  bunch of things that we're trying to film when we're short on time.
*  So we couldn't do things together.
*  But remember, we did the skinwalker ranch one together.
*  You were so pissed.
*  It was so fake.
*  Oh, there was the problem was when we got there, right, we got there.
*  We heard this preposterous story from this person who threw a cigarette on the
*  ground after he set you up 100 percent.
*  Yeah, because I'm like, this is a moron.
*  He threw a cigarette on the ground in the forest.
*  This is a moron.
*  Like we drove here for and he's lying.
*  We're here.
*  The moron who's lying.
*  I'm like, oh, great, great.
*  I actually asked him to pick it up.
*  Come on, man.
*  I remember that moment, dude.
*  But that's just like you can't.
*  It's a beautiful Utah forest.
*  You smoke a cigarette and you throw it down.
*  You step on it like you're not my kind of person.
*  Joe, here's the reason you're so American.
*  You really do believe in a utopian ideal.
*  And Joe Rogan questions everything for real.
*  Both of us. This is what I realized years after we both had a sense in our heart.
*  That we might really find proof of something big.
*  And we went into it with that attitude.
*  We did.
*  But we were so high.
*  We believe what we were saying.
*  Dude, that's the funniest thing about it.
*  It's like, you know, most people, when they do these shows, they're not going into it
*  thinking like I'm actually going to uncover something.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  They don't go into it thinking they're going to uncover something.
*  They go into it thinking this is all a
*  bunch of bullshit and I'm going to do so.
*  I'm going to be like, or maybe they think
*  maybe it's real or whatever.
*  But the main thing is they they don't they talk they they pretend it's real.
*  That's the thing. They didn't.
*  We didn't pretend it's real.
*  And we also went into it like two guys who were more high during a show.
*  You will not find.
*  It's true.
*  You will not find the entire barbecue.
*  Look at the big plate.
*  I was barbecue.
*  We were so high, dude.
*  And this guy, we don't need to blow this guy's spot up.
*  He's a poor fellow.
*  Look at me, my hipster face.
*  Oh, boy.
*  Listen, people love maybe he believes what he's saying.
*  Maybe maybe all that stuff that they were telling us, they really truly believe.
*  But they were talking about like bulletproof
*  wolves that appear out of mist and all this stuff.
*  To me, that moment was when the show went south.
*  And what was really funny was like
*  this is the last thing the sci fi network wanted was for you to like
*  actually begin to like realize that maybe we're not going to find UFOs.
*  And they started getting unhappy, I think, with the situation.
*  Oh, they did get unhappy.
*  There was actually a conversation where they're like, is he trying to debunk
*  these things because they have all these shows on like UFOs and all these shows
*  and ghosts, and then they have this comedian asshole with his asshole buddy.
*  And they're both high as fuck.
*  And like, this is so fake.
*  We're like, this is so.
*  But we wanted to know.
*  We wanted to know.
*  We wanted to know if it was real or if it was.
*  Remember the alien artifacts part?
*  Do you remember that part?
*  There was someone who collected all these alien little bits of
*  dust and metal. You don't remember it, probably.
*  I remember. I remember that because I was already given up on that point.
*  I had noticed a pad, unfortunately, and I feel real bad.
*  But it was it was really a personal thing
*  because I was dealing with my own nonsense, my own inclivity, my own inclination to
*  believe ridiculous stories even today, like with the Pentagon story about them
*  having recovered a craft not made from this world.
*  Please don't let it be a misquote.
*  And I don't want to read the misquote, man.
*  I don't.
*  So I know that there's a real pull to believing in bullshit.
*  There's a real pull to like manipulating the actual facts of Roswell so that it
*  appears the government absolutely 100 percent colluded to keep the alien crash
*  from the general public. There's no way it could be a weather balloon.
*  I don't know if that's right, man, because I know it in myself, because I see it in
*  myself, I see that dirty little asshole that wants to believe in Bigfoot, that
*  stupid fuck, they're like, hey, hey, hey, maybe it's a bear.
*  Maybe it's not a lost monkey species, but I want to believe so bad.
*  So I don't think that's a dirty asshole.
*  But this is me.
*  This is me. I've worked on this.
*  Right. This is something that I've spent a lot of time thinking about.
*  There's a lot of people out there that just lie,
*  thinking about anything.
*  But they the same way they want to believe, too.
*  They want to believe in UFOs.
*  They want to believe in Bigfoot.
*  They want to believe in all these things.
*  They want to believe. Yeah.
*  And it's not their fault.
*  This is they grew up in a fucked up town and their friends were probably all drunk
*  by the time they were four.
*  And the whole thing's a mess.
*  And here they are stuck in this situation when they're just making shit up.
*  And here you and I are standing there going, I don't think this guy ever really
*  was kidnapped by Bigfoot.
*  Yeah.
*  And we get to hear these ridiculous stories.
*  There was too many of a man.
*  Everybody we talked to had this eye,
*  like real obvious psychological bend to them.
*  There was always like,
*  everyone and no one had a steady chassis, no one who you were talking to.
*  Right. Yes.
*  You remember the fucking Bigfoot guy that said he would chop his pinky off
*  to find out if Bigfoot was real? He was a professor.
*  He was a professor.
*  I forget. We had him on the podcast.
*  We had the foot, the footprint.
*  See if you get Dr.
*  Melcher, right?
*  Meldrum. Yes.
*  Thank you. Jamie's the wizard.
*  Dr. Meldrum. Dr.
*  Meldrum.
*  He said he would cut his finger off to find out Bigfoot was real.
*  Would you cut your finger off?
*  No, I don't care.
*  Listen, I hope it's not real.
*  I hope it's real.
*  I don't care.
*  What would you cut?
*  It would be awesome.
*  What data set would you cut your finger off?
*  I would cut my finger off to know if there was an intelligent design to
*  creation on Earth.
*  I would give them the very tip of my pinky for that.
*  But then what happens?
*  And you run around with this information you can't share with anybody and you're
*  freaked out all day.
*  Well, no. Then I try to contact that thing in a more intense way.
*  I mean, like the tip of the pinky is not a bad thing to get rid of.
*  Yeah.
*  Knowing whether there's like, again, you have to like...
*  It's a week.
*  First of all, what kind of computer are you working with that you're going to have
*  to take your pinky and drop it in to get truth out of it?
*  It's a stupid computer.
*  You shouldn't trust it.
*  If you ever want to feel what it's like to be like three again,
*  make your thumb wrestle your pinky.
*  Your pinky is like, shit, you have no power in your pinky.
*  Your pinky is so weak.
*  That's what it's like to be like a three year old straining against your older
*  brother. Get off me.
*  Get off me, asshole.
*  You got a pinky.
*  That's right.
*  What a bullshit little digit.
*  What does that thing get used for?
*  What does it get used for?
*  I dislocated both of them.
*  You dislocated them?
*  Your pinky?
*  They don't match up.
*  Oh, dude.
*  Oh, damn.
*  Oh, that's weird.
*  So one go.
*  Oh, that makes sense.
*  I'm in all sorts of shit.
*  You use it for holding wine.
*  You need it to like extend when you're drinking.
*  Yes.
*  Look, man. Very important.
*  I think that...
*  Don't you like...
*  I hurt my pinky doing that.
*  Wrestling with my thumb.
*  Like legitimately, it hurts now.
*  It's so weak.
*  It's so weak.
*  But I do so much with my hands.
*  I'm sure there's some chin ups.
*  There's some reason for it.
*  So many kettlebell grips.
*  And it's mostly these other fingers.
*  Even when you draw back a bow,
*  my bow, my release doesn't even have a pinky thing.
*  I draw back with these fingers.
*  This bitch ass just hangs around for the ride.
*  You're so mean to your pinky.
*  Why do you do that to your pinky?
*  I love my pinkies.
*  Yeah.
*  I love them.
*  They're great. I don't want to miss them.
*  But think of the name itself.
*  It's weird how weak it is compared to all the other digits you have.
*  And they named it a pinky.
*  Like the whole thing is like messed up.
*  The whole thing does sound like it is a very like we.
*  The name pinky itself is like,
*  I will fuck you up with this finger.
*  This finger right here is strong as fuck.
*  This finger gets a hold of shit.
*  This is a strong finger.
*  This is a bullshit finger that's not hurting anybody.
*  We got all in the same hand.
*  Listen, everyone belongs on the hand.
*  Like we imagine pinky.
*  If you were as strong physically as your small toe.
*  Wow, that's great.
*  That's life.
*  Just everything can fuck you up.
*  Every pebble is murderous.
*  Every jumping off stairs.
*  The wrong way you stub your toe.
*  You want to die if you're that's who you are.
*  You are as strong as your little baby toe.
*  Your little baby toe has zero power.
*  Grab your little baby toe and like wrestle with it.
*  It has nothing.
*  It's a mess. It's a baby.
*  Yeah. They call it a baby toe because it's like a baby.
*  It's stronger than your baby toe.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Well, it's a bitch ass little limb.
*  That's yeah, that's the funny thing about the human sentient projection into time.
*  It's like we're probably like the little toe of the universe.
*  You know, like we have just enough realization to know that we're something
*  where this hilarious intersection of like, you know, meat and what appear like a real
*  feeling of like, you know, I do feel like bias aside, if there isn't a part of you
*  that hasn't like really come to the conclusion, there seems to be a part of you
*  that doesn't get touched by reality.
*  Some eternal part of you that has met time and space.
*  I feel like most people get that sense.
*  Kids feel that they know that they just actually know it.
*  But, you know, to me, I think maybe what we are in this little temporary,
*  whatever it may be, whether it's an aquarium, whether it's a training facility,
*  I think it's probably a training facility, you know, like, I don't think it's that.
*  I think it's a process.
*  And I think the process has to be tumultuous, because if it's not, nothing gets done.
*  I think the struggles have to exist because if there's only harmony and peace,
*  everybody gets stagnant. That's right.
*  There's there's a steady push towards ultimate technological innovation.
*  That's the steadiest push.
*  If you look at the human race in terms of like what it makes, like what does it do?
*  At the end of the day, if you have these bees and they have all this different
*  thing, all these different social things they do and all these different things
*  they do for covering territory and ground and all these different aspects of being
*  a bee and laying the larva inside the honeycomb.
*  But what do they do? They make honey.
*  They make honey, bitch. That's what they do.
*  They make honey. What do we do? We make robots.
*  We make computers.
*  We make technology and we make it better every fucking year.
*  We don't make better laws every year.
*  Like, no, no, no, we don't revise that shit.
*  We got stuff written with fucking ink from charcoal.
*  You know, that's like the archive somewhere.
*  Yeah. What we do is we make better shit every year.
*  We make better shit.
*  And our goal is just keep making better shit.
*  And I'm obsessed with better shit.
*  I'm obsessed with like cell phones and I'm obsessed.
*  I love like unbox therapy or any any of those shows.
*  Marcus Brownlee, when they doing these
*  unboxed videos and talking about the newest, latest and greatest technology
*  and they're showing these 120 Hertz screens and these fucking cameras with a
*  100x optical zoom.
*  Like, wow. Amazing.
*  But what are we doing?
*  We're moving ourselves closer and closer to some kind of technological superiority.
*  And along the way, we're losing our humanity.
*  And that's the weirdest, most ironic part of it.
*  Along the way of we've never been in a greater technological era.
*  If you look in terms of the things that are consumer electronics to get released
*  right now, whether it's laptops or iPhones or Samsung Note 20s or whatever the fuck
*  they are, these things are insane.
*  Right. Never been in a time like this before.
*  This is like this is peaked.
*  Also, when we ever had a time where there's riots in every city, every city,
*  all across the country, and it's a lot of it is things that most people agree with.
*  Right.
*  You say especially if you say something like Black Lives Matter.
*  I want to let's have a vote.
*  How many people don't agree with that statement?
*  Just forget about what the this everybody was all the Marxist thing.
*  And these people, they want to destroy the nuclear family.
*  I don't know if they do or they don't.
*  Most people I bet who are who are a part of that movement don't even know what that means.
*  They don't know all that shit.
*  Right. They just don't want people to get killed by cops.
*  That's it. That's it.
*  And it's not like Michael Che has a great bit about it where it says like,
*  that's not even asking a lot like matters like Black Lives Matter, just matters.
*  Like and people like, man, I don't know.
*  Yeah, it's this is the strangest time for us socially because of covid.
*  This is the strangest time because of the economy.
*  The strangest time because Trump is president.
*  Yeah, there's chaos.
*  And the guy who's running against him is older than him.
*  And you're like, this is madness.
*  Like what is what is happening here?
*  And no one knows when the fuck people are going to be able to go back to work.
*  And there's all this chaos and all this anxiety.
*  It's all happening together at once.
*  I know, man. I know.
*  And that's what this is.
*  You know, this is what I love.
*  Like I work my I work with a meditation teacher, David Nick, and he's he's brilliant.
*  And one of the things he tells me and I really
*  this is an example of how cool he is.
*  This is when all the New York Times shit came out about the aliens.
*  I call him. I'm like, David, New York Times, aliens.
*  And he's like, wow.
*  And then his response was Duncan.
*  Where do you think thoughts come from?
*  Do you think they are.
*  Born from something.
*  That was his response to me telling about aliens was the question.
*  Where do you think thoughts come from?
*  Are thoughts like born like the way?
*  Well, it's a good question.
*  It's a great question.
*  I still haven't figured it out.
*  I've asked if ideas were aliens.
*  I think that if you think about a cell phone, right?
*  I mean, obviously, there's a collaborative effort involving a lot of people that
*  understand all sorts of different aspects of technology.
*  But ultimately, it has to be an idea.
*  Someone has to have the idea to come up the original Motorola phone, the fucking
*  brick, and then they had the idea to innovate and keep getting better and better.
*  And these ideas eventually lead to this thing that can open your car door,
*  turn your lights on your house, you can FaceTime your kids.
*  It's a crazy, crazy, crazy thing.
*  And it's all coming out of ideas.
*  Where do they come from?
*  That's the question.
*  The question is, is it an inherent part of being a human being?
*  Because like all other aspects of human beings, we are not a single organism.
*  We are a biosphere.
*  The human organism is essentially an ecosystem.
*  The human organism has untold trillions of bacteria in our gut.
*  Right. We have it on our skin.
*  We have all sorts of weird life forms that we live synergistically in this space as a person.
*  Why wouldn't we think ideas would be a part of that?
*  Yeah, right. They might very well be a part of that.
*  And the healthier your mind is, the more you're able to live with ideas,
*  the more you're able to bounce ideas around, like ideas as a life form, just like their health.
*  Like if you use antibacterial soap all over your body all the time, you get sick.
*  Yeah, right. You get fucking rashes and shit because your body, it kills all the good bacteria too.
*  Yeah, it's like, man, I love the question because like one of my favorite acid trips was
*  I was like listening to Beethoven. Oh, wow.
*  Oh, man. And I like I like some.
*  I don't know how it happened, but like I was like I like had a little like
*  this beautiful girl, she was so beautiful.
*  And like I was at her house.
*  We're listening to Beethoven. I was tripping.
*  And I started thinking and it was just like romantic and cool.
*  But then I started thinking like.
*  Somebody thought of this and then I started thinking.
*  But where did it where did it come from?
*  Like if they thought of it, what was it before they thought of it?
*  Like this didn't exist before Beethoven.
*  So where was it?
*  And and I remember that as I was like thinking that on on the best still to this day,
*  the best acid I ever had.
*  What's the difference?
*  I'm not much of an acid connoisseur.
*  What's the difference between really good acid and mediocre acid?
*  Apparently it has something to do with the mechanism of production.
*  The way it's. Yeah.
*  Which is like listen to like Kid Charlamagne by Steely Dan.
*  It's all about it's all about one of the great
*  Owsley, one of the great LSD chemists of our time, who I met his wife.
*  And I asked her this question like, why is some why is acid not as good as it used
*  to be in the 60s? And her response was people are perfectionists anymore, honey.
*  That was literally the response.
*  We will sell no wine before its time.
*  Yeah, it was like I don't I don't I don't know.
*  But well, that's what I mean.
*  That's the thing that we want with whiskey.
*  Like that's one of the things about Buffalo Trace who bottles this stuff.
*  Yeah, they they taste everything.
*  They say that.
*  And if it's not good, they don't they they're connoisseurs.
*  Yeah, we want.
*  So I understand that you would want that with acid.
*  The problem is that acid is illegal.
*  That's the real problem.
*  The problem is you have some fucking space daddy,
*  some dude who's at the top of the fucking helm of this spaceship as it hurls
*  through infinity. They don't want you.
*  They have to be space daddy.
*  If it's the president of the United States, that's space daddy.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  The president of the United States is space daddy.
*  He is the fucking leader of the greatest army the world's ever known.
*  He's at the helm of the global empire.
*  That's space daddy. And we're going through space.
*  So if we are a spaceship, the president of the United States is space daddy.
*  It's Captain Kirk. He has to be.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Well, it's not the space daddy that's made LSD illegal.
*  What's made LSD illegal was an earlier space daddy.
*  Yes, 1970 space daddy tried to disband the civil rights movement.
*  Yeah. They're making drugs like all schedule one drugs.
*  That space daddy did it.
*  But the good news is, at least to the very least,
*  they're letting people look at what it is and how it affects the brain.
*  And they're beginning to understand that everything we all knew.
*  There's no point getting resentful about it, but we all knew this.
*  We all knew this.
*  But we're all like it's being validated.
*  Thank God. And it's very sweet because it's a healing drug,
*  especially when used and with therapy, you know, and it's healing.
*  It's a very powerful, beautiful, wonderful thing that exists on the planet
*  that anyone could have access to, especially if they like stop this
*  ridiculous prohibition and lifted the prohibition.
*  I'm not saying like don't prohibit heroin, prohibit heroin,
*  prohibit methamphetamine, but even even
*  regulation.
*  The problem is I don't want anybody doing it, but I should be able to tell you not
*  to. That's the problem. That really is the problem.
*  The problem is I shouldn't be able to tell you not to.
*  That's right. And certainly like it's too slippery.
*  But you shouldn't be able to like it shouldn't be a five year mandatory
*  minimum for LSD. I mean, that's madness.
*  No, that's madness. And it really does heal people.
*  It's a healing. So, look, you do your own like do your research.
*  Look into it. Have you read Chaos?
*  No. The Tom O'Neill book?
*  No. Oh, my God, dude.
*  One of my favorite podcasts over the last year I did was with Tom O'Neill.
*  And he's Greg Fitzsimmons neighbor.
*  He was Greg Fitzsimmons neighbor for like 20 years.
*  Wow.
*  The whole time he was Greg's neighbor, he was working on this book.
*  Now, Greg never brings someone to me.
*  Never, never says, dude, you got to have this guy as a guest ever.
*  So out of all these years, Greg's like, dude, this guy you need to have on.
*  This guy researched Charles Manson for 20 fucking years.
*  He was originally just writing an article.
*  He was writing an article.
*  But as he's writing this article, he starts uncovering more and more crazy shit.
*  And he goes deeper and deeper into this work.
*  Twenty fucking years later, he finally puts out this book.
*  And this book is basically detailing a CIA LSD operation where Charles Manson was
*  getting dosed in prison, allegedly, and he was being treated at this free clinic
*  in Haight-Ashbury that ran for more than 50 years and closed three months after
*  the book was released.
*  Damn.
*  They ran this fucking free clinic where they were dosing hippies and they were
*  testing them. They ran Operation Midnight Climax.
*  It was all part of MKUltra.
*  He's detailing step by step all these people that were directly involved in not
*  just Charles Manson, but in fucking Jack Ruby and all these other political
*  figures in history. And it's like, what in the fuck?
*  All these mind control, C-I-A-L-S-D experiments that were real.
*  And Charles Manson was a part of that.
*  Yeah. Allegedly.
*  And Charles Manson was dosing up these hippies and not taking it himself.
*  He was using the techniques that they allegedly used on him for like seven years
*  while he was in federal penitentiary.
*  What a mess. This is the problem with like any time power.
*  You gotta read this book, man.
*  Look, I've read a lot about the MKUltra stuff.
*  This one's different.
*  It's just specifically what they did to allow Manson to run free and build these
*  murderous hippies and get them high on LSD.
*  This was all a part of this thing to sort of demonize the antiwar movement.
*  There was all these different strategies they were doing to demonize the antiwar
*  movement. Yeah, because you take LSD and war seems ridiculous.
*  You take LSD and money seems ridiculous.
*  You take LSD and anything that doesn't have to do with love seems insane.
*  And the problem is, is like, you know, and this is, you know,
*  all the psychedelic bullshit aside, if you just look at like basic Buddhism 101,
*  I was in some of the prior to this pandemic, my favorite conversations were
*  an Uber's man and I'm riding this Uber and this Uber driver who's clearly a
*  Buddhist, he's got a Buddhist statue on his like dashboard.
*  And like, so we start talking about Buddhism
*  and we're talking about it.
*  And he said the coolest thing I've ever heard of regarding Buddhism, which is he's
*  like, do you know how you look at letters
*  and you think that they're a language?
*  What are you before that?
*  It was so cool.
*  Holy shit.
*  Thank God there's people like that in the world.
*  I know. Well, that's a true Buddhist.
*  That's a true missionary.
*  But but in that in LSD will return you to that state.
*  So it will drop you under all of your apps that are running on the operating
*  system of your consciousness for a little bit.
*  Some people hate that because they like so identify with the apps.
*  There's a moment they can't like cling to the app that they become this like,
*  you know, thing before the language, which is why some people on a lot of
*  assets can't even they can't talk.
*  They talk like babies. Yeah.
*  But but what's happening is you're encountering like
*  original sentience prior to conditioning.
*  And that's dangerous to
*  any kind of power structure.
*  Like if I'm trying to implement a hierarchy,
*  I depend on your consciousness flowing into these rivulets that are language,
*  morality, ethics, the entire structure of whatever I'm like trying to like
*  tell you is the way things are.
*  And if I can do that, then I can own you
*  because suddenly your morality isn't real morality.
*  Your ethics aren't real ethics.
*  Your idea of what's right isn't necessarily what's right.
*  It's what's right for capitalism, what's right for communism,
*  what's right for this or that.
*  If I can tell you if I can make your moral compass point away from service in any
*  way, shape or form, I can control you forever.
*  And so anything that gets in the way of that is really like generally like
*  delegitimize by power structures. I mean, it makes sense.
*  The problem is you're dealing with a combination of morality
*  and a game and the game is trying to make money.
*  Like when you have numbers, you know, I'm reading this book right now.
*  I'm listening to it on tape.
*  It's called Irresistible.
*  I keep forgetting this dude's name who who wrote the book, but I'm listening to it
*  on audiobook. It's Adam Alter.
*  And it's all about addictions.
*  It's all about particularly how addictive games are insanely addictive,
*  like games like Tetris and Candy Crush,
*  insanely addictive where they've made billions and billions of dollars on
*  Candy Crush. Yeah, it's crazy.
*  People can't put it down like farmland made fucking unbelievable amounts of money.
*  Crazy. There's something about numbers.
*  Like you see you look at your bank account.
*  I've got fifteen thousand dollars in the bank.
*  I can't believe this. That's pretty fucking good.
*  I remember when I was broke and then you go, you know what?
*  It would be great if I had 50.
*  I'd just like to get 20 this year.
*  I'm just going to cut back on going out to eat.
*  I'm going to do that. I'm going to put five away.
*  And then you're like, you know what? I need to make more.
*  That's what I need to do. I need to make more money.
*  I want to put in some overtime.
*  I'm going to talk to the boss. I'm going to look.
*  I'm dedicated. I don't give a fuck.
*  A lot of people get tired. I don't get tired, dude.
*  I am dedicated to this fucking job and I want to move up in this company.
*  And the boss is like, yes, come on aboard, slave man.
*  You get to work for the corporation.
*  Eighteen hours a day. Great.
*  You're getting paid well.
*  Don't get me wrong. You're not really a slave.
*  But what you are is a slave to your own idea of what success is.
*  You've got you're a slave to the idea that numbers equate success.
*  Yeah. You don't notice, man.
*  You don't notice. You don't notice.
*  You get used to everywhere you live.
*  It's nice if you live in a place that's safe.
*  After that, I'm telling you, you don't notice.
*  You know what you notice?
*  You notice when your friends are around you and you're enjoying each other's
*  company and you're laughing and having fun.
*  You notice those things.
*  Yeah. You notice if you do something and people enjoy it.
*  You notice if you have a good interaction with someone at a store,
*  like they go, no, you.
*  And then you go, no, you.
*  And then you both smile and laugh and everybody's you haven't.
*  That's those are nice moments, man. We have those.
*  We still have those like you let somebody in front of you and they give you
*  the peace and you give them the thumbs up.
*  And these moments are still here, man.
*  They're more than they're not.
*  It's not like everybody just stabbing everybody everywhere you look.
*  Most of the interactions that people have with each other all over the place are positive.
*  That's right. It's a very small amount.
*  The problem is these small amounts making on fucking YouTube.
*  And then that's all I can watch.
*  There you go.
*  I just watch these fucking people in Portland beat the shit out of each other
*  and kick some guy in the head when he's sitting on his.
*  He's sitting down when he apparently drove too close to these Antifa guys.
*  And they made him get out of the car and they're searching his belongings.
*  This guy runs up behind him and kicks him in the head and knocks him unconscious.
*  I'm like, God damn it.
*  Horrible. Not most people most of the time.
*  And the problem is that's what everybody's going to pay attention to.
*  That's what everybody's going to share on Facebook and Instagram.
*  I saw that fucking video in my timeline like 30 times.
*  But this is what I love about humanity.
*  Is like if you strip away the story
*  and you see a person getting kicked in the head, honestly, man, like I don't care.
*  Like in general, like I don't care what that guy is.
*  Don't kick him in the head.
*  Here's the problem, dude.
*  It's a natural inclination to want to fight the opposite of your tribe.
*  Yeah.
*  And when you're 16 years old or however old that kid was,
*  the kid who kicked that guy in the head, he looked young to me.
*  I could have easily done that when I was 16 easily.
*  I was so dumb.
*  If I was in the streets at 16, he was dumb.
*  And we pulled some guy out of his car that someone said tried to run us over.
*  And the guy sitting there easily, me or any of the people I hung out with,
*  would have punched that guy or kicked that guy.
*  That's the compassion.
*  Normal. It's normal.
*  Yeah. The problem is the tribal war that we have going on.
*  That's the problem.
*  That's but what you just said, that's the truth.
*  That's the truth.
*  And it's compassionate.
*  This this is a stupid kid.
*  He was a fucking I think he worked at the airport, whatever the fuck he was.
*  This is a stupid kid.
*  And what he did is wrong.
*  He got caught up in the wave of violence and the mob mentality.
*  It's normal. We have to figure out.
*  Listen, man, here's the thing.
*  We must discover you're not first of all, you're not going to find this on the map.
*  I like going off the map, but there's not a map for this.
*  So that's deliberating to me.
*  We got to get off the map.
*  Number one, we got to get off the map.
*  Like first, everyone, this is what's so crazy.
*  People are really legitimately tuning
*  into it like the like human trafficking in the United States.
*  It's a big business.
*  It's one of the biggest businesses, actually.
*  Human trafficking.
*  Yeah, I was reading a post today that somebody sent me.
*  I don't know if it's verified or real or whatever.
*  Where a girl was saying that she was headed to a bathroom at a gas station somewhere.
*  And someone she noticed that someone was had their camera turned around.
*  So they said the selfie camera on with their face time.
*  And they pointed to this lady and they said, what about her?
*  She heard her say, what about her?
*  You like her?
*  And the girl looked at them and the lady turned and looked at her.
*  And she ran back to her car, got in their car.
*  And the guy who was with them went and ran up to the side of the car like she
*  thinks they were trying to kidnap 100 percent they were.
*  And that that happens.
*  That happens. That happens.
*  That's a real business.
*  This is not like this is not a fucking story.
*  This is not a magazine article where people are someone who wrote some fiction.
*  This is right.
*  And the funny thing, not funny, but what's ironic about the sudden horror at human
*  trafficking is a lot of the very same people who are fighting against this thing
*  that they're realizing is happening in the country simultaneously don't want to
*  look back into the history of the United States, which was 100 percent based on
*  human trafficking, 100 percent.
*  Our country's foundation is human trafficking.
*  They fucking kidnapped black people and made them work for free.
*  And somewhere in between that horror and now people have gotten this delusion that
*  that stopped. It didn't stop.
*  Our country is was literally founded.
*  George Washington.
*  Did you know this was the number one slaveholder in Virginia, wherever the fuck he
*  was, he was the number one slave.
*  Supposedly his wooden teeth thing.
*  It was slave teeth.
*  Yeah. He was the number one slave holder.
*  Yeah. Did he have wooden gums?
*  Is that what it was? I don't know.
*  The whole wooden teeth thing was a replacement of the truth, which is this
*  motherfucker was a human trafficker.
*  So people try to like they try to revise.
*  So the idea is like, you know, let's look at this.
*  Look at this. Washington's dentures were
*  likely sourced from the teeth of slaves.
*  Sourced. There you go.
*  They're going to say sourced.
*  That wasn't sourced.
*  They were ripped out of the fucking mouth of human hostages.
*  Don't say sourced.
*  I source avocados to my fucking Mexican restaurant.
*  I don't source teeth, motherfucker.
*  Why would you use that language?
*  Why would you use that?
*  Yeah, it's not sourced.
*  Go back to that, Jamie. Can I read the rest of it?
*  Records at Mount Vernon show that he bought teeth from slaves.
*  Brought them. But that's records.
*  Who knows if the slaves actually got the money?
*  The poor enslaved had been selling teeth as a means of making money since the
*  Middle Ages, which were sold as dentures or implants to those of financial means.
*  Either way, you know, Jeffrey Epstein,
*  Jeffrey Epstein source teeth from some of the young girls he was fucking.
*  And it was actually common for the young girls to sell their teeth for money.
*  Like it's that that right there,
*  that right there is the root of the fucking problem, which is like this
*  country, George Washington was a human trafficker who had in his mouth
*  the teeth of people that were kidnapped, that he was making work for free.
*  This makes Dahmer look like a fucking poor scout.
*  Can you imagine if like at this quote,
*  according to George Washington's ledger on May 8th, 1784,
*  he paid six pounds, two shillings to Negroes for nine teeth on account of Dr.
*  LeMoyne. So he paid six pounds, two shillings.
*  I don't know how much that is.
*  Who cares?
*  For nine teeth.
*  So this says.
*  Does this say he's paying it to the slaves?
*  Actually, he says they don't know if they were slaves or not.
*  Probably paid it to the doctor to extract it.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  But it wasn't what.
*  So there were free black men that lived in America.
*  But what was the percentage versus slaves and free men?
*  Who cares?
*  The main thing is this asshole who's in statues everywhere was a kidnapper who
*  like took teeth out of people's mouths and put it in his own mouth.
*  That's fucked up.
*  And so like everybody's fucked up in our all of our all of our holidays.
*  Columbus was one of the worst people of all time.
*  Yeah.
*  So this whole like when people are defending the statues, it's like, shut the fuck up.
*  But here's the thing, man.
*  Should you allow people to just pull down the statues?
*  Really? Yep.
*  What do you think? Because do you think?
*  Here's what I think.
*  What if there were Jeffrey Dahmer statues all over L.A.?
*  No, you make a good point.
*  But what maybe we should educate people on why you feel so strongly about like
*  the George Washington statue or even the Thomas Jefferson statue.
*  A lot of people are arguing that Thomas Jefferson, that, you know, he's a piece of shit.
*  We shouldn't respect him either.
*  Do you do you think that all those statues should come down or do you think it's
*  more of an imperative for us to understand that
*  in the world of 1776 or in the world of whenever when did Washington get here?
*  What was George Washington's first years in America?
*  I'm not in any way, shape or form giving anyone a free pass on owning slaves.
*  I don't think anybody thinks you're doing that, man.
*  That's all I'm saying.
*  Anybody thinks that about you?
*  But what I am saying is I think human beings up until he was born in Virginia.
*  Oh, he was born in America.
*  Powerful. George Washington, one of the first real Americans.
*  1656.
*  That's it. Fuck it.
*  I'm getting a George Washington tattoo.
*  Joe, I mean, what's wrong with you?
*  He's American.
*  No, look, can I get the statue question?
*  This is what I think. OK, either take the statue down or or put around it
*  the number of slaves he had built statues for all the slaves yet.
*  So George Washington had 4000 slaves.
*  There needs to be a field of slave statues
*  around the George Washington statue that you have to walk through to get to the
*  George Washington statue or just pull it down.
*  You know what? It's easier to pull it down.
*  No, no, no, no, no. You're right, though.
*  Have the slaves and have some of them missing teeth because they sold it to them
*  because they don't.
*  We'd have to find out if you really bought
*  teeth from slaves or just regular folks who needed money.
*  Just have the whole story there.
*  Like, that's all. Just have those sorts of people.
*  What you're saying is perfect.
*  You're saying it's perfect.
*  Like if you're going to have a guy who victimized.
*  I mean, everybody did it back then.
*  Everybody of wealth did it.
*  It was a normal thing to do to have people that you owned as crazy as that sounds to
*  us, dude. I think that the world before mass communication, before the post office
*  and certainly before any kind of boat travel, when everyone was just either on
*  foot or on horses was undeniably.
*  Impossible for us to understand because they were so savage.
*  There was very few rules.
*  People were just dying of syphilis and
*  every other fucking disease that came around the bend, whether it was the flu
*  or the plague, there was no sanitation.
*  Everyone was a rapist.
*  It was just a wild, barely human thing that would occasionally paint cool things
*  and write things down and compose music, but lived in a savage environment
*  that's almost unrecognizable for us today.
*  I don't look and again, man, like I'm presenting a counterpoint to you.
*  I don't want people to prey upon me for the counterpoint saying,
*  oh, woe, Duncan had a baby, got all woke.
*  But I do want to present a counterpoint with the intention of like,
*  let's look at that, maybe that is actually part of the conditioning,
*  which is like, so if your country is based on human trafficking,
*  which to this day is happening.
*  Well, this country is based on human trafficking.
*  This country is based on and it's also based on human sacrifice.
*  It's also based on us killing the people that were here first.
*  That's right.
*  And we've been at war for 92 percent of our history.
*  And many of those wars are based on nothing.
*  So people are up in arms about the Bohemian Grove.
*  But it's like, give me a fucking break.
*  Look at Vietnam. That's human sacrifice.
*  There was money to be made from killing people and they made money.
*  Right. So we have a country that's based on human trafficking and human sacrifice.
*  Nobody wants to talk about it.
*  The idea is the exact same thing that all abusers do to people they've abused.
*  They want you to, number one, forget it.
*  And if you start remembering it, they tell you you're crazy or that you're fucked up.
*  So the idea is that like the world prior to the United States was a savage world.
*  Savage. Africa was not savage.
*  These were very advanced people.
*  But because like the Europeans were savage, were brutal people,
*  they went in there and fucking just started chopping people up.
*  These are people who had a natural, innate trust for other humans.
*  And they were like, put your hand out, slap, go get some gold or I'll cut your other one off.
*  That's what they did when they came here to North America.
*  It was Hills Have Eyes level.
*  So the Hills Have Eyes roll into all indigenous cultures.
*  They're in tune with the earth.
*  When shit gets weird, they move.
*  Look, I'm not saying.
*  Here's the thing. I've been spending the last six months deeply engrossed in Native
*  American books and they weren't that nice.
*  Not at all, dude. They ate each other.
*  The Nez Perce were like practicing cannibals.
*  The Nez Perce.
*  Yeah, the Nez Perce Indians were practicing cannibals.
*  OK, listen, man.
*  The Comanches killed everybody. They were brutal.
*  They killed everybody. They killed each other.
*  All right. They killed Native Americans.
*  They would. Their main thing was raiding.
*  They'd raid tribes and steal and kill and murder and rape.
*  The idea I've heard and this may not be I didn't look into it.
*  I apologize to the people who told me
*  about this idea because I wish I'd researched it more.
*  But I'm going to put it out there is that Africa was a was a really ancient culture
*  that was Africa's where Egypt is.
*  Yes. Exactly.
*  That's what people don't recognize.
*  And people were sending people there to get educated before slavery even started.
*  Before they burned the Library of Alexandria,
*  that was the place where everybody would go to learn.
*  Yes. And so we fucking went in there and just wreaked havoc.
*  Not us. It wasn't us.
*  We can't say we.
*  I'm sorry.
*  North Carolina. I love that I burped when I was born in New Jersey.
*  We can't say we.
*  You made it. You made a very profound point.
*  I burped.
*  But we didn't do it.
*  No, I don't. I don't mean we.
*  I don't mean we.
*  I'm not saying like I'm directly connected.
*  I'm just saying, like, for me, it's like the any time I get around any situation
*  where someone is making it so I can't say the truth, I get really annoyed.
*  Yes.
*  Which is why your comic.
*  It freaks me out. Yes.
*  And it freaks me out.
*  And so the reason that the whole, like,
*  the whatever the particular movement is, like when Trump is it like the Mount
*  Rushmore and that's Lakota, right?
*  That's like sacred land.
*  That's like sacred land.
*  But like they went in there and they chopped up a mountain with a bunch of
*  slave owners faces and Trump's like, this is the best mountain on earth.
*  It's like it looks better before you put the human traffickers on it.
*  How about the fucking hilarity of him
*  suggesting that his face should be on it just to rile people up?
*  Yeah, there's some part of you as a comic that has to appreciate that.
*  I'm sorry, Joe. I'm going to admit that's true.
*  And when I saw that he was suggesting
*  that his name should be on Mount Everest, I or not at Mount Everest Mount Rushmore.
*  I was I was thinking immediately like, oh, my God, he's moving them into checkmate.
*  Dude, look at my fucking Twitter.
*  I've been like seven different personalities
*  designed to rile people up over the last month.
*  That's all you do with this QAnon thing.
*  Jamie was hoping you would come in as your QAnon character.
*  It's fine. Look, no.
*  But like, does that should that person be president?
*  No, but listen, but that's hilarious.
*  In this madness with all this crazy, there's no such thing as gender world.
*  For a guy to come around and say, I want to put my face on Mount Rushmore.
*  Like this is part of that that I like.
*  Well, listen, I'm going to be honest.
*  I'm not a fan of his lack of empathy.
*  That's what beautiful that's what's beautiful about you is you're not afraid
*  to admit something that I think is really important to admit, which is like,
*  dude, there are like there are there's a continuum of reality.
*  And there's swaths of that continuum that are amazing.
*  Like, I don't know if you've ever been
*  in a situation where like maybe you're in a kind of like relationship.
*  It's not great.
*  But there's a piece of that relationship
*  that is so fucking hot and so sexy and so beautiful in the midst of all the madness
*  that it almost like makes the madness make sense.
*  Right. That's a that's a or certainly like there's certain like substances I imbibe
*  that if you look at what they do to my body, it's like terrible.
*  But like that sliver of whatever it is is great.
*  So anyway, what I love that you're not afraid of doing is like putting out there
*  like, look, man, it's not like people are one thing.
*  But here's the thing, too.
*  I'm not a willing victim of gaslighting.
*  You can't you can't do that to me.
*  Right. I'm not interested.
*  You know, I don't need anything from you.
*  I'm not interested in you gaslighting me.
*  I know when someone's putting on a show.
*  I had an email from a guy who I like
*  who told me to stop talking about Joe Biden because all the problems are
*  because he has a stutter, I'm like, listen, man, when you're 74
*  or however old he is, he's older than that.
*  Right. The wheels come off, man, on everybody.
*  Right. I I don't feel as sharp at 53 as I did at 33.
*  How about that?
*  Yeah. The reality is there's days if I'm not on top of my fucking game,
*  I get real spacey. Yeah.
*  What happens in 25 years?
*  Come on, man.
*  Are we pretending that we live forever?
*  You we need young, vibrant, robust people with a lot of energy
*  who are also advanced thinkers.
*  And right now they don't have any one of those people in the race.
*  We got craziness in the race.
*  No, you know, man, like the thing with Biden is like
*  forget about like the problem, like I'm voting for fucking Biden.
*  You know, suck my dick. I'm voting for Biden.
*  Do we have to do that?
*  Are you going to do it anyway?
*  I'll tell you not suck your dick.
*  And why can't I get a blowjob on top of it?
*  It seems greedy.
*  It would be nice.
*  Look, I'm sorry to be aggressive, man.
*  This this liquor, it like it's bringing out something.
*  That's what I love about whiskey.
*  Whiskey has been responsible for some of my favorite conversations.
*  Look, man, shout out to Buffalo Trace.
*  I like the reality of the situation is like Biden.
*  I don't like his policy regarding drugs.
*  And I'm very resentful of a lot of the things he's done.
*  And I'm also very resentful of the fact that that's what I'm like being.
*  That's the binary that I'm being forced to like contend with here.
*  That's the resentment, right?
*  Is that we only have these two sanctioned choices.
*  And if you're a good person who doesn't
*  want people to die in the streets, you have to vote blue.
*  That's it. Period.
*  That's it. And the initial phases of it, when I was trying to like,
*  I was hoping Bernie would be the fucking front runner.
*  And I'm like, I fuck Bernie up, dude.
*  Bernie got attached to some jokes.
*  What do you mean?
*  Bernie came on my podcast and I did a very lukewarm endorsement of Bernie.
*  Look, I can't do stand up right now.
*  So I'll just tell you this. Bernie did this very lukewarm.
*  I did a lukewarm.
*  I said, I'll probably vote.
*  I had my friend Barry Weiss on from the New York Times.
*  And she said, who are you going to vote for?
*  I said, I'll probably vote for Bernie.
*  I said, he makes sense. I like what he stands for.
*  The guy has been rock solid his whole life.
*  He's always believed it would be good to have a change where someone gets
*  into office, but this guy really believes in justice.
*  He's not greedy.
*  He's not beholden to corporations.
*  Well, they ran with that.
*  And then all these people that were in competition with Bernie started pulling
*  that I've said on the podcast, drunk, high as fuck.
*  Stand up comedy, put it in.
*  So annoying. Put it in quotes.
*  I remember that. And there was one of them.
*  I read this article that was like on a real a real newspaper
*  where in quotes it said he believes that
*  lesbians lack the lower back muscles to fuck a woman correctly.
*  What? This is a piece of my act.
*  It was a bit.
*  It was a bit about a conversation that I had at a bar.
*  I was with a friend of mine at a bar.
*  And this lady who's really aggressive,
*  who's making out with a girlfriend, and she yells over at us.
*  She goes, sorry, boys.
*  She only likes girls.
*  And I got my own dick.
*  She says this to us.
*  Yeah. So I go, where is it?
*  And she goes, it's a strap on.
*  And I said, having a strap on and thinking it's a dick is like having a lighter
*  and thinking you're a dragon.
*  Plus, everyone knows that lesbians lack the proper lower back muscles to fuck a woman correctly.
*  It was like I was in this sparring match, this verbal sparring match with this crazy lady.
*  That's what I said.
*  You can't just take that part out and put it in quotes and say,
*  that's what I really believe that lesbians lack the proper lower back muscles
*  to be in a loving relationship with another woman who's also a lesbian.
*  That's not what I said, bitch.
*  I can't trust you on anything.
*  How am I going to trust you with Russia or climate change or anything?
*  You lie about jokes. Right.
*  Because they didn't want a guy who wasn't beholden to the system.
*  So there was two people that I was interested in.
*  Tulsi Gabbard, who's a she's been a congresswoman for six years.
*  I love her. She's she served overseas twice.
*  Rock solid.
*  She's a real leader.
*  And they didn't want to have nothing to do with her.
*  You know, Tulsi is a plant.
*  The Hare Krishnas.
*  Good. Good.
*  I hope they get in.
*  Let's give it a chance.
*  Maybe they're right. They seen those Hare Krishnas.
*  I mean, I'm like really eating my ass here because like there was a period
*  where I'm like, you know what, fuck this.
*  I'm not going to let the fucking Democratic Party shove this motherfucker
*  who's like was like pro all these.
*  What happens if he dies?
*  Kamala becomes president.
*  And then does she have to get a new vice president?
*  Who does she get?
*  She would have to get a vice president.
*  AOC because you don't have to be a certain age to be vice president.
*  I love AOC.
*  I don't give a fuck what anybody says about her.
*  She's wonderful. I love her.
*  She's awesome.
*  Eat me alive.
*  I don't care. Look at me.
*  Who cares?
*  I think she's awesome.
*  I love her so much.
*  And I'm going to get shit for it, too.
*  But I think the errors that she makes, she makes because she has this idea
*  that she's trying to do good.
*  I really believe that she is also 30.
*  Yeah. How fucking dumb were you when you were 30?
*  Right. One of the things about Bridget Phetasy is hilarious.
*  Bridget Phetasy is amazing.
*  What happened here?
*  You have to be 35 to be vice president.
*  Sorry, AOC. Hang in there in the wings, baby.
*  We will vote for you, AOC.
*  We'll pick you up in term two.
*  I will vote for you.
*  I think she's trying to do good.
*  But Bridget Phetasy, who's one of my favorite people to talk to,
*  she said that when she read a diary that she wrote or a journal she wrote when she
*  was 24, she's like, Jesus Christ, I was AOC.
*  And now she's like much more of a centrist.
*  In fact, she's always mocking woke shit.
*  Right.
*  And she's like, but I was like full on woke when I was 24.
*  I get it.
*  It's a thing of a person being a good person who's compassionate,
*  who wants to do good for people, who thinks they're moving in the right
*  direction. But the problem is it's not in a line with the understanding that we
*  have currently of psychology and of how people behave and of laws and the idea
*  of punishment and crime.
*  Like you have to have some of that stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  You have to have incentives for people to do well,
*  but you also have to have disincentives for them.
*  They have to be punished if they commit crimes.
*  You have to have law and order, but you have to have compassion.
*  You have to have goodwill, but you have to have you have to have law.
*  You have to model it on good parenting, man.
*  Yes, that's what it should be modeled on.
*  That's where it's and also good community.
*  I think parenting is one aspect of your ability to develop growing up.
*  You like neighbors are important, too, man.
*  Friends. Absolutely.
*  Uncles. All those people are important in your life.
*  The aunts, you know, everybody, your grandparents, there's they're important.
*  There's a lot of shit going on.
*  It's input coming into a person.
*  I just love like thinking like what's outside of propaganda parenting.
*  It isn't outside of propaganda, but you can look like as a parent,
*  I can see like, look, it doesn't matter what my ideals are regarding regulation.
*  Forest is not going to be allowed to go into the pool unless I'm there with him.
*  100 percent. He'll die. He'll die.
*  So there's like real like there's like a true like to me, there's an eternal sort
*  of path in in like looking at what good parenting is across cultural cultures.
*  And you realize like, you know, you're an idiot if you think that people
*  in the vast number of humans on Earth, if you think people in that vast
*  number aren't insane, like what percentage are insane?
*  Like, you're insane. Everybody's insane.
*  Well, I know, but I'm saying that's the problem.
*  Like what is that metric?
*  You know, a fucking yard is three feet.
*  I know I'm saying I'm talking like like people who are like
*  registered sex offenders or you know what I mean?
*  Like that, that like pathos, like true narcissist, true sociopaths.
*  Like we live in a world where from time to time, but it's still a spectrum.
*  Right. Because like what if someone's saying
*  but they're a gambling addict and they keep losing all their family's money
*  every year in poker games? Right.
*  We got to figure out a way to help them without simultaneously creating tyranny.
*  Have you fucked with Ibogaine?
*  No, I don't want it, man.
*  I'm terrified of that shit.
*  I haven't fucked with ayahuasca.
*  I smoke DMT from time to time, but I'm scared of a six hour DMT trip,
*  much less Ibogaine freak. Have you done Ibogaine?
*  No, I don't have any like physical addictions that I'm trying to kick
*  or real personal addictions.
*  I've kind of got those things dialed in in terms of my workout and, you know,
*  work schedule and family schedule. It's pretty good right now.
*  I got a good harmony.
*  I got a good rhythm and I'm going to keep that up.
*  Yeah.
*  But people that I know that have really needed it are people that got hurt.
*  And then they got prescribed pain pills.
*  And the pain pills is what got them.
*  I know quite a few people that have turned to the Ibogaine,
*  two good friends that have turned to the Ibogaine and it knocked them right off
*  of the addiction and right back on path.
*  And it's really disturbing to me because it doesn't seem to be killing people
*  and it's not legal.
*  And I think going forward in this country,
*  we're going to have to come to grips with a bunch of shit.
*  One of the things we're going to have to come to grips with is we've got.
*  And this is not a bad thing.
*  OK, if any company is allowed to donate
*  to a political candidate, any company, a fucking, you know,
*  any company, chocolate company, a company that makes cars,
*  then a drug company probably should too.
*  If they're allowed to sell drugs, maybe they should be allowed to
*  to give money to corporations or give money rather to politicians that are
*  running for government. Why not? Everybody can do it.
*  Who's to say they can't?
*  And the fucking guys who make cars can when they're polluting the air.
*  OK, who knows?
*  But at the end of the day, we have to go, yo,
*  there's a lot of people getting hooked on these pills.
*  Yeah, man.
*  There's a lot of people ruining their lives in these pills.
*  And we're turning a blind eye because there's a lot of money involved
*  in these pills. Yeah. And it's weird. It's weird.
*  It's weird. Like the cigarette thing.
*  It's if we're so worried about one hundred and seventy thousand people
*  dying of covid, why aren't we worried about half a million dying from cigarettes?
*  Yeah. Why aren't we worried about all the people that not just dying,
*  but losing their fucking their sanity on opioids?
*  How many people in this country are hooked on fucking pain pills?
*  Is it I mean, do we even know the real number?
*  Because how many people are functional where they're hooked on it,
*  but they're just like taking one or two a day and they're just going to work
*  every day and they just stay in a steady haze of fucking working for fucking,
*  you know, Hertz rent a car and they just deal and they've got a prescription.
*  So it's all good. Doctor says, hey,
*  great new world, baby, brave new world.
*  This is all this.
*  These are all the things that I think of.
*  And this is it gives me up.
*  This is the perspective that I have in this day and age right now.
*  As I'm talking to you, a place of humility,
*  because I'm more aware now than any other time in my life that no one is in control
*  of this thing and that we all have to just stop thinking that daddy is going to rescue
*  us because there is no daddy.
*  Garcetti is not your daddy.
*  Gavin Newsom is not your daddy.
*  Donald Trump's not your daddy.
*  Nancy Pelosi is not your mama.
*  None of these things.
*  These are just people.
*  And we have to look at this in an objective.
*  First of all, anyone who's famous, anyone, I don't care if you're Donald Trump or
*  Nancy Pelosi, those are famous people.
*  Everybody knows their name.
*  Everybody knows what they look like.
*  That's a wild way to live.
*  That's a wild, crazy way to live.
*  Yeah, that's a crazy way to live.
*  And then you're out there also dictating what people can and can't do.
*  You're saying you're not where the taxes go.
*  You're not.
*  The idea is like by becoming famous,
*  you become antithetical to the very thing that you're representing.
*  So how can you represent it anymore?
*  If you have you I'm not saying you can't,
*  but I'm saying that's a that's a different ride.
*  That's a different ride than a regular person.
*  Yeah. If you're if you're a famous person
*  and you're all of a sudden at the helm of an empire that's dropping drone bombs on
*  people, fuck you.
*  Whoa.
*  Shouldn't the greatest government be a government that has an idea of eventually
*  there'll be no more government?
*  There should be.
*  But then you have shit like 9-11.
*  You know what happened?
*  We get attacked.
*  If we know. But did we?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know what happened.
*  What happened?
*  I don't know who trained those people, who designed that.
*  A lot of things happen afterwards that people will say,
*  did those things that happen afterwards happen because and this is my belief.
*  My belief is that all the things that happen after 9-11 in terms of like
*  the Patriot Act and all these other things, they happen because people were
*  taking advantage of an opening where they recognize a lot of people are scared.
*  And then they started implementing these ideas that they would love to do during
*  peacetime, but they would never be accepted.
*  That's my the dogs of war.
*  But this is my interpretation.
*  Some people are under the impression that they actually orchestrated the event and
*  then afterwards implement these new rules and everybody went along with it because
*  the event they orchestrated.
*  Now, I'm not saying I know that that's not the case.
*  And this is what's the scariest fucking thing to admit.
*  What do you know about Operation Northwoods?
*  You know that the government in 1963 was literally planning on blowing up a jet
*  airliner and blaming it on Cuba.
*  They were going to arm Cuban friendlies and attack Guantanamo Bay.
*  They're going to do whatever they could.
*  Get us into a war with Cuba.
*  This was signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
*  They're like, I like it.
*  I like deception.
*  I like what you're going to do.
*  You're going to kill people.
*  Whoo.
*  Let's go to war, baby.
*  Go to war.
*  If they did that in what was it, 62 or 63?
*  Who who knows how that's evolved?
*  Right.
*  Why wouldn't that evolve?
*  Everything evolves.
*  OK, technology evolves or understanding of a biology evolves.
*  Everything evolves.
*  Everything evolves.
*  You know what evolved?
*  What evolved was not the technique.
*  What evolved was the story.
*  The technique seems to be the same.
*  You look at the news that Putin opponent.
*  He fucking keels over in an airplane moaning.
*  All he had to drink was tea.
*  The Kremlin apparently says we wish him a speedy recovery.
*  And everyone's like, what the fuck?
*  And it's like, wait, actually, the use of poison and imperialism is a pretty classic
*  basic technique, like not just in Game of Thrones, but like in general,
*  if you're an imperialist and your interest is like power,
*  you use whatever technique you have to use.
*  Doesn't that technique and using it in that way point to this thing that we're
*  really worried about?
*  What we're really worried about is there's this underlying narrative that's
*  going on where these elites are battling it out and these warlords and these evil
*  sociopaths that run the world are battling it out.
*  All this.
*  Well, they don't think they're evil.
*  But they don't do it.
*  They don't just have a guy just fucking
*  blow his brains out on the airplane and then just jump right off on the tarmac.
*  And then he gets rescued by the Russian police.
*  And then nobody says anything about it ever.
*  No, they do it in a weird, sneaky way.
*  Yeah. It's like there's some plausible deniability involved.
*  Right. Well, they number one, they don't think they're evil.
*  Putin doesn't wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and go,
*  I'm an evil jackal.
*  What are the henchmen of the apocalypse?
*  Putin probably wakes up in the morning.
*  I imagine he stretches.
*  He looks at his phone.
*  He's got text from his friends.
*  He's like that motherfucker.
*  Fuck that bitch.
*  And then he like and then more than likely probably exercises.
*  And then he go and he I bet a lot of times Putin wakes up in the morning.
*  He's like, I don't want to go to work.
*  I've had a lot of times he's like, God damn it.
*  I just want to fuck off all day.
*  Then he has to go to work.
*  He's stuck being Putin.
*  Trump wakes up in the morning.
*  Same problem. He's like, this sucks.
*  Drinking Diet Coke, watching Fox News, tweeting out crazy shit.
*  He wakes up in the morning, like takes whatever the fucking drug he's on.
*  What do you think he's taking?
*  Dude, I don't know.
*  I want some of it.
*  Well, if you had a guess.
*  He's on some kind of a feds.
*  He's on a Fetimen.
*  I don't know what it is, but some sort of diet pill.
*  Yeah.
*  Was it ever confirmed that that whole thing where they said they found the very
*  great Dwayne Reed pharmacy in New York City where he had been taking?
*  I'm not going to beat up somebody for being on drugs.
*  Listen to me, man.
*  He's 74.
*  He wins.
*  OK, if you can make that much money while you're on an amphetamines and you don't
*  die, then they're right.
*  The doctors are right.
*  The doctor likes it safe.
*  He's like, you sure? I want to make money.
*  Yeah, I want to keep going.
*  I don't want to sleep.
*  Like, just take this shit.
*  You don't have to sleep.
*  And he just keeps going.
*  He rattles off fucking campaign speeches and hops on a helicopter and flies a
*  thousand miles away.
*  Find me a 70 year old not on drugs and I will give you a hundred dollars.
*  Give me a fucking break.
*  You're 70. You're going to die in like 20.
*  It's so true.
*  You're going to die.
*  If when I'm 70, oh, my mouth is going to be like a baby bird underneath any drugs.
*  If he wants to put in.
*  Of course.
*  We're both high now.
*  Yeah, drugs are fine.
*  I don't care if Trump is on drugs or Putin's on drugs or whoever's on drugs.
*  It's like the point is like these.
*  The problem is that like we like to imagine like Trump wakes up in the morning
*  and is like, let me destroy this country.
*  Trump wakes up in the morning in a haze.
*  He takes some weird drugs.
*  He tries to remember what he's doing.
*  I promise you every morning he thinks to himself, why the fuck did I listen to my
*  kid? I guarantee it was this kid who's like, Dad, you got to run for president.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no.
*  You don't think you think he want.
*  I don't think he wants to be president.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
*  It was Obama talking shit about him.
*  100 percent. 100 percent.
*  When Obama was doing that dinner.
*  You know that that's that that thing that they do every year with.
*  Yeah.
*  What's it called again, Jamie?
*  The press roast.
*  White House Correspondents.
*  Yeah, White House Correspondents dinner.
*  And Donald Trump's in the audience and
*  Barack Obama's going deep and he's hitting him with some bombs.
*  It was good. It was good.
*  And one of the things he hits him with is here's one thing I am that you'll never
*  be president of the United States.
*  And everybody goes, oh, it's like, you know, that meme with the kid in the hoodie,
*  the glasses, and he's just standing there and all the other kids are running around.
*  Oh, he's so many demons.
*  Can we hear some of this or we get in trouble?
*  No, it was a brutal.
*  Is that is that like public domain or anything?
*  I don't know. Do you think he wrote it?
*  Do you think he wrote it? I don't think he wrote it.
*  Oh, sure.
*  He would write that because Trump was a part of the birther moment.
*  But here's the thing, honestly, legitimately.
*  I hope he was born in Kenya.
*  I hope they pulled it off because I don't care because my grandparents were born
*  in Italy. I don't give a fuck.
*  I don't need you to be born in this patch of dirt.
*  You know why? Because I'm not a fucking idiot.
*  I don't think you should have to be born on a patch of dirt.
*  Look, should you have to be born in
*  fucking
*  Calabasas in order to be the president of Nobu or whatever?
*  That's a bad example.
*  Do you have to live?
*  It's a restaurant, a sushi restaurant in Malibu.
*  Do you have to live like in the town?
*  Like, what are you saying?
*  All the patch of dirt is significant.
*  Where was you expelled out of the vagina?
*  I moved here when I was 13 minutes old.
*  Is that OK?
*  What if my mom shat me out in the middle of a plane on the way across the Pacific?
*  Am I American?
*  Who cares? It's stupid.
*  It's dumb. It's fucking dumb.
*  Well, that's like geospatial centrism.
*  I hope he's born in Kenya.
*  I hope he admits it.
*  I hope he says, oh, and by the way, I was born in Kenya.
*  Oh, shit.
*  If Obama wanted to.
*  You know, everybody has one friend.
*  Please come out.
*  Come out of the closet, please.
*  Yeah, please.
*  You'll feel better.
*  No one will care.
*  This is there's never been a better time.
*  If I'm not saying Obama was born in Kenya, I believe everything he says.
*  I believe he was born in Hawaii.
*  But part of me wishes he was actually born in Kenya.
*  And he waits until after the election.
*  And if Biden wins, he just gets in the book.
*  And by the way, I was born in Kenya.
*  Oh, and the whole audience just goes,
*  the earth turns into a sun.
*  Everything would erupt.
*  Man, I got to pee.
*  I got to pee.
*  Go pee.
*  But what are you going to do when I go pee?
*  Jamie has the editing equipment.
*  Oh, right.
*  He's the wizard.
*  Don't take your headphones off.
*  Headphones. Don't run away.
*  You wrapped behind the back.
*  That was close.
*  I don't want it to end.
*  We don't have to end.
*  OK, great.
*  There was one thing that I wanted to make sure
*  when we decided to go to Spotify.
*  One of the first things I thought of is Duncan Trussell has to be episode number one.
*  That was like a legitimate thing, I thought,
*  because there's something about my relationship with Duncan.
*  It's very unique.
*  He brings things out of me.
*  He puts me in when you're around certain friends,
*  they put you in a state of mind that you don't go into when you're not with them.
*  When I'm with Joey Diaz, one of the things I love about Joey Diaz,
*  I'm always smiling when I'm with Joey Diaz.
*  First of all, because he knows I love him.
*  I've loved him forever.
*  We've been friends forever.
*  Every time I see him, I hug him.
*  So because he knows I love him,
*  when we're around, he just starts talking shit.
*  He gets loose because he knows that I'm his number one fan.
*  And
*  another person like that is Duncan.
*  When I'm around Duncan, there's something like we do to each other.
*  Like we're like some sort of a weird epoxy where you mix it together,
*  where he puts my mind in a place that it doesn't ordinarily go to automatically.
*  I think I genuinely believe there's ideas that I form when I'm talking to Duncan,
*  like ideas popping in my head when I'm talking to him,
*  that they don't get there anywhere else.
*  And it's it kind of goes in with what we're
*  talking about about that other guy's idea of thoughts and my concept of ideas
*  that maybe they're a life form, maybe they're just like E.
*  Coli that lives in your gut or the floor that's on your skin.
*  And that they different people have different combinations of those things,
*  just like some people, you just don't vibe with them.
*  You talk to them.
*  You just want to get away from them as quick as possible.
*  You're like, oh, this person's so annoying and you can't help it for whatever reason.
*  It's like they say that women
*  firm own wise, like women can smell a man's clothes and they can sort of.
*  I don't know if this is true, but I read that they can accurately
*  depict if they smell a man's clothes, whether or not they should be attracted
*  to that man, whether or not they're genetically, they match up well with that
*  man, but that gets fucked up when they're on birth control.
*  Yeah, that's when they're on birth control.
*  It gets confused.
*  Yeah. Well, it's it's in sex at dawn, but it was a real study.
*  And there's a real concern about that, that people are, you know,
*  we're losing some of our senses.
*  Dude, I was in a relationship with a woman
*  who got off birth control and stopped wanting to fuck me.
*  And I remember hearing that and being able to refer to the moment that she seemed to
*  be really into me, but then she got off birth control.
*  And suddenly her real intuition was like, you don't want to make babies.
*  This guy, this guy's fucked up.
*  And she stopped. She stopped.
*  It was real.
*  Like, I remember the moment I happened.
*  It was so bizarre. It was like it was great.
*  I'm glad, by the way, I'm glad because like the baby that we made is so beautiful.
*  And like, have you heard this shit about the egg picks the sperm?
*  Have you heard about this? How the egg does?
*  This is the new research is like, you know, as dudes, we're always like, well,
*  we make the come and there's a sperm that makes it to the end of the race.
*  And that's the one that makes the baby.
*  So in our minds, we're like, it's our it's like a sperm that won a marathon,
*  gets into the egg as a reward for winning the marathon.
*  But now the idea is the egg actually is like the sperm are running to the finish
*  line and the egg sends out chemicals to destabilize certain sperm and picks the
*  one that fits best with the whatever the plan of the egg is.
*  Look at that. Human eggs use chemical signals to attract sperm.
*  Humans spend a lot of time and energy
*  choosing their partner, a new study by researchers from Stockholm University
*  and Manchester University, NHS Foundation Trust shows that choosing your partner
*  continues even after sex, human eggs can choose sperm.
*  It's the goddess baby dudes.
*  It's like the last fucking bashing we had was this idea that we had this athletic
*  little bit of our come that made it through the mother egg that picks it up.
*  Come, come to me, come to me and the rest back, back.
*  It sends out signals to destroy certain sperm trying to make it made it all that
*  way.
*  Choosy eggs may pick sperm for their genes, defying Mendo's law.
*  We're done.
*  But then again, the sperm that get there, those are still at the front of the pack.
*  Yeah. Like in Price is Right.
*  Most likely the egg, you know, the eggs go like, look, I want the best sperm.
*  But the best one's going to be the one that's there first.
*  It's very, it's both things.
*  It's good. It's sweet. It's sweet.
*  It's kind of both things. Right.
*  Yeah. But the final decision is the egg.
*  Bitch ass lazy sperm that just bounces off the head of the rugged sperm and like
*  winds up plop. Wow. Can't believe you chose me.
*  It's like I didn't shit.
*  No, I have a nerd.
*  And the the egg gets really pissed because it's not a precise mechanism.
*  There's a lot of chaos going on to encourage entropy and to encourage
*  innovation that they figure out how to better the better version of the species
*  to get into the egg.
*  Sometimes there's a headbutt and then the dumb dumb goes right in.
*  Head first and bang.
*  You got a kid that's not that bright.
*  You don't want that kid. But then that being said, so on one
*  supposed to get eaten by coyotes on one level, it's great because it says actually
*  the goddess chooses everything.
*  But then on another level, you've got Hitler.
*  Exactly. So that Hitler's mom's egg had a bunch of other sperm that were like,
*  we're not doing a genocide.
*  And what's the connection with what we talked about before with Hitler?
*  Amphetamines.
*  Yeah.
*  Hitler was all about they would inject coke in him and testosterone in him.
*  There's a legendary story about how Mussolini wanted to talk to Hitler
*  pulling out of the war and Hitler showed up, shot up with cocaine and testosterone
*  and just, you know,
*  yeah, I don't even Mussolini know what the fuck he was saying.
*  But he sweated on him until Mussolini relented.
*  Dude, that's true.
*  McKenna used to talk about alcohol in this way.
*  Like, we survived alcohol.
*  Just like he talked about alcohol being the
*  differentiation between the ancient psychedelic cultures,
*  they're like, Chaktal Hiyuk that worshiped the cattle, which like shat on the ground.
*  The mushrooms grow from and they had all this mushroom iconography to when they
*  started preserving things and preserving things in honey, which meant fermented
*  honey, which meant meat, which meant alcohol.
*  And then they switched to an alcohol based society when they couldn't grow the
*  mushrooms anymore because of climate change or because they were moving and
*  moving in different directions.
*  This is what I think happened.
*  This is where I disagree with McKenna.
*  What I think happened.
*  First of all, how confident are you?
*  Not that confident.
*  The fact that you say I disagree with McKenna.
*  I was about to apologize to Dennis McKenna and say, I acknowledge I'm a complete dope.
*  He disagrees with his brother sometimes.
*  Yeah, but he disagrees in the way an
*  ethnobotanist disagrees with a scientist, not in the way some fucking guy.
*  Somebody literally goes at night, goes to
*  read a conspiracy.
*  Disagrees.
*  Who's literally on a show called Joe Roe and questions everything.
*  We investigated UFO materials.
*  I'm sure like Stephen Hawking disagreed with Albert Einstein.
*  You went into a bunker to talk to a dude who's going to start a cult.
*  And you're like, hey, you guys grow tomatoes.
*  No, like I'm.
*  I remember coming back and I'm like, what was that guy like?
*  He was a really nice guy.
*  I'm like, well, Kevin, nice guy digs a hole inside of a fucking mountain and parks his SUV.
*  This guy's crazy, bro.
*  It's so stupid to say I disagree with
*  with one of the great minds that I acknowledge that.
*  But,
*  but, you know, to me, like this is where this is what I picture happening.
*  So, OK, we're storing our mushrooms in jars of alcohol, right?
*  We're storing our mushrooms in jars of alcohol in the rich people, the elites eat
*  the mushrooms, they all trip out and a little orgy, ask, take fucking awesome thing.
*  And then who's left?
*  The people whose job it is to put the mushrooms in the alcohol and what's left?
*  These jars that have a little bit of booze in them and some mushroom residue,
*  they drink it and then they start, you know, like that would be the beginning
*  of like getting fucked up on alcohol.
*  I guess what I'm saying is like,
*  I imagine that like really like if you look at like, OK,
*  mushrooms or LSD or any psychedelic, it teaches you you're a wee, not an I.
*  You're a wee, not a me.
*  And booze, what does it teach you?
*  You're a me.
*  When you're all pissed off on booze,
*  100 percent of the time, you're not angry because you're like
*  worried about the conditions of the world.
*  You're usually angry because someone like what's funnier than when you like insult
*  an alcoholic, how many times you've been around like a.
*  Have you ever heard of alcoholics feelings?
*  We say to them, hey, you're an alcoholic and you see that look in their face
*  where they recognize that you're telling the truth.
*  Yeah. Then it really hurts.
*  Yeah. They get mad at you.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Dude, I like the alcoholic outrage is one of the most like desperately sad things
*  to witness. There's nothing worse than a drunk whose feelings are hurt because
*  usually their feelings are hurt because because you told the truth.
*  Yeah. Yeah. They don't want the truth.
*  And so because their condition depends on lies.
*  Well, it's a weird
*  like one of the things about alcohol, it's like it sort of narrows reality.
*  Yeah. You know, like
*  if you think of one of the things that I really, really enjoy about edibles,
*  there's a thing that I enjoy when I get so paranoid and so freaked out that I
*  don't think I'm going to make it.
*  Yeah. And then I come down from that and I get to this place of humility.
*  And that's one of my favorite places to be as a person.
*  When I'm coming down from like a horrendous,
*  edible high and then all of a sudden I'm like real thankful that it's over.
*  I just want to be friends with people.
*  Yeah. Like there's that space and it sort of like the world broadens.
*  Your danger broadens your humility, your humanity, your vulnerability broadens.
*  And then it comes back to a manageable level and you recognize that it could be
*  so far worse than what you're experiencing currently.
*  And it's just your perspective that's fucking things up.
*  Because right now with you and me right here,
*  no people have ever been more comfortable in the history of humanity.
*  No, we're both in love.
*  We both have children.
*  We're both drunk and high.
*  We both love each other.
*  We're both making each other laugh.
*  Yeah.
*  Anybody in this position that looks at things incorrectly.
*  But like our problem is always perspective.
*  Our problem is always not recognizing how good we have it when we have it.
*  That's right. Dude, this is like there's a Buddhist teacher,
*  Jack Corfield, who says, tend to the part of the garden you can touch.
*  And also Chogyam Chöpurempeshe,
*  in one of his books, one of the things he said was, look, it could he any minute,
*  it could be there's an ism that's good.
*  There's an ism that's the right way to be like it could be socialism, communism.
*  Who knows? Capital. He didn't say that.
*  But there could be an ism that works.
*  Right. Because we can't we can't accept the fact the isms of the past are the
*  only ones that are ever going to be available.
*  That's crazy.
*  There might be a utopian ideal that is applicable to the now.
*  Or just better.
*  But what he said, what I love about what he said is, it doesn't matter
*  if you can't find peace in your own home.
*  Yes.
*  If when you're in your own home, there's disharmony.
*  If you're in your own home, people are unhappy.
*  In your own home, people are freaked out.
*  Then why would you even think about socialism, capitalism, capitalism?
*  When the when the when the pixel of society is the house, the householder.
*  And if within that pixel there's division,
*  then of course, in the world, that division would be like made into some
*  monstrous thing, so even down to the core, to the singular you as a human,
*  who are you OK?
*  Yes.
*  Do you have your shit together or no?
*  Sometimes. Yes, sometimes.
*  Sometimes. Yes, sometimes.
*  No. And everybody wants to point at people who don't.
*  Go look at you.
*  You don't have your shit together, Duncan.
*  I know.
*  You got three quarters of your shit together.
*  That's not helping me get my shit together.
*  That with your white privilege.
*  But I'm trying to be better.
*  I believe you, but you must be punished.
*  I'm not sure for how long.
*  Well, that's aggression.
*  Silence.
*  I want silence from you for an extended period of time.
*  I'll give it to you.
*  I'll decide.
*  The further the silence, the more you're going to appease people.
*  You could wait 10 years and no one gets like four people to be upset.
*  Look, man, ten months.
*  All like to me, like it's like the whole that that whole ball of wax, man, is like,
*  dude, like after once I started, like the thing is, like when all this shit happened
*  and as a comedian, I was like really afraid to get into like even like a little
*  bit of studying the shit people are upset about because like no like comedian,
*  their right mind wants to be identified with like some woke ass comedian because
*  it's embarrassing. But then when I started looking into it,
*  then I found out about the George Washington shit.
*  The George Washington shit is super creepy,
*  creepy because there's no way if those teeth were valuable,
*  the people weren't murdered for their teeth.
*  That's it.
*  There's no way people weren't like just held down and they got their teeth stolen
*  or they were told that they were going to get money and they weren't.
*  And they were many of them have been raped.
*  But here's the thing.
*  Is the real value in getting outraged at shit that happened hundreds of years ago?
*  Or is it is it an acknowledgment of, first of all,
*  the fact that we all agree we can do better?
*  That's what the turmoil the turmoil exists.
*  All of it, social, economic.
*  The turmoil exists because we haven't really come to grips with whether or not
*  we can all get together and be cool with each other all the time.
*  Yeah. So there's always some sort of turmoil.
*  And when you look at turmoil in terms of like whether it's financial turmoil or
*  social turmoil, we're always trying to figure out like who's being the asshole.
*  Right. Don't you feel like that?
*  Like when you.
*  What do you mean?
*  When you see anything that's happening,
*  like when you see when you see a government getting overthrown,
*  when you see war, you always like who is being the asshole?
*  Any kind of turmoil?
*  You mean you try to find the perpetrator of the.
*  Difficulty, right?
*  What's causing it?
*  And is it possible that most of this shit could be avoided?
*  And what's stopping most of it from being avoided?
*  When you look at any kind of any kind
*  of government, like any kind of country in any time a country invades another
*  country, any time bombs are being dropped from drones, like what can be done to
*  avoid this? That's right.
*  What can be done?
*  Dude, man, I started this fucking pandemic philosophy club is what we call it with
*  like my friends Marcus and Brandon. What's up?
*  We don't even do a podcast every Friday.
*  We just get together and talk and they like Midnight Gospel.
*  That's how I got lucky enough to meet them.
*  Midnight Gospel is an amazing show.
*  Thank you.
*  Can I just say before we get going, I'm really proud of you.
*  Thank you. Really, really proud of you because it represents you as an artist
*  more than anything, almost anything any of my friends who've ever done has done
*  because you're so weird and it's so weird, but it's so funny and it's so amazing.
*  It's amazing.
*  They let us make it.
*  I can't believe it.
*  Praise Odin for Netflix.
*  Praise Odin. Praise Odin.
*  But what they've done is amazing.
*  But what you've done is somehow or another
*  encapsulate some of the things I love about you, how weird you are, how
*  you're not like anybody else.
*  When you came here today, one of the things I said to you, I go, dude,
*  I go, you're the only guy that like I like listening to your ads.
*  That's sweet. I do.
*  Thanks, man.
*  Your fucking Express VPN ad is a hilarious ad.
*  It took so long.
*  I didn't even know if it was an ad.
*  Thank you.
*  Crazy. But you're the best.
*  I want to say this to you.
*  You are the best that I've ever seen at reading ads.
*  Of all the people that I've ever heard who read ads, your ads are the most entertaining.
*  You're very sweet, Joe.
*  And I'm not going to get in a cocksucking competition with you, but I wouldn't be here
*  if not for you.
*  And that's the truth.
*  And I'll never stop saying it.
*  And I will never stop being grateful to you.
*  But I wouldn't be me if it wasn't for my friendship with you either.
*  That's very sweet. It's true.
*  I appreciate that.
*  We all benefit each other.
*  Yeah, but I don't mean to cut you off.
*  I'm so sorry.
*  By the way, I had a little bit of booze.
*  So forgive my impetuousness that I would suddenly interrupt you.
*  But you do have a history of finding young comedians who are like and you do help us
*  a lot. And we are eternally grateful to you.
*  And I don't care if you don't acknowledge it.
*  You won't acknowledge it because if you did, you're afraid you'll go crazy.
*  It's not that I want.
*  I'll tell you from my perspective, it's not that I'll go crazy.
*  It's that I have to do it.
*  There's no if, ands or buts.
*  It's a path.
*  It's like if you're going down, if you're on a fucking one of those water slides,
*  and you're going flying down, you're just going that way.
*  If you're a good person and you love comedy and you love comedians and you have
*  friends and you want to see them happy and you want to see them successful and
*  you know they're good and you know it benefits not just them, but you to elevate them.
*  Right. I'm like, hey, check out Annie Letterman.
*  Hey, check out everybody, whoever it is.
*  It's like I want them to know that my relationship with them, anybody who's
*  listening to this podcast or anybody who listens to my stand up or watches it,
*  it's genuine. That's who I am.
*  So if I find someone who's awesome, I want you to know about it.
*  I don't want to get paid for it.
*  If I find a great band, I start talking about it on Instagram.
*  I find a great application.
*  I tell people it's cool.
*  I have the obligation.
*  I didn't know if I did or I didn't.
*  But I did.
*  I don't think I'm in a position that everybody's in.
*  It's a weird spot.
*  And might I say, I'm so glad that Annie Letterman is someone that you've your
*  attention. She is so funny.
*  So her podcast is so fucking funny.
*  I'm sure it is. But, dude, her and Whitney, this is what happened.
*  We were at the comic store the other night.
*  Mike Binder, Mike Binder is doing his his whole
*  showtime documentary thing.
*  So we're all on the roof. It was fun, man.
*  I got to chat with Paul Rodriguez.
*  Very cool, dude.
*  I really never got a lot of time spending talking to Paul Rodriguez before.
*  He's really cool, man.
*  He's really good.
*  He had some good, good,
*  good stories about South America and Latin America and Mexico, where comedians
*  have actually got jailed. Yeah, really interesting shit.
*  And Bill Burr was hilarious.
*  And Annie Letterman was on fire.
*  And then there was Whitney Cummings and Jay Leno.
*  And we had a good fucking time, man.
*  It was a real and Mike Binder.
*  It was a really good fucking time.
*  It really was. It was.
*  It was it.
*  First of all, it reminded me.
*  How much I love that place.
*  I walked in there. I was like, God damn.
*  I got so emotional when I walked in the door.
*  But when I had Whitney and Annie together and they're talking shit to each other,
*  I'm like, these girls are so funny and they love each other.
*  They're really good friends.
*  And I said, Whitney was scheduled to be on the podcast.
*  And then I said to her, I said, do you care if Annie comes?
*  I want Annie to come, but it's up to you.
*  She's like, fuck, yeah.
*  So I brought Annie in too.
*  And the two of them together, dude, they're savages.
*  That's that's the future of female comedy.
*  Truly. And the future of podcasting, because there's all these like like that's
*  a popular thing now, like guys we fucked.
*  They're killing it.
*  And then there's the Call Her Daddy that shows killing it like they're on a
*  different vibration than you, Duncan Trussell.
*  But there's a really popular sort of segment.
*  Yeah. And these two girls together, two
*  hilarious standup comics talking shit together on a podcast.
*  You guys have to do it.
*  But they're also like, you got to admit,
*  like they're gonzo, like the Hunter S.
*  Thompson thing, like their full gonzo.
*  Both of them are like terrifying in their own way.
*  Yes. You know what I mean?
*  Like when you encounter either of them, I have to help them.
*  Right. You have to help them do a podcast.
*  Well, it has to be Annie and Whitney
*  because the A's make you find it quicker.
*  The world deserves it.
*  But like, I remember going to do it.
*  When I was me, Annie and Whitney, when I
*  went to do Annie Letterman's podcast, I won't give anything away.
*  What happened?
*  I'm not I can't say it.
*  It's not legal.
*  But like, I remember, like,
*  leaving there being like, wow, holy shit.
*  Like, I remember leaving there just thinking like, not just that, not whatever
*  I'm saying right now, I'm saying like, realizing like.
*  I've always loved chatting with Annie Letterman.
*  We have great conversations, but I remember like getting into where she lived
*  and looking around and realizing like, well, she's formed some kind of cult.
*  I don't know what it is.
*  She's really funny, man.
*  She's so funny.
*  And like that, like just that moment of like, wow, like you're you're like.
*  Both of them.
*  Well, that it's the thing is, is like this
*  acknowledgment, first of all, you your your podcast has a cult following
*  and you've hit this like weird place.
*  And I think you feel very similar to the way I do that when you find someone who's
*  extraordinary, you want to let everybody else know.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  We both have that.
*  Yeah, we all of us have that.
*  Joey has that already has that already is one of the best.
*  If you're already friend and you have a special coming out,
*  we'll promote the fuck out of you.
*  He's amazing at that.
*  He did it for Joe List.
*  He's done it for Mark Normand.
*  And he's helped get guys on my podcast.
*  And I blow them up because if you're friends with are your friends with me.
*  But we're all like that.
*  Diaz, Red Band's like that.
*  Tony Hinchcliffe's like that.
*  Everybody will tell you all the people around them that are killing it.
*  And I think that's real important, man.
*  I think it's an important thing to get out there.
*  There's a there's a frequency.
*  There's a frequency that we're all sending out.
*  And it's a frequency of camaraderie, you know, of
*  it doesn't matter if you're wrong sometimes or it's just like sometimes you
*  fuck up, like we're all trying to go the right direction.
*  But, you know, when we're talking about
*  that dumb sperm that clashes heads with the alpha sperm, it just accidentally
*  slides in that shit is going to happen.
*  That's right. All these things.
*  But we we have to move forward in the spirit of camaraderie.
*  And this is like the big test.
*  Let's can we for a second just draw?
*  I don't care. It's so cheesy.
*  And you've heard everyone's talking about the comedy store.
*  Let's just spit a second with the comedy store, man, because like for me,
*  and this is the truth and like, you know, I was talking to Ari's like
*  you never would. I'm like, I was going up like twice a week.
*  But even if I wasn't, he said he never went.
*  No, for a second, because he did work there, dude.
*  That's how we became friends.
*  But from Ari saw me in a really dark period where I was like not showing up for
*  spots and he rightfully judges me for that.
*  But like, it's OK.
*  Was that when you were living with me?
*  That was after I was living with you.
*  I went through a dark period.
*  I didn't take it. I took it for granted.
*  And I deserve no, no, no.
*  But whatever is Duncan, you just always been complicated.
*  That's it's not it's not you're complicated.
*  You know, yeah, I was having a conversation with someone and they were saying like,
*  it's OK to have a loose chassis, but you got to stay on the road.
*  Yeah, I try to stay on the road, man.
*  But I love the comedy store.
*  I love it with all my heart.
*  Dude, when when you and I became friends, we should tell people you and I became
*  friends because I would call into the comedy store and I say, hey, I'm here
*  Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
*  Yeah, you'd be like, cool, man.
*  Hey, did you fucking see this thing?
*  They're saying is happening in Nepal where all these people are getting together.
*  They're all seeing these like crazy conversations for hours.
*  You put me on hold.
*  You would take another call and then we would talk about fucking Terrence McKenna
*  and Graham Hancock.
*  The best dude we had we would get baked on the phone where Duncan Trussell was a
*  comedy store employee and I was I was at home and we would get high and we would
*  just start talking about aliens.
*  The best ghost is the best man.
*  That place is a temple for real, dude.
*  But you and I became pen like phone pals.
*  We that's how we got to be friends.
*  And like here we are right now.
*  The funny thing is the conversation we're
*  having is no different than the conversation we had when I was working there.
*  But I was saying to Jamie when you left and went to P.
*  People bring things out of people.
*  And it's something that I don't think people like to admit.
*  But sometimes people bring bad things out of people.
*  And sometimes people bring good things out of people.
*  And when I'm with you, I'm different than when I'm not with you.
*  Yeah, man.
*  Like I really don't want this conversation to end.
*  Like I'm not going to get all sappy cinema.
*  You fly to Austin occasionally.
*  Anytime you want, man.
*  I'll come anytime you want.
*  But like it won't.
*  To me, it's like this is my solution to all this.
*  I'm just going to fly people out and put them up and pay for their food.
*  It'll be great. Get a massages.
*  It'll be great, man.
*  But like all that being said, like we just I just don't.
*  I don't think anyone can understand what it's like
*  unless they've been there to get off stage at the Comedy Store.
*  And you have a good set, maybe, but you're working on a joke and you get off stage.
*  And suddenly, Whitney Cummings, who is like a very rightfully successful,
*  brilliantly funny person, stops you and says, hey, what do you think about this
*  addition to your punch line?
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like those moments are so so like so like because in that moment there isn't like
*  hierarchy, like in that moment there isn't like, look, I made like shows for network TV.
*  One of my proudest moments as a comic, I was at the improv and this was like
*  two thousand fucking three or some shit like that.
*  And Louis CK sits in the back of the room and takes notes.
*  And then we get off stage and he actually asked me before he goes,
*  do you mind if I watch and like give you some like give you some notes?
*  I go, dude, I fucking love that.
*  Yeah.
*  And then afterwards, he had a bunch of really funny suggestions.
*  I don't remember if I wind up using any of them, but it was just so fun,
*  so fun to hear him and I talk about like bits and the fact that he would like sit
*  down and watch these bits. That's it.
*  That's the so to me, like, you know, and I like I would always tell Aaron,
*  my wife, I'd always say, like, you know, there's no comedy store anywhere else.
*  Like I want to go. I want to be here.
*  I don't think it's impossible to make that somewhere else.
*  This is the whole reason why I'm interested in moving to Texas.
*  I don't believe that we have to be tethered to this machine that makes things that we
*  don't do right. This machine makes music.
*  This machine makes movies and it makes TV shows.
*  And we don't do any of those things.
*  We're a totally different business.
*  And I don't think we have to be connected to any sort of legacy entertainment
*  structure. It doesn't make any sense.
*  It's like the entertainment.
*  Just trying to siphon money off of you.
*  Right.
*  It's just like they're not they're missing the point.
*  Like, I want to tell the truth.
*  I don't want to just sell things.
*  I want I want I want to say what I'm thinking right now, whether it's good or
*  bad or angry or sad or remorseful.
*  I want to be able to say it any time I want to say it.
*  And this is not acceptable in the regular old school legacy medium that that that
*  people are thinking of as mainstream media.
*  And it was mainstream media 20 years ago or 30 years ago.
*  But what you and I are doing right now is writing on a fucking cave wall compared
*  to what's coming. What you and I are doing right now compared to what the fuck is
*  going to happen when Elon Musk starts producing this whole neural link.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And then they develop some sort of fucking satellite network where
*  everyone's connected and reading each other's minds all over the globe.
*  Dude, this is cave wall scratch tickets bullshit.
*  I know. And to me, I'm playing tick tock toe by the fire.
*  But this is what's this is to me, like the poignant thing about like neolithic
*  structures is like you see the neolithic structure and you know, like, fuck, man,
*  people spend a long time building that.
*  And in this in the process of building that, they became friends and they shared
*  stories. It was really beautiful.
*  But now all we see is some old eroded shit that we don't know anything about.
*  Right. Yeah. So to me, what's beautiful is like you are absolutely right.
*  This thing we're doing right now, it's it doesn't matter.
*  What we're doing is like Morse code.
*  It's going to be it doesn't matter if it's a million years.
*  It won't be a million years.
*  It won't be that long before our conversation is dated.
*  But you know what we're doing also?
*  We're doing the same thing that Beethoven was doing.
*  Where they were making music at a time where you couldn't record it.
*  So you had to write it down.
*  Yeah, we're doing this some clunky.
*  Like if you can listen, imagine if you could listen to the actual orchestra
*  that was playing like Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.
*  Oh, shit, that's crazy.
*  Imagine, bro, also being in context of never having heard the doors,
*  never having heard Hendrix, people cough.
*  Yeah, never having heard any of that.
*  Only being in that era and sitting in the audience.
*  That would be crazy.
*  Is that Beethoven's Fifth? Did I make that up?
*  Jamie, act like no, no, I don't.
*  It was a terrible impression.
*  It was like, who am I?
*  But think about how powerful that is.
*  But imagine being there in the moment when it was first released.
*  Yeah. And no one could record anything.
*  And now you had to write it down in some weird, they had to develop a language for music.
*  Say what it was.
*  Yeah. I mean, you could be a bad ass guitarist in 2020 and not have any idea how to read music.
*  Yeah, that's right. Right.
*  That's right. You could like watch videos and just decide I'm just going to go full
*  Stevie Ray Vaughn. Some people don't want to know how to read it.
*  Yeah, they want to be able to just free.
*  Oh, what's the earliest recording of that?
*  Is this hooked on?
*  Can you play that? Or we get in trouble?
*  You can't play it.
*  That is it.
*  That's it. Right. That's Beethoven's Fifth.
*  I mean, bro, imagine being alive back then when you never heard any shit like that.
*  Dude, I was sitting in the audience.
*  Do you remember when Notorious Big IG?
*  B.I.G.
*  Big IG. Biggie.
*  Remember when Biggie came out with Hypnotize?
*  No.
*  Do you remember? How old were you?
*  I don't know. The year. I don't know.
*  I have to math.
*  It seems like 95 because I was on I was on news radio.
*  And I remember driving to work.
*  What year? 97.
*  97. Yeah.
*  OK, I was on news radio from 94 to 99.
*  So I was on news radio and I remember
*  driving to work and hearing that going, whoa, they just cracked through some new level.
*  Yeah. Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see?
*  Sometimes your words that hypnotize me.
*  Great song.
*  I got.
*  But it was just there was something about it where I was like, oh,
*  somebody figured out a new level of the video game.
*  Yeah.
*  Of course he did.
*  Dude, you don't understand what it was like back then.
*  No Internet.
*  You would see him on MTV with piles of cash.
*  Yeah. There's no accountability.
*  That's so cool.
*  Like this is the like one like there's a concept in Buddhism, which is like if you
*  want to really start it, it's just that's all.
*  But it's just helicopters and how many helicopters.
*  Look at him. Look at him, Biggie.
*  Man, do you know how many fucking amazing songs we missed out on?
*  Because Biggie and Tupac didn't get together and small pot.
*  How fucked up is that?
*  A couple of drinks like somebody had them tricked that they were enemies.
*  Imagine if Biggie and Tupac were just like me and Stan Hope or like comics.
*  Yeah. Like comics are just like like what the fuck are we?
*  We should love each other.
*  We're the only ones that are like, how many goddamn emcees are there?
*  How many rappers are there? How many standups are there?
*  There's so few. There you go.
*  We should be so happy we run it. We can't.
*  That's that kind of talk will get you killed
*  because that's the last bastion of the thing that wants to keep us limited, man.
*  It's like that's the idea is like even them.
*  And I'm telling you for them, they need to listen up.
*  I know you want to have control,
*  but sometimes not having controls is better.
*  Like, here's the thing in archery.
*  Let me tell you something about archery.
*  There's a thing about archery where it's very few people can what they call
*  command shoot.
*  What that means is when you draw back the bow and you have your finger on the trigger,
*  you just decide when the arrow is going to go.
*  OK, sure.
*  Most people don't do it that way.
*  And most people who do these big tournaments, like even the Olympics,
*  they teach them to have a surprise release.
*  It's a psychological trick where you're using a certain type of release where
*  either you have your finger on a trigger and you don't push your finger.
*  You just let your back muscles pull it because they're crude muscles or you use
*  what's called a hinge.
*  We slowly pull in the hands and the arrow goes.
*  We don't know when it's going to go.
*  Whereas a trigger, you know exactly where it's going to go.
*  Well, there's something about knowing exactly where it's going to go.
*  We just fucking it tense up.
*  It's twitch. And it's hard.
*  It's hard to keep your mind in order.
*  We just go, especially if you're shooting in a tournament.
*  You're in the Olympics.
*  Gold medal round.
*  So very few people in the Olympics allow their brain to decide when the shot goes.
*  Isn't that interesting?
*  Yeah. Yeah, that's beautiful.
*  I get what you're saying, too.
*  There's the mind of no mind, the ability to get out of your own way.
*  And for archers, the best way to do this is either in the hinge release or a release
*  with a thumb where you pull through with your back muscles and it makes the thumb
*  trigger. This thing is dangerous.
*  This thing's dangerous because you could develop what's called target panic.
*  And there's people that never like my friend, Cam Haynes.
*  He's a freak of nature.
*  He's never developed target panic.
*  And he shoots like this. He sees things.
*  He shoots out of his perfect.
*  He shoot 140 yards, pop, balloon and shit.
*  But he also runs a marathon a day.
*  He's like a freak of nature.
*  He's a very rare human.
*  But you can't bank it on those people.
*  You got to think about the rest of the folks for the rest of the folks.
*  The whole idea is like getting rid of anxiety.
*  And what's anxiety?
*  Anxiety is pulling the trigger.
*  You're in a gold medal round.
*  I just hit that bullseye.
*  This is it.
*  America wins.
*  And you just slinch.
*  There's just a little thing that happens to you that you don't want to happen.
*  And your arrow just goes four inches shy.
*  Got it. Got it.
*  Love it. Yeah, that's the so that is the so like and I'm sorry, every every podcast
*  I do, I talk about Buddhism, but I don't care.
*  I want you to talk about.
*  Thank you.
*  So like what I love about it is like so everybody gets caught up
*  in the first two ideas in Buddhism, the first being life is unsatisfactory.
*  The second being the reason life is
*  unsatisfactory is because you think it's a way that it's not.
*  Now, this gets translated in a lot.
*  Let's break that down.
*  Life is unsatisfactory.
*  And the reason you think life is unsatisfactory is because.
*  Well, life.
*  So the best way to put it would be,
*  have you ever been with someone in traffic in L.A.
*  and they're angry? Me.
*  OK, but me.
*  When have you ever been myself? Right.
*  But that's literally the way traffic is in L.A.
*  Yes. Yet somehow, like because you drove that day in a traffic,
*  you got in your head this would be the one day in L.A. where there would be traffic.
*  No, honestly, I keep it together.
*  But I do.
*  I do. I recognize that it's knocking on the door.
*  It's like, come on, be a bitch, freak out.
*  I really do keep it together.
*  But that this is also the real argument for micro dosing.
*  Because if you could just micro dose,
*  there would be so much less negative interactions with people,
*  whether it's on the highway or anywhere.
*  No one's going to know one who's micro
*  dosing on psilocybin is going to yell at you from across the street.
*  Put your fucking mask on.
*  No, they're not going to do that.
*  You're going to let them be themselves.
*  But I want to be I want to be the person that makes people smile.
*  I don't want to be the person that makes people mad.
*  I don't either.
*  And this is something I'm consciously thinking about more and more as I get older.
*  I want I want us to do better.
*  I really do.
*  This is one of the reasons why I have this idea of like starting over in Texas.
*  I have this idea of like disconnecting from all these old hubs and this idea of
*  what we're doing or putting out content into the world.
*  I don't believe it.
*  I don't believe it has to be from a media center.
*  I don't believe it has to be from New York or L.A.
*  I don't believe it.
*  And I think I want to prove to myself that it doesn't have to.
*  I want to go.
*  One of the reasons why I wanted to go to Texas is because it's like almost like
*  this, there's a certain mockery to live in in Texas, you know,
*  listen, especially for someone like me.
*  I wouldn't want to be you.
*  Like you everything you do is to study.
*  And like I like I like being free of that magnifying lens.
*  But, you know, to me, like whenever I'm thinking about
*  like, you know, it's fun to think about what's the root problem here.
*  The root problem seems to be centralization.
*  It's like wherever centralization rears its head, problems emerge.
*  The root problem is compassion.
*  What do you mean? The root problem is compassion, that we don't make our decisions
*  based on compassion.
*  We make them based on beneficial markers of improvement, whether it's financial
*  improvement or land grabs or that's the problem.
*  The problem is that we we we have these things in our head where this is what's
*  the most important and this is what's not as important.
*  Like love is important.
*  But if you see two people that are, you know, they're in love, but you don't like
*  either one of them, you do feel like that's the same kind of love as two people you
*  admire there together.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Like how many of you who do you know?
*  All right. I'll give you one.
*  I do. Laird Hamilton and Gabrielle Reese.
*  I'm friends with those two people.
*  They're super athletes.
*  She was a super athlete in volleyball and he's like one of the greatest big wave
*  surfers the world's ever known.
*  I'm friends with them.
*  And when I talk to them, if I talk to them either on like we do a little we do a
*  little FaceTime the other day and I get out of it, I go that I want to be somebody
*  who makes me feel or I want to be somebody who makes somebody feel the way I feel
*  when I talk to them. That's cool.
*  When I talk to those people like these are superior people like Laird Hamilton's
*  a weird dude, but he's also like a superior human who does these crazy pool
*  workouts like 70 pound dumbbells.
*  He gets in the fucking sauna at 250 degrees and rides an air dyne bike with
*  oven mitts on Jesus.
*  Yeah, they're freaks.
*  He wears oven mitts because it burns his hand.
*  Yes.
*  250.
*  250.
*  Fuck that.
*  You eat at some point.
*  He was like, I got to put on oven mitts.
*  But he doesn't get out of the sauna.
*  And I said to myself when I got off the phone with them the other day,
*  they're really nice people.
*  They're really, really they're genuine people.
*  And this is one of the things that happens.
*  And it's a weird thing that happens when you become more and more famous.
*  You get more and more comfortable talking to other famous people.
*  You know, see, talk to talk to famous people and you realize, oh, they have a hard
*  time talking to people because other people think they're weird.
*  Yeah.
*  So they have to find famous people that are also nice.
*  Right. And so that's how I feel about them.
*  So I get off the phone with them and I'm like,
*  like, you can be you could be Gabrielle
*  Reese and you can be Laird Hamilton and still come out and be a really cool,
*  friendly, inspirational, genuine person.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm like, I want to make somebody else feel the way those people make me feel.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's what I felt like.
*  I love that.
*  That's the best thing we can do for each other.
*  That's the answer.
*  And that's like if anything has ever come out as podcasts has been good.
*  It's that it's given people a perspective
*  where there's a potential where that maybe they're limited ideas
*  of what they're capable of in terms of their own personal happiness
*  or their own success and whatever their chosen endeavor is.
*  Maybe it's not really limited.
*  Maybe they can just shift their consciousness and through
*  effort and focus, they can change their destiny.
*  Maybe it's true.
*  Well, you know, the reason I say centralization is because like
*  the first and a very natural reaction
*  to being associated with a body would be that you would centralize
*  on the identity that you're in.
*  You know, if I step on your if I stomp on your foot, you're going to feel pain.
*  So why wouldn't you centralize on this identity that you're in?
*  So and again, like right now, the science we have, it can't show us what
*  I think it will eventually show that our sentience isn't limited
*  to the body that we're a field of consciousness.
*  It's kind of getting associated with like particular like quantum clouds of meat.
*  And they interface with other sentient bodies
*  in a way that makes them unique to the relationship between that person.
*  Like I bet you're different with your wife than you are with anybody you've ever met.
*  That that is true.
*  Yes. But that's also like one of the great like right now,
*  one of the big ideas, such a cool idea, too, is like on stage, off stage.
*  So how are you acting when you think you're on stage?
*  In other words, like when you're in front of like this is the best part about covid.
*  There's no on stage. Exactly.
*  That's it. But it's the only good thing about covid for me.
*  Well, there's actually I'll tell you some other great things about covid.
*  It's hard to say that we can tell a commute and businesses still work.
*  And that transforms the landscape.
*  But like the the the on stage, off stage idea or the way like Chogam
*  Trivoremposha puts it is some people at the end of the day, they go home
*  and they sit on the couch and they go.
*  And but they only let themselves do that at the very end of the day of work
*  because they produced in their mind a situation where this is me relaxing
*  and this is me working. Right.
*  Here I am with my family. Here I am with my coworkers. Here I.
*  So this differentiation produces a kind of neurotic kind of
*  split personality
*  way of being, which is like really all those.
*  You don't need to wait to get home to sit on the couch to go.
*  That's where you're at now.
*  Like that's actually every single thing.
*  But the story you're telling yourself produces moments where this is a relaxing time
*  and this is a non relaxing time.
*  But it's just a story, Joe, that that's the idea.
*  And like compassion is like, I think the beginning of recognizing like, you know,
*  how many people have you met?
*  I'm sure you and I know my life changed when I went to the doctor
*  with my swollen fucking testicle that, by the way, before I went to the doctor,
*  I would look at myself in the mirror and think, man, if they were symmetrical,
*  I would feel awesome.
*  Like it felt good to have a big ball.
*  There was like
*  a
*  I literally was like, God damn it.
*  If they were you were happy about the one big ball.
*  It looked powerful.
*  I'm not going to lie, man.
*  Have you ever seen Joey Diaz's balls?
*  Yeah, like that, like the way he feels like that every day.
*  They don't even make sense.
*  So like for a few months.
*  Jamie, have you seen Joey's balls?
*  See if you can pull up the picture of Joey on stage
*  where he's naked with a with a he had a show.
*  I know, I know. But just for me, he had a
*  a safety pin and a towel around his neck, like a cape.
*  And this was for my 1999 Warner Brothers
*  CD called I'm going to be dead someday.
*  We took these crazy pictures in the main room of the comedy store.
*  I was there.
*  You were there for those. The matador outfit.
*  I was like there was some drama about it.
*  You guys snuck in and took the pictures.
*  Were you working?
*  I was the talent coordinator.
*  You guys snuck in, took the pictures.
*  You know, we didn't snuck in.
*  We had a we talked to whoever the fuck it was.
*  It was me. Was it Scott or Tommy?
*  I'm sorry. I feel like I was there when I have I could be wrong.
*  But I remember the matador pictures.
*  Warner Brothers did it. Maybe I'm wrong.
*  They made calls.
*  No, I remember that. The matador picture was real.
*  I'm sorry, but I remember a moment that I was I think I was a talent coordinator
*  where suddenly Joey, there's pictures of Joey Diaz in a matador outfit.
*  There's a funny thing you ever seen.
*  But Mitzi caught wind of it.
*  That's what I remember is there was some drama around the situation.
*  Like the pictures themselves were like not just funny.
*  They were like kind of artistic. They look cool.
*  There's a picture of Joey and he please someone find this.
*  It's in I think I have the CD.
*  So I have it if it's on the it's on the CD.
*  So I have it because I you know, when I'm moving, I'm going through my shit.
*  And one of the things I found is those old I'm going to be dead someday CDs.
*  That's 99.
*  I became Joey Diaz's
*  associate and best friend around 96.
*  That's when I met him.
*  So I could be on when I was there.
*  I just remember there was some drama.
*  No, you might have been there if you were there in 99.
*  I when did you start working?
*  I don't remember. I don't remember the exact day.
*  And again, like I don't remember.
*  I just remember there was some drama.
*  I think it was before your time, man.
*  I want to feel like it's before your time.
*  Dude, it could easily be that Mitzi caught wind of the pictures late
*  or something, you know, like it could easily.
*  I just remember there was some drama attached to the lady was so nice to me.
*  She loves you, man.
*  She loves Joey, too. She loves all of us.
*  She had the the the the funnest thing with like her idea of us together.
*  She loved that we were together, that we were friends.
*  She was a wild, wild lady.
*  She was wild, dude. That was a real guru.
*  Like Mitzi Shor was an actual guru. Yeah.
*  Yeah, man, I tell everybody if there's one human being,
*  that's the most important human being in comedy ever that wasn't a comedian.
*  It's Mitzi Shor.
*  That's why she's on the wall of this room.
*  She was taking her with me, man.
*  Not only that, the movers don't take her. I take her.
*  Mitzi's come with me on the plane.
*  Yeah, man. She was real.
*  Listen, that's coming with me on the plane. No bullshit.
*  Yeah. Like the reason why that's up on the wall after the movers have gone
*  is that's coming with me.
*  Yeah, Mitzi. Yeah.
*  She gave me my my future.
*  No, she was wild. She was a wild animal.
*  She was a crazy lady.
*  She's a perfect person to run the comedy store.
*  Well, no, she had to be that way.
*  You know, you can't make you can't have the if you go through
*  there's photos in the album where you can see Joey with his with a cape.
*  He had this.
*  Oh, God damn, I know I can.
*  I know I have it. I know I have it somewhere.
*  I'll find it. It's on one of my folders.
*  You know, when you walk into her house,
*  Joey Diaz, Cape balls.
*  I'm looking.
*  You know, you know, it was in her house
*  on Doheny when you walk into her house.
*  No. So on her house, when you walk in,
*  the first thing you see is
*  what do you call it when people sew and they make art with so crochet
*  a crocheted picture.
*  It on it, it said, dying is easy.
*  Comedy is hard.
*  That's the first thing you said.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  It like it is true.
*  And like that was what's beautiful about her.
*  Is she understood how hard comedy was.
*  I told you the story of her getting robbed, right?
*  I told you that story.
*  Which story is that? Tell me.
*  So like, here's how cool she was.
*  And I can't remember the name of the comic, but she was giving him spots.
*  I can't remember the name of the comic.
*  This was in the early.
*  It's better you don't say it.
*  Yeah, it's better I don't say it.
*  So this motherfucker needed money and he robbed the van.
*  She was in the van.
*  Like, apparently he like at gunpoint
*  took the cash earnings of the of the club.
*  At gunpoint, like took the money from her
*  and she knew who it was somehow.
*  She could tell somehow from the mask.
*  He didn't do good. She just knew.
*  And I remember her saying like, yeah, he he robbed me at gunpoint.
*  We find me.
*  But it's funny.
*  He that was her.
*  But that was her.
*  Like, can you imagine?
*  Like, if you really think about it, you get robbed at gunpoint by a comedian
*  and you still give him stage time.
*  What the fuck is that?
*  Well, that's that's a guru.
*  That's a guru.
*  That's not a that's not a normal person anymore.
*  That becomes like that.
*  I've never had that sort of a relationship with any human ever.
*  You know, I sought her out when I was living in Boston.
*  Really? Yeah.
*  You knew about her.
*  Dude, when I was an open mic'er, OK,
*  I had gotten obsessed with comedy for six months before I could ever do it.
*  Open mic night, because I erroneously assumed that you had to be 21
*  to be able to get on stage.
*  It turns out you can be younger.
*  You just can't drink or watch you.
*  But you can be a 19 year old.
*  Do stand up. I didn't know.
*  So August 27th, 1988.
*  When I turned 21, I went on stage
*  and when I went on stage, I remember thinking.
*  I remember, like, really clearly thinking,
*  like, how weird is this job?
*  There's a there's a bunch of people out there that could just talk.
*  And they can make a living. Yeah.
*  How weird is this job?
*  What did you think the first time you ever went on stage?
*  And you talked into a microphone. Hello.
*  Hi, my name is Duncan Trussell. So weird.
*  Like when you look back at those times, like, how do you feel?
*  You feel like it's not even you.
*  I met that lady when I met Mitzi Shore.
*  When Mitzi Shore passed me at the Comedy Store,
*  I remember thinking when I was in 1988 in Boston, there was this mecca.
*  There was this place you had to go where Richard Pryor filmed live
*  at the Sunset Strip and Sam Kennison used to stand up.
*  Yeah. And fucking Howie Mandel went up and Rodney Dangerfield
*  and David Letterman. Yeah.
*  God damn, I got to get to the Comedy Store.
*  That's all they wanted to do.
*  I didn't want to get anywhere else.
*  There was one part of me that wanted to go to Houston
*  because I had heard that like Sam Kennison did these wild shows in Houston.
*  I want to go to Houston.
*  But the big thing for me was I got to get to the store.
*  And when I got passed by that lady.
*  Dude, you know, it's one of the reasons why I feel so compelled
*  to help people on this podcast,
*  because I feel like when that lady passed me, I was like, holy shit,
*  like, I'm a real comedian now.
*  Yeah, man. Like, I don't have to be scared.
*  I just have to keep working. Yeah.
*  I got passed. Yeah.
*  But the godmother, the real godmother. Yeah.
*  And you like you work for that lady. That's right.
*  You were there all the time, man. I know.
*  Can't go back. She made us.
*  She she created an environment that accelerated comedy.
*  Yeah, man.
*  She pushed comedy because she kept it together.
*  But like at the fucking highest RP,
*  like at 9000 RPMs of the engines going.
*  She kept it together.
*  You let these comics be wild.
*  You remember when Ari slapped Bobby Lee?
*  Of course I remember.
*  I know that's when he started getting spots.
*  Is that true? Yeah.
*  You know, I know, because I was jealous.
*  I was a talent.
*  Ari like I remember Ari's gradually unraveling into his comedic self.
*  And like I remember like Ari smacks Bobby Lee.
*  I don't know. There's a fight between Ari and Bobby Lee.
*  And I remember as the talent coordinator, that was when Mitzi started.
*  He's now a comic somewhere in that, like in that,
*  like throwing off of rationality in that.
*  I don't know what it was, man.
*  Like, you know, you know, here's the most important part of Mitzi.
*  She was a woman.
*  She was a woman and she encouraged chaos.
*  She wasn't in remotely concerned with safety.
*  She wanted wild people, man.
*  No, dude, she wanted me to be wild.
*  That's what she wanted. She wanted wild comedy.
*  She wanted Kinnison.
*  She wanted Pryor.
*  She wanted everyone that came in between.
*  Damon Wayans. Yeah, man.
*  She wanted she wanted wild.
*  She wanted Martin Lawrence.
*  She wanted wild. She wanted.
*  Yeah, she wasn't domestic.
*  Mitzi was feral. Mitzi was a feral lady.
*  Mitzi was a human.
*  I mean, that and what we call human now, people think of as feral or what people.
*  No, I mean, I mean, but when I say feral, I mean, I know what you mean.
*  Exceptional. She was wild.
*  She didn't have anybody else's rules holding her back.
*  No, she didn't. And she didn't fucking care.
*  She didn't care. She didn't care about money.
*  Oh, fuck you.
*  That's the most important thing about her is like having a club on the Sunset Strip
*  and not making decisions based on money.
*  Because let me tell you, man, as a talent coordinator,
*  there are plenty of times where people wanted to film some shit in the main room
*  where they wanted to pay a lot of money.
*  And she'd be like, no, get it now. Tell them the fuck.
*  We should talk about that, because that was like one of the things about that club.
*  Was that like you could never film anything? No.
*  That was one of the most amazing things about Ari filming his special there.
*  It was a really cool thing he did.
*  It was also like an acknowledgement that the world had changed.
*  And that was one of the reasons why I was willing to come back,
*  because Ari filmed his shit in the OR.
*  Well, she would have.
*  I really do believe she would have approved that eventually.
*  Sure. But somebody would have got involved.
*  They would have fucked it up.
*  She would have made him jump through some hoops.
*  It wouldn't have been that easy.
*  Like she would have made him do some crazy shit.
*  She's right. Here's the thing. She's right.
*  You know, I didn't I didn't cash any of my checks.
*  You probably know that.
*  Oh, I remember.
*  I don't like when I was working at the store, I just wouldn't cash my checks.
*  And then they would go, hey, we have like all this money that you just like,
*  can I donate it to the sound system?
*  You bought the sound system.
*  I did that, too. But that was that was extra.
*  That was on top of that.
*  Because the sound system was fucking up.
*  And then you bought it.
*  And honestly, Mitzi didn't want you to do that because like
*  that was the thing.
*  Like she wrecked.
*  She was smart enough to know if I let a comedian
*  buy the sound system, I can't.
*  Like honestly, give them spots like so.
*  I knew that was the case.
*  But I was like, at this point, she's giving me spots every fucking weekend.
*  I just want to help out.
*  Let's stop playing games like, come on, you know what I'm doing.
*  I'm out here doing my best stand up.
*  I can. We got a fucked up speaker system.
*  Let's fix it.
*  It was fucked up. I put a DAT system in there.
*  I put a mini disc and I have it set up so anybody could like,
*  if you had a mini disc, remember the mini disc days?
*  Of course.
*  Dude, it was so important before smartphones to be able to record your shows.
*  Yeah, it's so big.
*  And you don't record and listen to all of them.
*  But the option to be able to do that is so huge.
*  Even if you're not diligent, you still gain like 10, 20 percent
*  of like tightening of your act.
*  Dude, the Comedy Store at that time, for lack of a better word, was an art cult.
*  Yeah, that's what it was.
*  It was a cult and like it was a cult that was like
*  for sure, like all cult systems are based on like a strong,
*  charismatic, central leader.
*  There was Mitzi.
*  But you know what, as a man, I was happy to relent to Mitzi.
*  Well, yeah.
*  But there was a thing for me as like this macho man.
*  It was important.
*  It was important to relent to Mitzi.
*  You had to.
*  But it wasn't just that I had to.
*  I wanted to to show
*  respect, to show that I got it, to show that I know what you did.
*  Yeah, man. Like that lady, man, when I was in fucking Boston in 88,
*  I would hear about her.
*  She loved comedy.
*  This one lady did this like, yeah, she was married to a comedian,
*  but it didn't work out.
*  And she's Polly Shore's mom.
*  And I would hear these stories and I'd be like, that's crazy.
*  This one lady just figured it out.
*  She was wild and she liked the party and she like, man,
*  and she was just a wild lady.
*  But she was brutal with you.
*  She didn't like your comedy.
*  She would just tell you, you were done.
*  She would just tell you if you thought you weren't funny.
*  Dude, she put her hand on my wrist.
*  She goes, you're really funny.
*  And I'll never forget that.
*  Oh, it was like 1994.
*  I was like, oh, my God.
*  Well, she wouldn't hand that out lightly, man.
*  That was the thing is like she was like that.
*  I've been around it, man.
*  Like so it's so weird.
*  I'm so lucky because I got to be around like Ram Dass of Mitzi Shore.
*  And like they're similar in a way.
*  Yes, they are similar.
*  Yeah, there's a there's a lot of you know, like this idea of what we think of
*  as perspective, perspective.
*  Yeah, dude.
*  And he was an artist before when I was six years into comedy,
*  her putting her hand on my wrist and telling me I'm really funny changed my life.
*  Look, to me, the thing that like.
*  Will never be captured is that it's not just that here you have this
*  like tiny woman who is tiny, tiny,
*  but it's not just that you have this being so careful when I would hug her.
*  Yeah. Right. Remember hugging Mitzi? Yeah.
*  Yeah. Well, she was a gangster.
*  I mean, that was all like the thing about Mitzi was like, no, like imagine
*  like the best thing to think of is like, think of your most like outlaw comedian.
*  Then imagine a person who built a saloon
*  within which those comedians could be grown to be more of an outlaw.
*  There was no Kenison without Mitzi Shore. That's right.
*  But then the most to me, like with Mitzi, if you were to go
*  and she would never allow that she'd already if she heard me saying any of this
*  shit, she'd get fired.
*  But like if you were going to write a Mitzi Bible
*  and you wanted to like base the whole Bible on one thing,
*  it was something she told me so many times as a talent coordinator.
*  And I like to fantasize. She thought I was funny.
*  But as a talent coordinator, something she told me over and over and over again
*  regarding comedians was.
*  You don't need them.
*  They need you.
*  That was her like core thing, which is like the moment
*  that a comedian starts thinking that they need the system,
*  then they degrade themselves.
*  They have to understand that their comedic ability
*  and who they are is that persona, which she would say is like
*  their iconoclast.
*  She meant like you're not going to find anyone like this ever again.
*  And that's who she was trying to find.
*  She would say, therefore, you it's supply and demand, which is like
*  there is nothing like you, but there's a lot of things like them.
*  So if you think that you need them, you will degrade yourself as an artist.
*  That was her main core truth, which is don't get caught up in the thing
*  they're going to try to teach you, which is you need them.
*  You don't need the manager.
*  You don't need the agent.
*  You don't need the studio.
*  You don't need anything because you are funny.
*  You are the fucking nuclear isotope generating energy.
*  And if you get lost in this insanity that you require the system to be great,
*  not only do you grade yourself, you degrade an art.
*  But, you know, this is one of the things about recognizing what
*  Mitch Shore did and a lot of Bud Friedman, a lot of people own clubs.
*  Rodney Dangerfield is it's not just about the ideas
*  and getting the ideas out in a way the audience can digest.
*  It's setting up a club.
*  It's bringing people in.
*  It's setting a standard where people know, hey, man, David Letterman came out of here.
*  Robin Williams came out of here.
*  Yeah. OK. Bill Hicks came out.
*  Bill Hicks was a fucking doorman here.
*  Sam Kinnison came out of here. OK.
*  This is the motherfucking comedy story.
*  Yeah. There's a standard.
*  Yeah. That's a factor, too, man.
*  You can't let the artists
*  completely be in control because one charismatic artist
*  with a lot of fucking song and dance moves can trick people into thinking
*  things that aren't necessarily accurate because of charisma.
*  That's true, man.
*  Like that she figured that out, though. Yeah.
*  And we need another one of her, man.
*  I mean, like the thing never going to get another Mitzi.
*  But we can carry on her legacy.
*  We all learn from her, you know,
*  and I think she was uniquely qualified.
*  To run the comedy store because she wasn't a comic,
*  she had no desire to be a comic, but she was married to a comic
*  and she knew exactly what comics were.
*  Her son was a comic. Yeah.
*  She knew exactly what comics were.
*  And she wasn't stupid.
*  She was smart and she was.
*  But she also didn't give a fuck.
*  Like there's a there's a rare group of people that legitimately
*  don't give a fuck.
*  If Mitzi Shore was alive today, if we could somehow or another
*  like go back in time and grab Mitzi Shore from 1974 and bring her 2020,
*  she would just be running shit.
*  She would just be running shit.
*  First of all, she would have a hundred girls under contract
*  for like only fans accounts.
*  She would just run people.
*  I'll tell you the one time that part that's part.
*  It's not true. The only fans, the only fans.
*  It's conjecture, but I'll tell you the one time you have a problem
*  with only fans, the porn site.
*  It's not a porn site, though.
*  It's like girls can do whatever they want.
*  I don't have a problem with sex.
*  Like I like I have a problem with my own inability to like regulate
*  my desire to come.
*  But I'm like, I can't get mad at the world for that.
*  Like that conversation with some with someone.
*  And they were saying, well, also, she has an only fan site.
*  Like, hmm, if I had big tits, I'd be like getting paid for those big.
*  I'm so tired of these sex negative fucks, man.
*  They ramped up the lockdown, though, because it became a course.
*  It should be easy job. Yes.
*  For a lot of people.
*  If I was 22 and I had big tits.
*  And I like to do squats and I was sitting around thinking, do I
*  do I want to work at Burger King?
*  Or do I want to shake my ass
*  for 10 bucks a month for 35000 guys? Yeah.
*  It doesn't have to just be that, though, either.
*  It's not just a porn site. You can do whatever you it's Patreon for.
*  Right. This is madness.
*  So only fans can wear out.
*  You could just do yoga.
*  But Joe, in like a dimension where like being funny is getting people to come.
*  You'd be like the top porn star that dimension.
*  It's just that's a weird one, right?
*  Like getting people to come is so specific.
*  What's the big deal? It doesn't matter.
*  It shouldn't be a big deal. But yet it is.
*  Like if you find out that somebody came, it's not a big deal.
*  It shouldn't be. But it is.
*  It is right now because we're lunatics.
*  Like we hate life. Like we're in a. Exactly.
*  Yeah. We're we're we're we're so death centric that like
*  anything that's the source of life, which is a hand job, a blow job.
*  Fucking we look at that as like being depraved.
*  You know, well, it's it's really just some sort of weird canyon
*  ladder in between two fucking cliffs, between this and what is going to be
*  available for people in just a few years.
*  There's going to be virtual sex.
*  You got to have Riley Reid on, man.
*  She's so great. Like I don't know.
*  I guess you have her on and I'll take my pants off.
*  What I'm going to do is she's so funny.
*  She's goggles on.
*  This this is the future.
*  Goggles put goggles on.
*  You lay back. You're in another world.
*  Well, yeah, I mean, that's heaven.
*  But like, but is it?
*  Yes. No.
*  What's wrong with coming?
*  Because there's one percent of your brain that knows it's bullshit.
*  Why is no real girl and they don't really like you and your jokes suck
*  and you kind of smell and you didn't brush your teeth that good. Yeah.
*  Yeah. But she's like, I love that part of you.
*  No, the girl. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
*  If the girl really did love that part of you, that would be extraordinary.
*  See, that's the beauty of alcohol.
*  Alcohol is you're hanging out with a girl who's got a like Hello Kitty tattoo
*  in between her thumb and forefinger.
*  And you guys are drinking, you have a good time.
*  And you're like, I love you.
*  And she's like, I love you, too.
*  And you just give each other a hug.
*  It doesn't even have to be sexual.
*  That's where alcohol comes in. Where?
*  Where? What do you mean?
*  What do you mean?
*  I'm following you in the I the Hello Kitty.
*  The where does alcohol come in?
*  That's where alcohol comes in.
*  And like it allows you to take chances and hope that the other person
*  doesn't have ulterior motives.
*  We both release your ambitions and let's go to Vegas and get married.
*  I don't even know you. Let's go crazy.
*  How crazy is it? We think fucking's bad.
*  It's not that we think fucking's bad.
*  Is that we worry you fuck too many people?
*  Why? Why is that a word?
*  You got tricked too many times.
*  You're like one of those people at one of those David Blaine Street shows.
*  And you're like, it's going to be the queen of hearts. Trust me.
*  Isn't that wild? It's like it's the great.
*  It's one of the great things.
*  It really is one of the great things.
*  Like, think of like any time.
*  Like, you know why? Why?
*  Because we're concentrated
*  more on innovation and progress in terms of numbers.
*  Like so weird.
*  But earning money.
*  And getting new projects passed through.
*  They take precedent over everything else.
*  So sick. It's weird.
*  But it's just it's a weird game.
*  This is what I'm getting out of this book Irresistible.
*  It's like there's things that we have in our head where we're we're
*  we have these.
*  They're wrong.
*  We have these ideas of what we need.
*  Right. In order to be sufficient, like here's we're operating from the wrong principles.
*  Wait, I'm sorry, Joe. I got to pee.
*  I've been holding for like 10 minutes.
*  I'm sorry. I don't want it to end, man.
*  We don't have to end. Go.
*  This is the first show ever on Spotify.
*  I can't believe I get to be here.
*  I got to go. I looked on your your go.
*  He broke. Go.
*  I wasn't even Jesus. Go pee.
*  No voting. There's no voting.
*  God, isn't he funny?
*  I wasn't even in the voting.
*  Duncan Trussell, I wanted you to be guest number one.
*  It's important.
*  Guest number two.
*  Miley Cyrus. That's right.
*  Number two. That's what I said.
*  I said guest number two.
*  Yeah, you don't even listen.
*  We're like an old married couple, Jamie.
*  I said guest number two.
*  I'm drunk. I'm high.
*  Guest number two is Miley Cyrus.
*  Guest number three.
*  Mike Motherfucking Tyson.
*  How about that?
*  Jamie, are you concerned at all about moving to Texas?
*  No. That's what I like about you.
*  It's one of many things.
*  But you're ready to roll.
*  Like I just tell the people at home, I brought it up with Jamie.
*  I'm like, I'm thinking about moving to Texas.
*  Jamie goes, OK.
*  Is that accurate?
*  Yeah, I mean, it's going to happen.
*  Something was coming. Some change.
*  What did you think was going to happen?
*  What was worst case scenario like Montana?
*  No, I didn't think that was going to happen.
*  I just didn't want you to not want to do it.
*  I wasn't worried about it.
*  Good. Happy.
*  This, you know, it's hard.
*  I feel like I'm prolonging this out of a neurotic desire for it.
*  You're not prolonging anything. This is fine.
*  Jamie and I just had a love fest.
*  Oh, that's great. I do feel like I'm doing it.
*  I was asking Jamie if there was ever a time where I was telling him
*  we're moving to Texas where he was like, oh, like, I don't want to do that.
*  He's like, no.
*  But when I brought it up, I'm like, what do you think?
*  He's like, OK. That's cool.
*  I do feel like I'm stretching it out.
*  It's like, man, I mean, man, this is the first episode on Spotify.
*  I love it. It's supposed to be you.
*  I love it. It's beautiful.
*  But also, there's a piece of me that I think we can work things out together.
*  I really do. I think you and me together have a unique perspective.
*  And I'm not bullshit. I agree.
*  And I don't think it's I'm not taking ownership.
*  And you shouldn't either.
*  It's the two of us together.
*  There's a weird thing that happens.
*  I feel it, man.
*  Like, look, it's my favorite thing, which is why I don't want it to end,
*  which is why I'm like, I like to like, look, man, I'm a Buddhist.
*  I know I'm going to die.
*  What does that mean, though?
*  When you say you're a Buddhist, shouldn't we have a new thing?
*  You said like communism, socialism.
*  Can we have a new one?
*  I think we can.
*  But I do want to like the reason I'm going to speak up for Buddhism in general.
*  And I agree with you.
*  And what I love about Buddhism so much is that, man,
*  what's great about it is it invites you to reject it.
*  It says to you, the first part of it is like, reject this if you can.
*  Like if you can find a flaw in the thing, reject it.
*  And also, if you can find a like legitimate rejection,
*  then we will add that to the like what Buddhism is a Buddhism.
*  Yes. So that's what I love about it, because it's more of a process.
*  That's that's perfect.
*  Yeah, it's perfect.
*  And it has to be that way.
*  It has to be that way.
*  But if you're thinking about how to progress with ideas.
*  Yeah, man. You have to be able to say, hey, bring me a counter idea
*  that makes more sense and I'll reconsider it.
*  But it's what we were talking about earlier.
*  People are married to their goddamn ideas. It's sad.
*  It's it's it's not just sad.
*  It is sad for sure.
*  But it's also it's bad for all of us.
*  And it's it's one of those things that we should recognize, just like,
*  you know, like negative feedback, like, oh, I'm so fat.
*  Oh, I'm such a fucking loser.
*  Everybody admits that that is not good for you.
*  And it actually hinders process. Yeah.
*  And I progress.
*  I think that it hinders progress as well.
*  I think we have to look at things in a more positive way.
*  That's so weird, dude.
*  I like it. I was.
*  There's this teacher, Jack Kornfield. He's so smart.
*  He's a Buddhist teacher.
*  And I remember, like in the early days of the Ram Dass retreats,
*  I would do these podcasts with him.
*  And I remember being like, I want to get in shape.
*  I feel like I'm fat.
*  And what he said to me was get in shape because you love yourself,
*  not because you hate yourself.
*  Don't get in shape because because you are
*  angry at who you are right now.
*  Get in shape because you think you deserve to be in shape.
*  That's cute. That sounds like you guys never been fat.
*  Listen to me, pussy. Hey, he's not a pussy.
*  Competition's real, motherfucker.
*  Sometimes you just got to get in shape because you don't look at fat.
*  Shaming works.
*  This is people don't like to admit that that shame makes you fucking lose weight
*  because you don't want to feel bad.
*  Listen, you feel good because you lost all the weight.
*  I have to stick up for Jack Kornfield because he is one of the great teachers.
*  Take up for him, too.
*  And you would love him.
*  And you would love you.
*  I love him if he's friends with you. I love him.
*  Thank you, Joe.
*  But I do have to stick up for him.
*  But just just like an example of how bad ass this person is.
*  Do you want to move to Texas?
*  No, I can't. I'm going.
*  I'm not saying sure.
*  I don't want to be local. I have an idea.
*  I think you and I together can fix a lot of shit.
*  What's the plan, man?
*  You and me do like a weekly podcast one a week.
*  Joe and Duncan. I love it.
*  Live from Austin. I love it.
*  But it's not going to happen in Austin. Why not?
*  We'll zoom for a while until you come to your senses.
*  We'll do it off camera. This conversation.
*  I love this conversation, though.
*  Listen, man, not bullshit.
*  I'm not bullshitting.
*  I would do just about anything for you, Joe.
*  I would do just about anything for you.
*  I know you would. I would.
*  Now, look, I got to stick up for this teacher, though.
*  And I'm sorry. We can zoom it.
*  We can zoom it. Hold on.
*  What teacher? Jack Kornfield, Joe.
*  And I love you, man.
*  I love you, too.
*  But you got to understand, this is like a person is deeply
*  impacted me and and like he was a monk and I know him as a friend.
*  And like he's a monk.
*  OK, in the sense that he went here's what's cool about him.
*  He went to he became a monastic Theravadan Buddhist.
*  And he like took a vow of silence for like two years.
*  So for two years, he didn't talk.
*  Is it possible he didn't have anything good to say?
*  Oh, no, no, man.
*  Jack Kornfield.
*  Look, listen, I really like he really like I'm sorry.
*  I don't mean to be sentimental about somebody. I'm just joking.
*  I know you're joking. When did he die?
*  He's alive. Joe. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
*  You said sentimental. I panicked.
*  I mean, sentimental only in that, like,
*  I wouldn't want to do anything that would like negatively impact like a real.
*  We get him on a show.
*  First time on your show. You, me and Jack Kornfield.
*  You would love it. You love that.
*  Our first episode that convinced you to move to Austin, Texas.
*  I would I would come to Austin, Texas to move.
*  No. What about your house? Would you live in it?
*  Joe, I love that you would buy me a house, but I wouldn't move.
*  You know, it's cool.
*  Like, one of the cool things about us is you could say, I will buy you a house.
*  That's not why I would want to be with you for the house.
*  Or I know. I know, man.
*  And I understand. But like for me, it's like I was off camera.
*  I will talk to you about the reason we made the decision.
*  Oh, listen, you made an amazing decision.
*  Yeah. Your decision is way better than mine.
*  But I don't I'm jealous.
*  I don't want to be local. Like to me, I get it.
*  We do a Zoom show.
*  Let's do a Zoom show or listen, you and I have known each other for so long.
*  We could do both or either. Exactly.
*  We could do Zoom shows. That's what I think.
*  We could do live shows.
*  I just think like the right now, the best thing for the world
*  is not to imagine that you have to be in any given GPS coordinate.
*  I think that, yeah, the best thing for the world is to begin to realize, like,
*  we don't need to be tethered to a particular locality.
*  Like, this is the problem. It's like.
*  It's a bit of the problem, but it's also in recognizing that it is an actual like
*  it's a thing that you factor into the world that you see.
*  But how relevant is it to day to day operations?
*  Right. That's what I'm talking about.
*  That's the to me, like the gift of COVID has been like
*  people have begun to realize like, wait, your circle small.
*  Google is doing fine and no one's going to Google to go to work.
*  Twitter is doing fine.
*  No one's going to the Twitter building to work.
*  Netflix. They have jobs.
*  Dude, people are all working remotely.
*  No one's going to Netflix.
*  Oh, what you're saying is that the businesses are doing well,
*  but no one's going to the actual business.
*  They don't have to. Why do they have to?
*  Exactly.
*  Dude, that to me, that is the if you want to like start really like restructuring society,
*  let's start with a superstition that you need to be in
*  in like a like proximity of another person's body.
*  But goddamn, that kills New York City.
*  Yeah, it kills L.A. too. It kills L.A.
*  It kills L.A. That's why I want you to come to Austin.
*  Dude, I will be at whenever you want.
*  I'll come to Austin.
*  No, bring your baby.
*  He would love I can't wait for you to meet a little for us.
*  He's so brilliant.
*  But but my point is, look, my point is like we can't be centralized.
*  Like, look, you're going to be in Austin.
*  I'm going to be in a certain place. I don't want to say yet.
*  It's a bunker outside of Nevada.
*  Yeah, somewhere near Barstow where the bats take over.
*  We're going to fight against centralization
*  so that we don't have to get chained to shitty cities.
*  Like that's the whole point is like, look, if anything happens after COVID,
*  it's beautiful.
*  It will be that all the commuters say to their bosses, wait a minute.
*  For the last six months, I've been zooming in for these fucking conferences.
*  And your business is doing just as well as it did when I was driving an hour
*  to get there an hour back.
*  And then the moment that happens, we break the back of addiction
*  to being in a metropolis.
*  Now we have a global society.
*  Now it's not just that you have to have some person who's like living in an Angelino.
*  It's like you could have someone from any part of the planet.
*  Centralization seems to be the fundamental problem in the sense that it was it worked.
*  We needed to centralize prior to the Internet.
*  But now we don't need to centralize.
*  No one better for everybody if we take into account every idea.
*  It's better for everybody if we take into account
*  all the dumb ideas and smart ideas and let them battle it out.
*  Yeah. Let's find out who's right. Yeah.
*  And you got to be real careful.
*  People who think that they're right and the other people are wrong.
*  It's what we were talking about earlier
*  that bums me out the most about the Democratic convention.
*  Is it I would just like to forget about whatever you don't like about Trump.
*  Tell me what you're going to do.
*  Don't tell me how bad the orange man is.
*  Tell me what you're going to do.
*  Yeah. How are you going to fix it?
*  How are you going to fix it? Yeah.
*  What are you going to do?
*  We can do about Flint, Michigan's water.
*  What are you going to do about the fucking earth is heating up?
*  What are you going to do about? There's no fish.
*  Where's the fish? Right.
*  What are you going to do? Yeah.
*  Nobody has an idea.
*  They just want to talk shit and make sure everybody's trans.
*  I would rather them talk shit and make sure everyone's trans
*  than be like what's happening now.
*  I don't mean that trans people. I'm with you.
*  I know you look here.
*  Here's what's funny to me about your whole like pushback against the trans community.
*  It's not. It's only pushback about trans people competing as females and fighting.
*  That's it. But other athletics a little bit, but fighting in a big way.
*  To me, the part of it that's like interesting is I know you well enough to know
*  that if and prove me wrong here,
*  but if there was a technology that allowed turn a guy into a woman.
*  No, they could not just turn a guy into a woman, which is very funny,
*  because right now that's what we're doing.
*  And it makes sense because it's like right now what we know is men and women.
*  Right. So that's where we're at.
*  So right now, as far as our understanding of what can a human be,
*  if you want to break it into a binary, we've got men and women. Right.
*  But that's pretty limited to me.
*  You know what I mean? And I get wanting to be a woman.
*  And I think that you, Joe Rogan,
*  if there was a technology that could instantly turn you into a woman,
*  you wouldn't hesitate to turn into a woman.
*  I'd like to feel a dick inside me. Yeah, exactly. That's what I'm saying.
*  As a woman. Yeah. And I don't think it made me gay.
*  No, exactly. Doesn't make you gay. Trust me.
*  As someone who's felt many dicks inside of them, it doesn't make you gay.
*  I'm just kidding.
*  If you could be a woman and actually be attracted to a male
*  for 18 hours, you're in love.
*  Imagine if you have an Oculus Rift
*  and they make you go through a bunch of waivers and they say, Duncan,
*  if you do take the next step,
*  what happens is you become a woman who actually feels the way a woman feels
*  when she's attracted to a man. And a guy,
*  with a dick like a battering ram,
*  let me try. Just going to send it home. See what happens. You can't wait.
*  You want to feel him come inside your upper rib cavity.
*  I want to feel it. Sign me up. Yeah.
*  Who cares? The point is like,
*  the weakest among us would be scared of that experience. Right.
*  Well, you'd be scared that that experience weakens them and turns them into
*  something that they, they, they dismiss.
*  But how hilarious is it that they, sorry, Joe. No, no, it's,
*  it's their own issue. No,
*  it's the experience that literally made them exist on the planet.
*  They feel like if they were to feel it,
*  it would be something against who they are, which is insanity.
*  In the sense that the very,
*  see the very feeling of a cock blowing cum
*  inside your body. You switch spots with your woman.
*  Imagine if the only way a woman was willing to marry you is if
*  you become the wife and she becomes the husband, right?
*  And you switch consciousness. You have to feel it. Duncan. I love you.
*  I love you too, Priscilla.
*  I want to know what it feels like to be you. Yeah. I want to be with you.
*  Yeah. But I want, I want to be you for four years. Yeah. Let's swap.
*  Imagine a four year contract. Yeah.
*  Where all of your secrets get downloaded into your wife's brain.
*  Let's swap. He likes feet.
*  That's not a secret. Imagine though.
*  No, that's the idea is like, the point is like right now we're like terrestrialized.
*  Like, like we're,
*  the reason we're hanging out on planet earth is not because we decided to be here
*  or hanging out on planet earth because there's not other planets that we could
*  fly to to be here.
*  Even if we could, we haven't figured this one out yet. Right. But it does.
*  If there were other planets and we could get there, trust me,
*  this is what's funny to me about like Lindsey Graham. I love Lindsey Graham.
*  He's such a fucking asshole, but I feel for, I feel a weird connection to him.
*  He's such a fucking asshole, but like Lindsey Graham,
*  I have the feeling that if suddenly there was like the ability to travel through
*  space, he would leave the planet within seconds.
*  He would just be gone. The Lindsey Graham is like, here's what I think America is.
*  Religious guy. No, he's a politician. Lindsey Graham is just like, like,
*  pig religion. No, he's like, poor Lindsey Graham, man. He's like,
*  he like got, he's a weak chin. I have a weak fucking chin. Yeah.
*  Dude, wait till I shave my beard. No, listen, bro. That guy, no, Lindsey Graham.
*  Look, I know Lindsey Graham. He like got sucked into a dark vortex.
*  He's a sweetheart underneath it all. And also he's like, he's like a gay dude.
*  You know, he's like a gay dude who like has, but what I'm saying is like,
*  what is he saying? What is gay dude that has like a man?
*  Lindsey Graham causes problems because like a dude that what he like is a,
*  he's a, he's a suppressive being that like, it's like aligns with closet.
*  No, not a closeted thing. It's not the gay dude is in the part. The, the,
*  it doesn't matter if Lindsey Graham's gay. That's not what I'm saying.
*  You brought it up. So it must matter.
*  No, what I'm saying is like his shit came out about him being gay and like,
*  then he had to fight it or like there was like something I felt bad for him in
*  that regard. I feel bad about.
*  But don't you think for him even like it would be if he just said, I'm gay.
*  Yeah. Or I'm not like that's it.
*  That's the argument against these two ideas.
*  If you could turn into a woman and get fucked, like you just said,
*  would you be gay?
*  Good question. No, you would just be a woman who got fucked.
*  But like somehow if like you're,
*  if you've decided to centralize on your masculine identity and someone fucks you,
*  now you're gay.
*  The whole like conceptualization of gayness and straightness is just monkey
*  talk.
*  Is the problem the word itself?
*  The problem is a binary. It's like the definition.
*  Like it's a straight. It's a binary dude. It's like, look, I don't know.
*  I like whatever the fuck it is that you think is like limiting your ability to
*  experience pleasure on the earth is Satan.
*  And it's like,
*  if that thing is telling you that you're a dude and this is the only way you can
*  feel joy, but I'm like simultaneously,
*  you're like hanging out with a guy who's like the same gender as you and you're
*  falling in love with him. And then you're,
*  you're pretending you're not because because like some devil voice in your mind
*  is telling you that's Satan, man. That's evil. That's fucking evil. It's dark.
*  It's dark. And I'm not like deriding Lindsey Graham sexual proclivities.
*  I'm just saying he's not actively gay. I don't know that.
*  All I'm saying is like,
*  why are you shaming him? I'm not shaming Lindsey Graham. I feel like you are.
*  No, I'm not. I'm saying it'd be nice to admit your privilege.
*  I hope Lindsey Graham is listening to this cause I'm not insulting you.
*  My friend, you can hear from my voice that I'm not insulting you.
*  I'm just saying darkness. My old Joe,
*  I'm telling you if Lindsey Graham could fly off the planet, he would.
*  That's what I think.
*  I fly off the planet with a man's mouth on his penis. Who wouldn't
*  do that? I don't care.
*  I don't care if it was what fueled the spaceship or didn't.
*  That would be amazing. Why wouldn't you do that?
*  How awesome would that be?
*  If it was the mountain from Game of Thrones,
*  that guy's blowing you as you fly through space.
*  How your orgasm extends to eternity.
*  Yeah. The whole like gay straight thing really falls apart.
*  Pink Floyd, I wish you were here.
*  Sound of silence. I was trying to work it in there, but can't find the cue.
*  But the gay straight thing falls apart if we stop being terrestrial.
*  Like the moment you're not on the planet anymore, it's all planetary based memes,
*  man. It's like the moment we're like released from the gravity,
*  well all the stuff that seems so important to dumbasses,
*  which is like what? You, you thought you would put your mouth on a penis.
*  You must be crazy.
*  Imagine if it felt amazing. Imagine like, man,
*  I never blow a fucking guy and you get that dick in your mouth.
*  And the moment that sperm hits your tongue, it's like pop rocks. Yeah.
*  Pop pop pop pop pop. And your brain goes,
*  you and I, man, we will suckle on a,
*  we will suckle on a mucus thing. That's like a vagina.
*  We'll do that. We pride ourselves on it. We pride ourselves.
*  The end of a water park slide.
*  That's what I love so much about Christina Pazitzky's Instagram.
*  And she does these like fucking hilarious TikTok clips that she recovers from
*  TikTok.
*  And there's a whole genre of TikTok of these creepy fucking pervs who are like
*  showing how they lick pussy.
*  And like the whole TikTok is based on them like going,
*  uh, it's so fucked up. But it's like a guy will,
*  in the masculine sense will go down on a girl.
*  Yet the concept of having a dick in your mouth is considered to be like fucked
*  up. Like you must be like a complete, like you, something about you is weak.
*  You know, I think we're going to have to contend with that.
*  What's this? That's the dude. What's he doing?
*  He does like how, like he'd like watch this. You gotta watch it, man.
*  What's he do?
*  This guy does like, like eating pussy.
*  That's what he's doing. Yeah. Watch, watch this. Watch this one.
*  Doesn't do it. He like, he like eases into it.
*  Her, by the way, her Instagram, the TikTok she does,
*  like she should do a whole show based on her. Like she,
*  she like curates the most fucked up TikToks you've ever seen.
*  Isn't that important? Like TikTok,
*  whether it's TikTok or Instagram or any of these things,
*  isn't that important?
*  How did I do that? It kind of is, right? Yeah.
*  Lowering the boundaries, like, uh,
*  dropping down the boundaries for people to be able to enter into the world of
*  expressing whatever weirdo idea they have or video of them doing backflips onto
*  a fucking whale, whatever they're doing. Yeah.
*  It's a bad, I, I, I don't like TikTok in the sense that like,
*  I've never even opened it.
*  She's into TikTok and I don't like it cause she's always looking at TikTok.
*  And then I'll be like, really? You're looking at TikTok? And she'll be like,
*  you're on Twitter all day long.
*  You should get off Twitter. You should read this book.
*  I hate Twitter.
*  This book Irresistible. It's a mind blower, man. It really is.
*  Cause it lets you realize that as much as we're at each other's throats right
*  now, I don't know how much of it is our fault.
*  And I think we could have been a lot better off if someone decided instead of
*  trying to make money, that they would recognize that this strategy of,
*  whether it's social media likes or Twitter,
*  you know, Twitter, Twitter or Facebook,
*  or whether it's showing you the things you get angry about and you comment on
*  Facebook or YouTube, like whatever we're doing,
*  like ultimately we're changing the path of the way people think.
*  We're way more malleable than we like to think we are. Way more.
*  And I think people that have a voice,
*  whether it's you or I or Ari or Bert or Tom or anybody who has a podcast in
*  particular, because if you have a podcast at the very least,
*  no one's telling you what you can't talk about. No one's put Duncan.
*  I love that segment.
*  But when you're talking about people not conforming and trying to figure that
*  themselves out, people are thinking you're non-binary or somehow or another.
*  You're like, you're like, you're not woke.
*  Sorry. I'll repeat what I said. I'm sorry. I'll revise.
*  We're in the middle of a storm, Duncan. Yeah. Well, we, what the main thing,
*  the most important thing I think in the storm, and it's easy to forget,
*  is is that like you and I and everybody we run across,
*  I've yet to meet somebody who's a real monster, man.
*  There's a few, but even them, they just need hugs.
*  They're also very unique when you run across. It's very unique. And like the,
*  anytime I feel like this is where I'm like, I'm attuned to this.
*  Anytime I get this in someone's wanting me not to express myself,
*  that's where I get really locked in and really like,
*  and I get the whole like anti-woke thing because nobody wants some fucking liberal
*  Baptist piece of shit to tell them how to be. But you know, man,
*  like the moment I'm on my Instagram, I did a Black Lives Matter thing.
*  That's the only time anybody told me to shut up.
*  No one told me to shut up before that.
*  But the moment I did a thing that was in alignment with like Black Lives Matter,
*  there was all of a sudden like this weird similarity of people hitting me up
*  being like, you, you fucking woke me.
*  There was a lot of blowback from that. And also,
*  when you say a lot, like how many?
*  Enough that like I noticed it.
*  But if you tune in at not a huge percentage,
*  like 30 messages, how many messages? No, not 30, just enough.
*  I'm going to say like five, 15, 15,
*  enough where like I realize how many Instagram followers do you have?
*  I don't remember, dude. I can look it up right now.
*  Like not 200,000 or something. I don't know.
*  No, but, but I know what you're saying, but it was like,
*  I realized that like my thinking regarding being like even remotely and a
*  political activist was being shaped by my fear that a tiny percentage of my
*  audience would reject me.
*  And that's what I'm saying is like I was letting my ship get steered,
*  not by my own intuition or not by my own sense of like, fuck man,
*  like that fucking George Floyd video, that's unforgivable.
*  That shit's fucked up.
*  You know, it's, it's, it's both. It's unforgivable.
*  Any man that would do that to another man, like that man needs help.
*  I bet he didn't think he was going to kill that guy,
*  but he tortured that guy for eight minutes and 46 seconds. It's like,
*  that guy needs, he needs, uh, he needs a DMT trip. He needs something.
*  He needs to recognize who he is. It's also Duncan. I think,
*  I think we're asking people to do things they're not really qualified to do.
*  They don't have the tools to handle it.
*  They don't have the infrastructure to handle the load of pressure that comes in.
*  I just feel like all these people that, and then right now we're,
*  we're so anti-cop, it's like, it's over the top.
*  Well, look, man, what I love about you is that you're like,
*  not afraid to say a thing like that. And like, I think if we're going to go,
*  if we're going to move forward right now, we need cops. But no,
*  if we're going to move forward, what we need is not just cops.
*  We need compassion. Like if we're going to move forward,
*  what we need is it's like, look, man, you're, you're right.
*  This country was completely founded on human trafficking.
*  You're right that your, your idea that like the, the way,
*  like if you're, if you have a particular complexion in this country,
*  shit is immediately against you. You're completely right about that.
*  You're right. Like the thing is, is like, this is the problem is like,
*  and I think this is an important question for everybody to ask themselves is how
*  do you act when you're right? That's how,
*  that's how you can really tell a person.
*  You know what I think? Honestly,
*  I think we are looking for change the way we see change in ourself.
*  Like we see a potential for change in ourself. We see something wrong. We go,
*  I got to correct that. And then we think that society can do that too,
*  but society is like a battleship.
*  It's like a 500 meter long steel structure that has to
*  planes land on it.
*  That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's a good description.
*  And then people like, fuck you.
*  We don't like people from fucking Muslim countries.
*  Fuck you. Trans women are real women.
*  Yeah. Right.
*  And it's this battle to try to like navigate this enormous metal structure
*  through the fucking ocean.
*  And that's where we're at. That's where that's why you gotta do a podcast.
*  With me, Duncan. Anytime. I'll do anything for you. Work this out.
*  We can work it out. I mean, the answer is Jamie, I'm not wrong, right?
*  The answer is compassion, Joe. No, this is what I'm thinking.
*  You and I have a very unique frequency. Yeah.
*  Let's do it. This is why it's important because when you and I get together and
*  I firmly believe you and I could do this every goddamn week,
*  I love it. Especially if we only saw each other once a week. It's the best.
*  I'll fly you in. I'll fly you to Austin. We can zoom. We can zoom.
*  We can do whatever. I'll fly to North Carolina.
*  I'm not going there. I'm going to Colorado.
*  I'm at Cuba. Yeah, man. Like I love it, Joe. I mean, I, to me, like,
*  you know, that's what I think so great about the fact that you got to be the
*  person that you are, that you got to be the, the spotlight got to be on you as
*  it is. And the reason it's on you and the reason I take such, I really,
*  like not much offends me, man, but when people start attacking you, I do,
*  like I have to fight against my offense because I know you.
*  And so when people are fucking at arms against you,
*  I feel really depressed because I know you and I, and you, like,
*  you are one of the most progressive people I've ever met. And so when,
*  when people start falling upon you, uh,
*  because you have like fucking nerds like Ben Shapiro,
*  which finally should have that guy anymore. He's a dork. Come on.
*  Come on. Those conversations are important.
*  I think what's beautiful about what you're doing is you're opening.
*  I would not open up the pl- the, by the way, Ben Shapiro underneath it all.
*  I know that you and I would probably have fun,
*  but I know that right now where you're at in your incarnation,
*  you're a fucking dork. You know what I mean? Like he's a dork. He's a dork.
*  But what's so confusing, that's what's confusing about him is cause you look at
*  his, like you look at him and you're like,
*  he's all like beating up what's her face about the thing and that embarrassing
*  thing. The music video he's like,
*  and they are doing fornication.
*  Did you see me and Ali Minkowski talking about what has supposed to be?
*  Oh God. Like that thing Shapiro's do, it's so embarrassing, Joe.
*  And like that dude is like an embarrassment, but the way,
*  I don't think what people admit when they look at Ben Shapiro is like,
*  there's a piece of you that's like, I'd have fun with him.
*  Like it'd be fun to drink with him. He's probably cool, but he's like right now.
*  I don't think he drinks, but he's a nice guy. He's a, whatever it is,
*  he's a good person. I'm not bullshitting. I look again,
*  I think our job right now is not to alienate. We have to like involve.
*  And that's why I have him on. That's why I know you're doing it, Joe.
*  He's an, I'm telling you right now, Ben Shapiro is a nice man. He's a nice man.
*  I see him. I hug him every time I see him and I don't hug him to be fake.
*  I hug him cause I genuinely love that guy. I think he's a nice guy. Look,
*  I think some of the stuff he's propagating in his like philosophies is like
*  legitimately deranged. Bro, he's wearing an outfit.
*  It's a costume. It's not, I mean he,
*  Ben Shapiro could never take off the Yamaha, shave his head,
*  tattoo his chest with an eagle, wear a bikini.
*  He's got an outfit. I just want to, but it's not his fault. I'm telling you,
*  we all come from a different spot. We, if, if life is a race,
*  it's not like everybody's on the same starting line.
*  Like people on starting lines are like a mile behind.
*  They're so far away. They're all different. And they, here's the thing,
*  even if people are wrong about many things or even,
*  I'll explain this better.
*  Even if you disagree with the way people feel about so many different things,
*  it doesn't mean you can't be their friend. It doesn't. And I'm telling you,
*  we got it wrong. Here's what's important.
*  What's important is whoever that person is, they got to be sincere. Now,
*  as soon as you feel like someone's a grifter, you've got to cast them out.
*  You got to cast them out cause they got to figure that out on their own and
*  they got to apologize. That's cool, man. You've got, listen,
*  you can be wrong, but you have to be honest.
*  And if you're just bullshitting, then I can't hang out with you. Dude,
*  let me ask Ben Shapiro is not bullshitting. I don't think he's bullshitting.
*  I just think he's like a little like antiquated in his, I look, man,
*  I like, I'm not like the whole Ben Shapiro thing. I like that's of all your guests.
*  He's a great guy, man. If you met him,
*  if you and I and him went to a steak dinner, we'd have a great conversation.
*  I hung out with him at the, what's that steak house? The Boa,
*  Boa in Hollywood down from the store on Sunset. I had a great time with him.
*  He's a good man. I like, I like genuinely like him a lot. When he texts me,
*  Ben Shapiro texts me, I look at my phone and I'm like Ben Shapiro,
*  I like that guy. I like him.
*  Look, as far as I'm concerned,
*  if you're going to create what I think could be created by humanity,
*  we have to create the engine, not of rejection, but of acceptance,
*  which meaning that like if you got a charismatic Ben Shapiro avatar in the
*  video game, in the simulation that we're in,
*  there's a way to reabsorb him into reality that isn't like the way people
*  currently see him.
*  He's willing to relinquish his ideology.
*  And he has a very strict religious ideology.
*  Yeah. He's stuck in this little thing.
*  But I think that's helped him. That little thing. Look,
*  if you figure out a way to do something that helps you past most of the people
*  that you're competing against,
*  but ultimately hinders you against the people who learn your lessons plus other
*  lessons and aren't hampered by ideology and they pass you.
*  Like you have to, there's a moment we have to figure out when you're going to
*  let go.
*  He seems to have a very like clear mind. That's what's cool about him.
*  He seems to like have a very insightful mind. I like that.
*  I just feel like something about him,
*  it like smacks of like the Nazi intellectuals.
*  It does, but he's Jewish. And here's the thing I love.
*  When people get mad at me that I talk to him, I'm like, listen,
*  just listen to what we're saying. Listen, he's not a bad guy.
*  He might not agree with them, but me and him are having really,
*  really good conversations about why I feel like you can't tell an 18 year old
*  kid, just pull your pants up and don't shoot anybody.
*  We're having these like really nuanced conversations and he's allowing me
*  because he knows I like him.
*  So you're like the Bohemian Grove.
*  But it's no, he knows I like him. Like Ben Shapiro and I don't agree on many
*  things, but he knows if I see him, I go, what's up man? How you doing?
*  I hug him and it's genuine. I really care about him.
*  That's the whole point. That's the whole point.
*  So if we care, if he and I are sitting like right here and we talk about stuff,
*  he knows that if I don't agree with him, I, it's,
*  it doesn't change my feelings about whether I'll hug him or I love him.
*  That's it. That's it. Yes. That's the problem we're all facing.
*  We're all facing this problem where we identify with ideas. Whereas I think,
*  I think we can just do our best to make good
*  with where we stand right now as a human.
*  And when we encounter other humans,
*  let's take ideas and put them in front of us and let's cross our arms and let's
*  go over these ideas without any attachment.
*  That's where it gets hard because most of us don't have enough personal
*  satisfaction in our own accomplishments to relinquish this idea that our ideas
*  are not ours. That our ideas are just, it's just a mathematical problem.
*  It's a fucking Rubik's cube. It's a, it's a fucking game of clue.
*  Like who knows who did it?
*  Is it Charlotte in the fucking library with a rope?
*  We don't know. So this thing that we're doing as people today is we're scared.
*  And one of the things that happen when people are scared is they pull back,
*  you pull back, you, you, you, you put up fences, you wall off,
*  you protect your tribe, your tribe, gas,
*  you decide what you can say, what you can't say.
*  Who's the enemy and who's, who's good and who's bad.
*  And everybody walls off. And my thoughts are that's a trap.
*  And that is just something that we've been involved with forever.
*  From the beginning of time,
*  from single celled organisms to small mammals, to human beings.
*  We've been involved in this weird trap of competing against each other in the
*  wrong way, competing against each other in a way where ultimately somebody gets
*  victimized.
*  I think the best competition is keeping the other competition
*  alive, competing against each other while helping each other.
*  And everybody gets by, everybody gets better.
*  And even people who are not doing well,
*  you tell them why they're not doing well, that will force you to do better.
*  All of the people that are trying to take your position, if there's a ladder,
*  you say, this is why you fucked up and then you'll do better because they'll do
*  better and everybody does better. There's no stagnation.
*  It's just like the part, like you're in a, you're in a like brutal position.
*  You're in a really brutal position. Like, and no matter what,
*  I don't see how you can resist it. Like the problem with your,
*  your position is you have this like powerful voice.
*  That's the problem is like you're, you're a signal booster and like,
*  I also got a NASA suit and I can hold my piss for four hours, son.
*  How have you not pissed? But, but, but,
*  but to me, like the bizarre,
*  like the difficult situation you're in is like you get Ben Shapiro on,
*  you signal boost that whatever that is. I don't know what he is. By the way,
*  he's a bad guy. Ben Shapiro. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not trying to attack you.
*  You're fucking like whatever the thing you did with like attacking the music
*  video was an ass pussy. That was an embarrassment. That was a mess.
*  That was a mess. That was a mess. I get it. It was really sex negative.
*  It was so stupid. He seemed like such a nerd, a dork.
*  I mean like, and also anybody who's going to like do that, you like,
*  feel like they, they negate whatever their philosophical ideas by attacking the
*  thing. But, however,
*  he's doing the exact same thing that Trump does when he gets attention.
*  He's saying something about something that's culturally relevant and he's taking
*  a contrary position and he's generating likes.
*  He's generating interest. Right. He's like a, he's a,
*  he's a sales person for negativity. I was his best friend.
*  And Ben and I were sitting around. He's like,
*  you think you're supposed to ask them? I'd be like, okay, okay. Yeah.
*  You probably should. Cause like ultimately people are going to fuck with you.
*  But my, my position is it's better if you have
*  vulnerabilities. If there's something you've done that's really stupid,
*  it's probably better for you when you shit on things.
*  And I think that's a good argument for coming out against wet ass pussy that.
*  What's wrong with wet ass pussy by the way. Nothing, nothing,
*  but a guy like Ben Shapiro, he shouldn't be right too many times. Part,
*  part of his charm.
*  Is he casually,
*  he's got to say some shit that only a fucking dude with a yarmulke says.
*  It's not that he's a bad person.
*  There's a lot of Jewish, Jewish. Listen, listen, I love Ari,
*  but he doesn't wear a yarmulke. Okay. You're saying the yarmulke.
*  You don't have to wear it. So now you're in space.
*  You've gone from rejecting. Here's us as a golf ball.
*  Flying to the universe. Impossible. Look, man, I don't,
*  I didn't want to get, I don't care about fucking Ben Shapiro. I don't care.
*  God, you're the first episode on Spotify. I don't care about.
*  I legitimately four hours in. Who cares? Plus, I don't care.
*  I don't care about Ben Shapiro. I don't care. He's a nice guy. No,
*  he cares. Listen, if I hug Ben Shapiro, I really hug him.
*  I love that guy. He's a sweetie. I'm sure he's a sweetie. But when I meet him,
*  he's a nice guy. Look, man, it doesn't matter. Like, here's a deeper point, man.
*  I don't mean to do this every time I'm on, but you have
*  such a, such a crazy power that if you're not careful,
*  folks from deep,
*  dark wells of perspective are going to infiltrate your shit.
*  Dude, if you watch that great documentary on, uh,
*  the like white Aryan folks, man, it's fucked up. Like this.
*  Why you gotta go there? Give me that lighter.
*  Here you go. Like, yeah, you, you look at like,
*  these people are very organized, man. It's like,
*  they're organized what I'm saying. And like, and again,
*  I'm not saying Ben Shapiro is this person. He wears a yarmulke. He's Jewish.
*  What? I don't know what you're bad. I don't care. Listen to me. Listen to me.
*  All those people that are organized,
*  they come hang out with us. Give me a hug.
*  You don't want to give them a hug. Relax. Why? Just really all those people,
*  just people, man, like a white supremacist. There were laws.
*  They imagine if you gave a white supremacist five MEO DMT
*  and let them sit on a couch, one of them Brown suede couches,
*  they'd take three big hits. And then as the first one, as they're exhaling,
*  yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And they get sucked into the center of the universe and they realize there is no
*  center cause there is no boundaries. It's all connected.
*  You're in a soup.
*  You're in an infinite soup of ideas and biology and thoughts and
*  prayers and love and hope and happiness and jealousy and
*  anal sex and it's all together with
*  cartoons and pop music and cheeseburgers.
*  Just a bunch of different experiences,
*  all fucking stitched together and some sort of possibility.
*  And then the, then the aliens land.
*  Yeah. Look, man, this is the way I see it. I don't know, man.
*  Who gives a fuck? Like really it's like, you know, the, the,
*  the reality of it is, is like, we are in a very bizarre period, period in time,
*  which is that you and I,
*  we became friends on the phone having these same conversations.
*  And now you say a thing that flies in the face of the,
*  of the particular like default reality of our time.
*  And you start trending on Twitter. You know, like that's like some of our,
*  like the way I know you right now is like you trending on Twitter where I'm
*  like, what the fuck happened?
*  The jokes on them. Cause I don't read Twitter.
*  You don't go on Twitter at all. I don't read it. I post things.
*  Like today I posted the Ali Letterman made some masks. It's just a poster masks.
*  Joe, it's just weird because it's like, you're like a,
*  but it's not me. It's what they think I am. It's who they decide I am.
*  Yeah. But you have to watch out cause people are going to like try to exploit
*  you. That's the main thing is like people recognizing what you are,
*  who have political agendas will infiltrate your shit and then start blowing out
*  their radioactivity into the world. Right? That's a fear.
*  Like face rotten shit.
*  Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Like they'll get in, they'll get in there.
*  And then like all of a sudden, like you accidentally start exhaling shit.
*  That's like, that's the, you don't agree.
*  I know you don't agree with like Ben Shapiro.
*  Listen, it's not that I don't agree with Ben Shapiro and I definitely don't on
*  many things. And he and I talked about it. It's that I don't want to abandon him.
*  Ah, that's, that's cool. I don't,
*  I don't think he's worthy of abandonment cause I think he's a good person.
*  And I think many of the things he says,
*  he says cause he's rewarded for saying controversial things on the internet and
*  many times make sense in a logical way.
*  If you don't take into account all the different situations that lead to a
*  person becoming who they are in 2020,
*  slavery and Jim Crow laws and all these different things that we all have to
*  deal with. But I think he's a good person. I really do.
*  And I think many of times like the things we say we're half defensive and,
*  and, and, and, and half promotional,
*  you're saying things cause you think that people are going to react in a certain
*  way. You don't necessarily mean it.
*  And you also say things because you've seen the contrary to that poorly worded
*  and you decide you don't agree with that. And so you want to counter it.
*  But I think the problem is in ideal ideologies more than anything.
*  As if I'm really being objective,
*  I always feel like our problem is purely in ideologies because we just committed
*  to one side or the other and ideas to one side. You're right or you're wrong.
*  And I think if we could just divorce ourselves from ideas and divorce
*  ourselves from all ideologies and just look at something like honest,
*  like you come to me and I come to you and I go, Hey man, what's up? I go,
*  what are your intentions? My,
*  my intention is to live a harmonious life with my neighbors.
*  And I said, mine as well. Okay, good. Beautiful.
*  And you hug each other and you go, what do we have to do about taxes?
*  What do you look at, man,
*  if we lived in a community where I felt like, Hey, if I pay more in taxes,
*  people will have their kids in a better school and the water will be
*  pure and you know, there'd be less crime.
*  I would fucking 100% sign up for that.
*  But I don't think the people that are taking that fucking thing and running with
*  it know what they're doing. That's right. That's the problem.
*  You believe in the idea of democracy.
*  You just don't believe in the organizational facility.
*  That's like administering democracy.
*  I've been to the red line of human beings.
*  I know where people fall apart. I know the red line. Yeah.
*  I know when the RPMs hit here,
*  I know when people bitch out and I know I'm not going to bitch out.
*  And if you're going to bitch out, I know, I know you're,
*  if you're bitching out and you're also making, you're making laws.
*  Right. What are you saying?
*  What are you doing? What's going on? Who are you?
*  Why are you deciding what people do? We shouldn't have any figureheads.
*  It's dangerous. Alpha champs are dangerous.
*  Take it from me, a person with a big platform. You shouldn't listen to me.
*  You shouldn't listen to you. You shouldn't listen to Bert Kreischer.
*  You shouldn't listen to Tom Segura, Ari Shafir, Joey Diaz,
*  or name all the people you love to listen to. Sam Harris,
*  don't listen to them. Meaning listen to their show,
*  but apply to whatever they say,
*  your own objective opinion.
*  But how weird is it that people will focus that you have been Ben Shapiro on
*  this podcast, but they don't,
*  they don't focus that you have Bernie Sanders on how weird is it?
*  They do. They do focus.
*  But what I'm saying is like people in the left will say,
*  you're a monster that you would have been Shapiro on.
*  And they completely forget that you gave one of the great potential
*  socialist presidents of our time, a platform that you supported.
*  They forget that.
*  And Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gower, those are my favorite people.
*  That's the part that drives me nuts. Why do they forget that?
*  I am a savage. That's why. What do you mean? I'm a savage.
*  I'm a fucking cage fighting commentator. I do a commentary for UFC.
*  I do standup comedy. I do wild comedy. I'm a wild person.
*  It's a different thing. I understand.
*  It's just that we have to stop trying to push people down
*  in order to push ourselves ahead. And if we just all look at it,
*  like look,
*  there's things about all sorts of aspects of society that I don't
*  agree with that smart people disagree with. Right.
*  I don't know if they're right. I don't know if I'm right.
*  I don't know. I would like to talk forever to people that are vegans.
*  Like my friend, John Joseph, he's the singer, the, the, the Cro-Mags.
*  He's a fucking interesting dude, man. You know, and he,
*  he's a, he's been a vegan forever.
*  And he's like a super fucking strong guy, like mentally,
*  physically, just triathlons.
*  I want people to think different than me.
*  I want them to, I want bad motherfuckers to have
*  completely separate ideas of how the world should or shouldn't work.
*  What is wrong or isn't wrong? What's right or isn't right? What's privilege?
*  What's bullshit? I want everybody to come to the table clean.
*  I want everybody to come to the table warm. I want everybody to hug.
*  I really do. And I think we're all scared.
*  And I think it fucks up everybody.
*  And if everybody who wants progress doesn't want people to feel good about
*  running into each other and talking things through,
*  we're going into this thing with the wrong energy.
*  The right energy is going into this thing, going, listen,
*  I didn't ask to be born. You didn't either. Right. Here we are.
*  2020. Yeah. Trying to figure the world out, but let's just admit,
*  the, the idea of wrestling between gay and straight,
*  black and white, male and female. Those are so dumb.
*  I don't want to do that. I don't want to do that. I want, I want to be,
*  I want to talk to honest and dishonest. I want to talk to secure and insecure.
*  I want to talk to loving and hateful. I want to hug people that needed.
*  I want to figure out a way where we can get through this in a better state than
*  we were five years ago, 10 years ago.
*  Let's get through this with food and water and realize we didn't need a
*  fucking Amance platinum car.
*  I don't want a fucking, I don't want it.
*  I don't want Google home. You're going to be president.
*  No, I don't want to be president. I don't want any president.
*  That's what I want. I want no president.
*  They're going to run this in your anti campaign, but you're going to,
*  I could see it happening, man.
*  We should postpone the election and try to find a better way to do this.
*  No, do the fucking election. Get Biden in there. Get a non lunatic.
*  What we need is, um,
*  romantic tension between a 24 year old,
*  like super, super liberal,
*  super attractive woman and like a 32 year old
*  Navy seal who's also married and no one cheats on anybody,
*  but they have the sexual tension and they keep it together and they work their
*  way through veganism and
*  I'm trying to fucking fix the world, Duncan.
*  I'm trying to tell you that all the things that we see, pros and cons,
*  pluses and minuses.
*  Yeah, man. I'm just trying to figure out like,
*  we got to the election and suddenly it's this erotic romance between this
*  24 year old so much better than a fucking guy with fake hair and some,
*  a dead man,
*  weekend at Bernie's with a cop shoving her hand up his ass and walking him to
*  the aisle.
*  Here's the thing that I don't understand in sports,
*  somebody in any fucking sport,
*  if they're not doing great that night,
*  the coach pulls them off and puts someone better in.
*  Here's the thing, Duncan Trussell. No one wants that spot.
*  The replacement? No one. Why?
*  Who wants to be president? I would love to be president.
*  The fucking look in your face.
*  Oh, oh my God, Jamie.
*  I don't want to go through an election, but like, I would like that.
*  Elections are so archaic. That's fucking wood stoves. Yeah.
*  But I would love to be president. Being president would be so fun.
*  Would it be? Here's the best part. You could exonerate all your friends.
*  The most ridiculous thing about being president. You can,
*  the best you can just decide. You're out. I'm going to pardon.
*  By the way, he's a bad guy, but he's a good guy.
*  And here's a really important thing.
*  The Trump administration just let out one of the great LSD chemists of our
*  time. Who's that? I can't remember his name. It's so sad.
*  If you look it up. Don't say it. Don't say it. No, you should say it.
*  You blew up that guy's spot that was throwing cigarettes on the ground in Utah.
*  No, look, he deserves to be, his name deserves to be spoken.
*  You know who contacted me recently? Who?
*  Do you remember the neuro soup story? William Leonard Picard.
*  Do you remember? I'm so drunk. Me too. Do you remember neuro soup?
*  Yeah. Yeah. She was a girl who was on YouTube and her and I,
*  I went back with her. This is an interesting thing. She had a, a,
*  a detailed account of how she put DMT up her asshole.
*  He dated William Leonard Picard. Yeah.
*  That's the guy that had the LSD lab in the middle of the bunker and the DMT
*  accelerator pedal. He contacted me. Okay. And from prison?
*  I don't know. I just got an email and, um,
*  it's not my main account, but I was like, Hmm, maybe that's real.
*  But that lady, um,
*  she had a whole YouTube series about different ways she took drugs. Yeah.
*  And one of them was she took DMT up her asshole. It was a bad trip.
*  She had a bad trip. Yeah, but
*  part of me was like that girl,
*  DMT up the ass. That's a rare human.
*  That's a great night. A rare human looks at that DMT nugget,
*  that little Coco pop, whatever it is.
*  Honeycomb Cheerios. I want to, I want that in my life.
*  I want to be around someone who's like, I, this is so free.
*  Put it up your asshole. Would you even consider it? Yes. Really?
*  I would put DMT up my ass. I've thought about it after I heard about it.
*  It's a good way to let the universe know you give up.
*  It's the end. It's the video game.
*  It's a part of the video game where you're like done. Come move to Texas,
*  please. I'm going to North Carolina bullshit. Where the fuck do we have to be
*  localized? You don't want to live in Tennessee. I want to know. I look,
*  we don't have to be locked into any place. I bought you a house.
*  We don't have to be locked into a place. Joe, I appreciate you.
*  And by the way, I know you. I want to fix things.
*  I know that you buy houses of your friends. I want to fix things.
*  So sweet that you would say that, but look,
*  we don't have to be spatially disconnected.
*  We can all you're already look, man. You're already fixing things.
*  I think you can help me. I would, I will help you in any way.
*  I'm better with you. I'm better with you than without you. Listen, man,
*  I'm better with you than without you. That's real. That's real. It's true.
*  You and I both talked about this, not just on podcasts, I think, but even like,
*  on phone calls, but when we do podcasts,
*  I feel like you bring me to a place that I don't really get without you. Yeah.
*  We're really, I really feel like that because I've known you so long.
*  Like I remember when you had this breakup and we lived together and you called
*  me up, but I don't know what to do. I'm like, fuck, man, come live with me.
*  Yeah. I was so happy.
*  I was one of the comics that you evolved. And when, and also like in that,
*  that moment where I was living with you,
*  it wasn't like some kind of like national ampoon vacation thing.
*  You were like really serious with me and you were not serious all the time.
*  We had a few like really serious talks and then those serious talks,
*  you like helped me realize that like I had to stop being so flippant with my
*  life. And it was really good. And you weren't fucking around.
*  And it was cool and it was very sweet and I'll never forget it, man. And,
*  and, uh,
*  well you know what I wanted to say to you? This was, this was,
*  when you see someone who is at a bump in the road,
*  many things can happen, right? Yeah. And for you,
*  I wanted you to know that like you can most certainly get upset along the way at
*  different, or you can be almost,
*  almost immune to all the bumps in the road.
*  It's really how you decide.
*  And if you decide you're this fucking Peter Pan character and just like float
*  through this, like there's ways that you're lucky in ways that other people that
*  live in Afghanistan and the Congo will never understand.
*  You weren't letting me, no man, you weren't letting me do that.
*  But you and I, when we were hanging out together and I was like, I was like,
*  I remember the moment you called me,
*  there wasn't even a half a second between you say I was like, yay,
*  Duncan's going to live with me.
*  Sweet man. And I wanted you to get in the tank.
*  Yeah. Oh, that's great, man. I love it. And like, I, I'm not trying to,
*  like your perception of them may even be different from mine, but like one,
*  one thing that happened,
*  I have a few memories of that incredible gift that you gave me.
*  One of the memories is riding up to your house.
*  I don't even know how you got into my car that you would be in my Mini Cooper,
*  which was red at the time. I remember that. We're driving up to your house.
*  We're listening to Elliot Smith. I'm playing Elliot Smith.
*  He's talking about fucking morose things.
*  And you are this. So I remember like, I've been listening to that nonstop.
*  So we're riding up this hill to your mansion and listening to Elliot Smith in my
*  Mini Cooper. So this is like, this is before your podcast,
*  but before you had become like what you are now,
*  just imagine folks listening riding in a Mini Cooper with Joe Rogan and a cherry
*  red Mini Cooper, trying to play Elliot Smith for him.
*  Cause it's really been moving you.
*  I'm not playing it for you cause like any other reason than this is what I've
*  been tuned into for like a long time.
*  And so we're riding up this hill to your mansion.
*  And I remember you look at me in this way,
*  the only like real friends can do this.
*  And you look at me and you go, you have to stop listening to this.
*  You were like, you can't listen to this anymore. Like this is terrible.
*  This is like hurting you.
*  And it wasn't from a judgmental place or a place of musical brilliance.
*  It was a friend being like, dude, you are depressed.
*  That guy gives out a vibration. He was incredibly depressed.
*  And incredibly talented at terrible nexus. So good. So good.
*  And he was a trap, but like, it's a trap, but it is a trap.
*  It's like you can squeeze out some really super positive juice.
*  And then to the left of your body, you're filled with cancer. Like that's,
*  that's the problem. That's the problem with people that there's,
*  there's so many different things where people are depressed and morose and
*  they're talking about really dark things.
*  Dude, it wasn't just you. Like, so I get to your house.
*  I'm in this mansion. All of a sudden you had a,
*  that was this one you had a fucking piranha tank. Do you remember that?
*  You have piranhas. So all of a sudden I'm in a like mansion where there's a
*  piranha tank and Eddie Bravo.
*  I remember cause I was going up like to fake, to like hide smoking.
*  Cause I was addicted at the time. Yeah. And I remember like,
*  I was sneaking up to smoke and at some point Eddie Bravo,
*  I'd like gone up this hill to like, like hide smoking.
*  And Eddie Bravo walks up the hill to me and it's like imitating smoking to me,
*  making fun of me for being addicted to cigarettes.
*  But like, but like, you know, you know what happened with Joe, you know what happened.
*  Like if I live, this is where I really go back and I think Eddie Bravo,
*  in that moment I'm like, what a prick. Don't tell me not to fucking smoke.
*  Cut to me sitting in front of a doctor being like, well,
*  you have cancer in your balls.
*  And I remember like referring back to that moment where he was like,
*  stop smoking. You know what I mean? Which was cool. It was like,
*  like there's so many like in those moments.
*  There's a thing where you can do,
*  where you can protect people temporarily from their emotions,
*  but you won't protect them from the consequences of their actions that you see
*  that maybe they don't.
*  And I think we're all responsible for our friends blind spots.
*  And when we see blind spots, we're like, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey.
*  It's only so much you can do though. It's only so much you could do.
*  Eddie Bravo could have like turned into a dragon and then like,
*  creepy, right?
*  Nicotine is a very addictive drug man. It gets you. It gets you in a weird way.
*  But he was legitimately trying to get me to stop smoking.
*  Eddie Bravo is a good man. That was a sweet moment. Like when I look back,
*  I always like, when I look back pre cancer,
*  I always think of that moment is like, man,
*  you thought that guy was such a cunt. Like you thought he was such a cunt.
*  Because you didn't want to quit that habit.
*  I always like,
*  but you look back like he wanted me to do better.
*  He didn't want me to get one of my balls. I got lucky.
*  I got lucky because like it didn't spread through my whole body and I didn't
*  die.
*  We have two choices right now. I can pee my pants or I can run to the bathroom.
*  And then we come back.
*  No, don't stop it. I've never had it where you go to the bathroom.
*  We're full. What? Five hours in how many hours? It doesn't matter.
*  Be right back. I've been dying for this moment. Jamie,
*  just so you know, like through the years of us doing Rogan,
*  I usually am the one who has to go to pee. But in this moment,
*  here I am in a, with the thing happening.
*  And, uh, you know,
*  it doesn't,
*  what does he do with this spot with the guest leaves? What does he,
*  does he say pull something up?
*  He just yaps.
*  Well, uh,
*  subscribe to my Patreon.
*  Fort slash DTFH. We have a Tuesday. We have a meditation.
*  Uh, Wednesdays we're doing a Dune book club. It's amazing.
*  The book Dune by Frank Herbert is incredible. Uh, Fridays,
*  we have a family gathering. It's just us hanging out,
*  but join us there. Uh, you know,
*  the truth is it is a simulation, you know,
*  and we told you that before you linked into the thing.
*  And we told you it would wipe your memory and that you would feel like you are,
*  uh, helpless in the sense that the thing you are right now,
*  you don't know what the power that you wield.
*  So you chose that just, you know, and we said that in this moment,
*  we would do a thing where we alerted you of the fact that you have been,
*  you had intentionally decided to dive into a simulation, making you limited,
*  very powerful. You're Thor in the,
*  in the human world that you're in right now. You're actually Thor. You, uh,
*  you're, you're a powerful Norse God that has gotten
*  sucked into a very temporary, like magic spell.
*  That isn't even that powerful compared to the powers in the world we come from.
*  But right now you have become convinced that you are a limited identity in the
*  mortal realm, which you requested by the way, you said,
*  I want to be an insurance agent, real estate agent,
*  school teacher, psychologist, fireman, cop.
*  I wanted to be a pilot. Somebody who was a flight attendant,
*  someone who worked in a museum teacher,
*  somebody who was a historian, a failed writer,
*  a failed comedian. You, and,
*  and you became this temporary thing, but the truth is you're a God and you're
*  confused. Joe, welcome back.
*  Oh my God. I peed so hard. It was amazing.
*  I just want everyone to know if you're like,
*  no one should have this amount of influence.
*  No one, no one should be able to say things that affect politics and
*  social ideas. You're right. I don't, I don't, I agree with you.
*  I didn't want to do this. This is a weird thing.
*  But I'm doing my best.
*  What are you going to do? Stop. I'm not stopping.
*  You're going to retire because like, no matter what you do, it's like jujitsu.
*  You can't go for a choke just right away. You can't just dive on the choke.
*  Yeah. You got to slowly cook the person slowly work to positions.
*  What's the choke here? And you're naked. You get the mounts,
*  you let them buck you off. You get half guard, you hold on,
*  you escape side control. You try to mount again. They turn over,
*  you get their back hooks in squeeze.
*  She takes time. It takes time. All things take time.
*  Don't you worry though? Like that, like,
*  what if like, and again, like we've been going on so many hours now.
*  So now at this point I'm just pulling.
*  How much time has this podcast going on?
*  Four minutes and 40 seconds.
*  But don't you worry. Four hours and 40 minutes.
*  Joe, don't you worry though.
*  It's the first episode. We're right. I was right. I knew it.
*  You knew it. I'm like Duncan has to be number one.
*  Do you know you had to be number one?
*  When you invited me on, I didn't even,
*  I try not to think about it because I was so flattered. I felt darkly flattered.
*  And then I went on your like sub Reddit. I saw the,
*  the votes for who would be on the show.
*  And the number one thing I wasn't even listed. Joe.
*  No, they're not. I actually, listen to me. They're fools.
*  I know what I'm doing.
*  Tuck more custom knives. Shout out.
*  But like not to like, I do feel like it kind of does. People are fools.
*  They're wrong. Listen, you have helped me in many steps of the way because you
*  and I as friends, you know, we, we,
*  we came from different backgrounds,
*  but we're both very compassionate and very interested in exploring alternative
*  ideas. Both of us. And we, we, we, you and I have had so many conversations,
*  we, you said something to me and I went, Hmm, damn, maybe, huh?
*  And I've had a reconsider the way I was focusing in on something.
*  And because I respect you,
*  and this is something that I've said of Ari as well and in Joey and even Eddie
*  Bravo and Jamie and all the people that I'm around, if,
*  if you say something to me,
*  I consider it like I'm thinking of it in a different way. Like,
*  if you say, I don't think that's a good idea because of this, I go, huh, okay.
*  Tell me why. Right. And I, I'll let it go. I, I, I'm, I don't want to be,
*  I don't want to cling on to that early idea, man.
*  And I think that's half our problem. That's half our problem.
*  You know, I've always felt like a weird sense of guilt about Eddie Bravo, man,
*  cause like Eddie Bravo, uh,
*  Mommy did you do that? Yeah. Yeah. Thanks dude.
*  I always felt like a weird sense of guilt about him.
*  I thought he was going to cut his finger off last time he did it.
*  I felt like a weird sense of guilt about Eddie Bravo. Cause like,
*  and I don't agree with all his good spiritoid ideas. No, I don't either,
*  but neither does he.
*  But dude, this is an important thing. Like, this is an important thing. Like,
*  not only did he tell me to quit smoking and then I got one of my fucking balls
*  and I got one of my balls chopped off. Well, he was right about that. But,
*  right. But I want to tell you another thing he said. He said another,
*  cheers brother. He said another thing. I do feel like it's worth mentioning.
*  I always felt a weird sense of guilt cause I think I judged him harshly and it
*  makes me feel like a dumb dumb, but like, like,
*  cause he's like a jujitsu master. You know, so like I always, you know,
*  he's my master. Yeah. So I give someone said, who's your master?
*  I'd say first John Jogman Chado, second Eddie Bravo.
*  One of my best friends is my master. So I always felt,
*  I always had this trick at the very least, a trickling sense of like, man,
*  I think you were wrong about your judgment there. But it's dangerous.
*  Yeah, it's dangerous. Cause he can kill you. Yeah. Well that also talking to him.
*  Anytime I've been talking to him, I'm always a little bit like nervous.
*  Any moment I could die. It's like a pet snake. Yeah. Like what if some,
*  it's some moment you do like go insane and decide to kill me. I won't, I won't.
*  I feel like that around Joey.
*  What do you think you would kill you? No, no, no, no. But he's so wild.
*  He's like a bear. I want to keep feeding.
*  Joey Diaz is like, you know, he's the goat. You know that right?
*  Well I do. Like, you know, he's the greatest of all time.
*  There's no one who's ever been funnier. I've,
*  I've seen Joey Diaz hit like frequencies. I've never seen anybody else hit.
*  Yeah. He was hanging out in Colorado with like,
*  like around Shambhala, which is like the place,
*  like my meditation teacher's teacher was teaching. Yeah, man.
*  So we encountered some like beings there that were like really advanced and like
*  he had, he, he actually, he like digested some of that stuff. Like he's wild.
*  Joey Diaz is wild. Remember like to me,
*  like the thing that like, you know,
*  one of the aspects of this particular moment in the Kali Yuga that so is fucked up.
*  This is Kali Yuga, right? Yeah. It has to be. Well Kali Yuga,
*  like a lot of people can explain. So Kali Yuga, it's the age we're in right now.
*  So the Yugas are like vast spans of time and we're considered to be in the Kali
*  Yuga. Now the other,
*  but this is like something that was actually actually predicted several years
*  ago. Yeah. Well, a hundred, like thousands of years ago.
*  But in terms of like people recognizing this right now is Kali Yuga.
*  There's, there's, there's like, you know,
*  differences in what part of the Kali Yuga we're in,
*  but there's no difference in that we're in the Kali Yuga.
*  Explain the Yugas. I'm sorry.
*  The Yugas are a period of time that one of the ways to like,
*  that they get represented is like imagine a dove flying through the sky with a
*  silk scarf in the beak and the tip of the scarf brushes against the peak of the
*  Himalayas.
*  So the amount of time it takes for one of those peaks to get pushed down to a
*  valley, that could be considered a Yuga. It's like, it's a, it's a,
*  it's actually a, in Hinduism, it's a,
*  it's a period of time and people argue about that length of time. It's
*  negotiable, but there are certain symptoms for each Yuga.
*  And so the Kali Yuga,
*  the symptoms are you can't remember very well.
*  Your memory's all fucked up. You're impetuous. You're fast in your decisions.
*  You're easily addicted. You know, if you look back at the history of Hinduism,
*  the Vedas were originally sung. So they were memorized and people would sing
*  them. They would sing them and they weren't written down.
*  Writing is considered a degradation. Yeah. Yeah.
*  It was written down because they heard it and they, they like,
*  it was written down later down the line.
*  The idea was you didn't need to write anything down cause you would memorize.
*  I remember when I was a kid in high school,
*  my friend Brian Cattrill going through all the numbers he'd memorized.
*  And it was so many,
*  he had so many phone numbers memorized because we didn't have phones.
*  So you had to memorize numbers or write them down in a little pad.
*  So what we consider to be technology is really a crutch to make up for our
*  idiocy in the age of the Kali Yuga, which is what we're in right now.
*  And a lot of people get confused because they think Kali means Kali,
*  the goddess of destruction. How many Yugas? I'm not, I think four,
*  three or four. Do you know? I don't know that. I don't know the answer.
*  I only know that.
*  Jamie's like, this is an eight hour podcast.
*  I'll look this up right now.
*  You have to give him overtime pay.
*  I've been trying to figure out to not that I want to end this at all,
*  but this being our first Spotify podcast, it kind of has to be two.
*  We have other things. I don't know how they're going to deal with this file and
*  whatnot. Well, we, we're right now at five
*  hours into the podcast, right? How many hours?
*  Yeah. Five hours. We should just make it two, two and a half hour podcasts.
*  I feel like I've been stopping it.
*  Shouldn't we? I don't want Spotify. I know what I'm doing.
*  This is why I brought it. I'm going to miss you, man. That's the main thing.
*  You're not going to miss me. I'm going to be around you. Come on, dude.
*  You don't want to live in South Dakota. I'm sorry. I forgot.
*  I didn't want us. South Dakota, my sweet home.
*  Fuck Arizona. Sorry. I'm going to South Dakota and I can't wait,
*  but dude, it's rough to come in here and see people pack.
*  Cause look, man, here's the main thing. It's like,
*  we're not packing. Yeah, dude, but it's not,
*  we're not packing ourselves up because of some like, like,
*  like Turner S Thompson thing.
*  We're packing ourselves up because the country we were born into is falling into
*  the throes of a really dark period induced by a once in a hundred year
*  pandemic.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  But why do you want to live in a place where none of us are living?
*  Why not think about that?
*  I know why I don't want to live in Austin. I know that. Why? Why?
*  Well, cause I'll tell you why, Joe,
*  if you really want another real dark reason, cause you announced it.
*  You know what I mean? Had you not announced it, it might be a different story.
*  But you and Elon Musk, he was going to get out anyway. Yeah.
*  But Elon's coming to Austin. Yeah. We're talking about it. I know.
*  So welcome like Austin. That's Silicon Valley.
*  So yeah. Yeah, dude. Yeah, I'm sorry,
*  but that is what you have created by your.
*  I know Matthew has a great idea. What?
*  He wants to make a primer for people moving to Austin where you say, Hey,
*  don't turn what you escaped from into the place you're going to.
*  Oh shit. That's brilliant. Yeah.
*  Don't turn the place you're escaping to exactly like where you fled.
*  Yeah, man. Yeah, I get it. Brilliant. And that's, he's right.
*  Austin's gonna.
*  We were talking about earlier,
*  we're talking about defunding the police and defunding ICE and defund,
*  you know, all this nonsense that people are like,
*  let's just like figure out a way to be nice to each other. Yeah, man.
*  I agree. And I don't think that's based on any locality. Now the Austin thing,
*  I like offline. I'll tell you my decision. Cause I did. I did think about it,
*  Joe. I thought about it. Turned you off to it.
*  Well, you know, my,
*  my feeling is it's I'm stammering cause it's like telling you why would reveal
*  where I'm headed. And I don't mean to be like, oh magical about that.
*  The main thing that.
*  Let me say where you are headed is a great choice.
*  Thank you brother. And you fit in there like a P in the pod.
*  I might wind up being there.
*  You might baby.
*  Moving cause that's the thing I think about the Spotify deal and,
*  and, and just the idea of what a podcast is moving forward.
*  I want you to be involved. It's why I wanted you to be number one.
*  And legitimately you and I have some of my favorite conversations.
*  My love you, man. I love you too. We've been friends for a long fucking time.
*  I'll be involved with anything you're involved in. Let's do it.
*  I meant that. And by the way, not to go back to Eddie Bravo apologetics,
*  but I didn't finish my point back then.
*  And I think it was an important point to make.
*  He said to me something that was so fucking weird when he said,
*  and this was on top of him taking on a missionary stance with my inhalation of
*  tobacco smoke. So by then I was already like over a little defensive.
*  I was defensive and I didn't, I was like,
*  I was too dumb at that time to like recognize like, shit man,
*  this guy's got a fucking like, he's a jujitsu master.
*  So what he's saying is not coming from like a place of someone who like,
*  hasn't like worked really hard at a particular.
*  He's saying just don't kill your body. Yeah.
*  But one thing he said to me, which is, I always think back to it.
*  Cause I really remember when he said, I was like, you sick of it.
*  And what he said to me was exactly what's happening right now.
*  He said, you have no idea what's going to happen to him.
*  He's going to be like, like he's going to be so huge.
*  And I remember him saying it, this was, this was fear factor.
*  It was not like a safe assessment, man. It was like, when he said it to me,
*  it felt culty. It felt fucked up. It felt like,
*  it felt crazy. And it was, I remember him saying it to me and like being like,
*  man, I didn't say it cause I was afraid of him.
*  I'm thinking like,
*  you're fucking crazy that you would think that, but he, you know,
*  it's weird that he's right. You know, that's what's weird about it.
*  It's like, this is your first episode on Spotify. And it's crazy, man,
*  because like I get, and I'm honored deeply on it that you invited me on.
*  There was no second choice. Do you know that? Thank you, brother.
*  You were first choice across the board when they said,
*  who do you want to have first on Spotify? Before they said Spotify,
*  Duncan Trezell. That's so cool, Joe. I appreciate it, man. So cool.
*  And I really believe that what I said,
*  that I think you and I have different shows.
*  There's something about you and I together that it's different than just me by
*  myself. We're friends. We're not just friends, man.
*  Like we've known each other for so long and there's no doubt we've tested each
*  other back and forth and up and down and left and right. We know,
*  we love each other. Like, you know, if he,
*  if you call me up at three in the morning, Joe, I need your help.
*  Like I am fucking there, dude. I'm a commando.
*  I'm ready to drop in from a helicopter. I'm going to save you.
*  And because of that,
*  like because of our long relationship, we've been friends for so long, dude.
*  I mean, how long, when do we like 90s?
*  When did you start working on the story?
*  90s, dude. We've been friends since the 90s.
*  The 90s. So more than 20 years.
*  Yeah. We've, we've gone,
*  you have seen me go from being the town court of the comedy store to being
*  someone supporting themselves off of their comedy, man. Like you,
*  you've seen me go from like, you, you were friends with me when I was like,
*  uh, when I was, when I was like,
*  no one would have like ever gambled on anything happening with me other than.
*  No, not no one. Just no one's stupid. I saw it right away.
*  When the moment I first saw you do little hobo.
*  Yeah. I saw you do little hobo in the OR and I'm like,
*  Oh my God. Yeah, man. But you keep doing that. To me.
*  Like that's the thing is like, you keep doing that.
*  Like that's the reason that you, uh, you deserve what you have.
*  You really do. Like all the haters, all the people who are like,
*  I get the haters. So it's just, it's like, it doesn't work.
*  The trick is it's like, I get it. If you're not,
*  like someone explained it to me that like,
*  when you look at people that are doing really well,
*  especially if they all socialize with each other,
*  it becomes like a walled garden and it feels like it's alienated.
*  It feels like you're, you're isolated, you're locked out and it makes you feel bad.
*  It makes you feel shitty. Yeah. And that's the problem.
*  That's the problem. Dude, you hated me. You just, so you know, like,
*  when we first met, you didn't hate me, but you were irritated by me.
*  Cause like, you don't remember when you first met was in the belly room.
*  I was with Princess Corey, Corey Como. And like, uh,
*  I was trying to, at the time I was really into like,
*  it wasn't even called trolling them,
*  but it was like saying a thing opposite to what you should say.
*  And I remember like something about, I was being a contrarian and suddenly came
*  up about marijuana. You mentioned marijuana. I'm sitting with Corey Como.
*  I'm always, I was already nervous around you. Cause at the time you were like,
*  you know, you were, you were still like, at that time,
*  you were still like in this incredible trajectory. And like,
*  I made a stupid joke about how weed was like bad. You know,
*  I'd come from like, I was like, you know,
*  there's never been a time that I haven't been high for years. And you know,
*  what, especially then,
*  but I made this dumb joke about weed was bad.
*  And I remember you looked at me with such,
*  such like a scathing look of like,
*  cause you had just started like understanding how wonderful marijuana was.
*  And you really thought I meant weed was bad.
*  And I remember Corey gave me this look of like, no Duncan, no, don't,
*  don't do the joke.
*  It was a terrible moment because you weren't,
*  you weren't in a place where you could even like,
*  you weren't tolerating that because you were getting high and starting to realize
*  that it wasn't probably weed.
*  I think when I first started smoking pot, I became a zealot, like real quick,
*  because I realized that had been lied to.
*  And I had misunderstood the idea of what marijuana was. I became a zealot.
*  That's what it was. You were a zealot in the look you gave me.
*  I remember the way you looked at me. I realized like, God damn,
*  he, I bet he hates me forever. Never.
*  But today in the same situation, I'd be like, ha ha.
*  Yeah, right. But then it was funny. You were defensive.
*  I was a zealot. I was certainly a zealot. Once I first experienced marijuana,
*  I became a zealot, but you and I had such awesome conversations.
*  We had most of our conversations when we first became friends on the phone.
*  I would call you up. I go, yo dude, I'm here Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
*  Friday. What's up? What are you doing, man? Like, dude,
*  I read this Alice Huckley book and you start telling me about some crazy shit.
*  And you and I would just go, I mean,
*  it would be like a significant chunk of my day on like Mondays when I would call
*  in. You and I would have these cool conversations.
*  So you take me on the road with you. We go to the Irvine Improv.
*  We're driving back from the Irvine Improv in your car. I'm so stoned.
*  You're playing Terrence McKenna. Terrence McKenna is talking about the singularity.
*  And he's talking about like, uh,
*  this idea that we're accelerating towards this point in the future. Novelty.
*  Yeah. And I'll never forget that ride back from the Irvine Improv.
*  I'll never forget it because like,
*  I'd never heard that Terrence McKenna speech.
*  I knew about Terrence McKenna roughly from like, you know,
*  I had encountered him in my earlier years as a psychonaut,
*  but like something about that particular lecture that you're playing,
*  something about leaving something as weird as a comedy show and this idea that
*  you was saying,
*  and this is the part that still sticks with me to this day, which is, you know,
*  look, we are heading towards a point of concurrence of events that is known as
*  the singularity and that the closer we get to it,
*  the more we're going to experience these things tacky on particles being blown
*  backwards through time that will produce these events in history that we call
*  novelty.
*  And something about that ride back and just that moment in me listening to it,
*  I started thinking, it wasn't like, I even thought this isn't real.
*  I thought that is real. And so here we are now,
*  2020 in the middle of a pandemic,
*  you've become what has been described as the Oprah for men.
*  Bro-Pra.
*  Bro-Pra. And you are like,
*  you are someone who like great leaders and principalities are trying to get
*  into this podcast.
*  Do you remember when you live with me and I started buying Buddha shit?
*  Yeah, man. You already had the Buddha shit.
*  But I started buying all this. I like bought a Shiva.
*  I bought this giant bronze Shiva. Yeah. They're like, and you go, Hey,
*  you know why you're attracted to this, right? Yeah. I will. That's the,
*  that's the thing that weirds me out about you, man.
*  That's the part that where I'm like, Oh, I get it. It's like, well,
*  there was some realization that happened and you're picking up on that.
*  And so because you're picking up on that,
*  you have Ganesh out here and you have all these like Eastern symbols,
*  but I just think they look cool. No, no, I don't. That's what I think.
*  Well, yeah, you think that you think they look cool,
*  but also you happen to have this massive audience.
*  Uh, regardless of whatever that is, I just remember that, uh, that ride.
*  I remember that ride back and I remember it like,
*  I remember like thinking like, you know,
*  I think there's something real in here.
*  Like I think what McKenna is saying is probably true. You know,
*  and I think this pandemic,
*  I think this pandemic represents something he predicted,
*  which is we're in a novelty wave right now. This is, it's been,
*  it's been a century since the last pandemic.
*  No one here knows how to deal with this. So now we're in a novelty wave.
*  And maybe we got lazy.
*  We didn't take into account all of the possible variables and a big one with
*  this administration was pandemics. Yeah, man. But not just that.
*  It's like the problem is like where you're kind of in a bit of a bind is that
*  all this human attention has been placed upon you and you have to wrestle with
*  your identity because that's why I need you to move to Austin.
*  Like you don't need me in Austin. Come help me. Come on. I can't do this.
*  Check out. I'll help you. I'll be, I'm always there for you, man.
*  But the problem is, is like, you have this burden of attention and it's like,
*  it's a, it's a real, like for whatever reason, like some, like you,
*  people have decided you're,
*  you're one of the magnifying glasses focusing this beam of attention into the
*  world. And so within that is all this room for a disaster.
*  It's like, you know what I mean? Like,
*  it is.
*  Is the perfect way to put it. Oh my God. Yeah.
*  Someone pays attention to every aspect of your life.
*  There's so much room for disaster. Yeah, man.
*  But I think at a certain point in time it's like there's a sacrificial lamb,
*  a person who lays himself down on the cross.
*  Is that you? No, all of us. It's all of us, but you know, it's a, it's a,
*  really you are in a bit of a bind because the pro it's like, look, man,
*  here's what I love about not being George Washington.
*  I didn't have to make the decisions he made there.
*  I'm reading this book Dune and so beautiful.
*  Like if someone says Duncan, I know you only have 14 teeth.
*  I don't have to make the decision,
*  but I can sell you all the rest of them. I don't have to, I don't be Moses.
*  I don't be Jesus. I don't, I don't have to be church.
*  I don't have to be any of these people, man. I don't want to be them.
*  I would not assign myself to that incarnation, but like in Dune,
*  I'm reading this great book Dune by Frank Herbert is so good. And,
*  and in this desert world, there's these beings called the Fremen. They're like,
*  they, they, they like have become, they represent complete,
*  complete attunement with nature.
*  And so at this wonderful point in the book,
*  this Imperial like galactic representative of this imperialism is like sitting in
*  a like Canyon with all his wounded men. They're almost done.
*  And the Fremen,
*  one of these tribal beings is saying to them,
*  you have to make a water decision.
*  And what they mean by that is your wounded men,
*  you have to pick one of them to die and we'll render their body into water
*  because in this world there's no water.
*  So you have to make a water decision.
*  And the Fremen is interacting with a being in this pure way,
*  which is the only way you can act if you're truly in nature, you're innocent.
*  And he, and it isn't like dark or anything. It's like,
*  you have to make a water decision. And the being is saying to him,
*  like hesitating and the Fremen is saying to him,
*  do you want me to make the water decision for you?
*  And they don't mean it in an aggressive way. They mean like, would you,
*  you love these people? Would you give up the decision to us?
*  Wouldn't you be enough to make the decision yourself? Fortunately,
*  in the book, one of them dies and they're able to like,
*  rend their body into water.
*  But what I'm saying is like these being the position of power and all the whole
*  series of Dune is based on this problem, which is like,
*  if you get saddled with any kind of power, even if it's a,
*  even if you want to pretend it's a kind of clownish power,
*  you are still in a very difficult situation because you have to make a water
*  decision. Like you will have to,
*  like if you're Trump and you're a clown president or if you're Obama,
*  you're some advanced president or-
*  When you're lost, there's only 20 of you. Someone's got to become water.
*  You have to make a water decision.
*  If you're, if you're the president, there's 335 million people.
*  Everything you decide is a water decision. That's a little easier.
*  But if you're on lost, there's 13 people left.
*  Yeah, man. It's brutal. It's brutal.
*  And like no matter what trick you try to use to deal with it,
*  no matter what trick you use, you're still forced into this terrible,
*  it's a predicament, man. It's a Chinese handcuff situation. It's like-
*  Chinese handcuffs are bullshit.
*  It's not a Chinese handcuff that's ever been invented.
*  It's going to hold me down.
*  It's a creepy place. Chinese handcuffs are like this.
*  Yeah. Well, yeah, I know, I know, man, but it's ultimately, it's like,
*  damn, I always feel bad. It's like, I never want you to trend on Twitter.
*  Whenever I see you trending on Twitter, it really sucks for me.
*  Cause I'm like, fuck is he okay? That's what I hate about Twitter is like,
*  people will trend on Twitter. You know what I'm saying? And it's like,
*  dude, I get it. I hate it. Cause I'm like, shit was in a car accident.
*  Just stay off Twitter. Yeah, you're right. I gotta stay off Twitter.
*  I just don't think it's good for you. The problem is you're,
*  you're interacting with people that don't, they're not communicating.
*  First of all, and foremost, maybe they're,
*  they're not communicating with people that are right in front of them.
*  So they don't feel social cues. They don't feel empathy.
*  And so they're,
*  they're talking in this weird way that's only existed for like fucking 10 years.
*  It's at Duncan Trussell on Twitter. Follow me. Duncan Trussell on Twitter.
*  No, you're right. No, no, no, no.
*  Jerren Lanier, you know, like the idea is like, get the fuck off social media.
*  I agree. I don't think that's right either.
*  Is it weird for this to, I think, I think, I think it's inevitable.
*  I think it's too big, too much of a part of everything.
*  I think there's no,
*  I don't think there's a future in telling people to stay off it.
*  I think there's more of a future of telling people to understand what it is and
*  manage it to look at social media,
*  to look at Twitter and Instagram and all those things and understand what they
*  are. I don't think you'd have to get off, but you should,
*  you should spend a lot of time outside of that.
*  You gotta get out there, man.
*  It's not good to read comments. It's not good to,
*  Google your name. I don't think that's good.
*  And that's how, when you see me and you see I'm okay, that's why.
*  Cause I don't do that. Those things.
*  You get crazy. Should we cut ourselves for a Spotify?
*  Should we like do like a little blood brother ritual or cut our fingers and
*  like mix our blood?
*  That's how you got your fucking COVID test earlier.
*  Let's do it. We're like COVID. We don't have COVID anymore.
*  Should we like do a slice?
*  No.
*  Come on. It's good. Why not?
*  Duncan, can I do a little...
*  All great, all great rituals are based in like some kind of blood bond.
*  Do you think there's this, honestly, if you didn't know me,
*  if I wasn't your friend,
*  would you think there's a responsibility that I have that I'm not meeting?
*  No, I think you're meeting. I think the problem is like, no matter how,
*  it's like the, it's hilarious. And the, and Star Trek, you know,
*  Captain Kirk, they get that if you're going to be like someone who like gets to
*  be a commander of a starship,
*  you're given a problem that is unsolvable. So no matter what you do,
*  it's that you can't win. No matter what, like when you get to a certain level of
*  power, any decision you make on some level is wrong and right
*  simultaneously. This is quantum computing, my friend. So I do not,
*  you know, in my analysis of your podcast and all my deep
*  judgmental qualities,
*  I do not see what you're doing as being wrong at all.
*  I see sometimes you make naive decisions that I would make too.
*  I think sometimes you have people on who later found out to be like,
*  at least in the moment they were on the show, a little like fucked up.
*  Like for sure in the early days,
*  I had an issue in the early days where I didn't want to admit that I was getting
*  as many views as there was. And I would do a show and I was just like,
*  no one's watching this. And I would have some crazy person on. Maybe,
*  there was a few that was like, I shouldn't have talked to that dude.
*  That dude was fucked up. But that was a learning process. You know, that was,
*  there's a thing about doing a podcast where there's no school for it,
*  right? There's no way to figure out how to do it perfectly.
*  It's not like learning how to play piano. It's real linear.
*  There's all these weird ways to do it and no one knows. So unfortunately,
*  I was like, I guess like second generation,
*  first generation is for sure Adam Curry. He's the pod father.
*  And then there's like Adam Corolla. There's a few other people,
*  but I came right after that. 2009.
*  So no one knew what the fuck we were doing.
*  And I think there was a,
*  there's certainly been some times where I didn't want to admit that it was
*  reaching as many people as it was.
*  Yeah. You can't think about that because it makes you feel crazy.
*  Well,
*  that's why I want to have you on because I knew we were going to get drunk and
*  get high.
*  The first episode would be as preposterous as an episode could be. Yeah.
*  And then from this,
*  you can like have people on who are like real pundits or whatever. I mean,
*  look, man, anyone I've ever talked to,
*  anytime I've ever been in this situation where people are talking shit about you
*  or like questioning my friendship with you because I think,
*  because I've, because you had this person or that person on,
*  if I'm friends with you, something's weird with you or me or whatever, I,
*  oh, I always,
*  and will forever stand up for you, man,
*  because I know you and I, and I, and to me it's like,
*  look what, like you got into this ridiculous
*  predicament. Like you're in a, you're in a bind, man.
*  You are, you are in a bind and it's a beautiful, it's a beautiful bind,
*  but it's a real, it's a real problem. And, but like, because of your heart,
*  which is very open and very sweet, you allow this,
*  like you allow everyone to have,
*  you allow a lot of people on your podcast that don't make sense according to
*  the Zeitgeist and some people get mad at you and they pounce.
*  And I always feel so rotten about that because it's like, man,
*  you don't understand. This is a real progressive,
*  like you're looking at someone who is exactly the being that you would hope
*  would be the like result of like great government and great education.
*  And you're fucking attacking an ally.
*  That's the part that gets me up where I get really bummed is it's like, man,
*  you have to understand that person. Look, you should, if you ask me,
*  I feel like Duncan, should I have Ben Shapiro on? I feel like no, no,
*  no, there's so many better people to have on than that guy.
*  But it doesn't mean you can't have those other people on too.
*  Well, if you listen to me, but I would say to you, I go, listen, man,
*  I know what you're saying, but if I just took you to dinner, you, me,
*  and Ben Shapiro went to some fucking kosher. I love,
*  I love hanging out with him. I guarantee you'd like him. No, I know that.
*  He's a good guy. No, the problem is not him.
*  The problem is all the people's reactions to him and him.
*  There's two things going on.
*  Two things.
*  The things that he said and the reactions and the fact that he's kind of
*  weaponized their reactions. He's a good guy.
*  Look, I don't, to me it's like, I would,
*  I would be so bored if you only have people on the show that I agreed with.
*  It would be such a shitty show.
*  But I do have a rule where I,
*  I won't have anybody on anymore unless I feel that they enter into those arguments
*  with good faith.
*  Yeah, man. I know that.
*  And I feel like Ben Shapiro, he enters into all discussions with good faith.
*  He's not an insulting guy. He and he,
*  he and I have had interesting conversations about gay marriage,
*  interesting conversations about all sorts of aspects of society,
*  racial relations, black lives matters.
*  And he and I have talked about it in a very respectful way,
*  even though we disagree. There's been no, there's been no insults.
*  There's been no shittiness.
*  And I think that's the problem with putting a guy like that on some sort of a
*  standard traditional talk show.
*  You have him on and some social justice warrior and they argue with each other
*  and you got a host and you break every seven minutes to go to commercial.
*  You don't find out what he's about.
*  He's not a bad guy, man.
*  And he gets shaped as much by those seven minutes segments where you're battling
*  out with someone trying to get soundbites as you and I do by three minute spots
*  at the Comedy Store trying to pass open mic night.
*  Based on this podcast,
*  you would imagine that I have a chip in my shoulder about Ben Shapiro,
*  which I really don't. I don't think you do.
*  I don't think the reason I brought up Eddie Bravo is only because like, uh,
*  I think like what you're doing is really sweet and good.
*  And I think your heart is in the same place it was.
*  And I met you a while ago, which is pretty bizarre.
*  Like they would somehow maintain a thing that's an integral, you know,
*  I've met, you know,
*  you meet people out here who go through rough patches and they're not who they
*  portrayed themselves as initially.
*  They're actually like con artists or fuck ups or like bad temporarily.
*  I think people get better, but sometimes they're bad temporarily.
*  But you, you really like,
*  like maintain this,
*  I think a really beautiful kind of a North star regarding your ethics and your
*  consideration thing. So yeah, man, I'm like,
*  I'll do anything for you. Really. I'm one of your great devotees.
*  I'll kill for your joke.
*  I'm one of your great devotees. I really am too, man. I,
*  I feel like, like legitimately, honestly, I, I,
*  I feel like I've been tested where I've been given an opportunity to help other
*  people. And I feel like it's a, there's no controversy in my mind.
*  My mind knows the right choice. And so I've always tried to promote all these
*  different comics. And I think that that's what we should all do with each other.
*  I think, I don't think we need to make all the money.
*  I think you need to make some money. I need to make some money.
*  What do we need, man? We need barbecues and margaritas.
*  But I've never seen you be selfish.
*  I've seen a lot of people be selfish. I've never seen you be like,
*  this is the thing. I don't care.
*  Here's how I'm selfish. I'm selfish. And then I'm not selfish.
*  Cause I know that being selfish is negative to you. It's bad for you.
*  It's dangerous. It's sloppy. It's weak. It's some bitch ass shit.
*  So I never, I'm never selfish because I'm selfish because I don't want to myself
*  to be a bitch. You discovered a like thing.
*  I figured it out when I was jealous. I figured it out when I was younger.
*  I remember watching comics who were better than me when I was like 21.
*  And I was thinking like, God, fuck these guys. How did he come up with that joke?
*  And then I, I don't remember when it happened, but it was early, like 21,
*  22. I remember catching it and going, Oh,
*  I caught a bad pattern. Like I got this pattern where I'm jealous.
*  Instead of like,
*  or I could be the way I was before I ever got into comedy,
*  which is inspired. Instead I was jealous. And so it made me realize like, Oh,
*  I've got a bad pattern that I'm, I'm chasing this bad pattern.
*  Do you remember that time Joe that we drank a bowl of blood in front of that
*  Malik statue?
*  It was chicken blood.
*  Yeah.
*  Look, I feel like it's like, I do.
*  Is this the longest podcast ever?
*  Look, it doesn't matter. We're done. I gotta be again. Let's wrap it up.
*  But what are we at? Five and a half. It's over. We did it.
*  Kevin Smith was five hours.
*  You think you should do this in two podcasts? I think we should.
*  Whatever you want to do that. I don't care. Right. Listen, Spotify,
*  I don't get greedy. We give you a six hour podcast.
*  Thanks my friends. It gets better.
*  There's going to be actual scientists on the show.
*  I will talk Duncan Trussell into doing regular podcasts,
*  either through zoom or Skype. I have thoughts.
*  I have ideas. I'd want to help.
*  I would have this conversation if we were recording. That's the funny thing.
*  I've only been, I feel like I've been extending it.
*  It's just cause I want to keep talking.
*  I know me too, man. We're going to help. All right. How'd they kiss that?
*  Jamie, I'm sorry. Big kiss.
