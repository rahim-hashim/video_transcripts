*  God. Dude, this is the launch day. I'm nervous. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=14.0s)]
*  Ah, shut the fuck up. I'm nervous. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=17.0s)]
*  How can you be nervous? You run thousands of miles and you're a psycho. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=19.0s)]
*  This is the collaboration that we did with Kill Cliff. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=22.0s)]
*  It's out today. It's a spicy cherry. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=26.0s)]
*  What's it called? It's called Elk Blood. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=29.0s)]
*  Elk Blood. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=31.0s)]
*  How sick is that? Cheers, sir. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=33.0s)]

*  How sick is that, Elk Blood? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=37.0s)]
*  Ah, it's good too. We went over like, man, how many iterations did we go over? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=39.0s)]
*  About 20. Yeah, there was a shitload. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=44.0s)]
*  We kept tweaking it and, you know, it's kind of the same thing that we did with the flaming Joe. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=46.0s)]
*  You gotta get it right, takes a long time, but those guys, whatever they're doing, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=51.0s)]
*  whatever fucking alchemy they're doing to make this stuff so delicious. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=56.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is good. This is really good. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=60.0s)]
*  And I just love that it's, well, first it says, Cam Haynes and Joe Rogan, Elk Blood. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=62.0s)]
*  And it's CBD, so it's got 25 milligrams of CBD, and we're going to do an Ignite version as well. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=68.0s)]
*  No sugar? Yeah, no sugar. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=74.0s)]
*  It's got caffeine. How much caffeine does it have? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=76.0s)]
*  125. 125? That ain't shit, bro. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=79.0s)]
*  We've been drinking those Black Rifle coffees. Those Black Rifle coffees will ruin you. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=82.0s)]
*  They're so good. Have you had them? They're good. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=87.0s)]
*  Want one of them? I love them. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=89.0s)]
*  We'll bust them out too. A lot of sugar. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=91.0s)]
*  Woo, there's so much sugar. That's cheating. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=93.0s)]
*  I know, I was drinking that, and I was like, holy shit, this thing is so good. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=96.0s)]
*  And then I was like, what is going on here? And then I look and I'm like, oh, that's why. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=100.0s)]
*  How many milligrams does it have of sugar? I don't know. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=104.0s)]
*  Well, you just go grab a few for us. Infinity. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=107.0s)]
*  I love them. I love them. I'm going to drink one right now. Good boy. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=109.0s)]
*  They are so good. I mean, if you're not hung up on sugar like I am. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=112.0s)]
*  I'm hung up on it too. You should be. You really should be. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=116.0s)]
*  But it's a wonderful treat, occasionally. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=119.0s)]
*  Yeah, if you reward yourself. So if you run a hundred miler, I'm like, I can have a good Black Rifle coffee ready to drink with some sugar. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=122.0s)]
*  Well, you know Floyd Mayweather drinks Coca-Cola or Pepsi. I forget which one. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=132.0s)]
*  But he drinks it like he drinks soda, essentially, right after he works out sometimes. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=136.0s)]
*  And I talked to a nutritionist, he said, actually, like post rigorous exercise like that is actually pretty effective way of dumping glucose back in your body. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=141.0s)]
*  Sounds gross. Yeah. You know, you work out. You're the best boxer of all time. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=151.0s)]
*  You know, and you're fucking these are the three hundreds, though. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=156.0s)]
*  I thought that's what you want. One of these. Yes. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=159.0s)]
*  This is the real bad boy. I better have one too. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=162.0s)]
*  But yeah, no. But these are fucking awesome too, man. These have too much sugar as well. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=165.0s)]
*  No, I know. They definitely all have too much sugar. Dan, the fitness man came and trained with me one time, you know, Elk Shape. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=169.0s)]
*  Yeah. Dan Stanton. Yeah. And he gave his podcast. He's got great YouTube videos, too. He is good. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=175.0s)]
*  I mean, he's just like a great guy. He's a legit. He's just an elk hunter. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=180.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, and just a good guy who works his ass off. Yeah, seems like it doesn't talk shit about a real good guy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=184.0s)]
*  That makes me like that's a nice thing. But a lot of people talk shit about you. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=190.0s)]
*  I know. But he gave me one of these and that's where I was like, wait a second. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=194.0s)]
*  I got a little why is this so good? It's too good. It's too good. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=197.0s)]
*  What is the milligrams of sugar? You can read this. I can't read this with the light. This dim. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=201.0s)]
*  Where where is it? Say 16, 18 total sugars, 18 grams. Yeah, that's a lot. That's a lot. That's actually not too bad. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=207.0s)]
*  Well, it's not compared to apple juice. I thought you know how much fucking apple juice has in it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=217.0s)]
*  Total sugar. My daughter pointed this out to me. This is 28. What do you do? What's the matter? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=221.0s)]
*  It doesn't say 18. That says 28. It says 18, right? Oh, he has good eyes. Yeah, this is 18. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=227.0s)]
*  No, he has crazy vision, dude. He can see weird shit. Like I dropped my phone once when we were at Tahoe Ranch. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=235.0s)]
*  I dropped it on the ground. He's cracked. They're aware. And he's like in the middle. I'm like, no way. Really? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=241.0s)]
*  And I'm like fucking do this. He's like saw it from he I was holding it over here and he saw it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=247.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you're three months older than me. Yeah, I'm older. And my eyes are not as good. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=252.0s)]
*  In three months, I'll I'll be where you are. No, no, no, no. You have weird vision. You really do. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=257.0s)]
*  Like your vision is extraordinary. And I always wonder. I wonder if that's from so much time in the mountains. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=263.0s)]
*  Because one of the things they say that's fucking with people's eyes is we're constantly looking at short distances. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=268.0s)]
*  And it's sort of distorting our eyes because of that. And that's why Andrew Huberman recommends looking at great distances for like a good period of the day. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=273.0s)]
*  Like it's actually a good thing to do for your eyes. Well, you know what I what I've always done still, but I used to I've talked about it a few times, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=283.0s)]
*  but I will run at night and I never wear a light like I'll run on Pisgah, the mountain I run and never have a hair. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=291.0s)]
*  Are you trying to get eaten? What are you doing? Well, I'm not worried about that. But don't people get eaten up there in my head? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=297.0s)]
*  No, but in my mind, didn't someone didn't someone in Oregon recently get eaten? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=303.0s)]
*  Not that I know of. There was there was two people last year that got got got in the Pacific Northwest in Alberta. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=309.0s)]
*  I heard a woman was killed by a black bear last year. Yeah, I heard about that one. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=316.0s)]
*  But wasn't there a couple of people that were killed by mountain lions last year? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=321.0s)]
*  2018 hiker broken neck puncture wounds by a cougar. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=323.0s)]
*  Broken neck from a cougar. You imagine that motherfucker grabbing your neck. Speaking of my neck, look at this. What's going on? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=328.0s)]
*  Look at this bling. Look at the bling. You got a C-H bling. I've only had this on this the second time. Oh my God. Are you hanging out with rappers? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=336.0s)]
*  I know. I'm celebrating my JRE appearance. But so that was that was the whole reason why I wore it just to do that right there. That's adorable. Scooby the jeweler. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=343.0s)]
*  He made that for me and he hand delivered it. That's amazing. Yeah, it's amazing. Well, that's when you can wear bling and someone gives it to you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=353.0s)]
*  What I was going to say was cool. So if you want to have bought that for yourself, it's a little questionable, right? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=360.0s)]
*  Unless you're like a machine gun Kelly type person, a very flamboyant rapper or some rock star. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=365.0s)]
*  You want to rock it hard? No, my vision. I wear old man shoes. People make fun of my shoes. I know. You should be wearing these. I would wear those. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=372.0s)]
*  But listen, so my vision is the bling with a bear skin jacket. I like it. A bear that you killed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=381.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Everybody's got to shut the fuck up if you actually killed the bear. Yeah. I ate him too. We ate his pepperoni. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=390.0s)]
*  We're eating bear pepperoni. It's delicious. It's very, very good. So good. Shout out to whoever processed that for you. Whatever butcher did that for you. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=395.0s)]
*  This is in Cottage Grove, Oregon and Gates. Yeah. Gates family tradition meets. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=405.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of those folks out there that are it's like they're the unsung heroes of the wild game world. That is so good. And that's a bear. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=412.0s)]
*  And people like, oh, you can eat bear. Summer sausage. I've had bear summer sausage is delicious. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=420.0s)]
*  You know, it was the best for talking about all this stuff because, you know, you know, Jesse Griffiths, the guy who's the the chef of Die Do I. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=425.0s)]
*  It's a restaurant here in Austin. And I actually heard him on Steve's podcast, Ronell's Meat Eater podcast before I met him. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=434.0s)]
*  So I'd heard him there and then I had him on as a guest. Fucking super interesting guy. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=443.0s)]
*  But he's the best at taking wild game and making it insanely delicious. He's just because he's an excellent chef and he loves food and he loves hunting. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=448.0s)]
*  Yeah. And he teaches courses or takes people out hunting. What is his what is his school called again? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=459.0s)]
*  The New School of Traditional Cookery. New School of Traditional Cookery. So he takes people and he'll hunt hogs with them. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=466.0s)]
*  He'll teach them how to shoot a hog, how to butcher it. And then he teaches them how to cook it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=473.0s)]
*  And the guy is a fucking unsung hero in the world of like taking wild game and making it just the most extraordinary dish you've ever had. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=478.0s)]
*  We had duck, diver duck. Diver duck supposed to be gross. Yeah. That's what everybody says. Right. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=488.0s)]
*  Because diver ducks eat whatever the fuck is in the bottom of the ocean or the bottom of the lake rather. Yeah. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=493.0s)]
*  Well, most people don't like the way they taste. But he had this way of marinating them. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=497.0s)]
*  I don't want to like say to his process because I don't really totally remember it. I don't want to fuck it up. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=502.0s)]
*  But the result was fucking insane. It was so good. Yeah. No one could stop eating it. It was so good. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=506.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, imagine what he could do with bear. Oh, yeah. If he did that magic with duck. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=513.0s)]
*  What Jen Rivett can do with bear. I know. She makes those bear roasts in the Traeger and cooks them for like fucking 16 hours. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=517.0s)]
*  I wanted to bring. So I had that ham. I sent you a picture of because my my goal was I thought, oh, maybe we can cook this because I thought you were going to have a Traeger here at the studio. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=524.0s)]
*  We did. We do. Actually, it's just not hooked up through the ceiling yet. Right. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=533.0s)]
*  I mean, so I'm like, oh, we could marinate this thing. And so I had Jen send me her marinating recipe. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=537.0s)]
*  You know, it's got brown sugar. It's got all this shit in it. Of course. Pineapples. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=543.0s)]
*  And they know how to make shit delicious. So Trace did all that and got it. But of course, you don't have a Traeger. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=548.0s)]
*  So I'm like, well, I'll bring some bear pepperoni. And I was I was asking because everybody they're so concerned about trichinosis. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=554.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, yeah, Steve or Nella made everybody nervous about it because they got sick. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=561.0s)]
*  He got sick after he warned everybody forever. It's the craziest thing. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=565.0s)]
*  It's almost like he wanted to get it. Yeah. He manifested it because he always said that he wanted to get scratched by a grizzly. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=569.0s)]
*  Just scratched. He just wanted to fuck a tattoo. Sounds good. I want claws across the chest. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=576.0s)]
*  You know, but I think then he had that encounter on Fog Knack Island where they got rushed by an 11 foot brown bear. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=581.0s)]
*  Right. And he goes all that shit is out the window. Fuck that. Had to come to Jesus moment. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=588.0s)]
*  100 percent come to Jesus. Yeah. An 11 foot bear that's claimed an elk that you shot and you don't know about it. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=593.0s)]
*  And you're eating lunch sitting around in his territory. You're so relaxed. You let your guard down. You're just like, hey, we're good. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=600.0s)]
*  Well, what I was going to say was so I asked Gates Tanners, he's a young kid just kicking ass, does such a great job with your wild game meat. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=607.0s)]
*  But I said, what's the process for making pepperoni? Because people are nervous about cooking and trichinosis. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=617.0s)]
*  So they put it in like a smoker type oven and it's at one hundred and sixty for an hour. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=622.0s)]
*  Hundred hundred sixty five for an hour. One hundred and fifty five for an hour. And then one hundred and forty five for five hours. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=630.0s)]
*  So it's seven hours of cooking. Oh, wow. Yeah. And and so there's no no worry of. Right. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=637.0s)]
*  And it just tastes amazing. It's got that little I go I said, does it have a little pop to it when you eat it? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=643.0s)]
*  You know, I get bite into a little pop on that. The the shell out here. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=650.0s)]
*  It's like, oh, yeah, it's got the pop and it does. And it's everybody here who tried it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=653.0s)]
*  Everybody has given I've given it to. I took some to my old work yesterday. Everybody loves it. It's good. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=657.0s)]
*  What's weird is and this is a little known fact, when the settlers were making their way across America, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=663.0s)]
*  they would kill bear for meat and they would kill deer for the hides. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=670.0s)]
*  And that was their preferred food was bear. Right. Because it was closer to beef. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=675.0s)]
*  And when they named like a dollar bills a buck because a buck, that's what a buckskin was. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=681.0s)]
*  It was a dollar. Oh, I didn't know. That's why. Yeah. That's where that term came from. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=686.0s)]
*  I learned so much on this podcast. I've got a lot of useless information bouncing around in my head. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=690.0s)]
*  But that's a fascinating one. Like, I wonder what shifted where they stopped eating bear. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=694.0s)]
*  Then all of a sudden, Bear became a teddy bear and bear became your friend and bear became yogi and bear became only you can prevent forest fires. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=698.0s)]
*  All of a sudden, the bears, it's like this weird and more enthral, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=705.0s)]
*  more fized version of what you experience when you're out there in the woods. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=709.0s)]
*  Right. And with anybody experiences and what you know, when people get rushed by bear. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=714.0s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen the video of these guys that are on a dirt bike. And this guy wipes out in front of a bear. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=718.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And then I saw that thing comes boiling out of there. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=724.0s)]
*  Intense. Oh, my God. Pull that up, Jamie. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=729.0s)]
*  We have to see it because it's so scary. They're so scary. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=733.0s)]
*  Do we have a pull it up Jamie shirt? I think Jamie has one. Oh, good. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=738.0s)]
*  Yeah, you have pulled up Jamie shirts, right? Is it on Jamie? Is it on pull it up Jamie dot com? Young Jamie dot com? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=742.0s)]
*  It should be on pull it up Jamie dot com. These fucking scoundrels. There's a link on that website. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=750.0s)]
*  Oh, thanks, Eric. Your merch, dude. You got to get your merch. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=754.0s)]
*  Look at this video. Young Jamie dot com. Look at this video. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=760.0s)]
*  If that guy didn't rev the engine, who knows what that bear would have done to them? That dude. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=766.0s)]
*  Oh, very smart. Reving that engine. Very smart. Oh, that is a very, very smart move. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=771.0s)]
*  Whoever that guy who did that. Yeah, that guy probably saved their lives. Yeah. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=777.0s)]
*  Holy fucking shit. Those things are terrifying. Yeah, they are. They're monsters. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=782.0s)]
*  They are the killers of the forest. Yeah, that's all they do. Hey, you know what? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=787.0s)]
*  Here's this is a point. So you had the Alaska bone people up. Yeah. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=791.0s)]
*  And remember that video where they had the brown bear and the muskox. You watched that, right? Yes. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=796.0s)]
*  Killing the calves. Yeah. So I just had a study sent to me, but they had a radio caller. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=802.0s)]
*  Maybe you guys talked about this. I can't remember, but radio caller on grizzlies up there. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=808.0s)]
*  And it was they were killed. They killed seven bear and the camera is going off every 10 or 15 minutes. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=813.0s)]
*  And this was during calving season or or like caribou calves. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=820.0s)]
*  But they they killed I'm going to pull it up right here just so I have the exact number just because people don't won't even probably believe it. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=825.0s)]
*  But they killed so video camera footage of these seven brown bears show that they killed approximately 238 moose and caribou calves across the 45 days. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=834.0s)]
*  That's an average of about 34 moose and caribou calves per bear. Holy shit. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=846.0s)]
*  In 45 days, 238. So that was seven bear just killing. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=852.0s)]
*  So this is what is always weird to me. We have these things that are in our head like acceptable narratives of animals that you're allowed to kill. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=857.0s)]
*  Like you're allowed to kill fish. People fish. People don't freak out about it. You're allowed to kill birds. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=866.0s)]
*  But when you get into certain animals and I really do think it has something to do with like Disney movies. I really do. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=873.0s)]
*  Has to has to because it's in our head as a kid that bears are cool. Well, and you go to the zoo, you see a bear. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=880.0s)]
*  It's not doing shit. It's just laying there. Yeah. You know what I mean? Exactly. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=886.0s)]
*  And then you see it that reinforced on the movies or the shows. And then you see circus bears. Right. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=890.0s)]
*  And they harmless. Yeah. And like why would somebody want to kill one of these things? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=895.0s)]
*  But then you go into the wild and you see like where I was just bear hunting last week in Alberta. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=899.0s)]
*  These bear come in. It was it was funny because the sows would come in and they would just be growling, fighting, doing the alarm call, getting all puffed up. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=905.0s)]
*  And I'm like, they live with with each other every single day all year. Why are you so pissed off? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=916.0s)]
*  I mean, it's like, why would you be so mad at somebody you live with every day? Right. Yeah. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=923.0s)]
*  But they're just they are just so competitive. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=927.0s)]
*  And then the males come in and his breeding season and then the boar I killed came in and it was it was pretty fascinating because you wouldn't even see him. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=931.0s)]
*  And the bear would all be looking up the other bear, the smaller bear, the smaller boars or the south. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=941.0s)]
*  They'd be looking towards where he's coming. And then he'd show up. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=946.0s)]
*  And so it was it was pretty cool because I remember back the day before I saw a sow and she was like walking and like kind of doing like this, like really hard steps. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=950.0s)]
*  And I'm like, are they picking up vibration from the walking? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=962.0s)]
*  And so she's trying to sound bigger like this because then because I put it together when the boar I killed giant boar, he was coming before they could see him. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=967.0s)]
*  And I'm looking and getting startled, running up trees. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=978.0s)]
*  And I'm like, are they feeling that vibration of a heavy animal, heavier animal coming? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=981.0s)]
*  Wow. A bigger boar. They have that much sensitivity. I think I bet it makes sense because I saw the smaller sow like trying to stomp. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=985.0s)]
*  And I'm like, it just makes sense that that was going on because they would knew that they knew that the bear I killed was coming long before they could see him. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=992.0s)]
*  So a bear the size of the bear you killed is like a tyrant. Yeah. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1002.0s)]
*  He kills all the babies. He kills whatever he can get a hold of. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1006.0s)]
*  He kills younger bears. They cannibalize. Right. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1010.0s)]
*  That's what's if if aside. Yeah. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1014.0s)]
*  There's so much of that that they and cannibalize like if a bear gets shot by a hunter and you get to it, there's a possibility that other bears are eating it already. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1016.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah, that's a good possibility. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1027.0s)]
*  That happens often. It happens often. If you have to leave it overnight. Yes. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1029.0s)]
*  There's a chance it's going to be eaten. Which is fucking wild. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1033.0s)]
*  But that's the world. It's not a world of yogi. No. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1037.0s)]
*  And this is a crazy idea of this animal that people have, which is make what makes people take selfies with them and do all this crazy shit that they do it like Yellowstone, those wackadoos that get in front of bison. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1041.0s)]
*  It's like we have these ideas about what these things are that's based on a bullshit version of them, including the Yellowstone version. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1053.0s)]
*  When we were in Yellowstone, you could hang out 10 feet from an elk. They're just right there. Right. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1059.0s)]
*  They don't worry about people at all. They're hanging out in the visitor center. They're laying down in front of everybody. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1066.0s)]
*  That was probably not September then because they weren't running. No, they weren't running. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1071.0s)]
*  No, it was the summertime. But it was it was still it was totally alien behavior. Right. Like completely domesticated. Yeah. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1074.0s)]
*  And just imagine what it was like when they reintroduced wolves into that area. Oh, God. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1084.0s)]
*  Bloodbath. Because this is this is the animal that you're dealing with. You're forcing an animal to be reintegrated with the most ferocious death. Right. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1090.0s)]
*  So you think there's too many of them. You think it's imbalanced. You think they shouldn't have killed off the wolves. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1100.0s)]
*  OK. Well, now what? Now you're just going to all these cute elk that have been hanging out the visitor center are just going to get butchered. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1105.0s)]
*  Yeah. And they don't know what the fuck a wolf is. Right. They've had generation after generation after generation. No wolves. Yeah. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1113.0s)]
*  They're like, no wolves. Great. We're just out here hanging out. No. The occasional mountain lion, whatever, whatever. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1120.0s)]
*  But an occasional mountain lion is nothing like a pack of wolves. No, no. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1126.0s)]
*  Pack wolves makes a whole lot more wolves and they all stay together and they hunt together. They got a process for killing. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1131.0s)]
*  They got it down. They got it down. You know, you got some sort of telepathy or something. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1136.0s)]
*  You've seen where they communicate where one wolf will tire out. The next wolf will fill in like a little relay team. Yeah. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1141.0s)]
*  Yeah. Wearing out one animal. Yeah. You know, the prey animal. And it's yeah, they're just they'll wipe stuff out just like the brown bear and those, you know, the seven brown bear. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1148.0s)]
*  They're just they're born to kill. They don't know when to stop. You know, so it's not I saw somebody said on my page, I said, well, when they kill and just come back and just eat off that for later and live off that one kill. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1158.0s)]
*  I'm like, what? What are you talking about? They go on rampages. No, you flip that switch on. Yeah. They're killing everything. Yeah. They're not like Native Americans. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1171.0s)]
*  They don't want to kill what they're using every piece of this animal. Yeah. No, they're not like that. They don't have any they don't have any idea of conservationism. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1180.0s)]
*  Their idea is to just kill everything that's in front of them. And there was a was it recently there was a crazy one where this pack of wolves killed like an enormous number of elk. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1189.0s)]
*  It was like 18 elk, something crazy. Yeah. Just went on a rampage. Yeah. Just I don't know what happened or how they got so many of them. But it happens with livestock all the time. Yeah. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1201.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, can you see if you can find it was like surplus killing? I believe it was in Wyoming, if I remember correctly. But they were shocked. They were like, Jesus, they just killed them. Yeah. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1213.0s)]
*  They didn't even they weren't even eating them. Right. They just went on a rampage. They weren't hungry. I mean, that's what they're born to do. Yeah. Wolf pack slaughters 19 elk in rare surplus killing. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1223.0s)]
*  So this is in 2016. It's not rare, though. I mean, so even even that word rare. Yeah. Well, who's saying rare? Well, I think it's rare they get that many. I wonder what the circumstances were where they could kill that many. Yeah. There's a photo of all the elk lined up. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1235.0s)]
*  It's horrible. Yeah. Look at that. That's crazy. Yeah. I just I'm not convinced that it's rare. I think it's rare that we find out about it. How many wolves did that? That's what I want to know. I don't know. I want to know how many wolves if there's 19. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1251.0s)]
*  What you got 50 wolves up there? You got 100 wolves. Like are there fucking super packs up there that we don't know about? I don't. I they have a good accounting of how many wolves are up there. Oh, it says nine wolves. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1264.0s)]
*  Nine wolves. Yeah, I was gonna say I don't think it would take that many to do that. That's incredible because those are all see it's 17 calves. So that's that's kind of the point with that muskox video is those were calves. They don't they can't run and two adults. Yeah. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1274.0s)]
*  Yeah, 17 calves and two adults. Wow. I mean they they can't run like a full grown what muskox or elk or anything else. So they're they're pretty much just right for the picking that's bear even black bear will follow elk around when they know it's calving season. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1288.0s)]
*  Right when the calf is born, they'll kill it. They said Lund also described the kill to CNN as sport killing. Although the consensus among biologists and wildlife officials is that wolves do not hunt for sport, but sometimes kill more than they can eat at one point, especially in winter when frigid temperatures preserve the killed prey for later consumption. You know what I bet though? I bet they can't help themselves when they see calves. No, I bet it's like a kid. Which is on. Yeah, it's like a kid. Yeah. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1303.0s)]

*  mostly out to work. I mean, it's all it's I bet a lot of the killing is done by actual feral cats. But a lot of it is done by people's pets. You've seen pets that bring back a bird or a mouse and just lay it down. Yeah, I had a cat. She was the sweetest fluffiest thing and she would bring back a bird like she did some awesome thing. She wanted me to see it. And she's just a ball of love at any other time. Unless she saw fucking she saw a bird. It's natural instinct. A mouse death, death, natural. You know, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1363.0s)]
*  they play with them. You know, what's weird is like, so Marshall, yeah, you see dogs, they see squirrel outside. They're automatically in hunt mode. I don't know if is Marshall. Oh, dude, he killed two last week. Right. He's been on a rampage. So now it's fucked up nicest, fluffiest, sweetest dog. A bundle of love. He's all love but he wants to fuck up squirrels. And also turtles. So we have to keep protect the turtles from them now. So now I have to wander around my fucking yard looking for turtles. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1393.0s)]
*  He kills him. He kills him. Yeah, he fucked one of his teeth up, biting the shit out of this turtle shell. Like, bro, like, what are you doing? So where's the real Marshall? Where's my buddy? Does he try to get there? Because they kill them. They go in. Does he just crush a whole shell? He's trying to fucking chew at him while they're in there. And Marshall. Yeah, it's horrible. Yeah, it was horrible. He's done it to a couple of them now. So now when we go outside, we have to look for turtles first. Right. Because they come up to try to [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1423.0s)]
*  lay their eggs. Oh, yeah. So I mean, it's just animal instinct. It's just animal instinct. And it's a it's a sad one. Because it's like the I kind of I think turtles are cool. You know, I don't want the turtle babies to get fucked up on my dog. I remember I'm still kind of traumatized by this. I was driving back from scouting for elk and driving along this Mohawk River Road and a turtle was crossing the road. I didn't and I hit it with the just ran over it. And the sound [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1453.0s)]
*  Oh, and I was just like, it was haunting. Like popping a turtle in my truck. I was just like, and I still that was 30 years ago. This is why I think we have this relationship with turtles because they've never done anything to us. The worst thing that's ever happened to us. Yeah, but only if you fuck with them. They don't come for you. I think they evolved because they evolved with people in Florida. That's my theory. People in Florida's are fucking with them and they just developed ability to bite them. That's my theory. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1483.0s)]
*  That's my theory. I'll go hard. They're snapping turtles in Florida mostly. It's probably a shitty theory. But the point is like turtles don't fuck with people. You can get diseases from them though. If you have them as pets, you have to be real careful. They can they can give you diseases. I had a turtle turtle a pretty low maintenance went as a pet like I had a little tiny one when I was a kid. I had a few of them and they will fuck up some goldfish. Yeah, let me tell you something. Whoa, look at the size of that thing. See that would that's a snapping turtle that looks like Yoda. That would kill somebody that would that would [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1513.0s)]
*  bite your fucking hand right off your wrist. Snap. Look at that monster. See that that one look at the scales on that thing. That thing's coming for Marshall. That thing doesn't even look like a real thing. Now. Yeah, I don't think they hunt. But my dog so dumb. He'd probably try to bite it. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1543.0s)]
*  Oh my God, that's his eyeball. Look at his nose. His nose looks like we're out. That looks like something right out of doom. There are pig nose turtles. Yeah, I know. But what is the biggest snapping turtle? Is there because I think there's a few different species. I think there's isn't there one called an alligator snapping turtle. Look at that thing. It's 70 pounds. The fuck? 70 pound turtle with a big nose. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1561.6s)]
*  That's a mouth from hell. Look at that mouth. If that was in one of those hell bound movies, hell raiser movies, if that was like one of the demons, you'd be like, yeah, I buy that. It's fucked up ma was staring at you in a dark hallway. Oh man. While it's wearing like a leather corset. That's pretty intense. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1591.6s)]
*  Wouldn't you think? Yeah, that looks like a demon. Oh, that's totally looks like a demon. They could make a yeah, that looks like I was just gonna say Lord of the Rings. They could make a movie with that thing that totally looks like it belongs in Lord of the Rings. Yeah. Oh my God. Look at that fucking face. Look at its eyes. Jesus Christ. Those eyes are evil as fuck. I'm glad I didn't hit that with my truck. Dude, there's something about reptile eyes that scare the shit out of you. Yeah, you know, so look at those eyes. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1608.12s)]
*  They say like with snakes, if their eyes are like a slit like like like, yeah, like slit or if they're round, the snakes fine, not poisonous, not dangerous. If they're slits poisonous. Really? The problem is you got to get that close to see their eyes. So like you said your eyes aren't very good. I'm not gonna be able to tell. You take one right in the face. Oh Jesus fucking Christ. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1638.12s)]
*  Friend of mine sent me videos of her garage. She's like, are these bad? And there's two fucking coral snakes making their way through the garage. I'm like, those are real bad. Those are real bad. Right? Yeah. Don't fuck with them. I mean, because coral snakes are weird because they don't have the head like like when you see the head of a rattlesnake, you see that diamond shaped head. You like, oh, that thing's poisonous. Well, and it's pretty clear that I mean, they're pissed. Their tails going off. They look fucking mean. They let me know. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1661.12s)]
*  You're like, okay, there's some consequences involved in getting close to me. Yeah, it's very evident. Yeah, very evident. They don't want to die. Right? That's all it is. They don't want to die. And if they think you're you're gonna get too close and you're trying to grab them. Time to get bit. Yeah. But coral snakes, they look beautiful. They're gorgeous. You seen them in person? I don't think so. No, they have them out here, man. They're fucking beautiful. There's like multi colored. Look how cool they look. Yeah, those do look cool. But you look at the head. It's not that [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1691.12s)]
*  fucking triangular thing that you're not scared of. But look that that eyes round now. Oh, there goes. There's a slit, though. There's a slit up and down. See the up and down slit. Yeah, kind of hard to tell because there's a reflection in it. But what a fucking beautiful snake. No, God, they're so cool. Look at that. That's so gorgeous. What is it about like nature and creating some animals that are just extraordinarily beautiful? God, see, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1721.12s)]
*  those and then pigs. I guess I know. I guess get this short end of the stick. My my eye theory is thrown out the window. So scratch that. Did I tell you what my agent said to me? What? My agent loves animals. She's a wonderful lady. She loves animals. She goes, but you can hunt pigs because they're ugly. Okay. I was like, Jesus Christ. Yeah. See, that's a problem. That's discrimination. It is in the animal kingdom. Nobody wants you to hunt a tiger. They're gorgeous. But it's thin black vertical pupils. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1751.12s)]
*  Yeah. So you got it. Okay. So it's up and down. Hmm. Huh? Yes. People you got to even see. So you got you got to see the pupil. That's the problem. Oh, you can't get. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1781.12s)]
*  Oh, you can't get that close. You can't get that close. Yeah. You get that close. You fucked up. Right. So you know, you should be backing up. So I guess I was right. But that's gonna be tough to find out. I ran over a rattlesnake once and I didn't [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1796.6799999999998s)]
*  know it was a rattlesnake until I was mid mid leap over it. It was in the middle of the road. My dogs ran over it too. Oh, we're running in the, you know, my old house. Yes. The trail. So we're running down that trail and we run over this thing that looks like like, you know, like a branch in the road. Yeah. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1810.88s)]
*  Kind of thick branch in the road. And as I'm over it, I realize it's a fucking huge rattlesnake. Oh, man. And I have two pit bulls with me. And they've been bit a bunch of times. Really? Oh, rattlesnakes. They don't give a fuck. So what happens? They go. You got to take them to the fucking hospital. You have to get anti venom. Their head swells up like a balloon. And they're sick for a few days, then they bounce out of it. But they can. It's funny. He got bit. My dog, Frank, he was he was my craziest dog. He like, his [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1830.24s)]
*  day would be spent. We had a big yard and his day would be spent looking for lizards, just trying to catch lizards fucking up. So he was like playing a video game outside. Like that was his thing. Just like whatever is moving. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1860.24s)]
*  I'll keep trying to catch it. And so when I would run with him, I would run with him, but I would always have to like stay close to him because just in case like a raccoon was there or something, because he 100% jump on it. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1872.0s)]
*  If he saw that rattlesnake. So I had to say, OK, I am just going to run and keep running because the whole trail is like another mile in this direction. And then come back. And that rattlesnake had to know we just ran over it. So he's going to hide. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1884.24s)]
*  Hopefully, they don't find it because I'm tired. And you know, the back end of that is uphill. Yeah. And the dogs are not as tired as me. Pretty steep. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1899.6s)]
*  The dogs are way better at running than me. It's always slow down, slow down, slow down, guys. They can pull you though like water skiing. Yeah, but I don't have them on a leash. Oh, I see. Yeah. I don't like to run with dogs on a leash. I like them to be free. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=1907.1999999999998s)]
*  If it's an area. And like Marshall's the best because you don't have to worry about him. He stays right with you. Oh, yeah. He always comes and checks on you to get ahead of you and then come back. Everything good, Dad. Yeah, he's the best. He's the best with that. He's amazing.

Imagine being a squirrel and being killed by the most lovely looking creature you could imagine. I think didn't see. Here's here's why I was nervous coming on because that reminded me of Theo Vaughn said something about like Suzanne Summers. That's got that guy.

*  I think I like a golden retriever running like with flowing hair. Her hair was like that. Yeah. So then that got you guys on the Thighmaster. But anyway, so yeah, like Marshall, Suzanne Summers running towards you is what I envision. Yeah, but trying to eat you out of your shell. What the fuck? Oh, but the point was I'm pretty nervous because I'm like, how can I can't follow up Theo Vaughn who has been a couple of people on since Theo, right? Yeah. So you're all right. Don't worry.

*  And I don't know what to say [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2127.92s)]
*  by the time I fold my hands. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2130.32s)]
*  I only talk to God when I need a favor. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2133.44s)]
*  And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2139.0800000000004s)]
*  So who the hell am I? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2145.48s)]
*  Who the hell am I to expect a savior? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2147.04s)]
*  Oh, if I only talk to God when I need a favor. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2150.1200000000003s)]
*  God, I need a favor. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2156.48s)]
*  God damn, that guy's good. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2158.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, to me, the reason that song, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2161.04s)]
*  I think most people can relate to that also. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2165.88s)]
*  What's his voice, too? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2169.44s)]
*  That's real pain in his voice. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2170.88s)]
*  It's like, that's a real dude. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2173.4s)]
*  There's some people that just have a real voice. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2176.76s)]
*  When they sing, you just go like, God damn. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2179.76s)]
*  Yeah, there's just no denying [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2182.28s)]
*  that talent, that the story, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2185.2s)]
*  it's like a storytelling attribute, the voice itself, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2187.8s)]
*  and then how he delivers it. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2191.84s)]
*  And then on top of it is the lyrics. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2193.48s)]
*  So you put that all together [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2196.92s)]
*  and you get something magic like jelly roll. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2198.48s)]
*  And I think a lot of people can identify, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2201.04s)]
*  nobody's praying when things are going great, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2204.0s)]
*  or not nobody, but most people don't. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2206.4s)]
*  They're like, if God, please just give me another chance [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2209.0s)]
*  when something fucks up. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2211.84s)]
*  It's not when it's going great. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2214.08s)]
*  Always. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2216.24s)]
*  When you're injured, you always appreciate being healthy. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2217.08s)]
*  When you're sick, you always appreciate being healthy. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2219.7999999999997s)]
*  And it's just like, oh, I took it for granted. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2222.0s)]
*  God, I'll never take it for granted again. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2224.2s)]
*  I've done this. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2226.08s)]
*  I know that's why that song is so powerful to me [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2227.24s)]
*  because that's me. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2230.6s)]
*  It's everybody. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2233.04s)]
*  It's every human being. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2234.04s)]
*  It's human nature. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2235.64s)]
*  But that kind of guy, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2237.4s)]
*  you gotta cherish those kind of people. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2239.7599999999998s)]
*  It's a rare diamond that's created by that kind of pressure. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2242.64s)]
*  It makes that kind of a person. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2246.16s)]
*  It was months ago, I kept watching his video. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2248.3999999999996s)]
*  There's one he had, it's called Son of a Sinner, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2251.8399999999997s)]
*  but then he had another one. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2253.64s)]
*  For some reason, I can't even remember what it is, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2255.08s)]
*  but I watched the video so many times [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2256.9599999999996s)]
*  and I'm like, this guy is amazing. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2259.08s)]

*  Yeah, I think everybody does. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2391.7000000000003s)]
*  I think that's the beautiful thing [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2393.3s)]
*  about a great songwriter and a great singer. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2394.6800000000003s)]
*  There's something about someone [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2397.14s)]
*  who writes their own songs too. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2398.42s)]
*  There's something about when you're trusting them [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2400.44s)]
*  with your thoughts. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2406.02s)]
*  It's like you're riding along on the song, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2407.62s)]
*  on the lyrics, on the music, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2411.18s)]
*  and you're thinking with them. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2412.98s)]
*  They're taking you on it. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2415.46s)]
*  I think when you watch something that's very entertaining, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2416.94s)]
*  one of the things that happens is you give into it [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2419.66s)]
*  where you're letting it create experiences. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2422.8199999999997s)]
*  You're letting it interact with your mind. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2425.7599999999998s)]
*  And I think someone has a song [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2429.7799999999997s)]
*  that has just that real pain that's coming through it. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2432.5s)]
*  There's something about the way that interacts [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2435.86s)]
*  with your mind. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2438.34s)]
*  It's like this weird communal thing [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2439.1800000000003s)]
*  that happens to people that are listening to it. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2440.9s)]
*  That's why people love to go to a concert [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2442.6600000000003s)]
*  and everyone sing along to the same song together. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2444.5800000000004s)]
*  People love doing that. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2447.6200000000003s)]
*  They love doing that. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2448.9s)]
*  Music is magic. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2449.7400000000002s)]
*  It's magic stuff. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2451.5800000000004s)]
*  To me, when I think of that, I think of church. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2452.82s)]
*  When I think of those experiences like you just said, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2454.46s)]
*  because in church, that's kind of the magic of church. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2456.98s)]
*  You sing the hymns. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2459.46s)]
*  Did you ever see the video of a Biden in the black church? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2460.78s)]
*  Oh my God, okay. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2463.26s)]
*  Except for him. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2464.2200000000003s)]
*  Did you ever see it? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2465.34s)]
*  He wasn't really in that moment, was he? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2466.16s)]
*  He was in his own moment. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2468.58s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2469.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, I think he had a shitty diaper moment. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2470.62s)]
*  He didn't know what to do. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2474.18s)]
*  He didn't know what to do. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2475.7s)]
*  And supposedly he grew up in a black church. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2476.7s)]
*  Of course he did. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2478.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2479.7599999999998s)]

*  Don't you know that you are a suitcase guy? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2743.24s)]
*  Don't you know, don't you know? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2749.7999999999997s)]
*  Don't you know that you are a shifting star? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2754.88s)]
*  And all the world will love you just as long, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2761.84s)]
*  as long as you are. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2766.28s)]
*  Yeah, but doesn't it take a turn? [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2768.32s)]
*  It ends bad. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2770.1600000000003s)]
*  It takes a turn. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2771.0s)]
*  This is the part I like. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2771.84s)]
*  No, cause he proved everybody wrong. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2774.6400000000003s)]
*  He got to number one. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2776.5600000000004s)]
*  But he didn't, he didn't prove anybody wrong. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2777.4s)]
*  That's the problem with the story. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2778.7200000000003s)]
*  But he got to number one. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2779.96s)]
*  No, he didn't have to prove anybody wrong. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2780.96s)]
*  Cause he was a kid. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2782.92s)]
*  He was just a wizard. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2784.84s)]
*  Johnny's just a wizard who got instant pussy and hot rods. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2785.88s)]
*  The whole story makes no sense. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2789.8s)]
*  He's leaving his mom's house to be a fucking superstar? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2791.96s)]
*  Give me some volume. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2794.88s)]
*  I made the big time at last. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2795.96s)]
*  Let's see the lyrics again. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2798.1600000000003s)]
*  The story makes no sense. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2799.0s)]
*  That's why it's great for the 1980s, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2800.36s)]
*  when I was in high school. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2802.6400000000003s)]

*  He dies, right? [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2807.28s)]
*  Yes, he dies. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2808.1600000000003s)]
*  This is where it goes sad. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2811.48s)]
*  You know that you are a shooting star, yeah. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2814.56s)]

*  Now me, as being a person that's always worried [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2827.8s)]
*  about danger and like fucking things up, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2831.6400000000003s)]

*  My favorite part is the end. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2836.44s)]
*  My favorite part of this song is the end. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2838.76s)]

*  Always. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2841.96s)]
*  Ever since I was a kid, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2842.92s)]
*  I was concerned with things that are dangerous. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2843.76s)]
*  Don't get stupid. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2847.5600000000004s)]

*  Yeah, bro. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2861.6800000000003s)]
*  That's what they did back then, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2862.52s)]
*  because they told stories, son. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2863.6800000000003s)]
*  They told stories. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2865.88s)]
*  How many tapes did you need for that? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2867.04s)]
*  I know, but you listen to Borderline, Madonna. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2867.96s)]
*  That's like two fucking songs. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2870.7200000000003s)]

*  This is the best part right here. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2875.68s)]
*  Johnny died one night, died in his bed. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2885.9199999999996s)]
*  Pile of whiskey, sleeping tablets by his head. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2891.7599999999998s)]
*  Johnny's life passed him by like a warm summer day. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2897.56s)]
*  If you listen to the wind, you can still hear him play. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2902.96s)]
*  So for every young kid that I grew up with, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2907.96s)]
*  the romantic notion of dying young as a rock star [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2912.4399999999996s)]
*  that everyone's gonna miss for some stupid reason. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2916.16s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2919.2799999999997s)]
*  That was what everybody wanted. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2920.12s)]
*  That's Jim Morrison. Everybody wanted to be Jim Morrison. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2921.4399999999996s)]
*  Everybody wanted to be Jim Morrison when I was a kid. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2923.3999999999996s)]
*  Mac Miller. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2924.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2925.8399999999997s)]
*  All the geniuses die early. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2926.68s)]
*  Well, they all died at 27. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2928.48s)]
*  Yeah, 27. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2930.12s)]
*  Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2931.2400000000002s)]
*  What's that? [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2934.08s)]
*  Amy Winehouse. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2935.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2936.96s)]
*  Same age. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2937.8s)]
*  I know. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2938.64s)]
*  Nuts. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2939.46s)]
*  She was 27 as well, right? [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2940.3s)]
*  I think so, yeah. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2941.56s)]
*  That's nuts. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2942.4s)]
*  But I mentioned Madonna's long song. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2944.0s)]
*  That reminded me of another thought. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2946.88s)]
*  Could you ever see a time when Madonna was so hot [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2949.48s)]
*  like she was to where Roseanne Barr [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2952.68s)]
*  would be hotter than her right now? [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2956.0s)]
*  Roseanne Barr is way hotter than Madonna. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2958.64s)]
*  I mean, if you'd have looked back in the day, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2962.08s)]
*  Madonna, sex symbol, incredible, and Roseanne. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2964.7799999999997s)]
*  And now... [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2968.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2969.92s)]
*  Right? [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2970.92s)]
*  Well, I think... [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2971.7599999999998s)]
*  Because I thought, wasn't Roseanne in your club? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2972.68s)]
*  Yeah, she looked wonderful. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2975.08s)]
*  Isn't she? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2976.08s)]
*  She looks good. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2976.92s)]
*  She looks healthy, she's happy. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2977.7599999999998s)]
*  She looks great. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2979.12s)]
*  She's lost a bunch of weight. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2979.96s)]
*  Yeah, she's doing stand-up. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2980.7999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2981.96s)]
*  Loving it. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2982.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, look at that. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2983.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2984.46s)]
*  Something's going on with Madonna. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2985.9s)]
*  That picture is accurate. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2988.0s)]
*  No, that is. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2989.16s)]
*  What that is is like the same thing [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2990.0s)]
*  that leads to anorexia, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2991.56s)]
*  the same thing that leads to bodybuilders [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2993.04s)]
*  that get just so massive. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2994.8s)]
*  Dysmorphia. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2996.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's dysmorphia. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2996.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2997.66s)]
*  It happens to, I think, there's a certain percentage [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=2998.5s)]
*  of people that get those fillers in their face [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3002.56s)]
*  that it happens to. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3004.08s)]
*  You start fucking with the shape of your face. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3004.96s)]
*  And it looks crazy. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3008.64s)]
*  It looks crazy. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3010.32s)]
*  I'm not a fan of the lip things [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3011.44s)]
*  where all the girls' lips look the same now. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3014.52s)]
*  I don't, I know what the goal is [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3018.1200000000003s)]
*  because full lips was always kind of a cool thing, I guess. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3022.2000000000003s)]
*  But now they look the same. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3025.76s)]
*  But it also, it doesn't match your nose. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3028.96s)]
*  So my brain is all thrown off. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3031.84s)]
*  I'm like, what's going on? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3034.32s)]
*  Because that's a thing with facial symmetry. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3035.2400000000002s)]
*  That's why you can tell when someone's at a nose job. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3039.1200000000003s)]
*  It words you out. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3040.92s)]
*  Like, huh, what's going on with your face? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3041.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3043.52s)]
*  Like everything seems, you know? [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3044.36s)]
*  Things can seem a little off when you start [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3046.7999999999997s)]
*  making your lips bigger than everything else. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3049.6s)]
*  It just doesn't look right. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3051.2799999999997s)]
*  Your mind is going, what's missing here? [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3052.56s)]
*  Something's missing here. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3055.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3056.04s)]
*  I'm almost like, so that's, I'm, I'll be honest. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3057.0s)]
*  Like if you have a thick face, if you have thick skin, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3062.0s)]
*  you have Italian lips and an Italian nose [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3064.48s)]
*  and big, thick lips, it looks like it belongs in your face. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3067.96s)]
*  But if you have real thin skin and a narrow nose [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3072.04s)]
*  and this, right? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3076.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3077.7s)]
*  Well, I think things change too, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3078.54s)]
*  because it used to be like tit jobs were cool. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3080.7s)]
*  Now I almost think natural tits are better. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3083.9s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3087.02s)]
*  This kind of an, taking it aside. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3087.86s)]
*  Good for you. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3089.38s)]
*  Jamie, what do you think? [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3090.22s)]
*  I like what you did there. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3091.06s)]
*  It depends. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3091.9s)]
*  Well, I support people's right to do [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3092.74s)]
*  whatever the fuck they want. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3095.9s)]
*  If they want to get boob jobs, get a boob job. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3097.54s)]
*  I do think, however, people, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3100.94s)]
*  I don't necessarily think it's 100% healthy for your body [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3104.74s)]
*  to have something in your body like that. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3109.2599999999998s)]
*  And I think there have been some people [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3112.1s)]
*  that have had some real issues with having to get them out. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3114.58s)]
*  Well, it's like affects their health. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3119.66s)]
*  I believe Kat Zingano's talked about this, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3122.22s)]
*  cause she got hers taken out. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3124.9399999999996s)]
*  She was having real problems with them. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3127.14s)]
*  I worry about fighters, like taking a fucking kick [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3128.66s)]
*  right to the tit and having a pop. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3131.3199999999997s)]
*  I think these tits are fucking bionic now. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3132.98s)]
*  Probably. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3134.86s)]
*  I think they get combat tits. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3135.7000000000003s)]
*  But I was thinking. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3137.42s)]
*  It's like one of those laptops that's in a suitcase. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3138.54s)]
*  Oh, they're rugged? [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3141.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3143.14s)]
*  Like the Panasonics? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3143.98s)]
*  Yeah, the rug. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3145.06s)]
*  The ones that the military has. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3145.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's got a fucking latch. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3147.38s)]
*  You go and lift it up. Rugged tits? [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3148.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's what they got, robot tits. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3149.58s)]
*  If girls, you already got to cut weight, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3151.54s)]
*  how much are you adding on? [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3154.94s)]
*  Now you got to cut more weight. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3156.5s)]
*  Yeah, you probably are adding several ounces. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3158.1s)]
*  Whatever they're made out of. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3163.1s)]
*  I don't think they make them out of saline anymore. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3164.42s)]
*  I think it's like a mushy thing that doesn't break. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3166.9s)]
*  Because when they originally had them, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3170.42s)]
*  some people, like silicone ones, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3172.62s)]
*  people were getting, they were leaking. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3174.2200000000003s)]
*  Every 100 cc of silicone. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3176.06s)]
*  Yeah, so 1.3 pounds. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3177.82s)]
*  Yeah, wow. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3179.38s)]
*  I mean, that last pound for those fighters. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3181.02s)]
*  Half a pound, that's crazy. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3183.78s)]
*  So atypical, one, a pair will weigh 1.38 pounds. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3185.98s)]
*  1.38 pounds is a lot of weight to lose. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3190.14s)]
*  To cut? That's the worst one? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3192.98s)]
*  When you're dehydrating yourself. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3194.8199999999997s)]
*  That means you're going to lose something else. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3196.62s)]
*  You know, like, your performance, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3199.2599999999998s)]
*  it depends on, maybe you're cutting the weight easy. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3201.8599999999997s)]
*  It depends on the person, I guess. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3204.1s)]
*  Because some people are cutting the weight easy. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3205.42s)]
*  Really? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3208.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, some people are being, you know, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3209.1s)]
*  like, there's people that cut a shitload of weight. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3211.54s)]
*  You know, but some people are being pretty smart about it. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3216.94s)]
*  They really get down to about five pounds. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3221.22s)]
*  What does Colby cut? He doesn't cut much. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3223.1s)]
*  No, he's probably 85. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3224.7s)]
*  See, he's one of the best at that. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3227.54s)]
*  I think 85 to 70 is really good. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3229.9s)]
*  Because that's not that hard. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3232.9s)]
*  For an athlete like that, with all that muscle, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3234.46s)]
*  you could dry that out pretty easy. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3236.54s)]
*  But when them fucking Alex Paheta guys, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3237.62s)]
*  when you're talking about weighing in at 185 [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3240.14s)]
*  and then walking around at 230 or 220, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3243.46s)]
*  Colby Covington claims he lost over one stone in just a day [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3247.2200000000003s)]
*  to be back up for UFC 286 opponent, but didn't even fight. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3250.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3255.42s)]
*  So one stone is 13 pounds? [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3256.62s)]
*  18 pounds. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3259.06s)]
*  One stone is 18? [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3259.98s)]
*  That's what this is. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3261.14s)]
*  Oh. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3262.66s)]
*  Well, it's over one stone, so. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3263.5s)]
*  Oh, over one stone. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3264.7000000000003s)]
*  He lost 18 pounds. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3265.54s)]
*  18 pounds in a day. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3266.38s)]
*  He's a company man. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3267.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, well, he's right there. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3269.1s)]
*  You know, it's him. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3271.2599999999998s)]
*  And you got Bilal Mohammed. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3273.7s)]
*  You know, you've got a lot. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3275.8599999999997s)]
*  Hamza, at 170, he's the motherfucker, right? [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3277.4599999999996s)]
*  But it's like, can you be assured [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3283.18s)]
*  that he's going to make 170? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3285.1s)]
*  Or, or here's another possibility. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3286.4599999999996s)]
*  Did the athletic commission fuck him? [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3290.14s)]
*  Did they pull him out when he could have made it? [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3292.7799999999997s)]
*  Because they decided he looked bad. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3294.62s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, I looked bad. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3296.58s)]
*  That time when he misweighed by nine pounds. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3297.8199999999997s)]
*  Exactly, eight pounds. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3299.3399999999997s)]
*  But that was New York. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3301.46s)]
*  And they have done things in the past [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3302.94s)]
*  that show to me that they're a little more stringent [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3305.78s)]
*  on their enforcing of certain rules. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3309.14s)]
*  And they'll stop fights [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3311.98s)]
*  when maybe another commission wouldn't. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3314.3s)]
*  They won't allow fights to happen [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3316.06s)]
*  if other commissions would. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3317.54s)]
*  They're very cautious. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3319.26s)]
*  So maybe that had something to do with it. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3320.62s)]
*  That they pulled him, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3323.9s)]
*  because they did make the decision [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3325.06s)]
*  to tell him to stop cutting weight. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3326.5s)]
*  He's big. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3327.98s)]
*  He's fucking huge. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3329.62s)]
*  I remember we saw him backstage in Florida, I think. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3331.1s)]
*  And he's just like giant. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3335.22s)]
*  But the thing is, 85. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3336.42s)]
*  Now you go from, let's just. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3339.2599999999998s)]
*  That's a big gap. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3341.58s)]
*  Right, but I want you to think about it this way. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3342.7s)]
*  Think about Colby, the size of Colby. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3345.06s)]
*  And then I want you to think [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3348.06s)]
*  that if the next one up from Colby is Alex Paheda. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3349.94s)]
*  That's a big man. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3356.2999999999997s)]
*  So when you're talking about Hamsat, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3357.9s)]
*  if Hamsat and Colby fight, that's a fascinating fight. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3360.3799999999997s)]
*  But if Hamsat fights someone like Paulo Costa, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3363.8599999999997s)]
*  now you're dealing with a totally different size human. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3368.8199999999997s)]
*  Or Yoel Romero. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3372.1s)]
*  It's a totally different size human. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3374.18s)]
*  So as big as Hamsat is. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3377.7s)]
*  If he can make that 170. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3379.62s)]
*  And I don't know that he couldn't have made it. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3381.62s)]
*  The thing is, if they can say you look too sick, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3384.46s)]
*  you look like shit. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3387.58s)]
*  But everybody looks like that if they check in on you. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3388.82s)]
*  If you're gonna cut a big weight cut. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3391.3s)]
*  But if they know how to do it, they do it. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3393.66s)]
*  And I don't think he missed weight any other time. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3395.66s)]
*  Google that, find out if that's correct. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3398.62s)]
*  Because I do not believe he missed weight. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3400.3s)]
*  I know he fought Gerald Mearschart at 185 pounds. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3402.06s)]
*  And he knocked him out in one round. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3406.5s)]
*  He fought Kevin Holland at a catch weight of 180. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3408.26s)]
*  And the other fights, I believe he made 170. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3410.94s)]
*  Maybe he had one other fight, 185. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3414.02s)]
*  I think maybe it was his first fight in the UFC. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3416.14s)]
*  Might have been 185. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3417.9s)]
*  But. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3419.42s)]
*  Oh, he fought that... [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3420.26s)]
*  Who was that? [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3423.82s)]
*  Remember he was talking to Dana? [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3424.66s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3426.54s)]
*  What weight was that? [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3428.34s)]
*  That was 170. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3429.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3430.46s)]
*  That was the leech, leeching Leon. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3431.3s)]
*  Yeah, that was wild. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3432.46s)]
*  That was. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3433.9s)]
*  I mean, you wanna talk about like levels above. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3434.7400000000002s)]
*  When someone can carry you over to the boss [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3436.18s)]
*  and then fuck you up. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3438.82s)]
*  Talking. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3440.02s)]
*  And talking shit. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3440.86s)]
*  I kill everyone! [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3441.7s)]
*  I kill everyone! [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3442.98s)]
*  But you're not gonna do that to Paula Costa. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3444.3s)]
*  That's my point. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3445.98s)]
*  You're talking about a totally different size human being. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3447.18s)]
*  I get it, yeah. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3449.42s)]
*  Totally different thing. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3450.26s)]
*  It's like that gap is too big, in my opinion. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3451.18s)]
*  I think there's 10 pounds. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3454.06s)]
*  I think it should be 75, 85, all the way up. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3455.58s)]
*  Well, 65? [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3458.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3459.9s)]
*  75, 85? [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3460.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, 55, 65, 75. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3461.58s)]
*  It totally makes sense. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3463.1s)]
*  And if you did that, I think you'd have [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3464.82s)]
*  more reasonable choices that guys would make [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3466.42s)]
*  in terms of cutting weight or in terms of going up. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3468.94s)]
*  But ultimately, I really strongly believe [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3472.34s)]
*  that for the health of the fighters [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3476.06s)]
*  and just to really solidify what the sport [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3478.02s)]
*  has the potential to be. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3483.46s)]
*  People should fight at their actual weight. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3485.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3486.94s)]
*  Their actual weight. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3487.78s)]
*  That's what I was gonna say. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3488.6200000000003s)]
*  So if Haas-Mott can cut all the way down [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3489.44s)]
*  and Colby's more natural, is there an advantage? [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3491.98s)]
*  There's definitely an advantage. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3496.98s)]
*  But there's not an advantage in terms of endurance. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3498.1400000000003s)]
*  Performance, I'm saying. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3500.3s)]
*  So yeah, you're a bigger man, but can you perform? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3501.62s)]
*  Well, it's questionable, right? [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3504.5s)]
*  Because we've never seen him fade. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3506.22s)]
*  He's got incredible endurance [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3507.7799999999997s)]
*  because he fought that fight with Gilbert. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3509.14s)]
*  Three rounds. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3512.5s)]
*  Yeah, but it was a fucking war. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3513.34s)]
*  It was. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3515.58s)]
*  That was a wild slobberknocker of a war. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3516.42s)]
*  He got hurt. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3519.5s)]
*  He did, he did. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3520.34s)]
*  Gilbert is a fucking savage though. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3521.16s)]
*  I was disappointed. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3523.46s)]
*  He took that short notice fight, the last one. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3525.34s)]
*  We fucked up his shoulder. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3527.62s)]
*  And he got hurt. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3528.46s)]
*  Yeah, he fucked up his shoulder. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3529.2999999999997s)]
*  So it was like early in the fight. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3530.14s)]
*  He's such a dog, he wants to compete. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3531.5s)]
*  I felt bad. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3533.86s)]
*  I almost feel like they should have stopped the fight. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3534.7s)]
*  I think when a fighter literally can't use his arm [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3536.9s)]
*  like that and you're fighting a guy [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3539.54s)]
*  who's as dangerous as Bilal, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3541.38s)]
*  like you're gonna take shots you shouldn't take. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3543.62s)]
*  You run the real risk of getting extra hurt [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3546.38s)]
*  and you could hurt that arm even further [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3549.22s)]
*  to the point where it's not repairable through surgery. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3551.18s)]
*  I think at a certain point in time, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3554.18s)]
*  if you literally can't use your arm in throw punches, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3555.4s)]
*  you probably shouldn't be fighting. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3557.98s)]
*  And it's a hard pill to swallow. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3559.98s)]
*  That was hard to watch. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3560.98s)]
*  But you're probably gonna lose anyway [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3562.3s)]
*  because he was so diminished. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3564.18s)]
*  It was hard to watch. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3565.9s)]
*  It was hard for him to move. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3566.7400000000002s)]
*  You could see his movement was compromised too. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3568.3s)]
*  Whatever was fucked up with his shoulder, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3570.34s)]
*  he couldn't do anything with that left arm. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3571.98s)]
*  And hopefully he gets surgery on or whatever, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3574.02s)]
*  rehabs it or gets stem cells and fixes it. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3575.92s)]
*  But it's that weird thing where maybe he could still win. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3578.54s)]
*  Maybe he could land the head kick. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3582.76s)]
*  Maybe he could take him down [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3584.06s)]
*  and get him in a triangle or something like that. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3585.54s)]
*  You never know. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3587.1s)]
*  But when it's that bad of an injury, [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3588.7s)]
*  it's not a bad thing to call it. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3591.18s)]
*  I think he landed, late in that fight, [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3593.34s)]
*  he landed a pretty good shot, if I remember right. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3595.94s)]
*  Probably in agony while he's doing something like that. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3598.66s)]
*  What's your prediction on Leon Colby? [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3602.18s)]
*  That's a great fight. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3605.22s)]
*  That's a great fight. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3606.06s)]
*  Leon is so God damn dangerous on the feet. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3607.5s)]
*  Tell me. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3610.58s)]
*  Colby. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3611.5s)]
*  Yeah, well you're his friend. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3612.32s)]
*  Listen, Leon's so dangerous. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3613.34s)]
*  The fact that Camaro couldn't take him down [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3616.86s)]
*  in the last fight, that was a big deal. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3618.9s)]
*  Yeah, but okay, so how about this? [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3620.7s)]
*  So Camaro gets KO'd. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3622.7799999999997s)]
*  That obviously gives Leon confidence. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3625.5s)]
*  But also, no matter who wants to admit it, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3628.82s)]
*  that has to affect the confidence of Camaro. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3632.04s)]
*  He's a human being. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3634.86s)]
*  Right, so it's like that is such a crazy, [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3635.86s)]
*  I mean that one moment, the fight was pretty much over, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3639.62s)]
*  that one shot changed the trajectory of everything. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3642.7s)]
*  And it changed the way Camaro fought in the second fight. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3647.2200000000003s)]
*  He was a little bit more cautious. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3650.26s)]
*  And Leon was at home, he had more confidence. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3651.6600000000003s)]
*  He was like, I don't know, I just was thinking [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3654.82s)]
*  that one kick, I mean, changes everything. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3658.7000000000003s)]
*  Well that's a guy like Leon. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3661.26s)]
*  You can never, I mean that was the fifth round [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3662.6600000000003s)]
*  that he landed that. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3664.7400000000002s)]
*  Wasn't it late? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3665.9s)]
*  It was late in the fifth round. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3666.78s)]
*  I believe there was only like a minute left [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3667.92s)]
*  to go in the fight or something crazy like that. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3669.7400000000002s)]
*  The thing about Leon is you can never sleep. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3672.38s)]
*  He's so sharp. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3675.34s)]
*  He's striking, he's one of the most impressive guys [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3676.78s)]
*  I've ever seen hit the pads. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3679.94s)]
*  Yeah, but the pressure of Colby, come on now. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3681.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's incredible pressure. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3683.94s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3686.9s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3687.86s)]
*  Because also the cardio of Colby's off the charts. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3688.7000000000003s)]
*  Leon did do better than I thought he would [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3691.6600000000003s)]
*  at combating the wrestling, the takedowns. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3694.2000000000003s)]
*  So he has improved there. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3696.42s)]
*  So we'll see how Colby can mix that up compared to Camaro. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3698.34s)]
*  Because Camaro is good at that also. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3703.42s)]
*  But is Colby, does he have more to offer [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3705.38s)]
*  in terms of pressure and cardio? [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3707.98s)]
*  Well Colby puts a lot of volume on you. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3709.6600000000003s)]
*  He comes at you like fast. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3711.58s)]
*  He'll wade in. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3714.1400000000003s)]
*  He'll take a shot to get in. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3714.98s)]
*  Yeah, he wades right in. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3716.5s)]
*  And he puts you in a dog fight. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3717.54s)]
*  And when you're in a dog fight, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3719.86s)]
*  he's more likely to get a takedown. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3721.06s)]
*  It's very smart. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3723.1800000000003s)]
*  And also he's pushing you at a very extreme pace right away. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3724.02s)]
*  He's letting you know right away [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3728.1400000000003s)]
*  from the beginning of the fight, I'm coming after you. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3729.26s)]
*  And he has some wild fucking fights because of that. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3732.1s)]
*  The kind of heat that he puts on people. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3737.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I'm really, I'm excited for that. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3740.22s)]
*  I mean, I want that belt back to Oregon so bad. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3741.98s)]
*  Obviously not near as bad as Colby does. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3745.3399999999997s)]
*  But yeah, he texted the other day [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3747.2599999999998s)]
*  and said he's gonna come and train next month. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3749.58s)]
*  So getting ready for that fight. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3751.74s)]
*  It would have been interesting if Jorge Masvidal, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3753.98s)]
*  when he fought Gilbert, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3759.8199999999997s)]
*  which was Gilbert's fight before that, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3761.02s)]
*  if he didn't take that fight, [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3763.22s)]
*  I wonder if they would have given him a title shot [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3764.9s)]
*  if Leon can beat Colby. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3768.58s)]
*  Because that was the one fight [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3771.5s)]
*  when they had that backstage fight. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3772.78s)]
*  Yeah, the three piece in a soda. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3774.18s)]
*  I know, that had the storyline. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3775.78s)]
*  And that's, you know, Jorge was angling for that [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3777.66s)]
*  for the payday obviously. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3781.1s)]
*  And it just didn't make sense because Jorge had lost. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3782.74s)]
*  Well, Jorge's, he's kind of openly said [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3785.66s)]
*  that he just doesn't feel as good. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3789.2999999999997s)]
*  The fire. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3791.9399999999996s)]
*  He doesn't have it in. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3792.7799999999997s)]
*  He's still a very capable world class fighter. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3794.3799999999997s)]
*  But he doesn't feel like he's at his best. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3798.98s)]
*  You know, is he 37 or something like that? [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3801.22s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3803.62s)]
*  Is he 38? [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3804.9399999999996s)]
*  How old is Jorge Masvidal? [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3806.2999999999997s)]
*  Since the fucking backyard, dude. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3809.4199999999996s)]
*  I mean, are you the biggest OG ever? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3812.3399999999997s)]
*  38, yeah. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3815.4199999999996s)]
*  If you're a natural athlete, [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3816.2599999999998s)]
*  that's kind of the end of the line in combat sports. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3817.9s)]
*  It gets close if you're a natural athlete. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3820.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3823.7000000000003s)]
*  You know, it's like, it's so hard. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3824.54s)]
*  Except guys like Yoel. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3826.7000000000003s)]
*  You know, you have these guys that are just freaks [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3827.82s)]
*  that you don't understand. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3829.38s)]
*  They're just whatever, freak of genetics and nature. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3830.82s)]
*  And you know, obviously training's hard too. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3834.26s)]
*  But it's like, there's some guys that can be really, [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3836.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, he's elite. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3839.1400000000003s)]
*  Yoel is like what, 44, 45? [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3840.7000000000003s)]
*  And now he's in Bellator. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3843.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3844.86s)]
*  He's elite. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3845.7000000000003s)]
*  He's still elite. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3846.54s)]
*  His last fight, he won, I believe. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3848.28s)]
*  I'm sure he won. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3849.6800000000003s)]
*  46. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3850.52s)]
*  46. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3851.36s)]
*  46. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3852.2000000000003s)]
*  46 years old and fucking ragdolling people [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3853.04s)]
*  and still built like a Greek god. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3856.1600000000003s)]
*  I love training with the fighters just because [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3858.32s)]
*  I'm a big fan, obviously, but their mentality is like, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3862.88s)]
*  my goal to train with people is- [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3866.56s)]
*  Look at him. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3868.92s)]
*  I know. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3869.76s)]
*  Sculpted. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3870.58s)]
*  Is this his last fight? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3871.42s)]
*  Yeah, this is his last fight. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3872.26s)]
*  Oh, we fought Melvin Manhoef. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3873.32s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3875.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3875.92s)]
*  Melvin is- [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3878.04s)]
*  He's old too. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3878.8799999999997s)]
*  It's fucking, oh my god. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3879.7s)]
*  We were just watching highlights of him the other day. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3880.68s)]
*  Melvin is quite a bit smaller. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3885.0s)]
*  Yeah, but he's been, how old is he, Jamie? [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3887.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, he's- [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3890.2s)]
*  Melvin in fight years is fairly old, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3891.04s)]
*  I mean, in terms of miles. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3894.8399999999997s)]
*  He's got a lot of miles on him. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3896.24s)]
*  Yeah, god, I bet. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3897.08s)]
*  Imagine having Yoel on top of you like this. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3898.0s)]
*  Just crushing your fucking neck. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3900.08s)]
*  Miserable. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3902.04s)]
*  He's so good at wrestling. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3903.3999999999996s)]
*  Look at these elbows. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3905.96s)]
*  People don't understand how good Yoel is. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3907.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3909.76s)]
*  I mean, he was- [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3910.6s)]
*  They see him stand up all the time. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3911.42s)]
*  He likes to stand, it seems like. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3912.96s)]
*  Oh, he likes it, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3914.48s)]
*  because it doesn't take as much energy, [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3915.32s)]
*  and he's so fast. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3916.84s)]
*  With the knee that he knocked out Chris Weidman with, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3918.32s)]
*  holy fucking shit, that was scary. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3921.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3923.44s)]
*  He's so good, dude. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3924.26s)]
*  And he's so dangerously strong. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3925.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I mean, I know we've heard that a million times [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3927.88s)]
*  about how the doctor said his bones are- [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3931.28s)]
*  The doctor said his tendons and the eyes [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3934.2s)]
*  were three times larger than normal humans. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3936.04s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3938.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3938.8399999999997s)]
*  He's just- [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3940.24s)]
*  Look at this, he just smashed him. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3941.08s)]
*  God, that looks terrible. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3943.48s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3945.04s)]
*  I feel bad, oh my- [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3945.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, not good. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3946.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and for Melvin, Melvin has been knocked out a lot. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3948.3199999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of videos. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3953.3999999999996s)]
*  Joe Schilling knocked him out. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3954.48s)]
*  There's a crazy video of Robbie Lawler knocking him out [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3956.3999999999996s)]
*  in Strike Force. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3959.46s)]
*  The Robbie Lawler one's amazing, [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3961.16s)]
*  because Robbie is getting fucked up. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3963.44s)]
*  In that fight, look at this, boom. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3966.48s)]
*  Boom, he's out. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3969.64s)]
*  Stop that. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3970.6s)]
*  And he gets him in the neck, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3971.44s)]
*  and then gets him with another one. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3972.28s)]
*  Yeah, so- [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3975.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, well, remember, but see, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3976.04s)]
*  pull up Robbie Lawler versus Melvin Manhoef. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3977.2000000000003s)]
*  So this was when Melvin was in his prime. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3981.76s)]
*  Oh, he used to be a monster. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3984.28s)]
*  Everyone was terrified of him. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3985.12s)]
*  A monster. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3986.44s)]
*  He was one of the best kickboxers to ever fight in MMA, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3987.28s)]
*  and one of the most explosive kickboxers of all time. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3989.8s)]
*  He was so good and so dangerous. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3992.64s)]
*  And this is after he had already fought in Pride. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3996.68s)]
*  This is after he had had some crazy fights [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=3999.68s)]
*  overseas in Japan. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4002.36s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4006.64s)]
*  He's teeing off on Robbie. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4008.28s)]
*  Those body shots must be terrible. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4011.88s)]
*  Oh, look at this. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4017.56s)]
*  Look at how hard he's getting kicked in his legs, man. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4018.52s)]
*  I mean, he's just getting lit up. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4020.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4023.04s)]
*  So it looks terrible for him, right? [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4024.08s)]
*  It does, yeah. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4025.64s)]
*  Because you're thinking, you know, my God, Robbie, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4026.6s)]
*  this is one of the best strikers in the world, [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4028.7s)]
*  and he's chewing your legs up. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4030.72s)]
*  I mean, every time he's kicking his leg, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4032.48s)]
*  it's like, holy fuck, it's like he's doing the splits. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4033.84s)]
*  God, that hurts. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4036.12s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4036.96s)]
*  Oh, that was it, that right hand. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4038.04s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4040.12s)]
*  Oh, look at his eyes. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4041.04s)]
*  Yeah, look at that. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4042.4s)]
*  Oh my God, that looks terrible. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4044.32s)]
*  That's the shadow realm. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4045.96s)]
*  That looks terrible. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4047.16s)]
*  What was this, a right- [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4050.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, right on the chin. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4052.16s)]
*  God. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4054.56s)]
*  Yeah, Robbie, Robbie's right hand. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4056.96s)]
*  That is crazy. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4059.68s)]
*  That's one of the greatest come-from-behind knockouts [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4061.2799999999997s)]
*  of all time. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4063.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4064.6s)]
*  Can't walk. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4065.44s)]
*  I know, he's like, whoopie. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4066.2599999999998s)]
*  Of course, his legs got destroyed. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4067.1s)]
*  If you could even imagine how hard that guy can kick. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4069.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, the leg kicks these days are just ridiculous. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4074.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's so effective. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4079.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4081.56s)]
*  It's so, you compromise all your movement. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4082.4s)]
*  It's so painful. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4085.48s)]
*  So much respect for the fighters [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4086.6s)]
*  because they can't show pain. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4088.24s)]
*  They gotta walk it off. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4090.4s)]
*  You know, but you know, I mean, they're poker face [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4091.24s)]
*  and how bad that must hurt and they're just like, nothing. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4095.7999999999997s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4099.0s)]
*  So impressive. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4099.84s)]
*  The most impressive display of that I ever saw [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4101.0s)]
*  was Eric Anders versus Khalil Rountree. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4103.76s)]
*  Khalil Rountree was just smashing his legs. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4106.24s)]
*  When he went and trained Muay Thai, right? [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4109.2s)]
*  Yeah, he went over to Thailand. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4111.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, he had that front leg was like rural light. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4113.36s)]
*  Yeah, Thai style. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4116.44s)]
*  Just, oh my God, that was brutal. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4117.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but Rountree came back like a different person. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4119.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4122.72s)]
*  It was wild to see [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4123.5599999999995s)]
*  because he was always a good striker. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4124.4s)]
*  He's a tough guy. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4125.88s)]
*  And explosive. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4127.0s)]
*  Yeah, but he came back like, oh my God, his kicks. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4127.84s)]
*  Like, what the fuck, man? [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4130.5199999999995s)]
*  Me and DC, you know, [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4132.76s)]
*  how many fights have we commentated together? [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4134.64s)]
*  I don't know. A shit pile. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4136.200000000001s)]
*  It's rarely that we're looking at each other going, wow. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4138.4800000000005s)]
*  Like, what the hell, man? [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4142.12s)]
*  Like, what changed in this guy? [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4144.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4146.360000000001s)]
*  This is just him practicing. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4147.4800000000005s)]
*  I've always been a fan. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4148.88s)]
*  I really want to see him in that fight. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4149.72s)]
*  I've always been a fan of Khalil. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4151.280000000001s)]
*  See if you can find Khalil versus Eric Anders. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4153.88s)]
*  I remember, yeah, I remember this. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4157.6s)]
*  Yeah, it was a crazy fight, man. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4159.52s)]
*  It showed you how fucking tough Anders is. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4161.68s)]
*  He's so tough. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4164.12s)]
*  But these kicks. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4165.5599999999995s)]
*  Because Khalil is just lighting him up. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4166.4s)]
*  And he's moving so well. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4170.24s)]
*  That must be so frustrating [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4172.72s)]
*  because they don't want to switch stances, [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4174.12s)]
*  but if their leg is getting brutalized, they got to switch. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4176.84s)]
*  Yeah, there's not a lot of good options. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4181.68s)]
*  No. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4184.32s)]
*  And then their power's gone. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4185.16s)]
*  And if you're not an elite, world-class wrestler, [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4186.0s)]
*  like, you don't think you can take this guy down, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4187.88s)]
*  you got to try to commit. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4190.04s)]
*  And as you commit, you're running into a buzzsaw [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4191.56s)]
*  because he's such a good counter-striker, too. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4194.200000000001s)]
*  And obviously, coming into this fight, [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4195.84s)]
*  obviously, everyone watched this fight and said, [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4198.52s)]
*  oh my God, he's on another level. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4201.280000000001s)]
*  And occasionally, you see that from fighters. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4202.84s)]
*  Charles Olivera is a great example of that. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4205.6s)]
*  Something happened in his career. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4207.320000000001s)]
*  It snapped, and then all of a sudden, [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4209.400000000001s)]
*  he was on another level. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4211.240000000001s)]
*  And when most people watched Khalil before, [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4212.52s)]
*  everyone knew he was very good. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4215.64s)]
*  But you watch him after this, you're like, [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4217.320000000001s)]
*  well, this guy is like, this is world-class. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4218.88s)]
*  This is like top of the food chain striking. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4221.76s)]
*  And if he can keep getting better [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4224.400000000001s)]
*  the way he got better for this fight, [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4226.6s)]
*  that's like world championship caliber fighting. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4228.76s)]
*  The inside of that quad there on his right leg. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4230.96s)]
*  Or both, inside and out, it looks like. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4234.12s)]
*  I think for Khalil and a lot of these guys, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4236.12s)]
*  it's very hard to maintain the kind of focus [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4237.92s)]
*  that requires you to fight at this elite level every time. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4241.16s)]
*  What hurts worse, in or out? [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4245.76s)]
*  They both suck. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4247.68s)]
*  They both suck. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4249.64s)]
*  They both suck. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4250.64s)]
*  The calf, I've never been kicked in the calf, [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4251.4800000000005s)]
*  but everybody that I know that has says it's the worst. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4254.04s)]
*  Michael Bisping, in his entire UFC career, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4256.76s)]
*  won the world title, never got kicked in the calf. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4259.200000000001s)]
*  Lucky for him, that wasn't a thing. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4261.84s)]
*  Isn't that amazing? [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4264.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4265.0s)]
*  That's how recent it became [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4265.84s)]
*  one of the most dangerous weapons in sport. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4268.240000000001s)]
*  Now it's like the fight hinges almost on [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4270.52s)]
*  how many calf kicks can you land before whatever. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4274.400000000001s)]
*  When you watch the second Paheta-Otisania fight in the UFC, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4277.72s)]
*  the second one, he was getting to his calf again. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4281.679999999999s)]
*  And Israel. Oh, just recently. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4284.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, and Israel's like, God damn it, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4286.36s)]
*  he's getting me again. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4288.28s)]
*  He's so good at hiding it. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4290.24s)]
*  He's better than anybody I've ever seen. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4293.2s)]
*  And he knew it was coming. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4294.04s)]
*  Yes. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4295.36s)]
*  He knew from the first time. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4296.2s)]
*  But he was better at it this time. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4298.32s)]
*  But Paheta, he doesn't switch the hips. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4299.96s)]
*  He stands, he stands like this. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4303.8s)]
*  He's got this like weird way of standing [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4307.72s)]
*  where he's almost kind of square to you. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4308.96s)]
*  And when he kicks, he just throws the leg. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4311.28s)]
*  So the shoulders don't swing. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4313.44s)]
*  There's none of this stuff. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4315.24s)]
*  It's just thump, thump. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4316.4s)]
*  So even if you know it's coming. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4318.28s)]
*  It's not as hard as he can hit you, but it doesn't matter. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4319.64s)]
*  It's as quick as he can hit you [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4322.2s)]
*  and as sneakily as he can hit you. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4323.36s)]
*  And he's hitting that same spot again and again and again. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4325.32s)]
*  And if your daughter hits you there, it sucks. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4328.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4329.96s)]
*  I had to stop letting my 13-year-old thigh kick me. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4331.2s)]
*  It's hurting. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4335.4s)]
*  It started to hurt. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4336.24s)]
*  So it's really hurting. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4337.36s)]
*  And that was like the fun thing for them [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4338.719999999999s)]
*  that they could full power Muay Thai me in the legs. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4340.12s)]
*  Does she kick as hard as a round tree? [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4342.4s)]
*  Dude, I wouldn't be walking. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4345.2s)]
*  I can't take one of those. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4347.679999999999s)]
*  I know. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4349.12s)]
*  Those are horrible. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4349.96s)]
*  What I did like to see was. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4350.8s)]
*  Especially a full blast one. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4351.88s)]
*  With Stylebender was, you know, they showed, [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4353.679999999999s)]
*  after he knocked him out, they showed his training [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4356.0s)]
*  where he was mimicking that same exact shot. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4357.96s)]
*  Yes, yes, yeah. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4361.2s)]
*  In that same position where he's on the cage, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4362.04s)]
*  rope adope and then explode out is like incredible. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4364.36s)]
*  Well, he knew that Paheda opens up [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4367.96s)]
*  when he thinks he's got you hurt. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4370.44s)]
*  He kind of drops his hands a little bit. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4371.28s)]
*  Well, he fights with his hands down. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4372.799999999999s)]
*  It's a very unusual style. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4374.24s)]
*  But it's also very, very effective. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4376.08s)]
*  Oh, this is it. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4378.2s)]
*  Let's see here. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4379.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4379.88s)]
*  Oh yeah, look at it right there. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4380.719999999999s)]
*  That's it right there. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4383.88s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4385.24s)]
*  This one for sure right here. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4386.08s)]
*  See, he let himself get hit with the right. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4388.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4390.08s)]
*  Because even in that training, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4391.92s)]
*  he let himself get hit with that right. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4393.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4395.28s)]
*  Well, he takes a great shot. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4396.56s)]
*  I mean, he got knocked out by Paheda [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4398.68s)]
*  in the kickboxing match. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4400.6s)]
*  But God damn, if that guy hits you that hard in that, [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4402.88s)]
*  it was like the worlds were colliding [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4406.36s)]
*  as he landed the left hook. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4408.88s)]
*  Like sometimes you land a shot [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4410.56s)]
*  and the guy's moving in the direction of it. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4412.16s)]
*  It takes a little bit. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4414.2s)]
*  Like have you ever had anybody [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4415.2s)]
*  hit hold pads for you and hit pads? [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4416.2s)]
*  When they hold pads for you, [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4418.16s)]
*  they kind of meet your punch. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4419.56s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4421.6s)]
*  And it makes your punch seem harder. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4422.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4423.280000000001s)]
*  But if you work with a guy who doesn't do that, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4424.120000000001s)]
*  you have to actually hit it. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4426.56s)]
*  You realize the difference. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4427.84s)]
*  Well, that's the difference between you moving your face. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4428.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4431.04s)]
*  If you're coming into it, they're punching. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4431.88s)]
*  Boom! [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4433.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4434.280000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4435.120000000001s)]
*  And that can happen. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4435.9400000000005s)]
*  It happens with guys all the time. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4436.780000000001s)]
*  And you see the opposite too. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4438.04s)]
*  When they go with a punch [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4439.360000000001s)]
*  and it looks like it's gonna be hard, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4440.76s)]
*  but they're okay because they rolled with it. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4442.280000000001s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4444.52s)]
*  Kelvin Gastel is very good at that. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4446.120000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of guys that are very good at turning. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4448.32s)]
*  Izzy's good at that. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4450.5599999999995s)]
*  Izzy's really good at that. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4451.96s)]
*  Just turning, as the punch is hitting you, [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4452.88s)]
*  turning your head, going with it. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4454.96s)]
*  Whitaker's good at that too. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4457.0s)]
*  That's gonna be an interesting fight. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4458.599999999999s)]
*  Whitaker is, he's fighting... [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4460.12s)]
*  Yeah, I saw this. God damn it. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4466.5599999999995s)]
*  Why am I brain freezing here? [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4467.88s)]
*  I saw this. It's a great fight. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4469.48s)]
*  Oh, Drekos, Drekos Duplici. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4470.759999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4472.5599999999995s)]
*  That's a great fight. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4473.4s)]
*  That's an interesting fight. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4474.219999999999s)]
*  Because apparently Drekos and Izzy don't like each other [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4475.24s)]
*  because Drekos is saying something about [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4478.88s)]
*  I'm the real African. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4480.44s)]
*  Yeah, I know, it's so weird. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4481.28s)]
*  Might wanna fucking tone that down. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4483.12s)]
*  So weird. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4484.72s)]
*  It's kind of a history apart of... [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4485.56s)]
*  I don't, I know. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4487.0s)]
*  I can't get on board with that. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4489.12s)]
*  It's stupid, but it also gets attention. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4491.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4493.96s)]
*  And it gets the guy mad at you. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4494.8s)]
*  And then the guy wants to fuck you up. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4495.64s)]
*  Get him rattled. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4497.36s)]
*  No, I get it. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4498.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, what makes it interesting to me, [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4499.4s)]
*  in terms of the choice of having Whitaker [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4501.92s)]
*  and Drekos Duplici fight, [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4504.28s)]
*  is that Whitaker came really close [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4506.44s)]
*  to beating Izzy in that last fight. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4512.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4514.36s)]
*  I mean, it was a very close fight. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4515.2s)]
*  The first fight, Izzy steamrolled him, right? [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4516.44s)]
*  Izzy catches him, knocks him out. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4519.08s)]
*  Then all of a sudden Whitaker just keeps getting better [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4520.599999999999s)]
*  and better and better. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4522.24s)]
*  And then gets a shot at the title again [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4523.4s)]
*  and has an amazing fight, like down to the wire. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4525.879999999999s)]
*  I believe it was a split decision. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4528.08s)]
*  Is that correct? [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4531.44s)]
*  Fine enough that was a split decision, [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4532.28s)]
*  but it was a very good fight. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4533.5599999999995s)]
*  I just like Rob's take on things. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4534.56s)]
*  He's so articulate and well thought out. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4536.8s)]
*  He's an animal too. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4539.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4540.64s)]
*  He's all the above. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4541.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and he's one of my favorite fighters also, [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4542.320000000001s)]
*  besides Stylebender. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4544.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4545.400000000001s)]
*  But he's so good. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4546.240000000001s)]
*  I almost hate that they don't like each other. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4547.080000000001s)]
*  I know. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4549.200000000001s)]
*  Because I love both of them. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4550.04s)]
*  They're so great. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4550.860000000001s)]
*  It was the Stylebender-Whitaker fight? [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4551.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4553.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4554.080000000001s)]
*  KO. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4554.900000000001s)]
*  They had two though. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4555.740000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, the second one. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4556.580000000001s)]
*  The second one. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4557.400000000001s)]
*  They had two. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4558.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the first one he knocked him out. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4559.06s)]
*  And then the second one. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4559.900000000001s)]
*  A decision unanimous. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4560.740000000001s)]
*  A unanimous decision. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4561.56s)]
*  Yeah, very good fight though. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4562.400000000001s)]
*  But the point is, it's like, if they're gonna fight again, [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4564.64s)]
*  I'm in. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4567.0s)]
*  I wanna see that fight. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4567.84s)]
*  But I feel like, why not just give him that fight? [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4569.04s)]
*  Like why are you making him fight Drekus? [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4573.36s)]
*  And if you are making him fight Drekus, [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4575.72s)]
*  if he beats Drekus, then Drekus has to build himself [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4577.04s)]
*  back up to get to a place where you get this big money fight [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4579.84s)]
*  with Izzy. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4582.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4582.92s)]
*  Like, wouldn't it be smarter? [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4583.74s)]
*  Unpopular opinion. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4585.16s)]
*  Wouldn't it be smarter? [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4586.0s)]
*  I'm not a big fan of Drekus. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4587.04s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4589.32s)]
*  I don't think he's near as good as, [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4590.16s)]
*  the top of the heap. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4592.16s)]
*  He admits that, he admits fighting Robert Whitaker, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4593.879999999999s)]
*  not the smart move, explains why he accepted [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4596.44s)]
*  the UFC 290 fight. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4598.5199999999995s)]
*  So why is he accepting it? [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4600.08s)]
*  What is he saying? [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4601.32s)]
*  I think he's a notch bull. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4602.16s)]
*  I think those guys are just a little bit better. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4603.5199999999995s)]
*  A lot of people are saying it's not the smartest move [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4605.5199999999995s)]
*  to fight Whitaker, and 100% I agree with that. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4608.379999999999s)]
*  I agree, I like this dude. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4612.12s)]
*  Yeah, I choose to be a warrior. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4613.5199999999995s)]
*  I agree it's not the smart move, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4614.36s)]
*  but I'm not here to be smart. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4615.679999999999s)]
*  Otherwise I would have stayed in school [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4617.139999999999s)]
*  and finished my studies, gone to work at a bank, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4618.48s)]
*  wear a suit to work every day and do some corporate life. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4620.88s)]
*  But that's not the life I chose. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4623.88s)]
*  I chose to be a warrior, to be an entertainer, [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4625.84s)]
*  and at the end of the day I'm a fighter, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4628.72s)]
*  and that's what I do, I fight. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4630.32s)]
*  Okay, well I like that a little better. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4632.24s)]
*  I like that attitude. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4634.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I like that. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4635.4800000000005s)]
*  I know he talked a lot of shit, but you know, listen. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4636.32s)]
*  People talk shit about people in other towns. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4639.12s)]
*  If you actually lived in Africa, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4640.68s)]
*  and some dude's in New Zealand, [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4642.28s)]
*  and you'd be like, hey I'm the real African. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4644.46s)]
*  One more, just a couple more sentences to add. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4645.96s)]
*  Okay, I want to deserve my title shot, [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4648.6s)]
*  I don't want to be handed a title shot. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4651.62s)]
*  I'm going to deserve that belt, [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4652.46s)]
*  and that's why I wanted that Whitaker fight. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4653.98s)]
*  All right, okay, I can respect that. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4655.72s)]
*  I still like Whitaker better. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4658.86s)]
*  Well, I like both of them, but that's a find out fight. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4660.3s)]
*  We'll find out, we'll find out, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4664.94s)]
*  because Whitaker's gonna test that guy. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4667.099999999999s)]
*  Whitaker's a motherfucker dude. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4668.98s)]
*  God, he is so good. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4670.46s)]
*  And he's another guy that couldn't, [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4671.78s)]
*  he's a good move to 85, right? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4673.139999999999s)]
*  Because at 170 it was just too much. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4675.7s)]
*  He was just cutting too much weight, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4677.74s)]
*  and then at 185 becomes world champion. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4679.22s)]
*  One of my favorite things, and I don't know why, [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4681.820000000001s)]
*  is watching fighter reactions to them watching fights. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4684.580000000001s)]
*  When Stahlbender beat Alex, they show Whitaker's reaction. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4690.620000000001s)]
*  And I just love that that moment, [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4696.42s)]
*  because they're in the same job, same whatever, [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4698.14s)]
*  and so their reaction is so authentic. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4701.22s)]
*  Connor watched Khabib, they had on there. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4704.26s)]
*  Did Robert Whitaker cheer when Israel won? [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4706.62s)]
*  No, he's just pretty measured, but he's just like, [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4709.66s)]
*  I don't know, I just like it. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4712.78s)]
*  I'm not really like Theo Von watching people eat dinner [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4715.38s)]
*  like that, but it's- [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4717.86s)]
*  Say it if he was on cocaine. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4719.66s)]
*  Who do you think he would wanna fight more? [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4722.9s)]
*  Who, between who? [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4725.62s)]
*  Robert Whitaker, who would you wanna fight more? [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4726.86s)]
*  Would you wanna fight, if you were like him before the fight, [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4728.5s)]
*  who would you be rooting for? [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4731.82s)]
*  I would imagine he'd be rooting for Adesanya, [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4733.46s)]
*  because that's the big money fight for him. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4735.98s)]
*  Yeah, and they're one and one. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4738.98s)]
*  Or no, no, they're two and all. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4741.379999999999s)]
*  Stahlbender beat him twice, right? [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4743.379999999999s)]
*  Yes, or he might think that Stahlbender had a good time [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4744.9s)]
*  in the first fight with Beheeta on the ground. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4750.259999999999s)]
*  Whitaker's a very good wrestler, very good on the ground, [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4752.82s)]
*  very strong grappler. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4755.94s)]
*  I think he'd want Stahlbender just because of that, [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4757.7s)]
*  that location, they're both the same part of the world. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4761.299999999999s)]
*  Well, it could be that, but it also could be, [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4764.46s)]
*  he thinks he's got a good shot at beating Beheeta. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4767.5s)]
*  I mean, you might wanna look at it that way. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4771.78s)]
*  He probably does. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4773.7s)]
*  Because the other thing is, if he beat Izzy twice in a row, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4775.54s)]
*  there wouldn't be a third match, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4778.3s)]
*  so Whitaker would automatically kinda be a shoe-in [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4779.62s)]
*  for the next title shot. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4782.14s)]
*  Wouldn't you imagine? [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4783.26s)]
*  Well, yeah, and don't you think that people are, [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4784.18s)]
*  the critics would say Alex hasn't taken on a wrestler, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4787.86s)]
*  a good wrestler, right? [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4791.1s)]
*  Oh yeah, 100%. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4792.38s)]
*  That's the style of Bender's thing. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4793.26s)]
*  But that's Whitaker's thing. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4794.3s)]
*  I mean, it's not Whitaker's whole thing. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4795.46s)]
*  Is there a lot of sign, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4797.3s)]
*  you're confident Robert Whitaker beats Drekka's Duplisi [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4798.14s)]
*  at UFC 290, open the trilogy bout? [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4800.26s)]
*  It will be a great fight. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4802.62s)]
*  Because, I mean, Izzy just had his fucking number [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4804.3s)]
*  in that first one. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4807.820000000001s)]
*  That was like a prime Izzy performance. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4808.66s)]
*  I think a lot of these wrestling strong fighters [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4810.860000000001s)]
*  want Pahira. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4815.740000000001s)]
*  Look what Izzy said. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4817.5s)]
*  He said, I tried to do Drekka's Duplisi [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4819.54s)]
*  in the fucking Death Star, [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4821.86s)]
*  the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4823.42s)]
*  I had a sign he said, I tried. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4825.5s)]
*  Maybe not International Fight Week [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4827.0199999999995s)]
*  because it was already booked, [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4828.58s)]
*  but I tried it later on. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4829.42s)]
*  I was like, fuck it. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4830.58s)]
*  Give him to me. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4832.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm already, it's already there. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4832.86s)]
*  What's the point? [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4834.62s)]
*  Why wait? [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4835.46s)]
*  Yeah, I like that attitude too. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4836.54s)]
*  I think he'd fuck him up. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4838.34s)]
*  Maybe, but wouldn't you wanna watch? [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4839.7s)]
*  Of course. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4843.58s)]
*  I wanna watch. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4844.42s)]
*  He's upset. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4845.259999999999s)]
*  I know. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4846.099999999999s)]
*  If Izzy is mad at somebody, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4846.94s)]
*  if Izzy's fired up, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4848.58s)]
*  I want to be there for that. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4850.1s)]
*  I wanna see that. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4853.38s)]
*  I love it all. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4854.5s)]
*  I love it all. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4855.5s)]
*  I wanna see it. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4856.660000000001s)]
*  That's what he's saying. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4857.5s)]
*  My dream people to train with, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4858.46s)]
*  I did Chandler, [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4860.3s)]
*  but Colby's tough, [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4861.660000000001s)]
*  but I want the wolf. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4863.900000000001s)]
*  I want the wolf. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4865.540000000001s)]
*  Oh, Hamzat? [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4866.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4867.22s)]
*  I kill everyone. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4868.06s)]
*  Yeah, I want him to come do lift, run, shoot. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4868.900000000001s)]
*  I want him to get a dietician. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4870.780000000001s)]
*  Well, and then I also want Connor [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4872.5s)]
*  because I want Connor to stop partying [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4874.38s)]
*  and fucking get serious. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4876.1s)]
*  Well, it's hard [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4877.54s)]
*  because why do you become famous in the first place? [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4880.46s)]
*  Why do you become successful in the first place? [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4884.22s)]
*  So you can live like a fucking baller. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4886.06s)]
*  Yeah, but you can- [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4890.26s)]
*  And that's what Connor's doing. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4891.1s)]
*  But you can do that shit when you're old. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4891.94s)]
*  Do you see he pulled his yacht up [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4892.78s)]
*  to the fucking Formula One? [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4894.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4896.14s)]
*  So he's watching the Formula One [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4896.98s)]
*  while he's eating breakfast [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4897.9s)]
*  off the back of his yacht. I know. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4898.74s)]
*  It looks great, but- [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4899.78s)]
*  Fuck yeah, it does. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4901.26s)]
*  But, I mean, you got a shitload of money. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4902.38s)]
*  You don't do that. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4906.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm a different person than Connor McCracker. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4907.18s)]
*  I know, but- [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4909.700000000001s)]
*  I have different motivations. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4910.54s)]
*  But he's in his, I'm not quite in his prime, [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4912.18s)]
*  maybe a little older, but he's got so much talent, [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4915.54s)]
*  so much ability. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4917.9400000000005s)]
*  You can party and be a fucking madman. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4919.06s)]
*  Or you could be jacked in your yacht, [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4922.58s)]
*  which is what you want. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4924.06s)]
*  Yeah, but when you're 40 and you got no other choice, [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4924.9800000000005s)]
*  do it then. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4928.900000000001s)]
*  Well, but you can do it now [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4929.9800000000005s)]
*  and that's what he wants to do. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4932.18s)]
*  The problem is- I fucking hate it though. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4933.740000000001s)]
*  The problem is, it's like- [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4935.58s)]
*  I'm sick of seeing pictures of him partying. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4936.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4938.94s)]
*  I'm sick of it. I want to see him in the gym. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4939.98s)]
*  I want him to do what he wants to do. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4942.0199999999995s)]
*  If Connor McGregor wants to fucking buy diamonds [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4943.58s)]
*  and lay around in the sun, I'm all there for it. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4945.7s)]
*  The guy earned every fucking penny he got. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4948.42s)]
*  I'm happy for him. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4951.18s)]
*  I'm happy. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4953.0599999999995s)]
*  I salute him. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4953.9s)]
*  Come carry that fucking rock up the hill. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4954.74s)]
*  He'll do that. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4956.66s)]
*  I want him to. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4957.46s)]
*  Oh, that would be an awesome show. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4958.3s)]
*  Would. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4959.62s)]
*  Yeah, it'd be fun. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4960.46s)]
*  You and him on Mount Pigza. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4961.74s)]
*  Pisgah. Pisgah. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4963.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4964.5s)]
*  You know what that's what these are called. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4965.62s)]
*  See that? [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4967.5s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4968.34s)]
*  It's a GSPGH. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4969.54s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4971.66s)]
*  You didn't know that? [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4972.82s)]
*  No, I didn't know that. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4973.7s)]
*  And then the- [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4975.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, I just saw these in the flesh today [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4975.9s)]
*  for the first time. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4977.14s)]
*  What's that? [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4979.78s)]
*  That's me on the monument. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4981.34s)]
*  Ooh. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4982.62s)]
*  You want that little thing that you hop on. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4983.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4985.34s)]
*  Nice. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4986.18s)]
*  That's kind of sick, isn't it? [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4987.0199999999995s)]
*  That is sick. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4987.86s)]
*  What's it like to have your own shoe? [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4988.7s)]
*  Well, you had a bunch of own shoes [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4989.62s)]
*  when you were with Under Armour. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4991.22s)]
*  You did. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4992.0599999999995s)]
*  But this one, [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4992.9s)]
*  I'm not saying I'm like Michael Jordan, but- [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4994.82s)]
*  I actually killed two elk wearing your shoes. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=4997.38s)]
*  You did? [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5000.94s)]
*  On two different occasions. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5001.78s)]
*  I killed elk wearing those [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5002.62s)]
*  Under Armour, Cam-Ains trail shoes. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5003.46s)]
*  Yeah, those, [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5005.339999999999s)]
*  I like those shoes too. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5007.339999999999s)]
*  Well, they're great. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5008.5s)]
*  They were great for bow hunting [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5009.339999999999s)]
*  because you could get a little bit of traction to them [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5011.5s)]
*  and you could- [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5013.94s)]
*  Feel the ground. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5014.78s)]
*  They're real lightweight if you're sneaking up on stuff. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5015.62s)]
*  So you can, as long as you're not in real hazardous terrain, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5017.299999999999s)]
*  you can get away with a good trail running shoe. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5020.299999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5022.099999999999s)]
*  No, for sure. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5023.1s)]
*  If it's a, you don't need that ankle support. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5023.9400000000005s)]
*  What are you wearing now for your hunting boot? [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5025.860000000001s)]
*  Last year I wore Solomon. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5029.54s)]
*  Solomon's are great. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5031.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5032.620000000001s)]
*  Those are great. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5033.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5034.700000000001s)]
*  And the, I mean, the Under Armour boots, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5035.54s)]
*  I killed a lot wearing those, but- [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5037.58s)]
*  Those are real lightweight too. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5039.46s)]
*  Yeah, it was like, [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5040.5s)]
*  I'm not working with them anymore. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5042.9400000000005s)]
*  So I'm like, well, just try a bunch. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5044.860000000001s)]
*  And that's why I tried out a bunch [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5046.9800000000005s)]
*  of different running shoes also to try to make, okay. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5048.54s)]
*  I kind of had to use Under Armour and they, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5051.78s)]
*  they did what I wanted and they made the good shoe, [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5053.5s)]
*  like that you killed bulls in. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5055.3s)]
*  I ran a lot of miles in those, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5056.78s)]
*  but then once I didn't renew with them, I'm like, [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5058.46s)]
*  well, let me just see what's out there [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5060.78s)]
*  and see what the best is. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5062.3s)]
*  So I tried Solomon in boots and then ran [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5063.9s)]
*  and about everything else and ended up on these Speedlands. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5066.0599999999995s)]
*  And is Speedland a company that just specializes [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5069.7s)]
*  in running? [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5072.5s)]
*  Is it just running sneakers? [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5073.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's just trail running. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5074.179999999999s)]
*  Just trail running. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5075.86s)]
*  Yeah, just trail running. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5076.7s)]
*  Nice. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5077.54s)]
*  Yeah, so they- [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5078.38s)]
*  My worry would be if you tried to hunt with those, [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5079.219999999999s)]
*  the elk would look at you too and go, [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5082.58s)]
*  is that fucking blood in this motherfucker's shoes? [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5083.78s)]
*  Is it? [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5085.82s)]
*  What was the decision to have blood splattered on it? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5086.66s)]
*  And is it the same splatter on every shoe [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5089.74s)]
*  or is it different? [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5091.5s)]
*  No, it's the same splatter. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5092.34s)]
*  It's kind of cool. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5093.18s)]
*  Feels like different on every one. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5094.18s)]
*  It's a lot of work. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5097.66s)]
*  It's a lot of work. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5098.5s)]
*  I was thinking that. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5099.34s)]
*  Too much work. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5100.18s)]
*  My thought is blood to me is a symbol of sacrifice. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5101.0199999999995s)]
*  Sometimes you gotta bleed to achieve your goals. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5106.139999999999s)]
*  So that's what it means to me. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5108.42s)]
*  And those guys, those are the owners of the company. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5110.5s)]
*  It's an Oregon company. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5113.86s)]
*  They both used to, they've worked at Nike, Puma, Under Armour. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5115.3s)]
*  And so Speedland is their brainchild. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5118.42s)]
*  And then me being local, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5120.94s)]
*  they're willing to work with me and do whatever I wanted. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5122.94s)]
*  And a lot of the running companies are pretty liberal. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5127.1s)]
*  So me being a bow hunter, [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5133.26s)]
*  even though I have influence in the running community, [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5136.42s)]
*  they're not willing to put themselves out there. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5138.98s)]
*  But you need to make these in origin camo. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5141.179999999999s)]
*  So we're coming out with a winter version that's black. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5144.459999999999s)]
*  What about origin camo? [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5150.0599999999995s)]
*  We could do that. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5151.179999999999s)]
*  We need to get that. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5152.099999999999s)]
*  We can do whatever. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5152.94s)]
*  That needs to be done. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5153.78s)]
*  Don't you think? [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5155.0199999999995s)]
*  Then you could totally hunt with this. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5156.0599999999995s)]
*  Seems like it's got a good grip on the bottom. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5157.9s)]
*  Oh no, it's great. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5159.82s)]
*  I mean, that bottom is, [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5161.219999999999s)]
*  so I just ran it, I ran an ultra. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5163.419999999999s)]
*  My brother won it. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5165.78s)]
*  I got second, but it was super muddy. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5166.82s)]
*  The traction on them is perfect [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5169.94s)]
*  because the mud doesn't stick to the sole, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5171.219999999999s)]
*  but it still gives you grip. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5173.7s)]
*  So that's always the, there's a trade off. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5175.0599999999995s)]
*  You don't want the lug so close where it's holding the mud. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5177.379999999999s)]
*  I started wearing these really light crispies. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5180.419999999999s)]
*  I like them a lot. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5182.54s)]
*  It's like heavier than that, but lighter than- [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5184.099999999999s)]
*  It's a trail runner? [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5187.0599999999995s)]
*  No, no. A boot. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5187.9s)]
*  A hunting boot. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5188.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5189.74s)]
*  I like those a lot. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5190.58s)]
*  Yeah, those have a good reputation. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5191.419999999999s)]
*  I haven't tried those. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5193.0599999999995s)]
*  Super solid. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5193.9s)]
*  Yeah, I liked it a lot. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5194.86s)]
*  It's like, but having the proper footwear as a runner [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5196.82s)]
*  has to be, like when you think about the amount of miles [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5200.62s)]
*  that you run, like you run an insane amount of miles. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5203.219999999999s)]
*  Like on a regular week, would you run [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5206.0199999999995s)]
*  when you're not prepping for like some ultra marathon? [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5208.38s)]
*  I mean, I don't even, usually I don't even track it, [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5212.0599999999995s)]
*  but it'd be for sure a hundred miles a week. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5213.9s)]
*  That's a lot. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5217.86s)]
*  14 miles a day. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5219.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that's a lot. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5219.98s)]
*  For an average. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5220.82s)]
*  But that's where those, that sole is, I mean, my body- [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5221.66s)]
*  It's got good cushioning. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5225.62s)]
*  Because even though I'm much younger than you, I am old. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5227.1s)]
*  Damn, that sucks for me. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5230.9s)]
*  This has got a good cushioning. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5233.5s)]
*  Yeah, so point is, is that my body doesn't take a beating [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5234.54s)]
*  with all the miles I put on. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5237.94s)]
*  Right, gives you a little padding. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5238.9s)]
*  And then the boa, of course the boa is nice [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5240.14s)]
*  because there's your foot swells. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5243.06s)]
*  Sometimes in longer races, your foot swells. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5244.86s)]
*  And so you can back those boas, [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5247.66s)]
*  the old ones you used to have to release all the way, [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5249.94s)]
*  those you can back like one click back. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5252.22s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5254.66s)]
*  You don't start all the way back over. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5255.9s)]
*  So if your foot gets a little tight, [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5257.62s)]
*  cause it's swelling, you can just go click, click. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5259.34s)]
*  I like boas. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5263.3s)]
*  Oh, there's a game changer. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5264.62s)]
*  Laces, dangling around. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5266.3s)]
*  And those cords, I was always worried [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5267.5s)]
*  those cords were gonna break. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5269.14s)]
*  Yeah, I've never had one. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5270.74s)]
*  I've never had one break either. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5271.9s)]
*  I kind of stopped worrying about it after a while, [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5273.3s)]
*  but in the beginning I'd crank them down, [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5274.94s)]
*  just waiting for it to pop. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5276.3s)]
*  Yeah, testing it. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5277.78s)]
*  I just wanna see. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5278.98s)]
*  Testing it like you did your back. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5279.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5281.22s)]
*  I think I felt that, but let me make sure. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5282.06s)]
*  Yeah, this is a good wake up call for me though. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5284.66s)]
*  Very good wake up call. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5286.9s)]
*  I was getting a little too lackadaisical about my choices. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5288.42s)]
*  Just, and not, I don't think I warmed up enough, [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5293.0199999999995s)]
*  honestly either. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5296.22s)]
*  Because I'm doing a lot of my workouts after the cold plunge. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5297.34s)]
*  And I think what I should incorporate now [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5301.62s)]
*  is probably like a good bike ride. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5303.66s)]
*  Like a good assault bike ride [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5306.82s)]
*  to really fucking get a good sweat going [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5309.22s)]
*  before I do anything else. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5311.9s)]
*  Because I've just been going lightly, [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5313.46s)]
*  like doing body weight squats and pushups [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5315.1s)]
*  and getting my body warmed up. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5317.22s)]
*  And then I started doing a bunch of leg stuff [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5319.1s)]
*  and then I did the dead lifts. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5320.9s)]
*  And it's not a bad injury. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5322.62s)]
*  Like I have full range of motion. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5324.14s)]
*  I can buck, but it's just- [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5326.18s)]
*  I mean you're shooting the bow today and looked fine. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5327.58s)]
*  But my muscle in my back is just a little annoyed with me. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5329.9800000000005s)]
*  But that's where that fucking hyper ice hammer [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5332.9s)]
*  has been helping me, is this fucker. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5335.7s)]
*  These things are game changers. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5338.46s)]
*  This is the Hypervolt Plus. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5340.14s)]
*  These are game changers. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5341.86s)]
*  It's a fat and CBD cream. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5343.22s)]
*  I got some really good CBD MD recovery CBD cream. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5345.46s)]
*  What kind? [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5350.46s)]
*  CBD MD. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5351.3s)]
*  It's called recovery. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5352.42s)]
*  It's one of their many different muscle bombs [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5353.26s)]
*  that they have. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5357.38s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5358.22s)]
*  Have you ever used that stuff? [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5359.06s)]
*  I use Santa Cruz medicinals. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5359.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5361.22s)]
*  And so it's like, I put it on today. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5362.06s)]
*  Just on my legs, on my arms. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5364.1s)]
*  Just because it's like when I'm tight from training, [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5365.46s)]
*  it just helps. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5369.14s)]
*  It's really, it alleviates inflammation somehow or another. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5370.1s)]
*  It feels good. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5373.42s)]
*  It goes through your pores. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5374.259999999999s)]
*  And does that, I mean even the smell, the aroma, I like. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5375.099999999999s)]
*  Oh I like it, yeah. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5377.9s)]
*  I like taking it too. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5379.0199999999995s)]
*  It's nice though when you take it, it relieves anxiety. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5379.94s)]
*  Like some, I was, when I first started, [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5383.7s)]
*  when CBD MD became a sponsor a long time ago, [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5387.38s)]
*  they sent me a bunch and I started taking their gummies [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5389.62s)]
*  every day and I was like, why do I feel so good? [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5391.42s)]
*  I was like, I feel like- [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5393.78s)]
*  And then it was just CBD. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5394.62s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5395.86s)]
*  Not THC. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5396.7s)]
*  No, just CBD. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5397.54s)]
*  And then I started taking the drops. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5398.38s)]
*  And you know, the drops, the oil, you can get it. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5400.42s)]
*  It's like really effectively into your system. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5403.66s)]
*  You just drop it under your tongue. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5404.94s)]
*  And it's, it just, I mean I think results may vary. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5406.46s)]
*  But for me it works great. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5411.7s)]
*  I'm a big fan. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5413.0599999999995s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5413.94s)]
*  I try so much different stuff [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5414.78s)]
*  and I don't really know what works specifically [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5416.66s)]
*  but I know I feel good. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5419.74s)]
*  Dave Foley told me that it cured his arthritis in his hands. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5421.46s)]
*  He had his hands, he said he couldn't straighten them out. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5425.86s)]
*  He started taking CBD and it just all went away. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5428.46s)]
*  He goes, now I have full range of function in my hands. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5431.22s)]
*  Which is amazing. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5433.5s)]
*  That is. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5434.34s)]
*  That's amazing because usually that stuff [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5435.18s)]
*  goes downhill from there. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5436.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5438.38s)]

*  There's a comic named Sean Rouse. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5444.740000000001s)]
*  It was hilarious, hilarious comic [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5446.46s)]
*  and he had horrible arthritis. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5448.34s)]
*  It was horrible. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5449.820000000001s)]
*  He could barely move. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5451.18s)]

*  Dude was fucking funny though. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5454.900000000001s)]
*  He was so funny. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5456.900000000001s)]
*  That inflammation is a real, [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5458.14s)]
*  I mean it makes everything worse. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5460.58s)]
*  Oh, it's horrible. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5463.18s)]
*  And from the alcohols just exacerbating the symptoms. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5464.5s)]

*  it's Jordan Peterson's daughter, Michaela. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5471.86s)]
*  She has really bad arthritis [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5474.14s)]
*  and she got on the carnivore diet [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5475.94s)]
*  and basically like stopped in its tracks. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5477.42s)]
*  When I went, I did that kind of a keto thing. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5479.54s)]
*  I was trying to get fueled up with just fat adapted. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5482.58s)]
*  So no carbs, just all protein fruits type thing. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5487.14s)]
*  My joints have never felt better. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5490.620000000001s)]
*  I mean I would come downstairs in the morning. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5492.26s)]
*  I'm like a freaking 14 year old. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5493.900000000001s)]
*  Just like boop, boop, boop. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5496.820000000001s)]
*  Bouncing around. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5498.26s)]
*  I hadn't felt that good in whatever. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5499.1s)]
*  But it was the carbs that caused that inflammation. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5500.26s)]
*  I know it's crazy to think, but I think that's true. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5502.9800000000005s)]
*  I got, I've been doing the carnivore diet now. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5505.820000000001s)]
*  Pretty disciplined. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5509.46s)]
*  Except last night I had a couple of corn chips [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5510.780000000001s)]
*  because we were eating, [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5513.34s)]
*  my family got Mexican food [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5515.620000000001s)]
*  and I was just eating the steak, like some carne asada. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5516.860000000001s)]
*  There was some corn chips there and I fucking cheated. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5519.66s)]
*  I ate like five or six corn chips. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5521.7s)]
*  I won't tell. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5523.38s)]
*  But other than that, it's been mostly just meat and eggs. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5524.98s)]
*  It's mostly been all of what I've been eating. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5527.7s)]
*  And I've had a few pieces of fruit along the way. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5529.26s)]
*  But I feel great. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5532.22s)]
*  I lost five pounds, six pounds, somewhere around then. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5534.34s)]
*  What are you, 195? [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5537.66s)]
*  196 right now. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5539.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, 195, 196. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5540.46s)]
*  I feel fucking great. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5542.1s)]
*  I feel great. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5543.78s)]
*  Your energy levels. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5545.1s)]
*  This is what fascinated me about it the first time I did it. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5546.54s)]
*  I felt like my energy level was stable through the whole day, [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5550.86s)]
*  which it kind of never is. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5554.26s)]
*  After a podcast sometimes I'm just like, ooh. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5555.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5558.38s)]
*  Because you don't think about it as being difficult. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5559.34s)]
*  But say if I'm talking to someone that's talking to me [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5561.46s)]
*  about some really heavy shit, [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5563.58s)]
*  some quantum physics or something, [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5568.38s)]
*  Michio Kaku type dude. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5570.62s)]
*  The whole time I'm just trying to keep up with this dude. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5572.86s)]
*  It's like running up the mountain with you. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5575.42s)]
*  I could run a marathon way easier than I can sit into a podcast. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5576.9400000000005s)]
*  At my podcast, I'm so stressed out from, [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5581.06s)]
*  I can't keep this conversation going. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5584.1s)]
*  OK, I'm listening to what they're saying, [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5586.42s)]
*  but I got to think of the next question I'm going to ask. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5587.54s)]
*  You'll eventually get to the point where you don't think about that. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5589.9s)]
*  It's just a reps thing. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5592.9s)]
*  It's just like shooting your bow. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5594.22s)]
*  The worst is the smart people like Chris Williamson. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5595.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5598.1s)]
*  That dude's crazy smart. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5599.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5600.02s)]
*  And I'm like, god, what am I going to do? [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5600.5s)]
*  So I was exhausted after that one. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5602.82s)]
*  You never see that dude say um. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5605.02s)]
*  No. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5606.5s)]
*  And he's like, his memory is like, oh, my friend Alex Hormozi. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5607.5s)]
*  I mean, it just rattles off this quote and ties it in perfectly. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5612.18s)]
*  I'm like, god, I suck. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5615.5s)]
*  Fascinating guy and one of the best guys to sort of emerge [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5616.620000000001s)]
*  from this new group of people that are interviewing people [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5619.620000000001s)]
*  and talking to people on YouTube. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5621.860000000001s)]
*  He's one of the best. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5623.18s)]
*  One of my favorite. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5625.1s)]
*  I asked him, I said, so what exactly is an intellectual? [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5625.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good question. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5629.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5630.780000000001s)]
*  Because he was a club promoter. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5631.1s)]
*  I know. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5632.3s)]
*  I know. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5632.860000000001s)]
*  So it's like, I just know if it was intellectual, [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5633.66s)]
*  it'd be the opposite of me would be a good definition. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5636.26s)]
*  But you know, like, I think classical education has its point. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5638.5s)]
*  It has its merits and it has its place. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5644.0599999999995s)]
*  But there's some people that have done some insane things [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5646.34s)]
*  by bypassing the normal system. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5648.94s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5650.94s)]
*  One of them is James Cameron. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5651.46s)]
*  Do you know, I was reading this thing yesterday [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5653.0199999999995s)]
*  about James Cameron. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5655.26s)]
*  Do you know that James Cameron didn't go to film school? [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5656.14s)]
*  James Cameron used to go to the library [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5658.74s)]
*  and he would take people's dissertations [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5661.74s)]
*  and he would photocopy them. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5664.42s)]
*  And he would just absorb all their information [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5665.94s)]
*  about filmmaking. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5669.62s)]
*  All the interviews. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5670.62s)]
*  He essentially said he got a doctorate's degree [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5672.54s)]
*  for like $1,200. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5676.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5677.82s)]
*  Of photocopying things and studying things. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5678.34s)]
*  Well. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5680.46s)]
*  Which is kind of crazy because James Cameron is like, [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5680.98s)]
*  is he the highest selling producer of all time? [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5684.0199999999995s)]
*  Might be. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5688.62s)]
*  He's up there, Steven Spielberg. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5689.18s)]
*  But think about the Titanic. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5690.900000000001s)]
*  Avatar. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5693.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5694.62s)]
*  Aliens. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5695.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5696.54s)]
*  I mean, how many fucking movies has that guy made [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5696.900000000001s)]
*  that are just blockbusters? [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5700.42s)]
*  And to think that he learned how to do it. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5701.900000000001s)]
*  Find out if that's true. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5704.1s)]
*  He's number two right behind Spielberg. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5704.820000000001s)]
*  Number two behind Spielberg. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5706.42s)]
*  And you know, have you ever seen that? [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5709.02s)]
*  Tanner has a t-shirt and it says, great artist steel. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5711.14s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5714.66s)]
*  And so these guys, so whatever he was influenced by, [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5715.900000000001s)]
*  he'd go to the library or he'd see things. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5718.86s)]
*  The reason why I thought of that is when you were saying that, [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5721.5s)]
*  Bram Lynn Schake told me he like watches, [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5724.38s)]
*  who is the director? [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5728.339999999999s)]
*  He's done some, god, I can't think of it right now. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5730.0599999999995s)]
*  But anyway, he tries to mimic that style who he's watched. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5732.7s)]
*  Is this the guy who films or does he do documentaries? [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5736.339999999999s)]
*  No, no, he's like a movie maker. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5739.46s)]
*  A movie maker. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5741.219999999999s)]
*  But is. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5741.9s)]
*  Not Werner Herzog. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5742.42s)]
*  No, it was Brad Pitt's been in one of his movies. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5743.299999999999s)]
*  I know that. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5746.139999999999s)]
*  Not Tarantino. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5746.7s)]
*  No. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5747.54s)]
*  No. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5750.06s)]
*  OK. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5750.9s)]
*  But anyway, point is. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5751.42s)]
*  You'll remember it in an hour. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5752.26s)]
*  Who? [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5753.74s)]
*  Guy Ritchie? [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5754.22s)]
*  Yes, Guy Ritchie. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5754.66s)]
*  Oh, Guy Ritchie's the fucking man. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5755.42s)]
*  Guy Ritchie was one of Bram Lynn's biggest inspiration. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5756.98s)]
*  He would sit in his little apartment and watch this [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5760.0199999999995s)]
*  and then try to, when he was doing [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5762.26s)]
*  Jim Schake hunting adventures things, [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5763.82s)]
*  he would try to mimic stuff like that. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5765.58s)]
*  Like when he filmed the grizzly hunt that we did, [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5767.58s)]
*  he just was like using all these different influences. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5770.26s)]
*  And it was just mimicking the styles. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5773.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5776.26s)]
*  That's a good guy to mimic. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5778.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5779.700000000001s)]
*  So what does the classical schooling [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5780.18s)]
*  do when you can just watch this and try to mimic it [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5784.02s)]
*  and then try to use your inspiration or influence [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5787.46s)]
*  on whatever you're creating? [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5790.860000000001s)]
*  Maybe that's a ticket. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5792.62s)]
*  Well, I think both of them are tickets, honestly. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5793.900000000001s)]
*  I think classical schooling teaches you [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5796.780000000001s)]
*  all the technical details, all the stuff that you mean. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5800.3s)]
*  You can learn it other places as well. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5805.1s)]
*  But it puts you in a place where you're learning it [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5807.46s)]
*  and you're actually in a course. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5809.620000000001s)]
*  And there's a real value for some people [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5811.26s)]
*  for that kind of structure. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5813.42s)]
*  And I think not everybody's as motivated as James Cameron. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5815.14s)]
*  And sometimes people, they can't carve their own path. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5818.620000000001s)]
*  They can't figure out a way to make it. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5821.780000000001s)]
*  Like you got to find places that there's [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5823.46s)]
*  a light at the end of this tunnel. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5829.740000000001s)]
*  To try to carve your own tunnel is like, ugh. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5831.700000000001s)]
*  That's too much work. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5835.58s)]
*  So you've been influenced by comics. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5837.7s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5839.62s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5840.139999999999s)]
*  So you've implemented that strategy a little bit. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5840.66s)]
*  You'd see somebody you think is funny. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5843.259999999999s)]
*  You like their style. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5844.86s)]
*  Then you put your twist on it. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5846.179999999999s)]
*  Well, what happens is, first of all, [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5848.0599999999995s)]
*  there's one thing that happens when [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5850.299999999999s)]
*  you're around people that are really good, [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5851.94s)]
*  is that you have to bring your material up to their level. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5853.78s)]
*  Because iron really sharpens iron. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5857.099999999999s)]
*  That's one of the things that I really [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5859.139999999999s)]
*  like about this scene that we're developing here in Austin [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5860.98s)]
*  is there's so many good comics here on a regular basis. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5864.42s)]
*  On a regular basis, you're going to see Brian Simpson, [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5867.46s)]
*  Shane Gillis. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5870.22s)]
*  Best of the best. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5871.42s)]
*  Tony Hinchcliffe. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5872.14s)]
*  You're going to see fucking Mark Norman, Ari Shaffir. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5872.9400000000005s)]
*  You're going to see Joey Diaz. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5876.18s)]
*  You're going to see these people that are coming through. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5877.58s)]
*  It's been fucking wild. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5880.02s)]
*  But the young guys need that. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5882.06s)]
*  And the young girls and the young non-binary people, [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5884.02s)]
*  they all need it. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5886.74s)]
*  Everybody needs it. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5887.62s)]
*  Everybody who's watching that needs that. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5888.5s)]
*  Because you need to know where these levels are at. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5890.42s)]
*  You very rarely will go to a small town [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5892.98s)]
*  in the middle of nowhere, and the best comic in the world [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5896.459999999999s)]
*  is there. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5898.66s)]
*  I've never heard of that. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5898.94s)]
*  I don't think it exists. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5900.299999999999s)]
*  I think you have to be around other killers. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5901.339999999999s)]
*  But do you think that here's what I've noticed. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5904.62s)]
*  In small towns, there's always, I'll just [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5908.259999999999s)]
*  see if this analogy makes sense. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5910.98s)]
*  There's always a stud in the small town [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5912.94s)]
*  that doesn't really want to be compared [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5914.62s)]
*  to the beasts in big towns. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5916.219999999999s)]
*  So are there comics who really don't want to, [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5918.419999999999s)]
*  they feel better killing wherever they're at, [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5921.22s)]
*  and they don't really want to get thrown [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5924.02s)]
*  against the best of the best? [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5925.860000000001s)]
*  Well, it's not that. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5927.26s)]
*  It's that they don't want to travel. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5928.46s)]
*  And if they don't have to, because they're not [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5929.9400000000005s)]
*  going against them. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5932.62s)]
*  So one of the rare things about a setup like the comic store. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5933.820000000001s)]
*  Your game has to be elevated, or it's [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5936.9800000000005s)]
*  going to be very noticeable. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5939.62s)]
*  What I'm trying to say is, in the world of comedy, [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5940.62s)]
*  that really doesn't exist other than showcase clubs. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5942.820000000001s)]
*  So there's two kinds of clubs. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5947.02s)]
*  There's the kind of clubs where you travel, [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5948.46s)]
*  and you go on the road, and you go there. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5950.9s)]
*  Like the Denver Comedy Works, one of the best clubs [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5952.82s)]
*  in the world, or Nashville's, or Zany's rather, [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5955.099999999999s)]
*  in Nashville, which is one of the best in the world. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5958.62s)]
*  That one in Salt Lake, we did that. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5960.7s)]
*  Oh, yeah, Wise Guys in Salt Lake. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5962.0599999999995s)]
*  It's the shit. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5963.299999999999s)]
*  So you'd go there. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5964.0599999999995s)]
*  You'd do a weekend there. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5965.379999999999s)]
*  You'd do your stand up. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5966.7s)]
*  And then you go home. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5968.259999999999s)]
*  So you're the headliner. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5969.219999999999s)]
*  You bring a middle act, and you bring an opening act. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5970.7s)]
*  Or you use locals. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5973.099999999999s)]
*  So there's basically two people in front of you, [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5974.299999999999s)]
*  and then you, for the most part. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5976.259999999999s)]
*  Maybe one person. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5977.82s)]
*  But the point is, you're working with those people [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5978.62s)]
*  only. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5980.88s)]
*  So you know what you have to follow. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5981.96s)]
*  You know how good they are. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5984.36s)]
*  You know how good you are. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5985.72s)]
*  And you can kind of coast. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5986.84s)]
*  And some people kind of coast. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5988.24s)]
*  And they fall into this sort of trap of maintaining a level, [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5989.92s)]
*  but not getting better. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5996.4400000000005s)]
*  But the people that are forced into places [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5997.72s)]
*  like The Cellar in New York City, or The Comedy Store in LA, [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=5999.4800000000005s)]
*  or now The Mothership in Austin, they're doing sets, [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6003.84s)]
*  or they're following Dave Attell. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6006.68s)]
*  They're following Christa Stefano. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6010.08s)]
*  They're following Theo Vaughn. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6012.320000000001s)]
*  They're following assassins. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6013.92s)]
*  And it's just like these wild rooms where they're just [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6015.76s)]
*  filled with great comics. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6018.52s)]
*  Ron White's going up. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6019.68s)]
*  Roseanne's going up. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6020.6s)]
*  And there's this feeling in the air because of that, [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6021.76s)]
*  where everybody's super energized, [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6024.76s)]
*  and everybody's level goes up. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6026.4400000000005s)]
*  But everybody was influenced by the greats. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6028.16s)]
*  We have on the green room wall, we [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6030.92s)]
*  have Rodney Dangerfield's handwritten notes [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6034.200000000001s)]
*  for his last Tonight Show special. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6037.84s)]
*  So handwritten notes about all of his bits, [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6040.04s)]
*  and even the jokes he was going to tell when he sat on the panel. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6041.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's at my club. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6044.32s)]
*  It's framed. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6045.72s)]
*  Rodney's wife gave it to us when we opened the club. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6046.88s)]
*  It was an amazing, amazing gift. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6049.0s)]
*  And we framed it. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6050.64s)]
*  And I was heavily influenced by Rodney in a lot of ways. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6051.4400000000005s)]
*  But one way, he had this I don't give a fuck attitude that was, [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6055.72s)]
*  it was like everybody else was pretending. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6062.56s)]
*  But he really didn't give a fuck. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6065.52s)]
*  In his last days, Rodney would go on stage with a bathrobe on, naked. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6067.08s)]
*  So he was naked with slippers and a bathrobe [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6072.16s)]
*  and stand in front of a fucking arena and crush. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6075.8s)]
*  And I was there for that. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6079.44s)]
*  When I was a kid, I was working at Great Woods Center [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6080.68s)]
*  for the Performing Arts in Mansfield. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6083.76s)]
*  And it was an outdoor concert venue. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6085.6s)]
*  I got to see Bon Jovi there. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6087.68s)]
*  I got to see a bunch of artists there. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6089.88s)]
*  It was fun. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6092.16s)]
*  I saw Bill Cosby there. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6092.76s)]
*  You just bought a ticket just like anybody else? [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6094.04s)]
*  No, I was working. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6095.64s)]
*  That's right. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6096.92s)]
*  I was a security guard. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6097.4400000000005s)]
*  I heard the story. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6098.68s)]
*  It might have been on Hennessey's. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6099.6s)]
*  Oh, could be. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6102.72s)]
*  Could be, probably. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6103.96s)]
*  I've told it before. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6104.72s)]
*  But Rodney was backstage. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6105.8s)]
*  And I got a glimpse of him walking through the hallway with a bathrobe on. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6107.400000000001s)]
*  I'm like, this motherfucker's got a bathrobe on. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6111.040000000001s)]
*  I thought he was going to change. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6113.400000000001s)]
*  I thought he had a bathrobe. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6114.96s)]
*  And then he puts his suit on and goes on stage. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6116.040000000001s)]
*  Ha, can't catch a break. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6117.92s)]
*  God, classic. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6120.080000000001s)]
*  He was amazing, man. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6121.280000000001s)]
*  He was amazing. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6122.4800000000005s)]
*  No respect. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6123.8s)]
*  No respect at all. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6124.400000000001s)]
*  One liner is just bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6126.52s)]
*  And you've created this magical place here. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6129.16s)]
*  Yeah, what I was going to say about Rodney not giving a fuck, one of the things he did [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6132.360000000001s)]
*  give a fuck about was comedy. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6135.400000000001s)]
*  And the Rodney Dangerfield Young Comedians special was the most important special that [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6136.76s)]
*  a comic could get on back then. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6143.0s)]
*  And so many enormous careers were launched because of Rodney Dangerfield. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6144.84s)]
*  Because the Rodney Dangerfield special, we first met Dice Clay, Sam Kinison, Lenny Clark, [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6149.64s)]
*  Dom Irerra. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6155.28s)]
*  All on his special. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6156.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6157.88s)]
*  So many fucking great comics came out of those Rodney Dangerfield Young Comedians specials. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6159.759999999999s)]
*  Bill Hicks came out of that. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6165.0s)]
*  Robert Schimel came out of that. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6167.679999999999s)]
*  Great, great comics. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6169.96s)]
*  So if you saw the Rodney Dangerfield Young Comedians special, and then you saw that Robert [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6171.719999999999s)]
*  Schimel was going to be in your town soon, like holy shit. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6176.44s)]
*  And it was like the best thing that ever happened to these comics, these up and coming comics. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6180.08s)]
*  Because some of them were like, they were too dirty for the Tonight Show. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6185.48s)]
*  They couldn't do the MTV half hour comedy hour. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6190.0s)]
*  They wouldn't give you the full thing. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6192.32s)]
*  You're not going to get full Dice Clay from the half hour comedy hour. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6193.84s)]
*  You need to see him at the Rodney Dangerfield special. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6197.28s)]
*  And so he just launched everyone from that. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6200.08s)]
*  And I was always like, I need to do one of those. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6203.32s)]
*  I need to do like a Rodney Dangerfield kind of special. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6205.5199999999995s)]
*  So that's been your goal. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6209.12s)]
*  A Joe Rogan comedy special. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6210.12s)]
*  But what kind of happened is I've just kind of done it through the podcast. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6211.2s)]
*  So the podcast has become like a great launching pad to let people know about great comics. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6215.12s)]
*  Because if someone comes on here and I'm telling you, hey, this fucking guy is hilarious. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6220.56s)]
*  You've got to go see him. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6225.24s)]
*  People believe me. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6226.4400000000005s)]
*  OK, I wouldn't lie. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6227.320000000001s)]
*  Right. I'm telling you, because they make me laugh. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6228.96s)]
*  Yeah. And if they don't, I just fucking steer clear. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6230.8s)]
*  But then the club has been Bob and Weave. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6233.84s)]
*  But then the club has been an ancillary product of that, too, where it's even helping [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6239.400000000001s)]
*  even more because then you can have these guys in here. Right. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6244.56s)]
*  Yeah, that helps a lot. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6246.8s)]
*  All of it helps. It's all good. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6248.400000000001s)]
*  But having a club like that makes me really realize that that we we all are a part of [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6249.68s)]
*  like this hive mind of of our artists. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6258.0s)]
*  They're all like trying to be funny. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6262.240000000001s)]
*  Like everybody's like working really hard. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6264.0s)]
*  Everybody's writing new bits. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6266.240000000001s)]
*  They got Kill Tony where every Monday night, you know, guys like David Lucas and William [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6267.6s)]
*  Montgomery and Hans Kim to do one new minute every week. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6272.12s)]
*  So there's this like fucking buzz of energy in that place. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6275.8s)]
*  That's exciting. Yeah. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6280.0s)]
*  It's it's fucking wild. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6281.64s)]
*  All I know is I see the post and it's just like there's that FOMO type like, God, this [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6283.68s)]
*  looks incredible. This looks like how can I be part of it? [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6289.16s)]
*  You know, I'm out. Yeah, I know. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6292.92s)]
*  Just tonight. But the point is, like what you've created is just so special. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6294.5199999999995s)]
*  It's it's cool. Yeah. It's interesting. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6299.76s)]
*  It doesn't really seem real. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6302.04s)]
*  Does a why doesn't does a hunting need something like that? [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6303.2s)]
*  How would you do that? I don't know. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6307.6s)]
*  Expose. Well, how would you do that? [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6309.36s)]
*  You would have to have like what Jesse's doing. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6311.12s)]
*  How some sort of an academy. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6313.4800000000005s)]
*  Jesse. Yeah, Jesse, Jesse Griffith, the chef. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6315.36s)]
*  Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6319.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I guess the lift run shoot, but it's like we talked about having like a little. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6322.76s)]
*  I don't know, like a get together where you could have new hunters come in and kind of [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6329.16s)]
*  share knowledge and things like that. Yeah, fun. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6334.72s)]
*  It would be good if there was a way that they could learn where there was like real courses. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6336.8s)]
*  Yeah. And all the aspects of hunting, because I was very fortunate to become friends with you [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6342.36s)]
*  and to become friends with vanilla and guys like Ryan Callahan and Adam Green Tree, people that I [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6348.28s)]
*  can call and ask questions. Yeah. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6353.96s)]
*  People I could talk to, people that could you could steer me in a certain direction, like, hey, [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6355.5199999999995s)]
*  what do you think about this? [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6359.679999999999s)]
*  Like, hey, what happens when this happens? [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6361.12s)]
*  Hey, what is it? It's like a massive boost in my education. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6362.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And it just also being able to go actually into the woods with you. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6366.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's where we came up with this idea. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6371.24s)]
*  That's the hard part, because I mean, I am having a lift run shoot event in the end of July, [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6374.0s)]
*  but it's not when I go hunting. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6379.0s)]
*  It's so special to me. It's very different. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6381.36s)]
*  I mean, I'm only going to share it with people who I generally care about. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6383.52s)]
*  You know, I mean, I'm not saying I don't care about these people. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6386.52s)]
*  Yeah, I know what you mean. You can only go. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6388.400000000001s)]
*  There's only so many days. Right. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6389.92s)]

*  Unpack that. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6657.6s)]
*  Well, the reason why people get so mad is they don't feel like they're [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6659.120000000001s)]
*  getting what they deserve. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6662.64s)]
*  And they see unless there's some legitimate criticism, [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6664.12s)]
*  like unless someone realizes you're running a Ponzi scheme or something. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6666.88s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6669.72s)]

*  if all you're getting out of the experience of that person is negative, [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6675.200000000001s)]

*  It's you're looking at it in a way [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6691.24s)]
*  where you're trying to find negative, you're focusing on the negative. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6694.88s)]
*  You're not looking at like the overall top down picture of the positive things [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6698.84s)]
*  because you spread so much positivity. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6704.36s)]
*  You're all about hard work. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6707.48s)]
*  You're all about discipline. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6709.88s)]
*  And you're all about this passion that you have for bow hunting. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6712.16s)]
*  And this idea that somehow or here's the thought, right? [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6715.88s)]
*  There's one thought that I kind of understand where they're coming from. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6719.36s)]
*  And this thought is that putting all of this out on social media, [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6721.92s)]
*  you're you're kind of cheapening this experience [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6726.28s)]
*  that is so pure and so difficult to acquire and in a way kind of sacred. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6730.4s)]
*  And you're turning it into like, you know, [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6736.5199999999995s)]
*  fucking clickbait bullshit. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6740.639999999999s)]
*  You're turning it into selfies. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6743.679999999999s)]
*  You're turning it into like, look at me. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6746.76s)]
*  I'm amazing. Yeah. Commercialization is what they say. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6748.88s)]
*  Commercialization, but also a distortion of the thing itself. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6751.88s)]
*  You know, and I think there's some there's some validity to that. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6756.4400000000005s)]
*  And I know what they're saying when they're saying that. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6761.280000000001s)]
*  But it's a perspective thing. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6763.84s)]
*  I think if you just look at the overall person, [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6765.64s)]
*  what does the actual person stand for and what is that? [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6767.8s)]
*  What is the net positive effect of them posting about all this stuff? [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6769.72s)]
*  The net positive effect is inspiration. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6774.84s)]
*  And this is one thing that a lot of people have a hard time with. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6777.24s)]
*  They don't like the fact that you're inspiring and I'm inspiring [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6779.5599999999995s)]
*  more people to do this. Right. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6783.12s)]
*  And they think that these people are going to have realistic expectations [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6785.08s)]
*  based on the availability that you have to hunt and I have to hunt [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6788.76s)]
*  and they have to hunt on public land. And that's absolutely true. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6791.48s)]
*  It's absolutely true. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6794.08s)]
*  But this is my experience. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6796.44s)]
*  So if I can't talk about my experience [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6799.599999999999s)]
*  because I'm going to have a distorted version of this thing [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6802.16s)]
*  because it's the best version of this thing. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6806.4s)]
*  That means I shouldn't show you my cars either. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6809.36s)]
*  That means I shouldn't show you my comedy club like, yeah, [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6811.92s)]
*  I'm yeah, a lot of my life doesn't make any sense, [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6814.5199999999995s)]
*  including the places I get to hunt and the people I get to hunt with. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6817.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's not fair. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6819.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's not fair. Life's not fair. It's not fair. Right. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6820.88s)]
*  Yeah, not everybody can do it. But. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6823.36s)]
*  I used to be poor and I can do it. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6826.639999999999s)]
*  You can do it to other people can do it. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6828.5199999999995s)]
*  It's not an easy thing to acquire. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6830.12s)]
*  But if you focus on it, you can do it, too. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6832.4s)]
*  There's a lot of people out there that get to hunt in the places [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6834.599999999999s)]
*  that we get to hunt that. It's not the whole world. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6837.5599999999995s)]
*  It's not the whole public. And I understand that. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6840.28s)]
*  But it's, you know, as far as like the barrier to entry is not [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6842.599999999999s)]
*  the same barrier to entry as having a crazy car. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6846.2s)]
*  Here's what I've noticed is like, you know, I'm saying, I do. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6849.0s)]
*  I get that. But when you say that you were poor. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6852.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was poor and we've achieved this thing. Right. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6855.32s)]
*  What I've noticed in like with doing every person I've had on here, [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6859.599999999999s)]
*  probably every person you've had on my podcast and every person you've had, [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6863.24s)]
*  it's like what what is common about those guests is they have a passion [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6866.8s)]
*  for something. Yeah. And they've used it for a positive endeavor. They've. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6872.04s)]
*  They've overcome so much. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6878.84s)]
*  Like every guest I've talked to, they have this one thing [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6881.5199999999995s)]
*  that they've been obsessed with. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6884.4s)]
*  They wrote that obsession and passion to success. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6886.12s)]
*  So that's the message. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6889.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's the message. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6892.4s)]
*  What's your your whatever you're passionate about. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6893.44s)]
*  Yeah, that can elevate your entire life. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6895.84s)]
*  Yeah. I think the criticism that people have when it comes to social media [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6898.28s)]
*  hunting and the validity of it is that you're turning it into the same thing as. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6903.599999999999s)]
*  You know, posing in front of, you know, famous places for for likes. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6909.84s)]
*  You're turning it. You're kind of bastardizing it. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6916.5199999999995s)]
*  The commercializing of it. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6918.92s)]
*  I get what they're saying. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6921.16s)]
*  But there's also this thing that they're saying that I don't like, [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6922.280000000001s)]
*  where they're saying it's causing more people to want to go hunting. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6925.68s)]
*  It's causing more people to fill up the trailheads. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6929.12s)]
*  I guess those are the people that are going to vote to keep hunting legal. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6931.72s)]
*  Like you have to be careful about that. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6934.76s)]
*  Yeah. But you don't want it to become a small thing. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6936.4800000000005s)]
*  You want to become a bigger thing, even if it's harder to do. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6938.92s)]
*  And you have to go further and go to different places. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6942.0s)]
*  I think that adjustment is probably better than the adjustment [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6944.4400000000005s)]
*  of somehow or another people that don't know what this thing is, [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6948.0s)]
*  voting on it and making it illegal, because that's not outside [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6951.72s)]
*  the realm of possibility. No, no, no, no, not at all. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6955.16s)]
*  In some places of the world, that's the norm. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6957.72s)]
*  Well, and here's where that argument is a little bit. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6959.8s)]
*  I get it. I do get it, because when I would hunt the wilderness, [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6963.04s)]
*  I hated seeing a boot track. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6966.0s)]
*  So I get it. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6968.12s)]
*  I wouldn't even tell people my friends and family where I was hunting [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6969.52s)]
*  because I wanted to protect it. Right. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6973.08s)]
*  So I get it. I'm not I'm not saying they're wrong. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6975.28s)]
*  But where it kind of loses a little bit of it is [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6978.24s)]
*  when you're talking about a trailhead being being crowded. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6982.08s)]
*  So Oregon, where I'm from, is 60 percent public. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6985.56s)]
*  It's a lot of public land. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6989.04s)]
*  Alaska, 95 percent public. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6990.44s)]
*  Where most hunters are, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, back east. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6993.44s)]
*  Right. Most hunters. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6998.52s)]
*  So 300,000 hunter bow hunters are in Pennsylvania. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=6999.88s)]
*  They have a very small percentage of public land compared to Alaska. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7004.04s)]
*  What about Texas? Texas is one of the craziest ones. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7008.320000000001s)]
*  Texas has a million, I think a million bow hunters and five percent is public. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7010.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's nuts. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7015.56s)]
*  So, yeah, if we're talking public land, [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7016.64s)]
*  that's I think Oregon has 16,000 bow hunters. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7021.64s)]
*  It's not very many. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7026.4800000000005s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7028.04s)]
*  Texas is one million and 60 percent of Oregon is public. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7030.08s)]
*  So you're going to be able to find places to hunt. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7034.360000000001s)]
*  Montana, you know, that's where Steve's brother's from, [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7036.68s)]
*  and that's where his you know, he he he's very protective of Montana [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7040.72s)]
*  and talks about how there's not enough public land. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7045.28s)]
*  It's being it's being bought up by these. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7048.0s)]
*  What do they call the Hunt Trust? [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7050.84s)]
*  I think it's for land trust. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7054.16s)]
*  That's what it is. Land Trust, where they're where they're leasing out [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7055.52s)]
*  hunting rights. Well, if you look at Montana, [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7058.8s)]
*  most of private is down low because it's agriculture. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7062.5199999999995s)]
*  If you're talking month, if you're talking wilderness and mountains, [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7066.16s)]
*  that's public land. So where do you want to hunt? [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7069.24s)]
*  A land trust can't buy down on the private land. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7072.48s)]
*  That's cattle ranches. That's that's farmers trying to make money. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7075.5599999999995s)]
*  So go up into the wilderness, go hunt the mountains. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7079.12s)]
*  So where's the land trust purchasing so they can lease it out for hunters? [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7082.76s)]
*  Well, I know they're not purchasing. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7086.16s)]
*  That's not land trust in wilderness. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7087.8s)]
*  That's down on like they say, well, if a rancher isn't making money [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7089.48s)]
*  from cattle, he's going to sell it to people who want to do [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7094.5599999999995s)]
*  a hunting lease on it and sell out hunting rights instead. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7098.679999999999s)]
*  OK, well, that was private anyway. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7102.12s)]
*  Yeah, not only is it private anyway, but is it? [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7104.32s)]
*  So that seems that's a weird one. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7107.719999999999s)]
*  Like I get I get I get what he's saying. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7109.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, is he worried it's a slippery slope? [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7112.879999999999s)]
*  He his that eventually Montana could be something like what Texas is. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7115.599999999999s)]
*  He's saying that that the European [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7119.5199999999995s)]
*  hunting model of just the rich can hunt is going to be the United States. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7123.28s)]
*  That's what's possible. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7127.799999999999s)]
*  How with the public so much public land, the West is largely public. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7130.36s)]
*  But if it starts to creep in on that, if the private land starts [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7135.4s)]
*  to creep in on the public land, like if, say, let's just say [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7139.32s)]
*  I don't even know if this is legal, but let's say a state is horribly in debt. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7143.24s)]
*  Yeah. And they have an offer to sell off a chunk of private land. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7147.88s)]
*  States are always in public land, rather. Right. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7153.08s)]
*  They're always in debt. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7156.2s)]
*  Wasn't that someone's someone wanted to do that and they got in trouble in Utah [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7157.12s)]
*  and a bunch of people organized against him. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7161.719999999999s)]
*  There was like a representative who wanted to do that. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7163.799999999999s)]
*  I think so. That that was Chaffetz. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7166.2s)]
*  What's his name? Jason Jason Chaffetz. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7168.96s)]
*  Chaffetz. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7171.04s)]
*  Wasn't there a situation? [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7172.16s)]
*  I went and talked to him back in Washington about that. Yeah. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7173.28s)]
*  What was that? It was about there's a certain percentage of [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7175.92s)]
*  well, some of it was landlocked public land [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7180.8s)]
*  because there's public land, but you couldn't get to it. Right. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7183.24s)]
*  And then there was some [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7185.4800000000005s)]
*  a couple of million or a few million acres that were [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7188.84s)]
*  somehow into that where the public was didn't have access to it [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7193.12s)]
*  because of it was it was an argument between [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7196.2s)]
*  if the states manage it, but they can't do it, then federal takes it over. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7200.16s)]
*  And then it changes everything. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7205.32s)]
*  And states can never make it work money wise because they don't have the money. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7207.2s)]
*  Federal has more money. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7211.2s)]
*  So if it gets into the whole argument on timber management, [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7212.759999999999s)]
*  like they won't they won't go in and harvest timber [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7218.04s)]
*  because they're worried about politics because they won't harvest timber. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7221.28s)]
*  The fires burn hotter and are more devastating like in California. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7224.639999999999s)]
*  They're so worried about about the about politics. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7228.4s)]
*  Basically, the liberals throwing a fit about getting in there [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7232.88s)]
*  and managing the timber and doing selective cuts and things like that [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7235.8s)]
*  and cleaning up, which turns into fuel for wildfires, that they don't do any of it. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7239.68s)]
*  And that's what makes the fires burn hotter. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7245.0s)]
*  And wasn't that Trump's argument? [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7248.16s)]
*  He was saying that they're not managing their forest. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7250.16s)]
*  Like when California was having wildfires, [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7253.400000000001s)]
*  he was saying something about withholding funding. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7256.12s)]
*  Was there something like that? They were doing it wrong. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7259.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, what did he say? [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7261.599999999999s)]
*  Trump had some criticism about the way that California was managing. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7263.4s)]
*  He made that statement about the need to sweep the ground or something like that. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7266.44s)]
*  And everyone was like, what? Sweep the ground? [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7269.44s)]
*  Well, he's no way. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7271.8s)]
*  He just put bleach on it. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7274.5199999999995s)]
*  But that's when everyone, yeah, that made the joke. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7275.44s)]
*  No, it's it's clean. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7277.36s)]
*  It's salvage logging. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7279.4s)]
*  Just sweep it up. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7281.2s)]
*  So what happened? Beautiful, beautiful rakes. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7282.12s)]
*  No, what he's talking about, like if there is a fire, you got to clean the floor. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7285.44s)]
*  You got to clean your floors. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7289.36s)]
*  I see what he's saying. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7291.24s)]
*  No, if there is a fire and there's all that fuel there. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7291.92s)]
*  Right. Of course. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7295.84s)]
*  They can't get in there and haul it out. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7296.68s)]
*  But that's that's actual conservationist thinking. Right. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7298.2s)]
*  Right. You really do have to make sure that you have to manage it. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7301.72s)]
*  Fill with dry dead. You have to manage timber. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7304.68s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, that's all it's good. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7306.6s)]
*  And you have to manage wildlife. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7308.08s)]
*  Yeah. All those are those are uncomfortable things for some people. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7309.52s)]
*  Like you were talking about the amount of bears that were killing those calves. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7314.0s)]
*  They're starting to see it again in California. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7317.4800000000005s)]
*  I said, you got to clean your floors. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7319.68s)]
*  You got to clean your forests. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7321.8s)]
*  There are many, many years of leaves and broken trees. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7323.08s)]
*  And they're like so flammable. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7326.4400000000005s)]
*  You touch them and it goes up. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7329.52s)]
*  OK, first of all, you don't want to clean the leaves off the floor [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7331.12s)]
*  because that's compost. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7334.08s)]
*  Most of the time, some of the nutrients that actually go into the soil itself. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7336.04s)]
*  It comes from decayed leaves. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7339.52s)]
*  It's like a part of the ecosystem. Right. Right. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7340.84s)]
*  The leaves aren't up in the big timber timber country. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7343.04s)]
*  When I was in when I was looking for Bigfoot with Duncan Trussell, [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7346.08s)]
*  we were looking for Bigfoot. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7349.0s)]
*  Yeah. Television show that was awesome. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7350.04s)]
*  But we were in the Pacific Northwest. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7352.0s)]
*  I guess it was Mount Rainier. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7353.4800000000005s)]
*  Was that the one that's right above? [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7354.84s)]
*  It's in Washington. Washington. Yeah. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7356.88s)]
*  Right above Seattle. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7358.4800000000005s)]
*  So we were up there and we encountered a lot of elk. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7360.04s)]
*  It's elk everywhere up there. It's crazy. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7362.76s)]
*  I mean, just thick, just piles of elk shit everywhere you went. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7364.68s)]
*  But the floor was so quiet. Yeah. So quiet. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7368.0s)]
*  And if you're bow hunting, good luck, bitch. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7371.12s)]
*  You're basically shooting through a box of Q-tips. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7373.04s)]
*  Like there is no. Pretty thick. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7375.24s)]
*  There's no path. It's a jungle. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7376.88s)]
*  Right. So so that well, was it wet? [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7378.36s)]
*  Oh, my God. It's so wet. It rains constantly. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7381.5599999999995s)]
*  And you're just you're just walking through the most lush, green, [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7383.799999999999s)]
*  vibrant forest. There's so much fuel. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7389.28s)]
*  Yeah. For all those plants. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7392.5199999999995s)]
*  That's on the west side of the Cascades. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7394.44s)]
*  So on the east, it's dry. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7396.36s)]
*  Oh, interesting. Right. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7397.96s)]
*  And so when you got down to those fires, like in Paradise, California, [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7399.96s)]
*  that's dry country. Yeah. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7403.32s)]
*  So that if if you're not doing any salvage timber management down there, [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7404.92s)]
*  that's all fuel. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7409.08s)]
*  Do you see what's going on with Canada with the the fires? [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7410.0s)]
*  New York City is filled with smoke. Yeah, I know. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7412.64s)]
*  It's crazy. Yeah. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7414.96s)]
*  People took photos from New York City. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7416.96s)]
*  My daughter told me today she found on TikTok because that's where they learn [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7418.68s)]
*  everything that breathing the outside air in New York City is like smoking [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7421.24s)]
*  a half a packet cigarettes a day. Yeah. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7425.56s)]
*  Fucking a man. Yeah. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7428.12s)]
*  It's a there's out there up in Alberta. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7429.68s)]
*  There's fires. You know what they're saying? [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7432.32s)]
*  You know, you know what's hilarious? What? [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7433.76s)]
*  That masks aren't effective in protecting them. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7435.92s)]
*  Yeah. God, masks. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7438.4400000000005s)]
*  That even N95 masks for kids because they're not fitted properly. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7440.68s)]
*  Oh, you mean like air gets in? [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7444.72s)]
*  Why? When I see somebody in a mask, I want to punch them. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7446.320000000001s)]
*  I want to hug them. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7449.96s)]
*  That's a difference between you and me. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7451.16s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Hey, I was going to ask. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7452.56s)]
*  Oh, wait. OK, there's two things. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7455.04s)]
*  Sometimes I want to punch them. I know. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7456.6s)]
*  Two things. I don't want to punch them. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7458.64s)]
*  I want to let them know that I want to punch them. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7459.64s)]
*  I don't want to actually punch them. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7461.280000000001s)]
*  This has been like on a Ferris wheel. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7462.52s)]
*  I lost it and it came back around. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7464.6s)]
*  So two things. Now I forgot the one thing. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7466.280000000001s)]
*  The other thing was, you know how you don't like politics on here? [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7468.84s)]
*  Right. Right. Do you think in some ways [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7472.080000000001s)]
*  you have a responsibility? [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7476.200000000001s)]
*  No. To the people? [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7477.8s)]
*  No, they have. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7479.040000000001s)]
*  Everyone has a responsibility to do what the fuck they want to do. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7479.8s)]
*  Because, you know, some people would say you're the largest media in the world. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7483.4400000000005s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7488.400000000001s)]
*  That means some supply chain issue. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7489.280000000001s)]
*  That's what that is. You are the one's fucking up. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7491.44s)]
*  Well, that might be. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7494.4s)]
*  But OK, so if you are. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7496.12s)]
*  I think it's all nonsense. All of it. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7500.719999999999s)]
*  I know. I'll talk to some people and hear their version [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7502.759999999999s)]
*  of how to fix this nonsense. Yeah, I'm sure. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7505.799999999999s)]
*  And but I'm interested in what I'm interested in. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7508.28s)]
*  I know. And I have to kind of keep it that way. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7511.599999999999s)]
*  If I start thinking of this as a platform and a platform, [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7513.5599999999995s)]
*  we shut the fuck up. It's just me and Jamie and you. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7515.92s)]
*  That's why I want to. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7517.799999999999s)]
*  That's why I wanted your thoughts on it, [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7519.0s)]
*  because I've heard that before. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7520.44s)]
*  You know, because you shut the fuck up. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7521.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You just your responsibility is to be yourself. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7523.4s)]
*  We're just looking at things in this wild scale [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7525.719999999999s)]
*  that is sort of unprecedented. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7528.599999999999s)]
*  I think it was I think because people are frustrated with [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7530.36s)]
*  Robert Kennedy Jr. not having a platform. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7534.919999999999s)]
*  You know, like they're there. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7537.759999999999s)]
*  They don't want him to have get his message out because, you know, [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7539.32s)]
*  he's a threat because he makes a lot of sense. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7542.48s)]
*  So that's why the Democrats don't want to have a debate. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7545.5199999999995s)]
*  That's they're ignoring him. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7548.2s)]
*  That's what's wild. It's like they're pretending he doesn't exist. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7549.44s)]
*  Right. So that so people are saying they would love to see him. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7551.5599999999995s)]
*  And I heard you and Theo talking about it. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7555.5599999999995s)]
*  So I'm not trying to go over that again. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7557.04s)]
*  Yeah. But so it's just a weird time with media and platforms and politics, [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7558.599999999999s)]
*  especially because we've seen what suppression does. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7565.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's not good. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7568.44s)]
*  It's not good for anybody. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7570.08s)]
*  It's also it's not democratic. Right. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7571.36s)]
*  Like if they decide that they can not tell you about people [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7573.919999999999s)]
*  and not inform you about people that are very credible people, [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7578.64s)]
*  the guy's environmental attorney, guys, a Kennedy. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7581.8s)]
*  His dad was Robert F. Kennedy. He got assassinated. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7584.88s)]
*  He was there when he died in the hospital. He was 14. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7588.4400000000005s)]
*  His uncle was JFK. Yeah. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7591.320000000001s)]
*  He comes with perspective and he's a brilliant guy. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7593.6s)]
*  How valuable is that? It's very valuable. But [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7595.72s)]
*  this the system that's in power, they have like a coalition. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7599.320000000001s)]
*  They know what they're doing. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7604.320000000001s)]
*  They want to keep things exactly as they are now. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7605.4s)]
*  They want to keep control what they are now, [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7608.759999999999s)]
*  and especially the administration that's in currently. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7610.32s)]
*  If some new person comes in, all their jobs are at stake. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7613.04s)]
*  Yeah. Right. Everybody goes. Right. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7616.28s)]
*  Some new guy, if RFK Junior becomes the president, [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7618.12s)]
*  all those people working for Biden are gone. Right. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7621.28s)]
*  They know that they do their best to use all of their resources, [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7623.32s)]
*  all their connections with media. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7628.5199999999995s)]
*  All they're going to do their best to discredit him with hit pieces. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7630.4s)]
*  And maybe even they even believe the things that are in those hit pieces. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7634.5599999999995s)]
*  But at the end of the day, the only thing that changes it [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7638.16s)]
*  is if the media realizes that that guy's going to win. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7642.76s)]
*  And if that guy's going to win, you're going to have to deal [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7646.5199999999995s)]
*  with a whole new group of people once they get in there. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7648.8s)]
*  And so now it's time to play ball with the new people. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7651.88s)]
*  Start kissing ass. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7654.12s)]
*  Now it's time to play ball with the new people. Yeah. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7655.0s)]
*  But that's the that they're trying to stop that from happening. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7656.68s)]
*  They don't want that to happen. Right. But but you take a note. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7659.24s)]
*  Look at you. I know I'm not going to forget this. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7662.48s)]
*  Make it tick tock toe. He's playing against himself. I won. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7664.5199999999995s)]
*  But but yeah, so they're going to do all they can to suppress. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7668.36s)]
*  First, they'll suppress him. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7672.919999999999s)]
*  Then they'll, you know, try to. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7674.599999999999s)]
*  I talk to them, discredit him and do everything they can [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7677.16s)]
*  until they get to that point, the tipping point. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7681.0s)]
*  They're like, oh, shit. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7682.799999999999s)]
*  So that's that's what if Kennedy Junior and Tulsi Gabbard be hard to beat. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7684.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, man, I love Tulsi. That'd be hard to beat. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7687.679999999999s)]
*  She carried my fucking rock, dude. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7690.48s)]
*  She did. She's a beast. God. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7692.84s)]
*  And she only eats vegetables. We talked to her about that. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7694.56s)]
*  And what? She only eats vegetables. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7697.24s)]
*  Oh, I know. I wanted to take her honey. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7698.92s)]
*  And she said she's she's Hindu and she doesn't eat meat. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7701.6s)]
*  I was like, fuck, because she'd be a great hunter. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7704.56s)]
*  I know she would. She's so tough. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7707.68s)]
*  Someone's got to like explain to her. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7709.48s)]
*  This is nonsense. It's not a meat thing. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7711.96s)]
*  I know for you. She'd be even better. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7714.48s)]
*  Well, I mean, bear. Have a little bear. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7716.4s)]
*  She could have bear. Bear. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7719.12s)]
*  But Brony doesn't like that would hurt. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7720.08s)]
*  Listen, have some wild pig. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7721.84s)]
*  They got to get rid of them anyway. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7723.16s)]
*  Yeah. Be ashamed to not eat them. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7724.28s)]
*  But you're right. Tulsi, Robert F. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7726.5599999999995s)]
*  Kennedy. Come on. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7729.0s)]
*  That'd be tough to beat. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7731.64s)]
*  Yes. You know, I talked to I talked to her about that. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7732.92s)]
*  And, you know, on my podcast, and the problem is to run [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7736.8s)]
*  like to run for governor in a state. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7741.68s)]
*  Fifty million dollars to run for president. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7744.04s)]
*  Five hundred million is what you need. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7747.0s)]
*  It just it just keeps people out. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7749.84s)]
*  Yeah. So unless you have some private donor like an Elon Musk [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7751.76s)]
*  or your Trump, where is she going to get five hundred million? [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7755.04s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7757.92s)]
*  That's it. That's so wrong. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7759.320000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. So it's money is deciding everything. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7761.16s)]
*  Yep. And that's how they like it, because that way [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7764.84s)]
*  the people that have the money get to stay in power. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7767.16s)]
*  And it's but that that's the thing. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7769.52s)]
*  Like if the people are overwhelmingly supporting someone else, [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7772.04s)]
*  they'll shift. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7775.88s)]
*  They'll shift, too, because that's where the money is going to be. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7777.24s)]
*  It's just like hopefully the money there will be more ethically distributed. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7779.04s)]
*  They'll do it in a better way with someone. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7783.48s)]
*  That's what we all hope for. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7785.639999999999s)]
*  We hope for a president that has the character [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7786.719999999999s)]
*  and the moral foundation and the intellect to to realize a better way [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7790.96s)]
*  of managing this and also a way of uniting people and this this divide [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7795.679999999999s)]
*  that happened during this country. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7802.24s)]
*  It was first of all, it was Trump supporters. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7804.28s)]
*  Last election. Yeah. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7806.8s)]
*  Yeah. Trump supporters against the the the Democrats, [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7807.5599999999995s)]
*  because it really wasn't Biden. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7810.639999999999s)]
*  It was just Democrats winning. It was someone else winning. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7811.84s)]
*  And then it was vaccinated people against unvaccinated people. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7814.28s)]
*  This crazy divide. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7817.24s)]
*  We saw people that are just so scared of this virus [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7819.12s)]
*  that they were willing to cast aside their humanity [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7822.84s)]
*  and call people that were skeptical of the vaccine, call them like [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7826.2s)]
*  call them plague rats. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7830.759999999999s)]
*  I saw people call people wild shit, people that I knew. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7832.36s)]
*  Yeah. And then what is wrong with you? [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7835.4s)]
*  You you follow Eddie Bravo, right? [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7837.96s)]
*  Oh, my God. He's one of my best friends. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7840.32s)]
*  I know. I know. But so he put up a video the other day. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7841.88s)]
*  And it's like this compilation of this message that mainstream media had about Kofi. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7845.36s)]
*  Oh, yeah. No one's safe. No one's safe. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7850.88s)]
*  No. Yeah. Over and over and over. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7852.599999999999s)]
*  And then everybody then you'll never get it. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7854.799999999999s)]
*  You'll never get sick. You'll never die. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7857.16s)]
*  And then they all get it. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7858.679999999999s)]
*  And it's like this whole timeline we see that lying and [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7859.84s)]
*  and selling this fear the whole time and still never admitting it. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7863.56s)]
*  Well, it's a narrative. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7867.52s)]
*  They were given a narrative and they were told that this is the narrative [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7868.6s)]
*  that you're supposed to relay on how is that different than some? [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7871.4800000000005s)]
*  It's not some messed up country with, you know, some third world country. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7874.64s)]
*  It's not. But they thought they could get away with doing it in this case [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7879.52s)]
*  because of a pandemic, because there's an emergency. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7883.2s)]
*  Yeah. And so that's why you have to be very careful about giving up [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7886.72s)]
*  any powers to the government during an emergency, because they'll capitalize on that. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7889.64s)]
*  They're not stupid. They know this is an opportunity. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7893.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. They can clamp down on you. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7896.08s)]
*  You see that thing about the World Health Organization in the EU? [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7897.96s)]
*  They're this vaccine passport system that they've devised. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7902.0s)]
*  You see that? I retweeted it. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7905.4800000000005s)]
*  People are freaking out about this. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7908.6s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's just you don't give people power. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7910.200000000001s)]
*  Don't give people power to do things they couldn't do before [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7913.4400000000005s)]
*  because they're going to keep it and they're going to expand. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7915.64s)]
*  And if you don't fucking hold the line and you think it's a good thing to give in [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7917.84s)]
*  because we all have to be safe, like, oh, my God, if you got to be safe, [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7921.64s)]
*  then just tell people about it and the smart people will take it if it's really safe. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7925.84s)]
*  But if you make them take it, then you can make them do things. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7929.64s)]
*  If you make them do things and they don't want to do things, [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7932.68s)]
*  then you get to do things to them. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7934.88s)]
*  You get to take away their money, take away the job, take away their ability to travel. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7936.16s)]
*  Don't give into that. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7940.0s)]
*  You can't give into that because you're giving that power to other human beings [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7940.92s)]
*  that you might not agree with and you might not trust their judgment. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7945.320000000001s)]
*  And just because they won an election, that means they're smarter than you [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7949.08s)]
*  and they can sense what's really going on better than you. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7952.64s)]
*  And maybe they're compromised by money. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7954.84s)]
*  And maybe it's clear that they're compromised by money. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7956.88s)]
*  Maybe they're in a whole party that's compromised by money. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7959.360000000001s)]
*  It's in cahoots with a media organization that's compromised by money. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7961.88s)]
*  And they all spit out the same narrative. Right. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7965.64s)]
*  And they can now tell you, you can't travel if you don't agree. I know. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7967.96s)]
*  They don't have to be right. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7972.0s)]
*  And they don't have to debate it openly. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7973.4s)]
*  They don't have to have a consensus amongst all the intellectuals [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7976.28s)]
*  where they can do it anonymously, where they don't have any fear of repercussions [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7980.839999999999s)]
*  of their career, which is a lot of people during this whole thing. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7985.28s)]
*  They didn't want to speak out about any of it. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7988.4s)]
*  And the people that did got attacked and they got attacked directly by the government. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7990.4s)]
*  There's like real clear organization involved in going after certain scientists [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=7994.5199999999995s)]
*  that had a specific narrative, certain scientists that weren't toeing the line. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8000.16s)]
*  Yeah. You had them on here. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8003.92s)]
*  Yeah. But not just those guys. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8005.44s)]
*  There was a lot of other guys, too. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8006.84s)]
*  There's the people from the Great Barrington Degradation. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8008.44s)]
*  World Health Organization, World Health Organization, Director General [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8011.68s)]
*  Tedros Adnan. Oh, boy. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8016.76s)]
*  Yeah. Gibrasis announced digital immunization vaccine certificates, [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8020.32s)]
*  which will be required to participate in society. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8025.36s)]
*  So let's do this. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8028.72s)]
*  While the emergency phase of the COVID-19 pandemic is now over, [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8029.68s)]
*  investments in digital infrastructure remain an important resource [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8035.04s)]
*  for health systems and for economies and societies at large. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8039.2s)]
*  Like many countries, the European Union made significant investments [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8045.76s)]
*  in COVID-19 certificates to help people move around [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8050.400000000001s)]
*  as safely as possible during the pandemic. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8054.16s)]
*  The European Union certification system was used by all 27 EU member states [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8057.76s)]
*  and more than 50 other countries. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8064.52s)]
*  Building on the success of the EU system, [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8068.04s)]
*  WHO is proud today to launch the Global Digital Health Certification Network. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8071.72s)]
*  God. Thank you so much to European Union [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8079.12s)]
*  for the excellent certification system that you have. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8082.280000000001s)]
*  Here's the problem. Stop that for a second. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8086.12s)]
*  It didn't work. No. Here's the problem. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8088.400000000001s)]
*  It's not even an effective vaccine. Right. Right. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8090.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, maybe it saved lives in the beginning. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8092.96s)]
*  But we read this study about from the Cleveland Clinic the other day [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8095.4800000000005s)]
*  that was saying that overall in the Cleveland Clinic from the health workers, [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8098.200000000001s)]
*  when they did a survey of them, the ones who got vaccinated the most [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8102.200000000001s)]
*  got COVID the most. Right. Which is crazy. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8105.76s)]
*  Yeah. So it's not even like it just stops it dead in its tracks, [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8108.84s)]
*  like they were saying in the beginning of the pandemic. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8111.72s)]
*  And yet they're still trying to implement this digital system [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8113.68s)]
*  where you have to take this medicine that they've showed didn't work that good. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8117.6s)]
*  You know what it is, though? [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8122.6s)]
*  So he said, based on the success of whatever that was. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8123.52s)]
*  Yeah. What success? [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8127.4800000000005s)]
*  So it reminds me of Biden getting on there right now. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8129.240000000001s)]
*  He's making posts every day about how successful they've been [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8132.08s)]
*  and the most jobs in the history of the presidency of the United States. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8136.12s)]
*  And economy is coming back better. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8140.240000000001s)]
*  It's like. It's gaslighting. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8142.16s)]
*  It's just 100 percent a lie. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8144.4400000000005s)]
*  It's just gaslighting. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8146.4800000000005s)]
*  But also, they know it's not true for them to do this. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8147.88s)]
*  This is what everybody was worried about. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8151.4s)]
*  Everybody was worried about some global system where you have to opt into it. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8153.08s)]
*  You can't travel unless you do. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8156.68s)]
*  But he's worried about that. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8158.28s)]
*  But he's saying on the heels of the success. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8159.4400000000005s)]
*  That's so crazy. Yeah. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8161.36s)]
*  It's so crazy because people are furious. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8162.76s)]
*  People that took the vaccine and still got COVID and got very sick [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8165.4s)]
*  are furious. They got lied to. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8169.36s)]
*  Well, and the cancer in young adults is skyrocketing. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8170.88s)]
*  The cancer numbers based on the vaccine, apparently. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8174.72s)]
*  I don't know if that's true. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8178.400000000001s)]
*  I don't know what the studies say. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8179.400000000001s)]
*  And I don't know if anybody's doing studies, unfortunately. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8180.72s)]
*  Yeah. But I don't know. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8183.24s)]
*  You know, that's that correlation equals causation thing. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8185.2s)]
*  But it's something to be concerned with. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8187.4800000000005s)]
*  The uptick in just deaths is a weird thing to be concerned with. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8188.88s)]
*  All cause mortality is up. Right. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8195.880000000001s)]
*  Which is weird. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8198.08s)]
*  Well, people want to attribute that to different things. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8199.16s)]
*  Oh, people got they were drinking a lot during the pandemic. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8201.68s)]
*  Maybe. Yeah, maybe they were. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8204.36s)]
*  But but also another thing happened to remember that other thing. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8205.92s)]
*  Well, everybody got to take a shot. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8208.76s)]
*  Like, how about that? How about no. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8209.96s)]
*  Why is no one considering that? Right. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8211.68s)]
*  Like no one who's in these mainstream news organizations [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8213.44s)]
*  is looking over these numbers and saying, do you have to be concerned [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8217.32s)]
*  if you've had a vaccine injury? Do you have to be concerned? [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8220.88s)]
*  Have you had an adverse reaction? [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8223.88s)]
*  Do you hide those numbers? [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8225.64s)]
*  They're not they're not trying to seek them out. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8227.080000000002s)]
*  That's for sure. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8229.36s)]
*  They're not trying to ask people to come forward if you have. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8230.28s)]
*  Yeah. And we need to know the real numbers. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8232.960000000001s)]
*  They're not running like some sort of a wide wouldn't you think they would do that? [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8234.52s)]
*  Yeah. If you're going to do something, if you cared about society, like you say. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8237.6s)]
*  Right. If you weren't in cahoots with an organization that could lose money. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8240.880000000001s)]
*  Right. Some of these results wouldn't you do that? [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8244.52s)]
*  You probably would. You should do that. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8247.0s)]
*  That we should know. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8248.800000000001s)]
*  And they should know the pharmaceutical drug company should know. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8249.76s)]
*  They should. Everyone should know. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8252.04s)]
*  Like, what's the real result of this? [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8253.2s)]
*  And if it's positive, it's positive. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8255.320000000002s)]
*  It's a small amount of people that have side effects. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8256.92s)]
*  Great. OK. Let us know. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8259.16s)]
*  But this is there's never been a time ever in our country [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8260.4s)]
*  where this was mandated on adults, where adults were told that they had to take [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8264.119999999999s)]
*  a very specific medication in order to do things like go to work. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8269.08s)]
*  That's crazy, especially experimental one with no long term data. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8273.0s)]
*  Yeah. And one that was just rolled out for the whole world. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8277.16s)]
*  Very happy I didn't take it. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8282.439999999999s)]
*  Well, it was also watching the machine come after people. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8284.2s)]
*  Yeah. Didn't take it and come after people like me who didn't take and got better quick. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8288.6s)]
*  Well, OK. So this is like [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8293.36s)]
*  I was going to ask you before yesterday, where was Tucker Carlson? [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8297.12s)]
*  Because it seems like he just disappeared. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8300.6s)]
*  I was like, did they kill him? Is he gone? [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8302.24s)]
*  But Twitter show. Yeah. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8304.12s)]
*  But then he made a show. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8305.28s)]
*  So I was like, that screwed up my question to you, because I was like, have you heard? [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8306.32s)]
*  I never seen anybody disappear off the face of the earth like Tucker did. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8310.52s)]
*  Until he. Well, I think he probably had to get his legal ducks in a row. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8313.56s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's there's a big difference between like leaving, [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8317.68s)]
*  you know, a sitcom or something. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8322.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And leaving Fox News when you're the number one guy. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8325.0s)]
*  Yeah. And there's all sorts of speculation about why. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8328.0s)]
*  Why would they get rid of the number one guy? Yeah. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8331.96s)]
*  But that doesn't make any sense. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8334.439999999999s)]
*  Business wise, what is going on? [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8335.439999999999s)]
*  Unless the number one guy's got a body in his basement. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8336.56s)]
*  Yeah. Hey, this is going to come out. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8338.6s)]
*  I mean, he was gone, though. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8340.24s)]
*  I mean, there was no I've never seen anybody just disappear. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8341.92s)]
*  And then he made a couple of videos, made a short video right afterwards [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8345.04s)]
*  when they were attacking. Yeah. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8348.68s)]
*  And then it's like a month, though. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8349.72s)]
*  They did a thing with Twitter. Right. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8351.56s)]
*  Yeah. Just recently. Yeah. It's. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8354.52s)]
*  And did you see the views it got? Yeah. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8358.6s)]
*  Crazy numbers. 68 million crazy numbers. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8360.16s)]
*  And it's going to it's going to be the case. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8362.76s)]
*  Like they've by trying to silence that guy, they've made him gigantic. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8364.44s)]
*  He's bigger than he's ever been. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8368.52s)]
*  OK, so then that led this leading me to my other. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8369.64s)]
*  Thank you for that. Because so they tried to silence him. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8372.88s)]
*  They tried to silence you. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8377.08s)]
*  The White House mentioned you. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8379.119999999999s)]
*  So how how do people like you and Tucker [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8381.039999999999s)]
*  beat the system in that regard and become uncancellable? [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8384.88s)]
*  Well, there's not uncancellable. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8389.16s)]

*  That's just what they're doing. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8394.64s)]
*  They're trying to discredit people that they think are a threat. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8395.68s)]
*  And they have a very specific narrative. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8398.88s)]
*  The White House is there. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8400.4s)]
*  I mean, you see how that Peter Doocy guy gets into it [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8401.199999999999s)]

*  It was just a thing. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8461.16s)]
*  They had a narrative. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8462.08s)]
*  And this narrative was you got to get vaccinated. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8462.92s)]

*  You have to figure out a way. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8567.68s)]
*  Like if you want to release a medication, you you [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8568.640000000001s)]
*  you have to have access to the actual data, not the data as interpreted [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8572.2s)]
*  by the scientists that have made it. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8576.0s)]
*  And that's one of the things that we learned about the whole process [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8577.52s)]
*  of peer review when it comes to a lot of these pharmaceutical drugs. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8581.0s)]
*  That's how they sneak them in, because they make a whole bunch of studies. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8583.68s)]
*  Yeah. And they just gear the study to make sure that they get the results [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8586.44s)]
*  they want. And that's the one they release. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8591.880000000001s)]
*  And all the ones that show that it does harm, they get rid of those studies. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8593.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And they bury them. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8596.32s)]
*  We don't have access to it. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8597.48s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8598.52s)]
*  And the only way that that's possible is through corruption. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8600.16s)]
*  The only way that's possible is through money, because if we're really concerned [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8603.56s)]
*  about the the the human beings that are having to take this medication, [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8607.119999999999s)]
*  there should be a completely independent body [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8611.359999999999s)]
*  that does all these examinations. Third party. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8614.4s)]
*  I mean, but I mean, completely independent. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8616.52s)]
*  Don't you do it with your supplements? [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8618.6s)]
*  Yes, we did. Blind study. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8620.56s)]
*  We well, not just that. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8621.92s)]
*  We actually sent them off to third party. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8623.24s)]
*  We had to do that because we found out early on [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8625.8s)]
*  when we were making AlphaBrain that when we would make our supplements, [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8628.56s)]
*  whether it was AlphaBrain or ShroomTechs board, [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8632.88s)]
*  I forget which one it was, but we had sent it out. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8636.32s)]
*  And then we did a third party study. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8638.84s)]
*  We found vitamins that were in there that weren't in the original formula. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8641.08s)]
*  And it was just trace amounts. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8645.64s)]
*  And we realized that they were using the same bins for AlphaBrain [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8647.519999999999s)]
*  that they maybe were using for like vitamin B12 or this and that. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8651.68s)]
*  So you're getting like contaminated stuff. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8654.68s)]
*  So you have to realize, OK, well, now we're dealing with a irreparable vendor. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8656.24s)]
*  Vendor. They're not doing the right thing. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8659.84s)]
*  So now we have to switch switch people that make it. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8660.960000000001s)]
*  We're not vendor manufacturers. We have to switch manufacturers. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8663.2s)]
*  Yeah. So we had to do that. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8665.880000000001s)]
*  And we had to we had it was like a trial and error thing. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8667.16s)]
*  We have to realize that. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8670.36s)]
*  So if you're that committed for supplements, yeah. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8671.36s)]
*  More committed than for medicine. It's crazy. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8674.32s)]
*  It's what we did it because we wanted to know. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8677.52s)]
*  Like in the beginning, like a lot of people were saying that, [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8679.52s)]
*  like AlphaBrain was snake oil. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8681.64s)]
*  And I was like, listen, we should fund a study. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8683.0s)]
*  We should fund a study. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8685.32s)]
*  So we funded a study for the Boston Center of Memory. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8686.16s)]
*  We did a pilot study and then we did another study. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8688.32s)]
*  And it showed all sorts of positive increases in verbal memory. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8690.52s)]
*  It's about alpha flow state reaction time. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8695.28s)]
*  There was good solid data that showed in actually like half the dose that I take [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8698.6s)]
*  when I take AlphaBrain, there was positive results. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8703.4s)]
*  And so that was very reassuring because I'm like, [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8706.08s)]
*  I can't I don't believe this is a placebo. Yeah. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8708.4s)]
*  Because it works too well. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8710.28s)]
*  And there's too much anecdotal evidence. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8711.28s)]
*  There's too much evidence about some of the ingredients. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8712.72s)]
*  And when you put them together synergistically, [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8715.039999999999s)]
*  it only makes sense that it would work better. It does. That's beautiful. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8716.72s)]
*  I just want that same type of commitment to medicine. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8720.16s)]
*  See, like the thing is the FDA with supplements, it's just kind of squirrely. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8723.519999999999s)]
*  You don't have to do that. It's real squirrely. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8727.4s)]
*  Supplements are squirrely, you know, [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8730.439999999999s)]
*  because you there's not a lot of regulation when it comes to like vitamin [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8732.679999999998s)]
*  supplements. Part of me thinks that's good because there's companies like pure [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8736.119999999999s)]
*  encapsulations, right? It has a phenomenal reputation. They make the best stuff. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8740.48s)]
*  They make. And so when I see pure encapsulations, it sells whatever, [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8744.64s)]
*  various supplements, I tend to lean towards buying them because I know that's [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8748.8s)]
*  a really great brand, but you can buy some shady shit. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8752.92s)]
*  It's made somewhere that has like half the efficacy. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8756.4s)]
*  Like I know some guys who did some third party tests on some supplements and they [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8759.6s)]
*  found it was like 25% what it was supposed to be in terms of dosage and 25% [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8764.08s)]
*  you know, active ingredients. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8770.0s)]
*  So it's like you got to get it from people that you trust. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8771.8s)]
*  But the problem is along the way people are going to get fucked and people do. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8775.2s)]
*  And it happens with UFC fighters. They get tainted supplements. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8777.88s)]
*  It happens all the time or used to happen all the time. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8780.92s)]
*  The guys became more careful. But if you go to USADA's website, [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8783.96s)]
*  when they show for the athletes, [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8787.76s)]
*  they have a list of supplements that you should avoid because they've been [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8789.32s)]
*  determined to have illegal substances. It's a fucking shit load. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8792.84s)]
*  How many of them are on the USADA website? It was a shit load, right? [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8798.039999999999s)]
*  It was like just label after label after label. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8802.279999999999s)]
*  So it's unregulated. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8806.08s)]
*  I just want that same same whole of testing for what they're pushing to [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8807.279999999999s)]
*  society. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8811.68s)]
*  Well they should want to do it just like we wanted to do it for AlphaBrain. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8812.32s)]
*  But the problem is if they wanted to do it and they have all this money invested [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8815.68s)]
*  in it and it turns out that that thing is not as effective as they've been [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8818.72s)]
*  advertising, what do they do now? [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8821.44s)]
*  Well, what we think they do is they fund studies that make it look like it's [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8823.76s)]
*  more effective than it is, [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8828.0s)]
*  or they gear the study to make it look like it's more effective than it is in a [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8829.48s)]
*  very particular way. And then they release that. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8834.0s)]
*  And then they come up with justification and that's what they did with Vioxx. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8836.32s)]
*  And there's a paper trail. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8840.04s)]
*  You can see how they coordinated this and how they knew. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8841.04s)]
*  They even said, we know there's going to be people going to have some problems, [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8844.560000000001s)]
*  but we're going to do very well with this. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8847.52s)]
*  Which is a crazy thing to say when you're talking about people's lives. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8849.44s)]
*  It's a business model. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8852.4s)]
*  But it's what that business is. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8853.36s)]
*  If you're in the business of being a vampire and I'm like, [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8855.16s)]
*  why aren't you growing flowers? Because he's a fucking vampire. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8857.44s)]
*  Like wolves are in the business of being wolves. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8860.0s)]
*  And those CEOs that are just in the business of making the most money possible, [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8862.199999999999s)]
*  when they get access to the kind of loot that they made during the pandemic, [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8866.72s)]
*  they're addicted to that now. That's the new thing. Wasn't it like, [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8870.28s)]
*  wasn't it something crazy? [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8873.96s)]
*  Like 40 new billionaires were made during the pandemic. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8875.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8877.8s)]
*  Yeah. Why? [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8878.08s)]
*  They were ballin'. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8879.32s)]
*  They're ballin'. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8880.039999999999s)]
*  So that's their business. That's what they do. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8881.44s)]
*  They're going to continue doing what they do if you allow them to do it that way. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8884.12s)]
*  Right. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8887.08s)]
*  It doesn't mean they shouldn't be in business. Of course they should be in business. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8887.52s)]
*  They make dick pills. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8890.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8891.640000000001s)]
*  They make all kinds of good stuff. They make diabetes medication. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8892.0s)]
*  I love dick pills. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8894.68s)]
*  Pandemic creates new billionaires every 30 hours. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8895.880000000001s)]
*  Now a million people could fall into extreme poverty at the same rate in 2022. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8898.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8903.960000000001s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8904.240000000002s)]
*  573 people became a billionaire. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8904.76s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8906.92s)]
*  I thought they were just talking about the United States. Is that the world in the world? [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8907.880000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8910.960000000001s)]
*  That can't be in the United States. We have 573 billionaires. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8911.52s)]
*  Geez. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8914.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. They might come after us if that's true. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8916.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8919.56s)]
*  It's nerve wracking, man, because the people that have that kind of money and that kind of power, [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8919.92s)]
*  they want to maintain that position and they want to maintain that influence over people. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8924.0s)]
*  And the best way to maintain it is to like tighten down on what people are allowed to do. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8927.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8931.2s)]
*  Where they have to comply. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8931.4s)]
*  I mean, the CEO of Pfizer, there was a famous speech where he's giving, [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8933.08s)]
*  he was talking about a pill that you would have to take that sends off a signal to show that you've taken it. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8936.800000000001s)]
*  And he says, imagine the compliance. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8944.64s)]
*  This is what he says. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8948.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8948.880000000001s)]
*  Have you seen him say that? [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8949.24s)]
*  No. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8950.16s)]
*  Let's find that, find where he says that. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8950.72s)]
*  Because it's so bonkers, like compliance. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8952.48s)]
*  Like, oh God. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8955.800000000001s)]
*  You know, comply. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8957.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8960.2s)]
*  You're making people go, so you force that word, that term, just the thought process behind that statement. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8960.48s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8966.32s)]
*  Encourage would be better. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8966.92s)]
*  Comply like you have no choice. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8968.8s)]
*  Here it says, edited to cut important context. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8972.64s)]
*  CEO Albert Borah explains. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8976.6s)]
*  So what is the actual? [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8979.24s)]
*  But it's OK. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8981.64s)]
*  Says the video discussing ingestible pills with sensors has gone viral, falsely presented as an interview from 2022 and edited to cut out important context. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8983.2s)]
*  One Twitter user shared the clip on May 20 here commenting, [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8992.640000000001s)]
*  Pfizer CEO Albert Borla explains Pfizer's new tech to Davos crowd, ingestible pills, a pill with a tiny chip to send a wireless signal to relevant authorities when the pharmaceutical has been digested. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=8996.320000000002s)]
*  Imagine the compliance, he says. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9005.92s)]
*  Now, is that really what he said? [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9007.52s)]
*  See. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9009.240000000002s)]
*  So what does he really say? [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9010.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's there's. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9011.6s)]
*  What's cut out if he says that? [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9012.400000000001s)]
*  See, this is one of those things where you got to wonder if they're trying to gaslight you with the headline. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9014.92s)]
*  He commented on biological sensors during a conversation on general technological advances in health care and pharmaceuticals. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9019.640000000001s)]
*  So what does he said in response to a question from the audience? [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9025.880000000001s)]
*  Ideas to engage patient. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9029.16s)]
*  He calls the research and field fascinating. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9030.68s)]
*  He says that there's already a pill approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9033.08s)]
*  He moves on to describe this pill and where the clip version seen on social media begins and he later concludes. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9036.36s)]
*  But of course, there will be an initial cost and someone needs to invest. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9041.720000000001s)]
*  Bordler was not talking about a Pfizer drug or technology, rather, he was describing Abilify MySight, a drug with a digital ingestion traction system. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9045.12s)]
*  Right. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9052.880000000001s)]
*  So that is OK for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute treatment of manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar, bipolar one disorder and for use as an add on treatment for depression in adults. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9054.12s)]
*  So he was talking about a different pill, but he was talking about a pill with a sensor. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9065.68s)]
*  But the point is that is the same thing. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9069.560000000001s)]
*  That is true. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9071.400000000001s)]
*  So they can say, well, it's for this schizophrenia or manic. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9072.28s)]
*  So that's why they that's how they got it approved. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9075.560000000001s)]
*  But now it's out there. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9078.560000000001s)]
*  Right. Well, now it's an actual technology. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9079.880000000001s)]
*  And if they can mandate a medication that you have to take for something else, they make it sound good by, oh, that maybe that would help those people. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9081.800000000001s)]
*  But now it can be used on everybody. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9090.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9091.800000000001s)]
*  So here it says that. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9093.12s)]
*  So it basically is a biological chip that is in the tablet. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9094.640000000001s)]
*  And once you take the tablet and dissolves in your stomach, it sends a signal that you took the tablet. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9098.400000000001s)]
*  So imagine the applications of that compliance. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9102.0s)]
*  So did he say, imagine the applications of that compliance? [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9107.68s)]
*  And then they edit it to say, imagine the compliance. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9111.68s)]
*  Let's see him say it. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9115.32s)]
*  Here's here's the video. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9116.68s)]
*  Yeah, let's play the video. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9118.92s)]
*  And then let's play the video. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9119.92s)]
*  It would be this one. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9121.52s)]
*  It is basically biological chip that it is in the tablet. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9122.720000000001s)]
*  And once you take the tablet and dissolves into your stomach, it sends a signal that you took the tablet. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9127.2s)]
*  So imagine the applications of that compliance. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9133.24s)]
*  The insurance companies to know that the medicines that patients should take, they do take them. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9137.04s)]
*  It is fascinating what happens in in the medical system. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9142.84s)]
*  That doesn't comfort me. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9147.28s)]
*  If that's what you really said. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9149.2s)]
*  But he's saying, so if you have a schizophrenic patient, right, and they have to take it, they to know that they did or didn't take their medicine like they're supposed to. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9150.720000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9158.6s)]
*  But yeah, you could use that now on anything then you use anything. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9159.6s)]
*  Once they once they get it down, the whatever proved, then it's there. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9162.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9167.12s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9168.12s)]
*  And once it's been applied before, they can apply it to other things. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9169.12s)]
*  And then they can use it to take the medicine. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9171.28s)]
*  And once it's been applied before, they can apply it to other things. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9174.48s)]
*  And if they can mandate that everybody takes a medication, they have it. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9177.119999999999s)]
*  For health and safety. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9180.359999999999s)]
*  Especially if you have an application. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9181.359999999999s)]
*  Now, if you have an application, this World Health Organization digital passport, it sends a signal to your passport. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9182.6s)]
*  And if you don't, you're not going anywhere. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9188.24s)]
*  And they just say it's for health and safety. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9190.24s)]
*  It's all bonkers. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9192.08s)]
*  And the fucking headline that they had to that is like, yeah, that's that thing that they do. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9193.56s)]
*  The gaslighting thing. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9198.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9199.84s)]
*  We were reading this thing about Al Pacino. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9200.52s)]
*  There's this whole article and the type of article is Al Pacino feels like the reports are that Al Pacino felt like the girl hoodwinked him and this and that. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9202.480000000001s)]
*  And then below that in small letters after we talked to him, that's not true. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9212.04s)]
*  So the head. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9217.76s)]
*  So look at this. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9218.76s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9219.44s)]
*  Check out this fucking here. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9220.36s)]
*  We'll go back. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9222.960000000001s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9223.84s)]
*  So this is a really special coming at this time. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9225.560000000001s)]
*  Al Pacino, 83, breaks silence to celebrate 29 year old girlfriend's pregnancy after claims he demanded a paternity test because she hoodwinked him. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9227.96s)]
*  The actor revealed he and his girlfriend, Nur Al Fala, were expecting last week. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9236.039999999999s)]
*  Initial reports claim that Al was not pleased over the news. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9241.56s)]
*  Sources told Daily Mail that wasn't true, which he has now confirmed. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9245.279999999999s)]
*  Then why is it? [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9249.88s)]
*  So he's confirmed it's not true. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9250.48s)]
*  It's still in the headline. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9251.96s)]
*  Right. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9252.8s)]
*  That's in little tiny letters. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9253.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9254.72s)]
*  Below the big headline that says. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9255.0s)]
*  Break silence to celebrate 29 year old girlfriend's pregnancy after claims that he demanded paternity test because she hoodwinked him. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9259.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9266.84s)]
*  Claims. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9267.16s)]
*  Claims. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9268.84s)]
*  By who? [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9270.32s)]
*  But that's a headline. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9271.64s)]
*  So they're allowed to do that, just like they were allowed in that last headline. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9272.4s)]
*  That's what drives me crazy. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9275.28s)]
*  So what was the last headline? [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9276.72s)]
*  Go back. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9278.12s)]
*  I sort of understand this one because there were a bunch of claims that he was mad and they're like, he's. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9278.52s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not the Al Pacino one. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9283.64s)]
*  Go back to the other headline, the Borla one. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9285.56s)]
*  What was the headline that discredited what we did? [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9287.4s)]
*  It says that it's Pfizer's new tech. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9289.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's right there. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9290.96s)]
*  And it's not Pfizer's tech is the problem. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9291.64s)]
*  OK, so it's but it's new tech. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9293.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9295.76s)]
*  Whether it's still the CEO of Pfizer talking about the world economic forum. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9296.039999999999s)]
*  It was also in 2018 and they're saying that this was new and a year ago. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9300.0s)]
*  Well, it's not even if it's 2018, it's still crazy. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9304.24s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9307.279999999999s)]
*  It's still crazy. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9307.8s)]
*  And I get it that it was pre pandemic. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9308.599999999999s)]
*  So it's a different thing. [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9310.28s)]
*  And in application for schizophrenics, I understand that as well. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9311.199999999999s)]
*  I know people that are schizophrenic and I know people that go off their medication and lose their fucking mind. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9315.119999999999s)]
*  And it's dangerous. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9319.36s)]
*  It's weird. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9320.96s)]
*  They would probably when Brody was off his medication. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9321.56s)]
*  There was a moment when Brody was around the store when he was off his medication and people were trying to get him back on it. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9325.24s)]
*  And, you know, he was really struggling. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9330.44s)]
*  And I've seen it. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9332.88s)]
*  So if you had a situation like that or you could ensure that Brody was taking his medication, [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9334.48s)]
*  maybe Brody would still be with us. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9339.640000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9341.28s)]
*  But maybe maybe he would be OK. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9342.24s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9343.92s)]
*  But it's also he's a human being. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9344.68s)]
*  And like maybe you should just try to get someone to be with him and make sure he takes his medication rather than forcing a new technology down the throats of everyone for a very small percentage of people that absolutely have to take medication or they go crazy because most people don't have to do that. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9346.68s)]
*  Right. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9360.84s)]
*  So to have that kind of tech available, that freaks me out. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9361.6s)]
*  I don't like it. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9365.76s)]
*  And especially if you fall into this idea that they're prepared for something like this happening because if it did, they had sort of an idea of how to implement this sort of system. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9366.640000000001s)]
*  And one of the best ways to implement this sort of system would be some sort of a pandemic. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9379.800000000001s)]
*  We have new authorizations, new rules, new abilities to tell people to shut the fuck up and stay in your house. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9383.76s)]
*  So the fact that that was 2018. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9389.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9391.56s)]
*  Doesn't mean they were probably talking about this pandemic back there. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9392.16s)]
*  Well, they're definitely talking about a potential for a pandemic. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9395.04s)]
*  They've been doing that forever. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9397.28s)]
*  I know. [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9398.400000000001s)]
*  You know, and because human beings have them, they happen all the time. [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9398.960000000001s)]
*  So one last thing, because so what's your thoughts on having Tucker on the show? [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9402.240000000002s)]
*  What are you trying to do? [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9410.52s)]
*  Make a fucking viral clip? [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9411.92s)]
*  No. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9413.960000000001s)]
*  Is that what you're doing here, Cam Haines? [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9414.460000000001s)]
*  No. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9415.52s)]
*  But because I'm always like if people are trying to cancel somebody, I want to hear from that person. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9416.04s)]
*  Yeah, I want him to sort all this stuff out because I want to find out what's going on with Fox News. [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9424.36s)]
*  But I'd be interested in talking to him. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9428.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9429.800000000001s)]
*  I think the whole thing is very fascinating because he was one of the only guys that was kind of going against the corporate narrative. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9430.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9435.32s)]
*  They're in a lawsuit because he even put that Twitter video up apparently now. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9435.84s)]
*  So you're not even allowed to put a Twitter video up? [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9439.36s)]
*  They're saying Fox, according to this article, says that breached his contract. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9441.08s)]
*  He might have had a non-compete or something. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9444.76s)]
*  And then they're saying Fox is trying to silence his First Amendment rights. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9446.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9449.880000000001s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9450.400000000001s)]
*  They'll kick you off a show. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9450.92s)]
*  Can they say you can't use social media? [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9452.92s)]
*  Depends on your contract. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9454.759999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9456.32s)]
*  Is it possible that his contract said when they kick him off the show that he can't make a video on social media? [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9456.839999999998s)]
*  It depends. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9462.56s)]
*  That's where I would go like putting up an edited 10-minute thing that looks like a show. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9463.759999999998s)]
*  And if he has a non-compete that says you can't make a show, then that's what their point is. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9467.279999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9471.64s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9472.4s)]
*  That's what a judge should decide. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9472.92s)]
*  That's an interesting little battle. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9473.839999999998s)]
*  I wonder if he was like walking down a sidewalk saying that same thing. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9475.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9479.119999999999s)]
*  There might be a way for him to do it. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9479.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9481.16s)]
*  Maybe he's doing it on a jet ski. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9481.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9482.839999999998s)]
*  I mean, because it was kind of a studio setting. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9483.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9486.0s)]
*  So maybe. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9486.679999999998s)]
*  Maybe you should just put a fucking iPhone on a jet ski and just drive around and just talk to people. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9487.439999999999s)]
*  That'd be kind of dope. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9492.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there's probably a way around the loophole. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9493.8s)]
*  I just don't like. [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9495.4s)]
*  I just don't like. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9496.8s)]
*  I think he does fish. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9497.759999999998s)]
*  I know. He fishes a lot. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9498.599999999999s)]
*  He's a big time fly fisher. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9499.679999999998s)]
*  I don't like when the government or whoever, these corrupt TV channels try to cancel somebody. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9501.039999999999s)]
*  I'm like, I want to hear from him now. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9508.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9510.720000000001s)]
*  And so he was a number one guy. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9511.52s)]
*  Now they don't want anybody to hear his voice. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9514.44s)]
*  And everybody wants to hear his voice. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9516.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9517.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9517.880000000001s)]
*  It's a bad move on their part. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9518.6s)]
*  But I think it was a business move. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9521.0s)]
*  If I had to guess, I had to guess someone that was one of their sponsors or someone that owns a piece was very upset with his positions, [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9522.480000000001s)]
*  that he was taking some very controversial positions about a lot of things, including the intelligence agencies. [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9531.880000000001s)]
*  Fucking guy out and out said CIA killed Kennedy on Fox News. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9536.640000000001s)]
*  Who? He did? [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9540.52s)]
*  Yes. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9541.12s)]
*  Tucker Carlson out and out said the CIA. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9542.04s)]
*  See, I trust that guy. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9545.48s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9547.0s)]
*  I don't know why, but I trust him. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9548.0s)]
*  I want to hear from him. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9549.76s)]
*  And that's I trust him more than I trust Don Lemon. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9551.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9553.4s)]
*  I don't know if, you know, I don't know him. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9554.4s)]
*  I don't know what he's actually like. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9558.720000000001s)]
*  But Renella loved having him on the show. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9560.960000000001s)]
*  People that were ideologically opposed to him who worked with Renella, when they did the media, they were like, fuck, I hate this guy. [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9563.96s)]
*  I really like the guy. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9571.36s)]
*  Tulsi said he's a great guy. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9572.44s)]
*  He goes, you guys are to get along. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9573.72s)]
*  I bet you would. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9575.16s)]
*  And so that's... [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9576.0s)]
*  Get that motherfucker to run up the mountain. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9576.88s)]
*  It's just frustrating. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9578.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9580.64s)]
*  I'm just so frustrated. [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9581.48s)]
*  So I know you hate the politics, but like, selfishly, I want to hear from these people. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9583.12s)]
*  And I'm like, well, and you're so good at fucking getting to the bottom of everything. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9590.0s)]
*  I'm like, selfishly, I want you to, even though I know you don't want to and I get it. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9595.679999999998s)]
*  And it's your show. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9599.88s)]
*  Obviously, you'll do what you want. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9600.839999999998s)]
*  I'd rather talk about cats and dicks with Theo Von. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9601.839999999998s)]
*  I know. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9604.119999999999s)]
*  I know. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9605.16s)]
*  I mean, that's fun to listen to also. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9605.759999999998s)]
*  I just I know what you're saying. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9608.119999999999s)]
*  I know what you're saying. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9609.439999999999s)]
*  I'm concerned about society and like, I'm concerned. [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9610.039999999999s)]
*  I am too. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9613.439999999999s)]
*  I am too. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9615.24s)]
*  And I'm concerned that there's it seems like there's the most transparent power struggle [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9616.240000000002s)]
*  that I've ever seen. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9620.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9621.76s)]
*  Because the power struggle is even in regards to like, popular Democrats. [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9622.76s)]
*  It's not even about popularity anymore. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9627.28s)]
*  It used to be like, who's the most popular Democrat? [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9628.960000000001s)]
*  And that popular Democrat, they would run against a Republican. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9631.240000000002s)]
*  That seemed to be how it always went. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9633.960000000001s)]
*  I'm sure there was a lot of fucking funny business going on. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9635.08s)]
*  But if someone was uniquely popular, they would essentially, you know, they went out [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9637.800000000001s)]
*  in the debates. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9643.0s)]
*  And you remember all those days. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9644.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9645.16s)]
*  And you'd like the fucking power would shift. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9647.119999999999s)]
*  And it looked like this guy was going to win. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9649.24s)]
*  But then she came along and then he was it was always like that. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9650.4s)]
*  And now they don't want to do that anymore. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9653.2s)]
*  They don't even want to have debates, which seems insane. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9654.92s)]
*  It seems insane that we tolerate that, that they just want to hold on to the position [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9657.52s)]
*  like, no, we're not going to have any sort of primary debates. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9661.92s)]
*  That isn't that a part of what we've always done? [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9664.64s)]
*  Shouldn't you watch ideas battle it out against the other ideas? [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9667.64s)]
*  Shouldn't you see how someone stands up to the pressure of these national discussions [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9671.4s)]
*  about very important issues that are affecting us all? [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9675.96s)]
*  I want to know how people weather that storm. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9678.519999999999s)]
*  That's the whole point to it. [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9680.56s)]
*  That's the whole point to it. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9681.8s)]
*  And it's the whole point is to give people a chance to watch these people express themselves [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9683.359999999999s)]
*  and decide for yourself. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9687.08s)]
*  Yeah, intelligently. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9688.32s)]
*  And if they're in cahoots where the media is only putting out a negative version of [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9689.519999999999s)]
*  this one person and you got people like Hillary Clinton, they're saying that Tulsi Gabbard [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9694.039999999999s)]
*  is a Russian asset and crazy talk, crazy talk. [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9698.16s)]
*  I know. [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9701.8s)]
*  If you don't let that stuff, if that's what gets out and then you don't let that person [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9702.84s)]
*  talk and you won't let that person debate. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9706.32s)]
*  And that's what happened to Tulsi after the whole thing with Kamala Harris. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9709.32s)]
*  We're done with you. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9713.519999999999s)]
*  We did that 50 for the Fallen over in Hawaii with Tulsi. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9716.119999999999s)]
*  And we walked by and where she was like, oh, I live right there in the house. [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9722.279999999999s)]
*  It's like the most normal house in the normal neighborhood. [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9726.439999999999s)]
*  I'm like, no wonder I like her. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9729.92s)]
*  She's a normal person. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9732.36s)]
*  The most normal person ever, but just like a strong leader. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9733.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9736.92s)]
*  And I'm like, this is to me, it was beautiful. [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9737.92s)]
*  It is. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9739.880000000001s)]
*  She's an amazing person and unfairly maligned because of ideological tribes that people lump [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9740.880000000001s)]
*  themselves in. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9749.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9750.52s)]
*  If you're, you know, if you're on this side, like she's demonized and hear people talk [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9751.52s)]
*  about her at parties and hear people talk about her places. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9755.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9758.640000000001s)]
*  You have to kind of go along with it. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9759.640000000001s)]
*  You have to agree with it. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9760.640000000001s)]
*  And you saying that Hillary was saying she was a Russian asset just made me think that [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9762.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh my God, how crazy is that? [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9766.359999999999s)]
*  It's insane to say. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9769.599999999999s)]
*  And it's also insane that people didn't push back against it. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9770.599999999999s)]
*  People weren't furious about it. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9773.8s)]
*  It's a crazy thing to say. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9774.8s)]
*  Person who served overseas in a medical unit twice and developed that white streak in her [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9776.64s)]
*  hair while she was there, just from the stress of treating fallen soldiers. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9783.68s)]
*  It's fucked up. [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9789.519999999999s)]
*  And it's this weird world that we live in. [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9791.119999999999s)]
*  I think things go in cycles. [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9794.359999999999s)]
*  And I think part of the cycle is the recognition of how fucked up things are now, where new [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9796.32s)]
*  people have to come along that aren't fucked up. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9800.16s)]
*  And that these people then get the will of the people behind them. [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9803.279999999999s)]
*  And if there's enough power and there's enough influence and there's enough votes, there's [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9807.359999999999s)]
*  enough people that just overwhelmingly believe things, then the powers that be have to play [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9811.48s)]
*  ball with this new person. [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9816.279999999999s)]
*  Hopefully they don't kill that guy. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9818.2s)]
*  They killed his uncle and killed his brother. [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9819.640000000001s)]
*  Or killed his father, rather. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9821.44s)]
*  Well, I'm feeling like, I'll just tell you, I feel like when I used to go see my grandma, [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9823.04s)]
*  I used to want to try to get out of there and she used to keep bringing up things so [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9829.320000000002s)]
*  I didn't leave. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9832.320000000002s)]
*  That's how I feel right now with you. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9833.320000000002s)]
*  Because I feel like we've been talking forever and I keep bringing up this shit. [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9834.800000000001s)]
*  So I'm trying not to lock you guys in here. [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9838.2s)]
*  It's okay. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9841.6s)]
*  She said one thing when we were talking, it just gives perspective to what she stands [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9843.16s)]
*  for but she said when she was serving overseas and she would leave the base, there was a [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9850.32s)]
*  sign, I don't know if she said this on your podcast, but she'd leave the base and there's [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9855.12s)]
*  a sign that said, it's today the day. [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9858.92s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it was something like that. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9860.84s)]
*  It's today the day. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9862.04s)]
*  And that's serving over there wondering, is today the day you're not coming back? [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9863.36s)]
*  Because that's a very real thing. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9867.960000000001s)]
*  But the fact that she volunteers to do that gave up, she had a political seat I think [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9870.519999999999s)]
*  at that time even in Hawaii and to go serve and then face like what our troops face over [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9877.359999999999s)]
*  there fighting for a greater purpose and seeing that as today the day, it's like that's the [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9883.32s)]
*  type of person I think should be in politics. [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9889.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that or a person who really doesn't want the job. [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9892.519999999999s)]
*  Some Elon Musk type character, someone who's just very smart, who's like enough is enough, [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9897.4s)]
*  this is what needs to be done. [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9902.08s)]
*  Some genius billionaire type character who really understands the system and can adequately [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9903.76s)]
*  relay that message to people. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9912.6s)]
*  So that's the problem with being a president. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9913.92s)]
*  You can't just be great at these ideas. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9915.84s)]
*  You also have to have a certain amount of charisma. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9919.279999999999s)]
*  There's a certain amount of appeal, which is crazy because Biden won, right? [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9921.56s)]
*  There's a certain amount of... [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9925.88s)]
*  But he won because they didn't want Trump in. [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9928.759999999998s)]
*  It's real clear there. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9931.32s)]
*  No one was real pumped about that. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9932.32s)]
*  No, he's an anti-Trump. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9933.679999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's an anti-Trump. [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9934.679999999998s)]
*  It was anyone but Trump that was what that vote was. [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9936.0s)]
*  And the crazy thing is that's like more than Trump. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9938.56s)]
*  It's like more than the country wanted anyone but. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9941.119999999999s)]
*  Like very few people were excited about that choice because maybe some people in the beginning [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9943.92s)]

*  I think that illusion, that dissolved fairly quickly. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9954.12s)]
*  So here we are in this weird place where it doesn't look good. [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9959.560000000001s)]
*  There's international conflict with Russia. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9963.36s)]
*  There's all these war hawks that are causing calling for more escalation. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9965.44s)]
*  The warmongers making money off it. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9970.12s)]
*  There's people dismissing Trump's idea that he could solve it. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9971.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9974.800000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of weirdness going on in the world. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9975.800000000001s)]
*  And then there's AI and then there's UFOs and everything is happening at the same time. [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9978.800000000001s)]
*  It's really one of the wildest times ever to be alive when it comes to just life changing [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9983.12s)]
*  events, world changing events that can happen at a blink of an eye at any given moment. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9989.48s)]
*  At any given moment, something could break out with Russia and Ukraine that would change [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=9996.6s)]
*  history forever. [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10000.2s)]
*  I mean, change human civilization forever. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10001.2s)]
*  It's that scary. [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10005.64s)]
*  It's that scary. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10006.64s)]
*  And the people that dismiss that fear are, oh my God, what do you? [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10008.08s)]
*  It's like, he won't shoot me. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10012.480000000001s)]

*  People get shot all the time. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10014.92s)]
*  I know. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10015.92s)]
*  There's histories riddled with accounts of people doing horrific things. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10016.92s)]
*  We went back to the story of the Mongols earlier. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10021.640000000001s)]
*  There's a story of this guy who is the Khorizme and Shah. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10026.44s)]
*  And it's in the Dan Carlin hardcore history series of the Wrath of the Khan, where they're [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10030.1s)]
*  going to Jin China and along the way, they have to abandon their convoy because the roads [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10039.44s)]
*  are so destroyed that they can't travel on them because they're so thick with human bodies [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10046.24s)]
*  that have decayed that the roads are all mud. [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10052.800000000001s)]
*  And they see what they thought in the distance was a snow covered peak. [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10056.26s)]
*  And as they get closer, they realize it's a pile of bones. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10059.2s)]
*  They killed everyone. [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10062.52s)]
*  They killed everyone in the city and stacked them on top of each other and left. [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10064.16s)]
*  That's human beings. [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10068.24s)]
*  And human beings have been doing horrific things like that. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10069.72s)]
*  The idea that they won't do it now, that's the same ridiculous idea as no one will invade. [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10072.16s)]
*  We won't do that. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10077.94s)]
*  He won't do that. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10078.94s)]
*  Of course they do. [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10079.94s)]
*  That's what people have done. [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10080.94s)]
*  History is filled with stories of people invading countries, of war breaking out, of horrific [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10081.94s)]
*  death and destruction. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10087.92s)]
*  The idea that you can just push, push, push aggressively against this and there's not [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10089.6s)]
*  going to be some sort of global repercussion. [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10094.88s)]
*  You know what sets America apart is we have a lot of people, like there's a Native American [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10098.160000000002s)]
*  story that this village was being attacked and the men drove stakes into the ground, [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10103.28s)]
*  tied themselves to the stakes, let the women and children take off and would stand there [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10111.240000000002s)]
*  and fight till they died because they were tied there. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10116.400000000001s)]
*  We have men that will similarly do that. [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10119.28s)]
*  We'll fight to the end to do what's right. [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10123.640000000001s)]
*  So yeah, we can get pushed or we can push other people but there's still people out [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10126.2s)]
*  there who will fight to the death for what they believe in. [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10132.92s)]
*  That's why we need vaccine passports, to keep those people in their homes and take their [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10136.44s)]
*  guns away. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10140.92s)]
*  It's a lot of it is all connected, unfortunately. [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10142.92s)]
*  And they're also capitalizing on these horrific events that do happen with mass shootings. [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10145.44s)]
*  The one thing you never hear discussed is what, if any, are the correlations between [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10150.36s)]
*  mass shooting and psych medications. [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10155.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10157.84s)]
*  Yeah, I know they don't want to talk about that. [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10158.84s)]
*  The vast majority of those people are on some stuff, vast majority, but no one is looking [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10160.52s)]
*  at that as a potential cause. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10166.119999999999s)]
*  They're looking at it as not causation but maybe correlation because they're crazy in [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10169.4s)]
*  the first place, which is why they're taking medication. [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10175.72s)]
*  Not that the medication allowed them to do something horrific. [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10178.38s)]
*  It's this weird thing where people are doing the work for the companies. [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10184.699999999999s)]
*  They don't want to believe they got duped so they'll argue in favor of these gigantic [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10189.3s)]
*  pharmaceutical drug companies that don't give a fuck about them. [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10195.179999999998s)]
*  They'll argue in favor of the military industrial complex's influence over the politicians that [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10198.179999999998s)]
*  they support. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10204.58s)]
*  Their team has to win. [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10205.939999999999s)]
*  It's a bizarre way of looking at things that people have. [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10207.86s)]
*  It's very difficult for people to look at it objectively and to really step back and [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10211.300000000001s)]
*  take a good look at it like, wow, this is not optimal by any stretch of the imagination. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10215.380000000001s)]

*  A lot of them are buffoons. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10221.380000000001s)]

*  They're not the people that you want running a society. [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10224.060000000001s)]
*  No. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10226.460000000001s)]
*  If Chris Williamson, that guy was running for president, I'd go, hey. [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10227.460000000001s)]
*  So smart. [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10230.62s)]
*  He's so fucking smart. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10231.62s)]
*  Why don't he be president? [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10232.62s)]
*  He can't. [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10233.62s)]
*  He's from the UK. [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10234.62s)]
*  Even when Biden was young, he would just talk down to people, egotistical, make up lies [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10235.86s)]
*  about his grades. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10241.66s)]
*  He would demean people. [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10242.86s)]
*  But that was then, bro. [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10244.3s)]
*  He's better now. [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10245.3s)]
*  He's changed after two brain surgeries. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10246.3s)]
*  So he was never good. [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10247.5s)]
*  No, he was never the best guy. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10249.46s)]
*  What is that Obama quote? [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10252.9s)]
*  Never underestimate Joe's ability to fuck things up. [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10255.02s)]
*  Did he really say that? [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10257.46s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10258.9s)]
*  It's a great quote if he did. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10259.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10261.18s)]

*  I'm ready to argue this to the death. [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10275.54s)]
*  Trust science. [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10278.42s)]
*  That seems to be, it's maybe accurate. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10279.42s)]
*  It's not unproven. [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10282.02s)]

*  Last thing on my notes. [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10294.18s)]
*  You got notes? [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10295.699999999999s)]

*  Oh, I'm definitely worried about them. [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10312.3s)]
*  The fear part of it? [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10313.42s)]
*  First of all, I think there's something good about eating a predator. [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10315.42s)]
*  I really believe that. [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10319.06s)]

*  I know. [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10324.14s)]
*  I like the idea behind that. [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10325.14s)]
*  That clip where you said something and who, God, who's your friend? [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10327.82s)]

*  Because you said something about if you eat elk, do you feel stronger? [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10336.779999999999s)]
*  I said you get more aggressive. [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10339.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10341.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10342.619999999999s)]
*  But to your point. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10343.619999999999s)]
*  But he only ate one meal. [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10344.619999999999s)]
*  I'm a lunatic too. [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10345.619999999999s)]

*  Because when I eat bear, I fucking feel invincible. [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10347.619999999999s)]

*  It wasn't about this? [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10353.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10354.5s)]

*  It's like I'm eating all this shit. [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10360.5s)]
*  I don't care if it's fucking bad. [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10362.5s)]
*  Does it make you more aggressive? [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10364.5s)]
*  What? [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10365.5s)]
*  Elk. [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10366.5s)]
*  No, Joe, you fucking lunatic. [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10368.5s)]
*  If somebody gets in my face, that might cause me to get more lunatic. [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10374.5s)]
*  I ate a little bit of protein. [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10378.5s)]
*  You had to beat the fuck out of people for like three decades. [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10381.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10387.22s)]
*  No, but so maybe there is something to it. [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10388.22s)]
*  The predator eating the pet. [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10390.72s)]
*  I think so. [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10392.02s)]
*  When I eat bear, I don't know. [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10393.02s)]
*  Well people do say that when you eat meat, like a lot of people that get on the carnivore [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10394.94s)]
*  diet, one of the things they say is it feels like it ramps up your aggression. [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10399.46s)]
*  Hicks and Gracie used to say that. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10403.54s)]
*  Hicks and Gracie, when he was training for a fight, he'd eat a lot of red meat. [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10405.18s)]
*  There's a video of him from the movie Choke of him going to a butcher store and picking [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10410.34s)]
*  out big pieces of sirloin to barbecue. [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10413.9s)]
*  He would say that red meat increases your aggression. [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10417.06s)]
*  He was a guy who was a yogi, very tuned into his body. [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10420.18s)]
*  I think it makes sense. [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10425.06s)]
*  If you're an animal that eats grass, well you don't really have to be aggressive because [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10426.460000000001s)]
*  you're not chasing anything. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10431.54s)]
*  You're praying. [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10432.54s)]
*  You're not going after anything. [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10433.54s)]
*  You're praying. [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10434.54s)]
*  If you think about vegans, you think of like other than being hysterical, which is probably [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10435.54s)]
*  like they're not getting the proper vitamins, not getting B12. [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10439.140000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of shit going wrong and not getting enough cholesterol, a lot of shit. [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10441.34s)]
*  But other than that, it's like you would imagine like a calm or peaceful type person because [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10445.18s)]
*  they're just eating fucking squash and shit. [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10449.66s)]
*  But I think if you eat things that are difficult to acquire, like elk and deer and bear, I [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10452.820000000002s)]
*  think in particular if you eat predators, it just makes sense that you're consuming [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10460.220000000001s)]
*  some of the essence of what that thing is. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10465.02s)]
*  There's so much protein in these wild animals, but it's also because there's so much leaner. [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10468.42s)]
*  That's the thing with certified Piedmontese. [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10475.140000000001s)]
*  You know what that is? [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10478.18s)]
*  Certified Piedmontese is a specific type of cattle that they grow their cattle. [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10479.78s)]
*  It's all free range. [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10486.62s)]
*  They're all grass fed, grass finished, and it's very lean, almost like wild game. [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10488.5s)]
*  It has more protein per ounce than the average beef. [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10495.14s)]
*  The reason being is because it doesn't have as much fat. [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10499.74s)]
*  It's just logic. [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10501.54s)]
*  It's just science. [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10502.54s)]
*  If you look at an elk and compare it to a cow, cows are so much more fat. [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10504.02s)]
*  There's less that's certified Piedmontese cow. [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10510.26s)]
*  Can you look up the protein content in meat just so we can see? [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10513.74s)]
*  It's much, much higher in like loose elk. [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10516.94s)]
*  It doesn't have bear? [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10518.86s)]
*  I'm sure it does. [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10519.86s)]
*  I'm sure it does. [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10520.86s)]
*  I bet it's very high. [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10521.86s)]
*  I haven't seen bear on there. [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10522.900000000001s)]
*  Well, it's very fatty. [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10524.140000000001s)]
*  Maybe in a fatty cut, it wouldn't be as high because you've got the mass of it. [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10525.58s)]
*  If you have 16 ounces of it and four ounces that are fat versus an elk where it's like [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10531.220000000001s)]
*  half an ounce is fat, you're going to have much more protein. [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10534.86s)]
*  But then also the elk is that rich color. [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10538.54s)]
*  It just looks like a super muscle. [[02:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10542.54s)]
*  Quality, yeah. [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10544.58s)]
*  You just know that this is super fuel is what we call it. [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10545.58s)]
*  Super fuel. [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10548.58s)]
*  What does gene grass fed beef and grain fed beef? [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10549.58s)]
*  What the fuck's bear? [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10552.9s)]
*  They must have it in there. [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10554.58s)]
*  No, they don't have it. [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10555.58s)]
*  Well, that's just one little thing. [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10556.58s)]
*  What's alligator? [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10558.86s)]
*  Alligator is pretty high. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10559.86s)]
*  Oh, there's a bear over there. [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10560.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10561.86s)]
*  Okay. [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10562.86s)]
*  What does it say there? [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10563.86s)]
*  Boy, that's blurry. [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10564.86s)]
*  32.8. [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10565.86s)]
*  32.8. [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10566.86s)]
*  That's the most. [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10567.86s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10568.86s)]
*  As opposed to what's the other ones have for protein? [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10570.58s)]
*  Can you make that? [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10574.22s)]
*  It's really bad. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10575.22s)]
*  I can't see the rest of it. [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10576.22s)]
*  You can't click on it? [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10577.22s)]
*  You can't click on it? [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10578.22s)]
*  That's from Vortex's website. [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10580.779999999999s)]
*  Oh, there it goes. [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10581.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10582.779999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10583.779999999999s)]
*  So protein 33 grams, deer is 38, turkey is 36, moose is 37, and elk is 38. [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10584.779999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10590.38s)]
*  That's more than I've seen. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10591.38s)]
*  It's the least. [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10592.38s)]
*  But I think that makes sense because of the amount of fat they have. [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10593.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10595.22s)]
*  See the fat though? [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10596.22s)]
*  But that's got to be good fat. [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10597.22s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10598.22s)]
*  Well, they say it's the best fat. [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10599.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10600.22s)]
*  Like, Rinella. [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10601.22s)]
*  And it's got the most calories. [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10602.22s)]

*  Oh yeah. [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10604.22s)]
*  A lot of calories. [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10605.22s)]
*  260. [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10606.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10607.22s)]
*  It's good fuel for sure. [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10608.22s)]
*  And it's just interesting to me that that was the preferred meat of the early cedars. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10609.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10612.779999999999s)]
*  That says a lot. [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10613.779999999999s)]
*  It certainly does. [[02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10614.779999999999s)]
*  That's survival. [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10615.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10616.779999999999s)]
*  They're trying to survive. [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10617.779999999999s)]
*  This isn't a comfort time like it's now. [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10618.779999999999s)]
*  Also bears are probably pretty fucking common back then. [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10620.66s)]
*  You know, if there's no predators of bears, like just imagine what they experienced when [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10625.019999999999s)]
*  they first got here. [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10629.9s)]
*  And Native Americans didn't even have horses yet, right? [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10631.699999999999s)]
*  So they weren't riding horses and chasing after these animals. [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10634.7s)]
*  They probably weren't that effective at diminishing their populations either, especially when it [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10637.86s)]
*  comes to things like elk and deer and running up in the mountains and shit. [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10641.740000000002s)]
*  Imagine what that was like. [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10645.66s)]
*  Like when Lewis and Clark talk, like you read the journals from Lewis and Clark when they [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10647.86s)]
*  talk about this, like they talk about just crazy animals everywhere. [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10652.140000000001s)]
*  I couldn't imagine. [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10656.02s)]
*  It must have been wild. [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10657.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10658.02s)]
*  It must have been amazing. [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10659.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10660.02s)]
*  What we think of when we think of public land today, high pressure areas, lots of hunters, [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10661.1s)]
*  elk that are scared to bugle. [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10667.02s)]
*  They're going to diminish populations, a lot of trucks on the trailhead. [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10668.82s)]
*  Imagine none of that. [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10673.58s)]
*  Imagine zero, just wolves and bears and mountain lions and deer and elk and antelope and just [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10675.5s)]
*  everywhere. [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10681.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10682.78s)]
*  You know what? [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10683.78s)]
*  No, no use of resources by human beings. [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10685.78s)]
*  So everything is just in its natural state. [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10689.300000000001s)]
*  So anytime there's a place like this area right here where there's a lot of water and [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10692.1s)]
*  that's why there's so many fucking arrowheads here. [[02:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10696.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10698.42s)]
*  Did you? [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10699.42s)]
*  An article I just read was saying that when they started selling the teddy bear to represent [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10700.42s)]
*  Teddy Roosevelt is when people stopped eating them because they're so cute. [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10704.5s)]
*  Wow. [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10709.900000000001s)]
*  Teddy Roosevelt was a fucking beast. [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10710.900000000001s)]
*  He was a big time hunter. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10713.66s)]
*  That's when they stopped eating them? [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10715.82s)]
*  Why people aren't eating it and it says hunters can't sell it. [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10717.38s)]
*  And then the biggest reason I figure like is this is because back to the teddy bears, [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10719.66s)]
*  which had been before Disney. [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10724.02s)]
*  Same reason, but just earlier, I guess. [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10726.78s)]
*  It says the whole teddy bear thing was the Bambi moment for bears. [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10728.94s)]
*  Makes sense. [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10733.26s)]
*  It makes sense, but it's dangerous for people. [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10734.26s)]
*  It's dangerous for people to do that, to put human characteristics on animals and just [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10738.38s)]
*  think that those animals are your friends. [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10742.86s)]
*  Like, Jesus Christ. [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10744.300000000001s)]
*  It's funny you mentioned the arrowhead. [[02:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10747.02s)]
*  I was running the other day, the day that those shoes came out for pre-order, but I [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10748.300000000001s)]
*  was running and I was like, look down where I run almost every day an arrowhead. [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10752.66s)]
*  Wow. [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10758.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10759.5s)]
*  Sticking up out of the ground. [[02:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10760.5s)]
*  Oh, that's amazing. [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10761.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10762.5s)]
*  Well, it was halfway in the ground. [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10763.5s)]
*  Had it rained recently? [[02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10764.5s)]
*  No. [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10765.5s)]
*  I mean, let me think. [[02:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10766.5s)]
*  I don't think it had. [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10767.5s)]
*  So it might have been sitting there for a long time. [[02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10768.5s)]
*  Or a plant. [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10770.26s)]
*  Oh, no. [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10771.26s)]
*  It looks real. [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10772.66s)]
*  Maybe someone knew you run that way. [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10773.66s)]
*  He came here, he's got my fake arrowhead. [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10774.66s)]
*  I put it up, but I mean. [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10777.300000000001s)]
*  This is a real one. [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10778.78s)]
*  This is a real one. [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10779.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10780.78s)]
*  Look at that one. [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10781.78s)]
*  That one's perfect. [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10782.78s)]
*  It looked awesome. [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10783.78s)]
*  How awesome is that one? [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10784.78s)]
*  That is beautiful. [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10785.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10786.78s)]
*  See, where we are now was where the Comanche used to hunt. [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10787.78s)]
*  That's why you see these streets out here named like Quanah Parker Lane and shit. [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10790.300000000001s)]
*  Watch this. [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10794.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10795.460000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's amazing. [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10796.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10797.460000000001s)]
*  Dude, that's a good one. [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10798.460000000001s)]
*  I know. [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10799.460000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10800.460000000001s)]
*  I was running and picked it up as I got up there. [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10801.66s)]
*  And I said, I don't know if it's a sign because of the day of my shoes. [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10804.939999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's amazing. [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10809.5s)]
*  I'm just going with the coincidence. [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10810.5s)]
*  Dude, you should frame that one. [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10811.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10813.22s)]
*  You should frame that one. [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10814.22s)]
*  There's some people that say you're supposed to leave them there. [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10815.22s)]
*  I know. [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10816.619999999999s)]
*  To those people I say, fuck you. [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10817.619999999999s)]
*  What are you talking about, leave them there? [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10818.619999999999s)]
*  I love, I don't know. [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10820.66s)]
*  The tradition, the Native American tradition is like an archery specifically. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10823.419999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10827.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10828.98s)]
*  It just stirs me. [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10830.5s)]
*  I got to be honest though. [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10831.5s)]
*  I wouldn't be comfortable with the size of the cut that little arrowhead's making. [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10832.5s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10837.02s)]
*  And like that. [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10838.02s)]
*  That made me nervous. [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10839.02s)]
*  You got to make a good shot with that thing. [[03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10840.02s)]
*  But I bet you get a lot of penetration with that. [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10842.38s)]
*  This is a good one right here. [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10844.58s)]
*  That's a good one. [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10845.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's to wallop something big. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10846.98s)]
*  I just thought it was cool. [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10848.539999999999s)]
*  I mean, I run that. [[03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10849.539999999999s)]
*  Look how little that arrowhead is. [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10851.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10852.22s)]
*  Maybe that was for squirrels or something. [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10853.22s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10854.22s)]
*  It looks good though. [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10855.22s)]
*  It does. [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10856.22s)]
*  Doesn't it? [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10857.22s)]
*  It's an amazing craftsmanship. [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10858.22s)]
*  It looks like a bird point. [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10859.46s)]
*  Ah, bird point. [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10860.46s)]
*  Okay. [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10861.46s)]
*  Probably was a bird point. [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10862.46s)]
*  That makes sense. [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10863.46s)]
*  Makes sense because there's a lot of quail. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10864.46s)]
*  I mean, I run this trail. [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10865.46s)]
*  It's just amazing. [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10867.26s)]
*  That's awesome. [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10868.26s)]
*  Because I ran and I was like, you know how you think you see something? [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10869.26s)]
*  So I ran up and I turned around and I was like, did I just see? [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10873.179999999998s)]
*  I thought I saw a point sticking out. [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10875.779999999999s)]
*  And I went back. [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10877.98s)]
*  Sure as shit. [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10878.98s)]
*  I found one when I was bow hunting with Rinella. [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10879.98s)]
*  I was bow hunting with Rinella in Nevada in the high desert country. [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10882.26s)]
*  You guys were mule deer hunting, weren't you? [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10885.96s)]
*  Mule deer hunting. [[03:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10886.96s)]
*  Wasn't it fucking tough? [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10887.96s)]
*  It was awesome though. [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10889.699999999999s)]
*  It was really cool. [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10890.699999999999s)]
*  Really cool. [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10891.699999999999s)]
*  Really hard, tough hunt on public land up there. [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10892.699999999999s)]
*  It's really interesting because you really got to play it carefully. [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10897.359999999999s)]
*  You got to really play the wind. [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10901.0s)]
*  You got to really play when they're bedding. [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10902.0s)]
*  You got to creep up on them. [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10904.16s)]
*  I've killed a buck there in the rubies. [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10905.279999999999s)]
*  I crawled. [[03:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10908.119999999999s)]
*  We made our way about a half a mile to this isolated patch of trees. [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10909.88s)]
*  I crawled in for like an hour until I got within bow range. [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10915.9s)]
*  As I'm creeping forward, my bow fell over. [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10920.3s)]
*  Fell over. [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10924.619999999999s)]
*  Fell over like I was moving forward or leaning up against this bow. [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10925.619999999999s)]
*  And it spooked the buck? [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10927.86s)]
*  Because I'm creeping like this. [[03:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10928.86s)]
*  I'm creeping like this. [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10929.86s)]
*  I'm moving and I put it in. [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10930.86s)]
*  Clink. [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10931.86s)]
*  Boink. [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10932.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's not good. [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10933.86s)]
*  It was horrible. [[03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10934.86s)]
*  It was horrible. [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10935.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10936.86s)]
*  I've put crawling like that, I've put it on my back. [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10937.86s)]
*  Sitting on my back and then I'm just crawling. [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10942.82s)]
*  So I've got two knees and two hands. [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10945.1s)]
*  And it's just kind of sitting, resting on my back so I can stay low. [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10948.42s)]
*  Sometimes because otherwise you've got to keep leapfrogging it. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10953.58s)]
*  The problem was I was in a corridor. [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10955.66s)]
*  There was like a little trail with these bushes to the side of it. [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10957.460000000001s)]
*  So it was really good for cover. [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10961.18s)]
*  So I could creep in. [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10962.18s)]
*  I see. [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10963.18s)]
*  So I was just putting the bow ahead of me and creeping out. [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10964.18s)]
*  Putting the bow ahead of me and clunk. [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10966.18s)]
*  They don't like noise like that. [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10968.66s)]
*  I was barefoot. [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10971.42s)]
*  Oh, I had socks on too. [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10972.42s)]
*  I gave a shout out to Randy Ulmer. [[03:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10973.74s)]
*  Randy Ulmer is a legend. [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10976.62s)]
*  That's where I learned about taking socks off from him. [[03:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10978.62s)]
*  Taking your shoes off. [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10981.26s)]
*  There's certain people out there who have so much of my respect. [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10984.42s)]
*  I know I talk shit about Steve's brother. [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10988.34s)]
*  I got a lot of respect for Steve or Noah. [[03:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10990.14s)]
*  But Randy Ulmer. [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10992.22s)]
*  I got a lot of respect for his brother too. [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10993.22s)]
*  I just think it's, you know, I get. [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10994.86s)]
*  I don't like the hateful stuff. [[03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10996.7s)]
*  It feels like he's out of the conversation. [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10997.7s)]
*  It's unfortunate that he does that. [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10998.7s)]
*  But I think it just feels like he's out of the conversation. [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=10999.7s)]
*  That'd probably be frustrating too. [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11003.94s)]
*  Yeah, they have their own opinion on things and they don't think that people are doing [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11004.94s)]
*  it the right way and they have a very ethical stance on things. [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11008.86s)]
*  I get it. [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11011.98s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's fine. [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11012.98s)]
*  But I was just going to say, Randy Ulmer was a godfather of archery when I was coming up. [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11014.98s)]
*  He was so good. [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11021.1s)]
*  Killed so many good animals. [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11023.1s)]
*  Such a great shot. [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11024.78s)]
*  And they're just these legendary figures and he's one of them. [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11026.82s)]
*  He's such an interesting guy to hear talk about it too. [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11029.58s)]
*  So smart. [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11031.82s)]
*  Wasn't he a dentist? [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11033.46s)]
*  A veterinarian. [[03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11034.46s)]
*  Veterinarian, that's right. [[03:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11035.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11036.46s)]
*  So just a very smart guy to begin with and then becomes obsessed with archery. [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11037.46s)]
*  He was the first guy that I heard of that had like a bunch of different releases. [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11042.46s)]
*  So he never knew how it was going to go off so he could never think about it. [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11045.98s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11049.26s)]
*  Interesting. [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11050.26s)]
*  I mean, so intellectual in regard to archery. [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11051.26s)]
*  Very measured. [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11055.42s)]
*  Nothing was luck with him. [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11057.86s)]
*  It was just like very calculated. [[03:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11058.86s)]
*  But if you ever have time, look up, there's two other guys who died who I think you would [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11061.86s)]
*  just be fascinated by. [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11067.02s)]
*  Paul Schaeffer was one, incredible bow hunter out of Montana. [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11069.22s)]
*  And then they called him the last wild man, Bart Schuyler. [[03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11073.14s)]
*  Both of them died in the mountains. [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11077.94s)]
*  Roy told me of Bart Schuyler. [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11079.86s)]
*  Bart Schuyler got eaten by a grizzly when he was moose hunting. [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11082.1s)]
*  But he would make his own bow, flint out his own arrowheads and kill animals, sheep. [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11085.86s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11095.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11096.300000000001s)]
*  Roy worked with them at Foster's Taxidermy in Alaska. [[03:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11097.300000000001s)]
*  And he's just like, he goes, dude, there's this guy Bart. [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11100.06s)]
*  He goes, he's incredible. [[03:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11102.9s)]
*  And if Roy's saying somebody's incredible. [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11104.48s)]
*  So there's these larger than life figures. [[03:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11107.34s)]
*  You know, that Paul Schaeffer, he's got a book called or somebody wrote a book about [[03:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11112.42s)]
*  him called Silver Tip. [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11116.7s)]
*  And these guys used to shoot 90 or 100 pound recurves. [[03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11118.66s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11121.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11122.9s)]
*  Silver Tip, Paul Schaeffer. [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11123.9s)]
*  That's crazy. [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11125.94s)]
*  100 pound recurve. [[03:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11126.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11127.94s)]
*  Yep. [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11128.94s)]
*  So that's the last wild. [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11129.94s)]
*  That's Bart Schuyler right there. [[03:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11130.94s)]
*  So this guy was just a legend. [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11132.14s)]
*  Bart Schuyler. [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11136.06s)]
*  Yep. [[03:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11137.06s)]
*  Right there. [[03:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11138.06s)]
*  Is there any books about these guys? [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11139.06s)]
*  What is that? [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11141.3s)]
*  The last wild man? [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11142.3s)]
*  Is that a story? [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11143.3s)]
*  It's an article at least. [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11144.3s)]
*  In Outdoor Life. [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11145.3s)]
*  Yeah, if not more than that, I found it here. [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11146.3s)]
*  So he worked at the, like I said, worked with Roy or he worked at Foster's Taxidermy and [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11149.3s)]
*  Roy would go and talk to him. [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11154.74s)]
*  Wow. [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11156.619999999999s)]
*  And it's just crazy. [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11157.619999999999s)]
*  It's always interesting to me that there's people that take a thing like bow hunting and [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11159.3s)]
*  just go way out there with it. [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11164.619999999999s)]
*  Just way out there. [[03:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11166.82s)]
*  Pass where everybody else is going. [[03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11168.58s)]

*  I think. [[03:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11187.42s)]
*  I mean it's like- [[03:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11188.42s)]

*  I think he said something like that. [[03:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11208.74s)]
*  So both of them. [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11210.14s)]

*  And even if it's just for yourself, even if you're just one person, just prove to yourself [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11225.619999999999s)]
*  that you're doing something that no one else is doing. [[03:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11230.02s)]

*  And there's a great value in those people. [[03:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11248.1s)]
*  That's why when someone talks shit about you I'm like it's so stupid. [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11250.54s)]
*  It's so dumb. [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11253.78s)]
*  Because you're discounting all the positive. [[03:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11256.1s)]
*  For you to have only a negative take on someone like you is foolish. [[03:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11258.94s)]

*  And it's really that quote. [[03:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11272.94s)]
*  It's the tragic result of unmet needs. [[03:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11275.380000000001s)]

*  A lot of those people just they don't like other people being better than them. [[03:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11279.380000000001s)]

*  It's a natural thing that animals have. [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11289.880000000001s)]
*  It's just human instincts. [[03:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11293.2s)]
*  We're flawed. [[03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11295.68s)]
*  I mean we're all flawed. [[03:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11296.68s)]
*  But as a person that instinct doesn't serve you. [[03:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11298.84s)]
*  This is what's very important. [[03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11301.44s)]
*  It's a natural thing. [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11302.44s)]
*  I've had it. [[03:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11303.44s)]
*  I'm sure you've had it. [[03:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11304.44s)]
*  A lot of people get jealous. [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11305.44s)]
*  I struggled with it a lot when I was a young man. [[03:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11306.44s)]
*  But I realized that it's a weakness. [[03:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11308.6s)]
*  And I realized it's dangerous because it keeps you from progressing. [[03:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11310.2s)]
*  Because it puts your energy in a very stupid place that doesn't serve you any purpose [[03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11313.38s)]
*  at all. [[03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11317.099999999999s)]
*  It doesn't help you at all to be upset that someone else is successful. [[03:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11318.099999999999s)]
*  But that same success can inspire you instead. [[03:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11321.64s)]
*  If you can get past your initial reactions and your idea, this inclination to be jealous. [[03:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11324.759999999998s)]
*  If you can manage that in your head. [[03:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11330.38s)]
*  If you can conquer that in some way. [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11332.82s)]
*  Even if it's like a struggle every day. [[03:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11335.06s)]
*  But if you can get past that and just admire what that person's doing. [[03:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11337.339999999998s)]
*  It will fuel you. [[03:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11341.92s)]
*  And it will inspire you. [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11343.68s)]
*  It will actually provide you with positive energy. [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11345.72s)]
*  As opposed to just this bitterness that so many people have. [[03:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11348.84s)]
*  Where they just want to sit around and bitch and complain. [[03:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11352.12s)]
*  Nothing drives me crazier than a fat guy with a beer in his hand. [[03:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11355.0s)]
*  Who's talking shit. [[03:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11360.16s)]
*  Especially one that I know hasn't done anything. [[03:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11362.56s)]
*  It's just like, I know what you're doing, man. [[03:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11364.84s)]
*  I know what you're doing. [[03:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11366.76s)]
*  And you know what you're doing too. [[03:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11367.76s)]
*  And you don't have anybody around you that calls you on it. [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11369.0s)]
*  And you don't call yourself on it. [[03:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11370.68s)]
*  So you and your fucking dopey friends, you get together and you do this all the time. [[03:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11372.12s)]
*  And none of you are going anywhere with that attitude. [[03:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11375.960000000001s)]
*  They attract like-minded people. [[03:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11377.74s)]
*  Just like if your goal is to improve or greatness, you attract those type of people also. [[03:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11379.92s)]
*  Yes. [[03:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11388.64s)]
*  I think so. [[03:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11389.64s)]
*  So the people that you can't stand will surround yourself with people just like that. [[03:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11390.64s)]
*  And it's just a big ball of negativity. [[03:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11394.56s)]
*  Whereas it doesn't have to be like that. [[03:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11397.52s)]
*  Because as you said, you might have been like that. [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11399.24s)]
*  I know I was like that. [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11401.16s)]
*  But we're different. [[03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11403.12s)]
*  You get over it. [[03:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11404.44s)]
*  But you don't have to like think you're weak because you have it. [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11405.44s)]
*  It's a normal human emotion. [[03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11408.92s)]
*  It's a normal human reaction. [[03:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11410.4s)]
*  But you just have to realize it doesn't serve you at all. [[03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11412.2s)]
*  And in fact, it does the opposite. [[03:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11415.2s)]
*  It hurts you. [[03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11416.9s)]
*  Like you get angry when you see that person. [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11417.9s)]
*  You get angry when you see that person succeeding. [[03:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11420.16s)]
*  You get angry when you see that person on social media. [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11421.92s)]
*  Like it's foolish. [[03:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11424.36s)]
*  It's so negative. [[03:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11426.0s)]
*  There's nothing positive in it at all. [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11427.4s)]
*  It doesn't help you. [[03:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11429.52s)]
*  And if you change, like when I see you winning and see this thing, somehow I feel better. [[03:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11430.56s)]
*  I see you, this comedy mothership, blowing up everybody just like this excitement. [[03:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11436.6s)]
*  And somehow, for some reason, I feel like I feel good. [[03:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11442.72s)]
*  Well that's awesome. [[03:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11447.08s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[03:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11448.08s)]

*  And I knew it was going to work like this. [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11451.68s)]
*  I tried to fucking talk you into doing this forever. [[03:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11453.8s)]
*  I tried to talk you into quitting that fucking job. [[03:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11456.08s)]
*  Did anybody pastor you more than me? [[03:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11459.28s)]
*  No, no. [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11461.08s)]
*  I'll say you were the one. [[03:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11462.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, and I've said it before and I'll say it again. [[03:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11464.08s)]
*  If I believed in myself as much as you believe in me, I would have done a long time ago. [[03:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11467.44s)]
*  I don't believe in myself. [[03:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11470.96s)]
*  You do though. [[03:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11472.32s)]
*  You do. [[03:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11473.32s)]
*  You just need to get moving and then you believe in yourself. [[03:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11474.32s)]
*  It's like it's hard to do new things when you've been doing this one, you have this [[03:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11478.08s)]
*  one job for decades and then all of a sudden you're just going to get rid of it and you [[03:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n398J-SBF-g&t=11481.2s)]
